The predatory zzso zzso zzso uses zzso zzso to locate regions rich in zzso prey bacteria, zzso and attaching to prey and then zzso zzso zzso zzso are then invaded to form a zzso in a type IV zzso process, and prey contents are zzso allowing zzso growth and zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso resumes inside the prey zzso prior to its zzso and escape of zzso zzso zzso can also grow slowly outside prey as long flagellate zzso zzso cells, cultured on zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes three pairs of zzso zzso motor zzso each of which could potentially form an inner membrane zzso channel, interact with the zzso zzso zzso ring, and produce zzso zzso In 2004, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2004) used zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso expression to zzso a single zzso zzso gene and reported slowed release from the zzso and altered zzso of the zzso Here we zzso each pair of zzso genes and found that each pair contributes to zzso both zzso inside the zzso and during zzso zzso however, each pair was zzso and deletion of no pair abolished zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso cyanide zzso zzso and different pH and sodium conditions indicated that all Mot pairs are zzso driven, although the sequence similarities of each Mot pair suggests that some may originate from zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso zzso retaining and expressing three pairs of zzso zzso
