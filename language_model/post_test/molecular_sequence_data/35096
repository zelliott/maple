zzso E virus zzso has emerged as an important cause of epidemic and sporadic acute viral zzso worldwide, which is a major public health zzso A better understanding of the interaction between the virus and the host cell would be very helpful for its zzso zzso zzso zzso open reading frame 3 zzso is a regulatory protein that alters the activity of selected zzso factors and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso regulators of zzso genes and represent an interesting lead to study zzso infection and to identify new therapeutic zzso To explore how zzso zzso affects zzso in host cells, we used zzso array analysis to compare the expression patterns of zzso in stable cell lines that expressed or did not express zzso zzso We found a significant zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso expressing human embryonic kidney zzso cell zzso Among the 116 candidate targets genes of zzso and zzso that we detected in zzso we demonstrated that the expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso also named zzso was directly regulated by these zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso expression in zzso zzso This provides new avenues for future exploration of the precise roles of zzso in zzso zzso
