zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso control zzso function in zzso and many zzso zzso through the interaction with their zzso zzso and zzso Although the same is true for some zzso species, in zzso zzso and zzso there is no definitive evidence for the presence of either two distinct zzso or two distinct zzso zzso Our aim was to characterize the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso library from snake zzso and amplification of the zzso ending, we cloned a zzso related to zzso Attempts to clone a zzso more closely related to zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso was restricted to zzso zzso The snake zzso is a G zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain with zzso zzso acids consists of a nine zzso zzso zzso zzso flanked by two zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso are zzso with exception of the third, a region that may be important for zzso zzso In contrast with zzso avian and zzso zzso the snake zzso presents zzso acid deletions in the zzso region of the zzso domain which are also seen in fish and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso expressed in zzso cells showed that the snake zzso is more sensitive to human zzso zzso than to human zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso group separately from zzso zzso Our data are consistent with the apparently unique zzso system in zzso zzso zzso zzso about the snake zzso structure may help identify structural zzso for zzso zzso
