zzso replicate by reverse zzso their zzso zzso zzso into zzso DNA using specific cellular zzso to prime zzso zzso In zzso human zzso serves as the primer and is packaged into zzso during zzso The viral zzso protein is believed to zzso zzso placement onto the zzso zzso primer binding zzso however, the timing and possible regulation of this event are currently zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the highly coordinated process of zzso zzso but the contribution of these zzso to zzso zzso is zzso Here, we show that NC is absolutely essential for zzso and that the MA domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso MA specifically interacts with zzso zzso zzso lipids in the plasma membrane zzso Surprisingly, we find that zzso stimulate zzso zzso zzso but do not stimulate zzso in zzso zzso lacking the MA domain or containing point zzso involved in PM zzso Moreover, we find that zzso prevent MA from binding to zzso acids but have little effect on NC or zzso We propose that zzso binds to zzso either with both NC and MA zzso or with NC alone and that zzso interactions alter zzso binding zzso We propose that zzso interactions with the PM trigger the switch between these two binding modes and stimulate zzso zzso function, which may be important for the regulation of events such as zzso primer zzso
