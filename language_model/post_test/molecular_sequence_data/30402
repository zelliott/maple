The organization of the zzso gene is similar to that of other genes coding for zzso proteins in that the zzso code for distinct zzso of the zzso An unusual feature of zzso expression is that the primary transcript of the gene coding for zzso zzso extensive, zzso regulated alternative zzso resulting in numerous protein zzso Although the significance of this zzso is unknown, the multiple sequence variations may affect the function of zzso Without an understanding of the importance of the zzso of zzso and the process of zzso characterization of defects resulting in zzso zzso production will be zzso In this update, we review recent findings on zzso and speculate as to the structural and regulatory role of various regions of this zzso zzso
