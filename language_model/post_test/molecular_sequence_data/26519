zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso first identified as a zzso factor, is involved in the regulation of liver zzso zzso and natural killer zzso zzso in zzso The function of zzso in the duck remains zzso zzso A suppression zzso zzso library was constructed from the zzso of zzso zzso treated with duck zzso virus type I zzso A total of 66 expressed sequence tags zzso were identified in the zzso Among the novel gene fragments identified was the zzso zzso zzso duck zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso was obtained using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of the zzso ends zzso The zzso consisted of a 50 zzso zzso untranslated region zzso an 84 zzso 3' zzso and a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a single protein of 339 zzso zzso In agreement with a previously reported zzso zzso the predicted zzso acid sequence contains characteristic zzso and zzso zzso zzso is highly similar to zzso genes from other zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso gene has been highly zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso is widely expressed in healthy zzso They also showed that zzso zzso is significantly zzso in the liver and zzso following injection with zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso 4 or zzso zzso in the liver and zzso respectively, and afterwards gradually returning to zzso Our findings suggest that zzso contributes to the innate immune response against viral zzso
