Eight severe inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expansion of zzso repeats in the affected zzso In every case, proteins with repeats of fewer than 38 zzso zzso are zzso but those with repeats of more than 41 zzso zzso form toxic zzso nuclear zzso in the affected zzso Similarly, proteins that have repeats of fewer than 37 zzso zzso are soluble in zzso whereas proteins with repeats of more than 40 zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso apparently because of a structural transition associated with the increased zzso
