Different zzso zzso factors can act through the same upstream binding site to zzso regulate target gene zzso but little is known of the underlying zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso zzso domain proteins zzso and zzso of zzso zzso exert active and opposite effects on in zzso zzso when bound to a common site upstream of a core zzso Both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso affect the extent but not the rate constant of zzso complex zzso zzso Both regulators act early in zzso assembly and are zzso zzso zzso complexes become resistant to regulation by the bound zzso but zzso by zzso is restored upon zzso or zzso addition, and regulation by both proteins is restored after the addition of all four zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results establish that upstream zzso and zzso can function by fundamentally similar mechanisms, by zzso regulating an early step in zzso zzso leading to formation of functionally distinct zzso zzso A subsequent step renders mature complexes zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso for the mechanism of zzso complex assembly and turnover and its regulation are discussed, including a new role for zzso in zzso
