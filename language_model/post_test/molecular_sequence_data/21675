The spatial distribution of proteins in tissue sections can be used to identify potential markers for pathological zzso zzso sections are often subjected to zzso zzso before zzso laser zzso zzso zzso This study is targeted at improving the zzso identification of zzso peptides by accurate mass zzso and complementary zzso liquid zzso coupled to zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso Two adjacent mouse brain sections were analyzed in zzso The first section was spotted with zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of this section resulted in the identification of 14 peptides zzso from 4 zzso The second tissue section was zzso zzso by zzso and zzso with zzso prior to zzso zzso The number of identified peptides was increased to 153 zzso to 106 zzso by matching zzso mass zzso to peptides which were identified in these zzso zzso All results (including zzso imaging zzso were based on accurate mass zzso zzso zzso and allow a confident identification of zzso zzso zzso based on lower accuracy would have led to ambiguous or misleading zzso zzso images of identified peptides were generated with a bin zzso zzso range used for image zzso of zzso The application of accurate mass zzso and additional zzso zzso increased both the quality and the number of zzso zzso The advantages of this approach for the analysis of biological tissue sections are demonstrated and discussed in zzso zzso indicate that accurate mass zzso are needed for confident identification and specific image generation of zzso peptides in tissue zzso
