The zzso zzso family is responsible for a newly classified chemical reaction, zzso protein zzso New zzso zzso the reaction zzso and the products of the zzso transfer to zzso are described for zzso The final products of zzso reactions are the zzso zzso and the 2' and 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso formed through an zzso zzso zzso intermediate and zzso zzso reactions zzso zzso zzso The zzso their zzso forms, the zzso rates, and the reaction zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso exchange, and zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso transfer to zzso includes zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso oxygen to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attack of the zzso group on the zzso to form a zzso species, zzso zzso to zzso by the attack of water on the zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso This mechanism is unprecedented in zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso products are candidate molecules for zzso signaling zzso
