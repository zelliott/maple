The zzso box, located upstream at about zzso zzso and the zzso sequence element, located at about zzso zzso are both essential and sufficient for zzso level zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as demonstrated by its zzso into zzso zzso Point zzso within either of these regions abolish transcription, while deletion of the internal zzso element or zzso of 13 zzso within the internal zzso element does not impair zzso The latter zzso zzso the internal zzso affect processing of the zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso coding sequence with an zzso coli zzso zzso gene resulted in expression of the zzso coli gene governed by the upstream zzso promoter zzso These studies demonstrate unequivocally that the upstream promoter elements are sufficient for the zzso level of zzso gene zzso zzso extension studies with zzso zzso show that the internal elements do not play a role in selecting the zzso start point zzso but that selection of the zzso is determined by the region upstream from the zzso Further, studies with zzso zzso show that the distance between the zzso box and the zzso is quite likely the critical factor in selecting the position of zzso
