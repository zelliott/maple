zzso is known to become zzso when zzso with light in the presence of zzso blue, the loss of zzso being due to zzso of the zzso at position 16 of the B beta zzso In the present investigation it could be demonstrated that not only this zzso but also the one at position 24 of the A alpha chain was modified and that the rates of modification could be modulated by zzso release, zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso modifications can be used as zzso for surface accessibility of and zzso differences among the various forms of the zzso Both zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso A release alone leads to zzso protection of the one in the A alpha chain, but only partial protection of the one in the B beta zzso zzso zzso B release leads to zzso protection of the one in the B beta zzso The differential effects indicate that two zzso changes have zzso zzso zzso reverses the protective zzso zzso leads to zzso and equal modification in all samples as a consequence of the loss of native zzso
