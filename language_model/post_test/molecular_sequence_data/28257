The expression of two zzso zzso is induced by zzso stimulation in zzso T zzso Using nuclear zzso analysis the increase in steady state zzso level has been shown to zzso to zzso zzso However, the two genes appear to be zzso rather than zzso zzso Both genes were shown to be more sensitive to zzso I zzso than a zzso gene in zzso T zzso In addition, for the zzso cell zzso 1 gene the zzso region of the gene was more sensitive than the 3' zzso Two zzso hypersensitive sites were seen in the zzso zzso sequences of both zzso The DNA sequences of the upstream regions of both genes were determined and zzso Although the two zzso sequences are overall quite zzso there are short regions which are shared between the two zzso zzso A number of these have been implicated in regulating the expression of other T cell zzso
