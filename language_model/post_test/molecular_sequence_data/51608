The zzso gene of zzso encodes a large zzso protein involved in zzso interactions and cell fate decisions in the zzso zzso To determine if a gene zzso to zzso zzso plays a role in early mouse development, we screened a mouse zzso zzso library with zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A partial zzso clone zzso the mouse zzso zzso which we have termed zzso was used to analyze expression of the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in a wide variety of adult zzso which included derivatives of all three germ zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells into zzso cell types resulted in increased expression of zzso zzso In the zzso mouse zzso zzso transcripts were first detected in zzso at zzso days post zzso zzso By zzso zzso transcript levels were highest in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, while much lower levels were detected in zzso In contrast, at zzso zzso zzso was a major site of zzso zzso zzso were also abundant in cell types derived from neural zzso These data suggest that the zzso gene plays multiple roles in patterning and differentiation of the early zzso mouse zzso
