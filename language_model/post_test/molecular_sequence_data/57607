A genetic approach was undertaken to identify normal bacterial genes whose products function to limit the effective concentration of zzso In this approach, a zzso zzso library containing cloned zzso coli zzso sequences was screened for zzso that showed increased resistance to a number of unrelated zzso Three such plasmids were identified, and all contained sequences originating from the zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the minimal zzso unit revealed that the resistance zzso was associated with the presence of the zzso gene on the zzso The putative zzso gene product is predicted to contain a zzso DNA binding domain that is very similar to analogous zzso found in three other zzso coli zzso One such similarity was to the zzso gene product, the elevated expression of which has previously been associated with the multiple zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso resistance even in cells carrying a deletion of the zzso zzso zzso We have also found that zzso bearing zzso plasmids show a significant reduction in zzso translation but not transcription, similar to previously described zzso zzso However, this reduction in zzso expression plays only a minor role in the resistance zzso suggesting that functions zzso by genes zzso to zzso must be affected by zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso is the ultimate event that occurs at the zzso locus during the process that results in multiple zzso zzso
