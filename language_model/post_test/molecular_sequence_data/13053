zzso zzso do not contain zzso the principal zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso has a lower oxygen affinity than human zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 202, zzso It has been proposed that the zzso regulation in bovine zzso is introduced by particular zzso acid zzso located in the zzso region of the A zzso and in the E zzso of the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso In accordance with this proposal we have constructed two zzso human zzso zzso and zzso These are the zzso present at the proposed locations in bovine zzso except for zzso at position zzso zzso binding studies demonstrate that these zzso have introduced into human zzso the low oxygen affinity and zzso sensitivity of bovine zzso and reveal the presence of a previously zzso zzso mechanism of oxygen affinity regulation where all the interactions responsible for the lowered affinity and zzso binding appear to be confined to individual beta zzso
