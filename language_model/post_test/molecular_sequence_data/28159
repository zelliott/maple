The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a protein that is highly zzso to the alpha zzso of zzso zzso G proteins and is essential for zzso cell zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by zzso could complement the growth zzso of a zzso zzso zzso However, cells with zzso expressing the zzso protein were zzso to zzso in a short-term incubation but resumed growth after long-term incubation even after exposure to high zzso of zzso The former zzso associated with zzso is zzso and the latter zzso is dominant to zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso was dependent on zzso and zzso which demonstrates that this zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso and the beta zzso of the G zzso The double zzso of zzso zzso recovered from division arrest, which suggested that zzso is not required for recovery of the zzso zzso
