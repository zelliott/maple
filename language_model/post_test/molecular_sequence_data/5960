A number of cellular proteins and viral spike proteins are zzso at a basic recognition zzso To characterize the membrane traffic step at which this zzso occurs we have studied the zzso processing site of zzso Forest virus zzso spike precursor zzso in zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso at a zzso zzso recognition zzso Previously, it has been shown that the zzso zzso remains zzso when accumulated to the zzso network zzso degrees C block zzso We show here that exit from the zzso is required for the zzso of zzso zzso processing was inhibited in synchronized zzso when the 20 degrees C transport block was released in the presence of zzso A, energy zzso zzso and zzso zzso cyanide zzso zzso or an zzso of zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso spike zzso or zzso against a zzso corresponding to the zzso active motif of zzso inhibited zzso of zzso at a zzso zzso The results indicate a zzso communication step between zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that this communication may involve an early compartment of the zzso zzso
