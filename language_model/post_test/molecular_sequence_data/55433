The Greenland ice sheet zzso receives organic carbon zzso of anthropogenic origin, including zzso from the atmosphere and/or local sources, and the fate of these compounds in the ice is currently zzso The ability of zzso zzso microbes to zzso different types of OC is likely a significant factor determining the fate of anthropogenic OC on the ice zzso Here we determine the potential of the microbial community from the surface of the zzso to zzso the widely used zzso zzso acid zzso Surface ice zzso were collected and incubated for up to 529 days in zzso simulating in zzso zzso zzso of side zzso and zzso zzso was measured in the samples, and quantitative zzso targeting the zzso genes in total DNA extracted from the ice after the experiment was zzso We show that the zzso microbial community on the zzso contains microbes that are capable of degrading zzso and that they are likely present in very low zzso They can zzso zzso at a rate of up to 1 zzso per zzso per day, equivalent to zzso zzso C zzso zzso Thus, the zzso should not be considered a mere zzso of all atmospheric zzso as it is likely that some deposited compounds will be removed from the system via zzso processes before their potential release due to the accelerated melting of the ice zzso
