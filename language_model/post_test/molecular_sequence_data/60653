zzso an essential zzso zzso processing zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso processing zzso is implicated in maturation of zzso involved in development, zzso zzso and zzso We examined the zzso of zzso specificity using a series of zzso zzso zzso In contrast to previous reports, we found that zzso can cleave such zzso with zzso comparable to those observed with extended peptides and zzso zzso With the best of these zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso values greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited striking zzso zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso an observation of significance to the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso recognition at zzso zzso and zzso demonstrates that whereas interactions at zzso make comparable contributions to zzso by the two zzso zzso exhibited a approximately zzso lesser dependence on zzso recognition but a zzso greater dependence on zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to exhibit zzso recognition and we found that this interaction contributes approximately zzso zzso toward zzso independent of the nature of the zzso zzso We have also shown that favorable zzso at zzso and zzso will compensate for less than optimal zzso at either zzso or zzso The quantitative analysis of zzso and zzso specificity sharply distinguish the nature of zzso recognition by the processing and zzso members of zzso zzso
