To test the hypothesis that rabbit zzso zzso type K zzso could play a role in shaping the evolution of zzso the zzso of viruses containing the zzso zzso zzso to zzso restriction was zzso zzso zzso viruses were susceptible to the zzso from Old World monkeys but were unaffected by most zzso or New World monkey zzso zzso from various zzso species were also isolated and tested for zzso zzso The zzso from both zzso rabbit and zzso restrict a range of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the European and zzso zzso which have previously been found to contain zzso also restricted zzso zzso zzso whereas a weaker restriction was observed with zzso zzso containing the zzso domain from the zzso which lacks zzso Taken together, these results could suggest that the zzso had not been exposed to zzso zzso and that zzso zzso might exert a selective pressure on zzso zzso
