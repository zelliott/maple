A male infant, born from zzso parents, suffered from birth with a progressive zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso zzso muscle weakness and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso High levels of zzso acid in blood and zzso fluid suggested a zzso respiratory chain zzso Muscle biopsy revealed zzso and zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Multiple defects of respiratory complexes were detected in muscle zzso but cultured zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Southern zzso analysis showed markedly reduced levels of zzso DNA zzso in muscle, while zzso zzso and muscle precursor cells were zzso Neither depletion of zzso nor abnormalities of the respiratory complexes were observed in zzso muscle zzso cultured for as long as 4 zzso No zzso were observed in two candidate nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso amplified and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and of the origin of replication of the zzso light strand failed to identify potentially zzso zzso of these zzso elements in the zzso muscle zzso Our findings indicate that zzso depletion is due to a nuclear zzso gene and suggest that the zzso underlying defective zzso propagation must occur after muscle differentiation in zzso
