We have previously shown that the zzso gene zzso formed on the zzso zzso zzso as a result of the zzso zzso is zzso active in zzso of chronic zzso leukemia zzso We have now used the same technique, reverse zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso to study nine patients with Philadelphia zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso seven expressed the zzso and two the zzso type of zzso fusion zzso All seven patients with zzso had zzso transcripts containing a junction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso in two cases, zzso transcripts with the zzso junction type were also zzso Of the two zzso ALL patients, one had a zzso zzso transcript and the other showed no zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso gene is probably fundamental in the zzso of the zzso zzso differential expression of the zzso gene could contribute to the zzso zzso of the zzso
