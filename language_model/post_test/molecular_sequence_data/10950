zzso zzso zzso zzso has been structurally characterized by zzso analysis of the zzso protein chain and by molecular zzso and functional correlation with the zzso properties of zzso alcohol zzso The structure is found to be a divergent zzso zzso zzso at a zzso position intermediate between the cluster of zzso alcohol zzso of all classes (including the human zzso and several zzso zzso zzso zzso and functionally important zzso suggest a fold of the zzso zzso zzso related overall to that of zzso alcohol zzso with the presence of the zzso and structural zinc zzso but otherwise much altered zzso relationships compatible with the different zzso zzso and an altered loop structure compatible with differences in the zzso zzso zzso typical of zzso binding in zzso alcohol zzso are not present, consistent with that the zzso factor is not closely similar to zzso The molecular architecture is different from that of the zzso alcohol zzso (of zzso zzso and the zzso alcohol zzso (of zzso and zzso zzso further supporting the unique structure of zzso zzso zzso Borders of internal zzso differences between this and other zzso zzso coincide in different combinations, supporting the concept of limited changes in loop regions within this whole family of zzso
