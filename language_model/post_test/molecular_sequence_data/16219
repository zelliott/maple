We have prepared a series of zzso that contain changes in the functional group pattern present within the zzso recognition site - zzso zzso were zzso on solid phase using normal and modified zzso and analyzed in steady state zzso experiments with the zzso restriction zzso The following groups appear to interact strongly with the zzso since their modification or substitution renders the zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso of both A zzso the zzso of the first A zzso the zzso zzso of the C zzso and the zzso of both T zzso The zzso zzso of the G zzso supports effective recognition, since its absence lowers the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso of the second A zzso and the zzso position of the C zzso apparently are not recognized by zzso their substitution by zzso or modification with zzso or zzso zzso does not considerably change the rate of zzso All zzso investigated compete with the unmodified zzso for binding to the zzso We conclude that zzso recognizes its zzso presumably through hydrogen bonds to the zzso zzso and the zzso of the first A zzso the zzso zzso of the second A and the C zzso as well as through zzso interactions with both T zzso
