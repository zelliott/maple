zzso The three-dimensional structure of a portion of the zzso domain of the mouse liver zzso zzso zzso zzso described by zzso and Green zzso has been zzso from zzso acid sequence zzso zzso By inspection of the three-dimensional structure of the portion of the zzso zzso domain, a putative binding site for zzso zzso consisting of one zzso one zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), has been zzso zzso The interaction of 12 zzso zzso with the putative zzso binding site has been investigated and zzso of binding calculated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction data have been used to establish quantitative zzso relationships zzso between zzso zzso binding and either zzso zzso in zzso cells or induction of zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso The results are discussed in terms of the role of zzso in the mechanism of initiation of zzso proliferation in zzso zzso
