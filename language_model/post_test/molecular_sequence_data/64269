The zzso zzso has long been recognized as a natural group, but its zzso zzso is controversial and has not yet been studied in the light of sequence zzso 

zzso relationships among 32 species (35 zzso of the zzso zzso were investigated by comparative sequencing of the ITS region of the zzso nuclear zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso from all currently accepted sections and zzso of the zzso were included, along with zzso from four other early branching zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso generated by maximum zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso methods show similar zzso demonstrating zzso of zzso and the division of the zzso into two major zzso This division is also supported by analysis of the zzso coding sequence zzso The first branching zzso is formed by all the species of the zzso with zzso zzso leaves and zzso zzso with a unique type of leaf zzso The other major zzso includes the remaining species zzso all of which have more or less zzso zzso 

These zzso results do not agree with any previous zzso of the zzso zzso data also suggest that the endemic zzso species zzso zzso is a zzso as the sequence divergence between the populations in zzso and zzso Islands, and closer mainland relatives in zzso Africa is zzso All endemic zzso African zzso are included in a single unresolved but zzso zzso and the low zzso variation of ITS suggests a recent radiation within this zzso The only southern zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to be a zzso apparently closely related to zzso zzso a zzso zzso
