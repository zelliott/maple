Human respiratory zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso were zzso and zzso chains were released by treatment with alkaline zzso A neutral zzso zzso fraction was isolated from zzso obtained from a patient with A blood group zzso by zzso on zzso and individual zzso chains were then isolated by gel zzso on zzso zzso columns and high performance liquid zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The structures of the zzso zzso were determined by zzso analysis, sequential zzso zzso and zzso zzso The amount of each chain was determined by compositional zzso A wide array of discrete zzso zzso structures that contain from 3 to 22 sugar zzso were zzso Many of the zzso are related and appear to be precursors of larger zzso The zzso zzso zzso which accumulate contain terminal blood group H zzso alpha zzso beta 4) or blood group A zzso alpha zzso alpha 3) zzso beta 4) zzso which stop further branching and chain zzso The zzso of zzso chains in respiratory zzso occurs on the beta zzso zzso at branch points, whereas the beta zzso zzso zzso ultimately forms short side chains with a zzso alpha zzso alpha 3) zzso beta 4 zzso beta 6 structure in individuals with A blood group zzso The results obtained in the current studies further suggest that even higher molecular weight zzso chains with analogous zzso structures are present in some human respiratory zzso zzso zzso numbers of the repeating sequence shown in the zzso below is present in the higher molecular weight zzso zzso see zzso This data in conjunction with our earlier observations on the extensive branching of these zzso chains helps to define and explain the enormous range of zzso structures found in human and zzso respiratory zzso zzso zzso of the relative zzso of each zzso chain suggest that these zzso represent variations of a common zzso core structure which may be terminated by the addition of alpha zzso zzso to the beta 3/4 linked zzso zzso at each branch zzso These chains accumulate and are found in the highest zzso in these respiratory zzso
