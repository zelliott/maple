In the zzso the isolation of zzso zzso avian influenza zzso viruses has been uncommon in commercial chickens and zzso although sporadic zzso have been made from the live bird markets or its supply chain since zzso In 2002, two different outbreaks of zzso zzso occurred in commercial chicken or turkey zzso The first occurred in Texas and was identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The second outbreak was caused by a zzso virus isolated from a turkey farm in zzso In this study we analyzed recent zzso zzso zzso viruses from different avian species and different sources in the zzso Most recent zzso zzso zzso shared a high sequence identity and zzso assorted into a separate zzso from the zzso lineage zzso However, no established lineage was found within this zzso and the recent zzso zzso zzso seemed to be the result of separate introductions from the wild bird zzso The Texas zzso isolate shared the lowest zzso with the other recent zzso in the zzso gene and had a unique zzso zzso site sequence of zzso zzso recent zzso have the typical zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this isolate had a 28 zzso acid deletion in the stalk region of the zzso zzso a common characteristic of chicken adapted influenza zzso and may indicate that this virus had actually been circulating in poultry for an extended period of time before it was zzso In agreement with genetic evidence, the Texas zzso isolate zzso better than other zzso zzso in zzso infected zzso The outbreak in Texas with a more zzso zzso virus underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance and control efforts regarding the zzso zzso zzso virus in the zzso
