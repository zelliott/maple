zzso zzso zzso zzso a 28 zzso acid zzso widely distributed in the zzso nervous system, has potent zzso actions that influence cell division, zzso survival, and zzso To address the potential effects of zzso on embryonic growth, whole zzso zzso cultures were zzso After a zzso zzso zzso zzso growth as assessed by the following increases from zzso embryonic volume zzso DNA zzso and protein content zzso as well as the number of cells in zzso zzso No apparent zzso abnormalities are produced by zzso To assess the in zzso function of zzso in early zzso growth, a zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso between E9 and zzso VA induced a dose reduction of the DNA zzso of zzso and protein zzso of zzso contents of the E11 head and a decrease of zzso brain weight zzso of zzso In contrast, body growth was less affected by the zzso injections of VA for a longer period zzso to zzso did not increase the severity of the zzso By ex zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites were detected in the zzso zzso between E9 and zzso but not between zzso and zzso during zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso activity in the zzso zzso Although this effect is limited to a short zzso period, blockade of zzso by a specific zzso zzso a severe zzso
