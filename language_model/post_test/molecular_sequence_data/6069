zzso class zzso zzso genes specify cell fates in successive zzso body zzso in zzso insects and zzso The zzso zzso sequences are very similar between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and this similarity allows zzso zzso proteins to function in zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso are substantially zzso Further, zzso zzso differs from both insects and zzso in having a zzso body as well as a distinctive mode of development that involves zzso early zzso and zzso cell zzso Here we report that, despite these differences, zzso zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso can substitute for zzso zzso zzso proteins in the control of three different zzso zzso the regulation of cell migration, the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of a sensory zzso We also show that the specificity of one zzso zzso zzso protein is partly determined by two zzso acids that have been implicated in zzso DNA zzso Together these findings suggest that factors important for target recognition by specific zzso proteins have been zzso throughout much of the animal zzso
