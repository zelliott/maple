The zzso coli zzso system mediates zzso export of protein precursors bearing twin zzso signal zzso Genes known to be involved in this process include zzso zzso and zzso that form an zzso with a fourth zzso zzso The zzso gene product has two zzso in zzso coli coded by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso coli strain with zzso zzso deletions in all three of zzso zzso and zzso exhibits no significant zzso in the cellular location of five zzso zzso that are zzso with twin zzso signal zzso Neither these zzso nor overproduction of the zzso protein cause any discernible effect on the export zzso of an additional zzso coli zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that proteins of the zzso family have no zzso involvement in protein export by the zzso zzso zzso is shown to be a zzso zzso zzso binds to immobilized zzso or zzso affinity columns and exhibits zzso zzso zzso Features of the zzso zzso that may control zzso expression are zzso
