zzso zzso is a major cause of bovine zzso Since gene expression of many bacteria is known to be regulated by the environment, milk may play an important role in the regulation of the early steps in the zzso of bovine zzso by zzso zzso To get insight into the response of zzso zzso to the milk environment, a zzso zzso library was generated and screened for genes specifically expressed during growth in zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso Four groups of genes were found, involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation and zzso zzso A fifth group contained genes with hypothetical or unknown zzso Many of the genes identified belonged to zzso pathways of zzso zzso and other bacterial species which have also been shown to play a role in zzso as determined in zzso infection zzso zzso growth on milk may be an attractive model for the identification of genes zzso expressed during bovine zzso
