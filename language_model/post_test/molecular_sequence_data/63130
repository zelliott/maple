zzso plays an important role in male zzso Most of the actions are zzso by zzso zzso zzso To investigate the profile of zzso affecting male zzso we zzso cloned four zzso from the male zzso zzso a local economically important zzso fish in zzso zzso tree analysis ranked the four zzso as two distinct groups of zzso and zzso which could be further divided into duplicated zzso 1 and 2, zzso High score identities were shared between each of the duplicated zzso All of the four zzso distributed in central nervous system of male fish with a quite broad zzso However, distribution diversity became evident between zzso and zzso zzso in the peripheral zzso Both of the two zzso of zzso were detected in all seven zzso zzso while expression of zzso was mainly limited to liver, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was confined to liver, heart, zzso zzso and zzso During the zzso zzso zzso serum concentration of zzso hormone zzso testosterone zzso and zzso zzso were zzso T and zzso levels in the circulation were high until the later fully zzso phase, while serum zzso level was low all the zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis determined the most abundance of zzso in zzso where the two zzso zzso positively expressed with zzso development, while zzso zzso expressed with a reverse zzso zzso and zzso were the primary forms in zzso zzso gradually increased during the zzso process while zzso zzso decreased during the zzso stage and then positively expressed in fully zzso zzso Little or no signal was detected in zzso The present work provided evidence of four zzso in male zzso system and suggested an important role of zzso during zzso zzso zzso contained zzso forms of zzso which may play a role in the feedback effects of zzso on zzso zzso
