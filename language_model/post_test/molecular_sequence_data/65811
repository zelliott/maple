A complex of zzso proteins zzso of the human malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso host protective immunity and therefore is a candidate for vaccine zzso zzso the level of zzso and the evolutionary processes is important for zzso in both vaccine design and knowledge of the evolution of cell invasion in this zzso In the present study, we zzso the entire open reading frames of seven genes zzso the proteins of the zzso complex zzso zzso and five zzso gene zzso We found that four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and 8) were highly zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso are predominantly clustered around zzso acid positions zzso of these four zzso zzso An excess of zzso zzso over synonymous zzso was detected for zzso and 9, indicating positive zzso The zzso test with a zzso zzso zzso sequence also supports positive selection on zzso Based on the ratio of zzso genetic distance to zzso distance, the time to the most recent common zzso of the zzso and 8 zzso was estimated to be zzso and zzso million years ago, respectively, assuming divergence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 6 million years zzso In addition to a copy number zzso gene conversion events were detected for the zzso genes on zzso 3, which likely play a role in increasing the diversity of each zzso Our results indicate that a high diversity of the zzso zzso family is maintained by diversifying selection forces over a considerably long zzso
