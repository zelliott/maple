zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inherited zzso zzso disorder resulting in severe combined zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular defects responsible for zzso zzso in one such zzso The patient's zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and zzso Point zzso leading to zzso acid zzso were found in both zzso One point zzso led to a zzso substitution at zzso acid 51 and was common to both zzso In addition, an zzso substitution at zzso acid 128 and an zzso substitution at zzso acid 234 were found in the maternal and paternal zzso zzso In order to prove that these zzso were responsible for the disease state, each of the three zzso was constructed separately by zzso zzso of the normal zzso zzso and each was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso from cells zzso with the zzso carrying the substitution at zzso acid 51 retained both function and zzso zzso from cells zzso with zzso zzso carrying a substitution at either zzso acid 128 or zzso acid 234 contained zzso material but had no zzso human zzso zzso In zzso molecular analysis of this patient identified point zzso within the zzso gene which are responsible for the zzso zzso
