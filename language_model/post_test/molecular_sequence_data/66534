The zzso gene from zzso zzso functions as a mercury zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in the zzso membrane of plant zzso When zzso zzso and tobacco plants were transformed with the zzso gene under the control of the zzso mosaic virus zzso promoter, the resulting zzso of zzso rendered the host plants hypersensitive to zzso and they accumulated approximately twice as much zzso zzso as the wild type zzso Thus, bacterial zzso zzso zzso such as zzso may be useful molecular tools for producing transgenic plants that zzso zzso zzso
