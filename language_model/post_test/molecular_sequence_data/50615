We previously constructed a zzso zzso zzso encompassing an infectious zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here the complete viral sequence of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso long, consists of an internal unique sequence flanked by long zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso The first 96 bases of one zzso can fold into a typical zzso hairpin zzso The opposite zzso is incomplete, lacking 88 zzso These terminal structures, similar to those of zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly suggest a common mechanism of DNA replication for these zzso zzso zzso organization is unique among zzso in that coding sequences are evenly distributed in the zzso half of both zzso On one zzso the major open reading frame zzso encodes the four structural zzso On the complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso probably zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has little DNA zzso with zzso zzso and surprisingly even less with the two zzso presently zzso zzso contains the highly zzso zzso and zzso regions and zzso the zzso domain common to most structural and to all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The single zzso between zzso and zzso is unexpectedly located in zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso assumed to zzso structural zzso Only a weak zzso exists between zzso and Aedes zzso in their zzso zzso
