zzso zzso zzso zzso a zinc finger zzso is zzso from zzso to zzso In the zzso it activates zzso genes and other target genes in response to several cell stress conditions, notably heavy metal zzso The knockout of zzso in the mouse has an embryonic lethal zzso accompanied by liver zzso Here we describe the targeted disruption of the zzso gene in zzso by zzso zzso Unlike the situation in the zzso knockout of zzso in zzso is not zzso zzso survive well under laboratory conditions but are sensitive to elevated zzso of copper, cadmium and zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of two new zzso genes described here, zzso and zzso is abolished in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae are sensitive not only to copper load but also to copper zzso In zzso zzso copper depletion prevents metamorphosis and dramatically extends zzso zzso from normally 4-5 days to as many as 32 days, possibly reflecting the effects of impaired oxygen zzso These findings expand the roles of zzso in the control of heavy metal zzso
