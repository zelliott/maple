zzso can insert and zzso zzso resistance genes on plasmids in bacteria by zzso zzso Class 1 zzso code for an zzso zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso and are generally borne on elements derived from zzso such as that found in the central part of zzso A second class of zzso is found on zzso zzso and its zzso We have completed the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains an internal stop zzso This zzso was found to be zzso among zzso genes on three other zzso zzso harboring different zzso The predicted zzso sequence zzso is 325 zzso acids long and is zzso identical to zzso In order to detect zzso activity, the internal stop zzso at position 179 in the parental zzso was changed to a zzso coding for zzso zzso The sequences zzso the cassette zzso in the class 1 and 2 zzso are not closely zzso but a common pool of mobile zzso is used by the different zzso zzso two of the three zzso resistance zzso on zzso and its close relatives are also found in various class 1 zzso We also observed a fourth zzso cassette downstream of those described previously in zzso The fourth cassette encodes a zzso protein of unknown function with zzso zzso repeats of a sequence coding for 7 zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso of each of the zzso in zzso at different zzso The zzso from zzso and zzso showed limited zzso in that zzso could zzso all zzso from both zzso and zzso However, we did not observe a corresponding zzso of the zzso cassette from zzso by zzso
