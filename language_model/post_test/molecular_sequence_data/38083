In order to isolate a zzso clone of zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso library was constructed in zzso XL zzso with zzso zzso zzso from leaves of zzso zzso To get the probe for screening the library, zzso of zzso DNA was conducted using the zzso primer and zzso primer designed from a zzso putative active site of the zzso Twenty-six zzso clones from about 600,000 plaques were isolated, and one of these clones was fully zzso It was zzso zzso and contained an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence had a putative signal sequence of 17 zzso acids and a putative active site zzso zzso in other zzso zzso coli cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso did not grow well as compared to control cells, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso presumably zzso zzso coli zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso coli had translation zzso activity in zzso
