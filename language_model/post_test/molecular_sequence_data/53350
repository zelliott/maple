During zzso zzso recognition and zzso of the zzso signal sequences zzso requires the coordinated action of the zzso genes 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso In this report, we use deletion mapping and zzso zzso to determine the minimal zzso critical for interaction between zzso and zzso We define the active core of zzso required for zzso zzso as zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso 57 zzso of this core provide a dominant surface for zzso zzso This region zzso to the last of six predicted zzso repeat motifs that have been proposed by sequence analysis to fold zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within this sixth repeat is shown to be critical for zzso contact with zzso and zzso for stabilizing binding and directing zzso of the zzso We also show that zinc finger B zzso zzso of zzso provides a dominant interaction domain for recruiting zzso In all, the data support a model of zzso as a zzso protein that zzso one of its six faces for establishing productive contacts with zzso
