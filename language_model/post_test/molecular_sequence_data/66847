In living cells the mechanical properties of the zzso zzso are defined by the local zzso of different zzso zzso zzso These proteins consist of zzso zzso that are separated and zzso organized by different numbers of rod zzso The detailed molecular structure of the zzso molecules determines the structural and mechanical properties of zzso networks in zzso In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of the length of the spacing unit between two zzso zzso on in zzso zzso zzso Such synthetic zzso reveal that the shorter the zzso are, the greater the elastic zzso changes in the linear response zzso Because the same binding zzso are used in all zzso only the differences in the number of rod zzso determine their mechanical zzso zzso zzso of the networks show that bundling propensity is highest for the shortest zzso The zzso mechanical response is affected by the molecular structure of the zzso zzso and the observed critical strains and fracture stress increase zzso to the length of the spacing zzso
