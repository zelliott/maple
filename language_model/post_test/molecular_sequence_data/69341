The zzso zzso zzso was recently established as a discrete constituent of zzso zzso We have characterized the primary structure of the mouse transcript, the structure and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso pattern of gene zzso The transcript consists of zzso base pairs as determined by zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and primer extension zzso Using a zzso zzso as a probe, we isolated a single zzso clone that contained the entire mouse zzso Analysis of this clone indicated that zzso is fragmented into 9 zzso with the zzso Met zzso located in zzso zzso As determined by analysis of zzso cell hybrid lines and by zzso in zzso zzso the mouse gene was mapped to zzso 4 at a location corresponding to region zzso zzso sequence immediately upstream of the zzso start site was found to be zzso but lacked zzso or zzso boxes as well as other zzso motifs known to regulate zzso zzso of this type are usually found in genes that exhibit broad zzso and spatial patterns of zzso zzso with this idea, the zzso transcript appeared to be the widespread product of zzso tissue cells throughout mouse zzso This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of zzso gene expression during zzso zzso
