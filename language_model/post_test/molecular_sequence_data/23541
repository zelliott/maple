Bright, for B cell regulator of zzso heavy chain transcription, binds zzso sequences in the zzso zzso regions of the zzso heavy chain locus and zzso sequences of some variable heavy chain zzso Most resting B cells do not express Bright; however, it is induced after stimulation with zzso or zzso zzso Bright zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso however, it is not clear whether Bright function is critical for normal B cell zzso To begin to address Bright function during B cell development, seven zzso forms of Bright were zzso Five of the seven zzso revealed little or no DNA binding zzso Furthermore, because Bright binds DNA as a zzso two of the zzso formed complexes with wild type Bright and acted in a dominant negative zzso zzso negative Bright prevented the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with wild type zzso These data identify regions within Bright that are required for the DNA binding activity of Bright and for its function as a zzso zzso
