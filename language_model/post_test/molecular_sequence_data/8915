The zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for root zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso was found to form protein complex with zzso in zzso and in zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso in zzso The zzso gene was expressed in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a typical plant zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and exhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein could zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could not use one another as a zzso for zzso Instead, zzso acted as an inhibitor of zzso zzso when zzso was used as a zzso suggesting that zzso may serve as a negative regulator of the zzso signaling zzso zzso expression of zzso via zzso interference zzso resulted in drastic reduction of zzso formed in transgenic zzso zzso A significant portion of zzso zzso zzso roots failed to form a zzso In these roots, the expression levels of zzso and three marker genes for infection thread and zzso zzso formation were zzso drastically, while the expression of two other zzso genes were not zzso These observations demonstrate an essential role of zzso in the early zzso signaling and zzso zzso
