Type A influenza viruses are important pathogens of humans, birds, zzso horses and some marine zzso The viruses have evolved into multiple complicated zzso lineages and zzso Recently, the zzso diversity of type A influenza viruses from a whole view has been described based on the viral external zzso and zzso gene zzso but remains unclear in terms of their six internal genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In this report, zzso representative sequences of the six viral internal genes were selected from zzso using the web servers in zzso zzso zzso zzso Then, the zzso relationships among the representative sequences were calculated using the software tools zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were classified mainly according to zzso of the zzso trees and distribution of the viruses in zzso regions and zzso 

The panorama zzso trees of the six internal genes of type A influenza viruses were zzso zzso and zzso within the type based on the six internal genes were classified and designated by a tentative universal zzso nomenclature zzso The diversity of influenza viruses circulating in different regions, zzso and hosts based on the panorama trees was zzso 

This study presents the first whole views to the zzso diversity and distribution of type A influenza viruses based on their six internal zzso It also proposes a tentative universal nomenclature system for the viral lineages and zzso These can be a candidate framework to zzso the history and explore the future of the zzso and will facilitate future scientific communications on the zzso diversity and evolution of the zzso In addition, it provides a novel zzso view zzso the whole zzso to recognize the viruses including the origin of the pandemic zzso influenza zzso
