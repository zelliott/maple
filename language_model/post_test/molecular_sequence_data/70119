Using zzso C zzso and negative and positive selection with zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso respectively, a zzso cell line zzso zzso was zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso as well as zzso based cloning and sequencing of the zzso transcript from this zzso revealed a single zzso zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso by zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso are almost identical as each has lost at least five zzso specific zzso zzso and gained several new zzso Interestingly, the zzso cell line, zzso is efficiently recognized by zzso zzso raised in zzso combinations, zzso zzso anti zzso and zzso anti zzso indicating that zzso contains both zzso and zzso specific zzso The zzso has not affected the ability of zzso to present zzso restricted zzso peptides of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso the importance of zzso acid zzso 167 in zzso these results indicate a positive correlation between the gain of both an zzso zzso and a defined zzso zzso zzso
