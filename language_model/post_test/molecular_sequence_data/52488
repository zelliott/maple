We have identified a zzso of zzso B zzso in a zzso with zzso Four affected members had plasma zzso of total cholesterol of 115 zzso 14, low density zzso zzso of 48 zzso 11, and zzso of 28 zzso 9 zzso mean zzso zzso The values zzso to approximately zzso the values for unaffected zzso zzso and high density zzso zzso zzso were 92 zzso 50 and 49 zzso 4, respectively, neither significantly different from unaffected zzso Western blots of plasma zzso of affected subjects showed two major zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso DNA sequencing of the appropriate zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA segment revealed a deletion of the zzso at zzso position zzso resulting in a premature stop zzso at zzso acid zzso zzso In zzso zzso two LDL populations containing either zzso or zzso could be distinguished from each other by gel zzso zzso and by zzso of zzso gels using zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso LDL were smaller and more dense than zzso zzso To determine whether the low concentration of zzso was due to its enhanced zzso zzso zzso LDL were isolated from the zzso d zzso zzso fraction (which contained most of the zzso in his zzso by zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso The resulting pure zzso LDL fraction zzso with the cells zzso more effectively than zzso LDL zzso zzso zzso To determine the zzso mechanism responsible for the zzso in zzso kinetic studies were performed in two affected subjects, using zzso labeling of zzso and zzso with zzso followed by zzso kinetic zzso zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso and LDL were zzso and zzso those of zzso very low density zzso zzso and LDL, zzso zzso rates of zzso were approximately zzso of those for zzso This differs from the behavior of zzso a previously described zzso whose zzso were also increased approximately zzso relative to zzso but whose production rates were nearly identical to those of zzso Thus, in contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso two zzso defects to zzso zzso that account for the zzso diminished production and increased zzso
