An zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and characterized from roots of Chinese red zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH is zzso zzso zzso using zzso as zzso zzso can zzso the red zzso present in the zzso zzso as zzso and the specific activity is zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso is 45 zzso zzso and 46 zzso zzso as determined by zzso and gel zzso zzso The zzso point zzso determined by native zzso is zzso and by zzso zzso P) is zzso Analysis of zzso peptides by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso zzso covered zzso of the zzso sequence and confirmed its zzso The gene zzso zzso was cloned by zzso and the zzso acid sequence showed the highest identity zzso to zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and to zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso gels show that zzso is primarily expressed in the roots in agreement with the expression profile of the zzso zzso These five zzso zzso have three zzso of variable length and sequence at zzso locations between the zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso are widespread in the zzso plant family with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso Based on the results, we propose that zzso and zzso are targeted to the zzso to modify stored zzso like zzso
