We have cloned the full coding zzso sequence of chicken zzso V and of a zzso lacking 8 zzso acid zzso of the zzso tail for zzso zzso Both proteins were zzso in zzso coli upon induction with zzso zzso and were zzso following two different zzso one based on the ability of these proteins to interact zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso and the other based on two sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso V revealed that binding of calcium did not change the circular zzso zzso indicating no significant changes on the secondary zzso however, a zzso change affecting the zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was detected by analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V binds with high affinity to collagen types II and X, and with lower affinity to collagen type I in a zzso zzso Heat zzso of collagen decreases this interaction while zzso of collagen almost completely zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso V interacts with collagen in a similar way as the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso tail of zzso V is not essential for collagen zzso
