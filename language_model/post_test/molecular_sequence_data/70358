The zzso zzso a replication zzso of zzso zzso also functions as an zzso for its own structure zzso zzso through binding to the operator which consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to define the DNA binding motif of zzso we have analyzed its binding affinity for each half repeat of the zzso sequences and found that the right half of zzso was the preferred sequence for zzso although its affinity was much lower than those of the zzso zzso Next, zzso sequences of each half repeat with different zzso head to head (the same zzso as natural zzso head to tail, and tail to tail, were constructed and their affinities for zzso were zzso Almost all of sequences with the head-to-head zzso had binding affinity for zzso but these, including even the zzso sequence of the right half of zzso exhibited lower zzso abilities than natural zzso zzso We zzso a zzso zzso zzso to be the zzso motif from a sequence zzso Some zzso substitution experiments confirmed the motif and suggested that each zzso of the zzso zzso recognizes each half repeat of zzso zzso
