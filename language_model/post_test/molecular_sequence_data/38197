This review provides a comparative analysis of the expression patterns, functions, and zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These comprise zzso families that are closely related with respect to sequence features as well as expression patterns during zzso zzso Thus, members of the zzso and zzso families are expressed in zzso but zzso patterns and display complementary or zzso functions, depending upon the zzso A common theme shared among zzso and zzso genes is that they are required during early, middle, and late zzso of development where their differential expression mediates zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in which they are zzso With respect to their zzso properties, zzso proteins function as zzso zzso while zzso proteins are zzso zzso Moreover, their ability to oppose each other's zzso actions implies a mechanism underlying their complementary or zzso functions during zzso
