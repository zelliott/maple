The binding site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso like those of zzso zzso G zzso receptors zzso that bind small zzso is contained within a zzso zzso formed among its seven zzso segments zzso The high-resolution structure of bovine zzso however, revealed that the second zzso loop zzso which connects zzso and zzso folds down into the zzso domain and forms part of the zzso surface for zzso Whether zzso plays a related role in other zzso zzso is zzso To address this issue, we have now zzso to zzso one at a time, 10 consecutive zzso in zzso of zzso The reaction of five of these zzso with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and bound zzso protected two, zzso and zzso from zzso The pattern of accessibility in zzso is consistent with a structure similar to that of bovine zzso in which the region zzso to the zzso zzso bond is deeper in the zzso zzso than is the zzso part of zzso Thus, zzso likely contributes to the binding site in the zzso and probably in other zzso zzso as zzso zzso of its detailed positioning and interactions with zzso would benefit zzso molecular modeling and facilitate the design of novel zzso
