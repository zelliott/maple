To characterize the structural basis for the interaction between zzso and the insulin zzso and the zzso growth zzso zzso different zzso receptors containing a segment of deletion in either the zzso domain or in the C zzso of the zzso or containing zzso point zzso in these regions of the insulin zzso were zzso zzso zzso and in zzso binding studies of the interaction between the zzso receptors and zzso revealed that zzso zzso in these regions are not essential for the binding of zzso To further identify the binding site for zzso all zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the insulin zzso were replaced with either zzso or zzso by zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso in this region, except at positions zzso did not inhibit the binding of the zzso to zzso The binding of the zzso zzso 2 domain of zzso to the receptors was significantly enhanced in the presence of an intact zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that, unlike other zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the insulin zzso and the zzso zzso domain plays an important role in zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso are critical for the zzso and zzso activity of the zzso the binding of zzso at these sites may suggest a role for the protein in the zzso or regulation of insulin zzso zzso
