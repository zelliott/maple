zzso the founding member of a previously zzso large family of cellular proteins zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that has recently been shown to regulate cell proliferation through zzso of zzso cell cycle target zzso zzso shares its zzso zzso zinc finger domain with zzso P element zzso zzso zzso and several zzso proteins interacting genetically with the zzso protein zzso In this study, we report the three-dimensional structure and zzso relationships of the zzso zinc finger of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso domain of zzso is an zzso zinc finger of approximately 80 zzso distinguished by the presence between the zzso zinc zzso zzso of a short zzso zzso zzso by a long zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso of this zzso motif resulted in the identification of a number of critical zzso for DNA zzso zzso chemical shift zzso analysis was used to further characterize the zzso involved in DNA zzso The combination of the zzso and zzso data allowed the mapping of the DNA binding interface of the zzso zinc finger to a highly positively charged area harboring multiple zzso and zzso zzso Together, these data represent the first zzso analysis of a functional zzso domain, with demonstrated zzso DNA binding zzso They also provide a structural framework for understanding DNA recognition by this zzso zinc finger, which defines a novel family of cellular factors linked to cell proliferation and zzso cell cycle pathways in humans, fish, and zzso
