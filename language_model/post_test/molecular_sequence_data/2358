The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso zzso during zzso zzso I in the absence of any significant DNA zzso Unlike zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso is not affected by zzso of DNA zzso A zzso rat zzso gene was cloned by using a DNA zzso derived from zzso zzso as a zzso zzso of the cloned zzso was investigated by gene transfer zzso From these studies, we found that the zzso upstream region of the cloned zzso gene contained zzso zzso elements which regulated expression of a reporter gene in an zzso zzso The zzso element was found to be located in two regions containing zzso elements between zzso and zzso base pairs zzso and an zzso element zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The two regions were required for a zzso stimulation of zzso of the cloned zzso gene in S zzso On the other hand, only the zzso element was reported be important for the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso Since the synthesis of the zzso zzso is independent of DNA synthesis and specific for zzso zzso in zzso the presence of the zzso zzso regulatory elements in the zzso gene is zzso
