The zzso zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso has normal amounts of zzso zzso with very low amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a structural zzso however, zzso treatment leads to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 11, zzso We have demonstrated by chemical zzso a single base mismatch in DNA zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing showed that the zzso zzso results from an zzso substitution at zzso acid zzso of the zzso When zzso cell lines were selected for resistance to zzso the resulting amplified zzso gene was structurally indistinguishable from the wild type zzso These results suggested the existence of a single active zzso locus in zzso zzso Using the zzso restriction zzso zzso and zzso we found evidence for two zzso zzso zzso in wild type, zzso and zzso zzso One of the zzso appeared completely zzso by zzso but could be zzso by zzso in spontaneous or zzso zzso
