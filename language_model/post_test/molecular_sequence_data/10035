The zzso zzso cell zzso channel is a zzso zzso and zzso member of the zzso super zzso We have previously shown that rat lung zzso zzso is zzso at birth, and molecular diversity is generated by alternative zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 12, zzso Murray et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso To investigate other possible zzso zzso variations, we zzso the entire zzso gene and found that zzso (formerly zzso results from the deletion of zzso zzso The preceding zzso 19 has an unusually high CT content and a rare zzso zzso zzso Because both features were also found in zzso 13, we next tested the hypothesis that zzso 13 would be involved in alternative zzso As predicted, a second zzso product, zzso was found by zzso but only in zzso When we compared the zzso maps of zzso and human zzso zzso striking similarities were found in each zzso except for zzso zzso 20, which is absent in zzso These observations suggest that zzso and zzso may have evolved by gene duplication, zzso and DNA zzso
