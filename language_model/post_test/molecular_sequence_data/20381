Despite the critical importance of molecular specificity in zzso systems, in zzso display technologies have been applied extensively for affinity maturation of peptides and zzso without explicitly measuring the specificity of the desired zzso We devised a general strategy to measure, screen, and evolve specificity of protein zzso interactions analogous to widely used affinity maturation zzso The specificity of binding to target and zzso zzso labeled with zzso distinct zzso was measured simultaneously in protein zzso via zzso flow zzso thereby enabling screening for high target zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso exhibited varying zzso revealing critical zzso acid zzso for target recognition and zzso avoidance in complex zzso zzso specificity in the mixture was further enhanced by quantitative directed evolution, yielding a family of zzso exhibiting improved zzso zzso or superior to, the native zzso zzso to which the zzso was zzso zzso screening simultaneously favored zzso yielding zzso with zzso improved affinity relative to the parent zzso zzso specificity screening will be useful to screen, evolve, and characterize the specificity of protein and zzso interactions for molecular recognition zzso
