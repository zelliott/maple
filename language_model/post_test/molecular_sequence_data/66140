A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that produces zzso zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from the gut of a Japanese zzso The genes that zzso the zzso were cloned from the zzso library of the zzso using the genes zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso as zzso The zzso sequences were determined, and open reading frames of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso an zzso and an zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso respectively, were zzso The zzso had zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso had zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso For both zzso the DNA fragments that zzso the full-length protein and its truncated form lacking the putative signal zzso sequence were amplified by a zzso chain reaction and cloned into an expression zzso Each gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso from each strain had zzso zzso The zzso zzso the transfer of zzso acid zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso with low apparent zzso and the zzso zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso with low apparent zzso
