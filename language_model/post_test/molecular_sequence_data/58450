In this study, we report the cloning of a zzso zzso from a zzso adrenal zzso zzso The library was screened using a zzso zzso specific for the zzso adrenal zzso zzso Several clones of different lengths were obtained and one of these was zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the presence of the zzso zzso in male and female zzso in tests and zzso but not in the liver or zzso of either zzso Whole zzso zzso revealed the presence of four zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Indeed, when groups of zzso were injected with zzso and sacrificed at different times after treatment, only the zzso zzso form of the zzso zzso did not increase, whereas the other forms increased at varying zzso These results might suggest that the expression of the zzso protein in zzso zzso depends upon different zzso different zzso or different zzso signal zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that in zzso zzso is regulated by zzso suggesting the participation of this protein in controlling the transformation of cholesterol to zzso a key regulatory step in zzso
