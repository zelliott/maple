To improve zzso gene expression in zzso zzso a set of optimal artificial zzso I gene zzso promoters was zzso The region from zzso to zzso with three potential zzso zzso binding sites was zzso Then the region from zzso to zzso of the modified zzso promoter, including the zzso box and the zzso binding site, was repeatedly inserted into the modified zzso promoter, obtaining promoters with copy numbers 2, 4, and zzso The results showed that the zzso repression effects were abolished and the expression level of the zzso zzso reporter gene regulated by these zzso promoters was markedly enhanced as the copy number increased zzso The data showed the great promise of using the promoter artificial modification strategy to increase zzso gene expression in zzso zzso and provided a set of optional zzso zzso for gene function investigation and strain zzso
