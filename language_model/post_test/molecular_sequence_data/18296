The zzso of certain zzso of the DNA minor groove binding agent zzso zzso designed to exhibit altered sequence recognition are zzso The structural modifications include the zzso substitution of zzso for the zzso ring of the zzso zzso replacement of one zzso unit by a zzso in the two possible zzso with respect to the DNA zzso and a synthesis of zzso zzso recognition of these agents on a zzso zzso of zzso DNA was determined by zzso zzso zzso Some of the zzso exhibited altered DNA sequence preference compared with zzso zzso In particular, a structure bearing a zzso zzso with the oxygen oriented inward to the minor groove together with an zzso zzso nitrogen appears to zzso the property of recognition of a zzso base pair within the binding zzso The possible factors, zzso zzso and zzso contributing to the altered DNA sequence recognition properties are zzso
