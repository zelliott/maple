zzso virus zzso is known to be closely associated with the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso in some zzso endemic regions in zzso zzso zzso gene is one of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso membrane zzso zzso gene is thought to be a classical zzso since it zzso zzso cells in zzso and zzso tumors in experimental animals in zzso zzso is one of a few genes which is expressed in zzso zzso It was first shown that zzso of zzso gene obtained from zzso patients in zzso Asia contained a deletion of 30 base pairs zzso However, this deleted zzso gene was then found in the zzso zzso zzso among healthy virus carriers and patients with other zzso abnormalities from both zzso endemic and zzso zzso The aim of this investigation was to accomplish a molecular biological analysis of zzso zzso genes obtained from Russian zzso zzso To this end, the authors isolated and zzso the zzso clones amplified from the tumor zzso from 7 zzso patients at the zzso zzso zzso Russian Cancer Research Center and primary blood zzso zzso from 6 healthy zzso As a result, the authors could not find the deletion of the zzso 30 zzso in zzso zzso zzso but could in one healthy donor zzso A functional analysis revealed no significant differences between zzso zzso with or without 30 zzso deletion in their capacity to activate zzso zzso B and zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, Russian zzso zzso zzso as compared with those from zzso featured some specific zzso acid zzso These data indicate that the 30 zzso deletion of zzso gene is not a factor that zzso to zzso in zzso
