zzso zzso familial convulsions zzso represent a rare zzso disorder with zzso dominant mode of zzso To date, two zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in typical zzso zzso The study of new zzso may help detect new zzso and define zzso zzso 

A large Czech family was detected in which zzso was inherited together with a broad range of various zzso zzso zzso zzso linkage study and direct zzso analysis were performed to find the zzso zzso 

In seven patients with zzso and no recurrence of seizures, a novel zzso deletion zzso was identified within the coding sequence of the zzso zzso The zzso led to a putative protein that lacked nearly all its zzso zzso part, which plays a critical role for the accurate expression of the functional zzso zzso Three patients with generalized zzso zzso zzso all without any history of zzso also displayed zzso Three other patients with other idiopathic zzso zzso did not have the zzso 

A novel zzso deletion within the coding sequence of the zzso channel zzso gene was detected in patients from a large and zzso family with zzso or zzso zzso
