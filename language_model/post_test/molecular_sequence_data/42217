Because partial protection against zzso is induced by experimental infection in the guinea-pig model of zzso zzso infection, we sought to induce immunity by zzso Female zzso were zzso zzso with the major zzso protein zzso and the 61 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of the agent of guinea-pig inclusion conjunctivitis zzso zzso from zzso gels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained zzso to the zzso proteins at high zzso as measured by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso using whole elementary bodies as zzso showed significantly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso responses of peripheral zzso cells to zzso elementary bodies were zzso Animals zzso with zzso and zzso zzso were fully susceptible to zzso challenge, as were control animals zzso with buffer without zzso Another group of animals were zzso with material prepared by extraction of zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso and zzso which consisted largely of zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso group, zzso and zzso in the zzso group showed high zzso in zzso and high zzso zzso to zzso by zzso however, most animals also had zzso to 61 zzso 72 zzso and zzso 84 zzso zzso zzso zzso animals were partially protected against zzso challenge as evidenced by low inclusion scores compared to control animals, although duration of infection measured by culture isolation was similar to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
