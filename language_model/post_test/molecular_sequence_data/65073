We used direct recovery of bacterial zzso zzso gene sequences to investigate the bacterial diversity under zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso tree naturally growing in the dry land part of zzso (West zzso zzso DNA was zzso directly from soil samples and subjected to zzso with zzso specific for bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso clone libraries were constructed from two soil samples taken at two dates, zzso June 25th 1999 zzso zzso and August 28th 1999 zzso zzso at depths of zzso m and at 3 m distance from the zzso The zzso zzso of 117 clones was partially zzso zzso analysis of these sequences revealed extensive diversity zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis of these clones identified members of the zzso zzso of the zzso as the most important group, followed by the zzso division with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be less zzso Our data suggest that bacterial communities under zzso zzso zzso zzso might differ according to the zzso The relative compositions of the populations is different in both zzso the zzso are present in a much higher percentage in the dry season than in the rainy season sample while the inverse effect is observed for the members of the other zzso Within the zzso we found a shift between the dry season and the rainy season from zzso to zzso and zzso related zzso
