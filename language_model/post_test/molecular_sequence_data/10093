Most biological zzso contain one or two type I signal zzso for the removal of signal peptides from zzso precursor zzso In this respect, the zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be zzso because it contains at least four zzso type I signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the identification of the zzso and zzso zzso and the functional characterization of zzso zzso and zzso The four signal zzso have similar zzso zzso as they can all process the same zzso zzso Nevertheless, they seem to prefer different zzso as indicated by studies on the processing of the zzso of zzso zzso in strains lacking zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso and zzso genes are zzso transcribed at a low level, suggesting that they are required for processing of zzso zzso during all growth zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso and zzso is temporally controlled, in concert with the expression of the genes for most zzso zzso which suggests that zzso and zzso serve to increase the zzso capacity of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso serve different functions during the exponential and zzso growth phase of zzso zzso
