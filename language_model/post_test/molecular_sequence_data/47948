zzso stimulates sodium transport in the zzso collecting duct by zzso the zzso sodium channel zzso To investigate the basis of this effect, we have developed a novel set of rabbit zzso zzso to the 3 zzso of zzso and have determined the abundance and distribution of zzso zzso in the principal cells of the rat zzso collecting zzso zzso circulating zzso zzso to either dietary zzso restriction or zzso zzso markedly increased the abundance of zzso protein without increasing the abundance of the beta and gamma zzso Thus, zzso is selectively induced by zzso In addition, zzso zzso showed a striking zzso in zzso labeling to the zzso region of the collecting duct principal zzso Finally, zzso induced a shift in molecular weight of zzso from 85 zzso to 70 zzso consistent with zzso zzso clipping of the zzso loop as zzso zzso Thus, at the protein level, the response of zzso to zzso stimulation is zzso with both quantitative and qualitative changes that can explain observed increases in zzso sodium zzso
