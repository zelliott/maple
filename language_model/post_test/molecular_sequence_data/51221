The organization of the gene zzso tomato zzso a 200 zzso acid protein precursor of the 18 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor synthesis in tomato and potato plants, is zzso The zzso sequence reveals that the zzso which is composed of five zzso pairs of zzso plus a zzso zzso at the zzso containing the zzso zzso has evolved by several gene zzso events from a much smaller ancestral zzso The zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso among the zzso suggest that a small ancestral gene was duplicated to form at least two tandem repeats, followed by subsequent zzso events that resulted in five zzso repeated zzso sequences and three duplicated zzso acid sequence zzso Since the zzso zzso or zzso acid sequence was not zzso it was either not part of the gene zzso events or its coding region evolved separately and may even have been added to the zzso repeated part of the gene at a later zzso
