Diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes is based on protein zzso such as the cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are released into the zzso zzso discovery is focused on identifying very low abundance zzso zzso from within zzso zzso in which the wide dynamic range of the native protein complement zzso classical zzso zzso We employed an ex zzso rabbit model of zzso zzso zzso injury using zzso buffer zzso zzso zzso was collected over a zzso profile of 60 zzso zzso following brief, zzso zzso (15 zzso zzso for comparison with irreversible zzso zzso zzso proteins were separated using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and identified by mass zzso zzso revealing 26 zzso proteins released during zzso zzso zzso released during irreversible zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and one-dimensional gel zzso coupled to liquid zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A total of 192 zzso proteins were identified during zzso zzso zzso proteins included those previously associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to examples currently under investigation in large cohort studies zzso fatty acid binding zzso zzso The zzso release profile of a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein 3 zzso cardiac zzso domain zzso was validated by Western zzso zzso We also identified zzso in serum from 6 of 8 patients zzso following acute zzso zzso These studies indicate that animal modeling of zzso release using ex zzso buffer zzso tissue to limit the presence of zzso plasma proteins may identify candidates for further study in zzso
