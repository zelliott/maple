This study investigates the role of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso induction by zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso of newborn zzso zzso mice with zzso induced zzso plasma cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and few zzso marginal zone and small zzso zzso zzso one copy of the zzso zzso zzso sequence still allowed induction of multiple zzso tumor types, although zzso dominated zzso Additional zzso of binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso or basic zzso zzso factors in the zzso zzso region, however, shifted disease induction to almost exclusively zzso but had no major influence on tumor zzso zzso Southern analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso integration patterns showed that many of the zzso zzso induced by each virus were zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso weaken the ability of zzso to induce mature zzso zzso prior to the plasma cell stage, whereas development of plasma cell zzso is less dependent of viral zzso zzso
