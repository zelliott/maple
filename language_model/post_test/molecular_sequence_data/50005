We describe the cloning of a zzso from a human zzso library that encodes a novel protein with similarity to one repeat of zzso zzso channels zzso Northern and dot zzso analyses indicate that the novel zzso gene is expressed predominantly in zzso and at lower levels in many other zzso zzso expression of the zzso protein did not lead to the induction of any zzso zzso current and failed to modify zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso zzso proteins have been cloned from zzso zzso and zzso and appear to zzso zzso channels involved in zzso function, axis determination, and zzso zzso
