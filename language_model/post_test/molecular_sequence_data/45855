The ubiquitous zzso pathogen zzso zzso kills a wide range of zzso Host zzso can recognize and zzso its zzso but this capacity is lost on production of zzso zzso We show that the unusual ability of zzso bodies to avoid detection depends on a gene zzso that is expressed within 20 zzso of the pathogen zzso zzso A zzso disrupted in zzso is rapidly attacked by zzso and shows a corresponding reduction of zzso to zzso zzso zzso encodes a three domain protein zzso a zzso zzso charged zzso region with 14 zzso zzso a central region zzso tandem repeats zzso characteristic of zzso zzso and a zzso region that includes a zzso cell wall attachment zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso bodies are covered by the zzso zzso of zzso The collagen domain became zzso accessible after treatment with zzso suggesting that the N zzso are linked by zzso zzso bonds and are presented on the cell surface by extended zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso functions as an zzso protective coat because it masks zzso structural components of the cell wall such as zzso and because its zzso zzso charged nature makes it unattractive to zzso A survey of 54 zzso zzso revealed that seven other species have proteins with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a member of a zzso distributed gene zzso
