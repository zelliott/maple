In an effort to identify regulatory elements of the serum zzso A zzso gene that play a major role in its expression under zzso conditions, we studied the expression of a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids containing a progressively deleted upstream zzso sequence of the zzso zzso Two regulatory regions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso capable of driving zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the regulatory region located between positions zzso and zzso is a major site of interaction for highly zzso and zzso nuclear proteins in zzso rabbit zzso zzso I footprint and competition analyses showed that this region contains two adjacent nuclear protein binding sites (between zzso and zzso with varying affinity for protein zzso Both of these binding sites are capable of driving zzso zzso of a reporter gene containing a minimal zzso zzso analyses of the zzso nuclear proteins that bind to this promoter element showed that they are zzso of the zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso nuclear factors under acute conditions, when zzso zzso activity has been reported, suggests a critical role for these proteins in the expression of the zzso zzso
