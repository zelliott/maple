zzso zzso are a growing class of small zzso (about 22 zzso that play crucial regulatory roles in the zzso by targeting zzso for zzso or zzso zzso Most of the identified zzso are highly zzso among species, indicating strong functional constraint on zzso zzso However, zzso zzso may contribute to functional zzso during zzso Recently, an zzso zzso cluster was reported with multiple copies in primates but not in zzso or zzso Here we zzso and compared this zzso cluster in major zzso lineages including human, great zzso lesser zzso Old World zzso and New World zzso Our data indicate rapid evolution of this cluster in primates including frequent tandem zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso were observed in human and zzso leading to the emergence of potential novel mature zzso The expression analysis in zzso monkeys revealed a strong correlation between zzso expression changes and male sexual zzso suggesting regulatory roles of this zzso cluster in zzso development and zzso We propose that, like zzso zzso zzso genes involved in male reproduction are subject to rapid zzso changes that may contribute to functional zzso during zzso
