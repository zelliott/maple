Analysis of the automated computer zzso of the early draft phase zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed the previously discovered zzso gene zzso and an additional partial zzso with weak similarities to zzso zzso The entire gene was zzso to reveal a zzso gene coding for zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso No zzso or translation signals could be determined in close proximity to the zzso However, a strong putative zzso with a free energy of zzso zzso was identified directly downstream of the zzso A zzso analysis showed similarities to members of zzso zzso zzso associated zzso and zzso zzso of an zzso zzso tree with other examples of zzso proteins and zzso placed the deduced protein separately from both zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso was constructed by targeted integration into the zzso zzso analysis of zzso linked proteins of the cell wall of the zzso compared to the wild type, revealed the loss of a zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso revealed significant changes in cell zzso altered responses to various environmental zzso and lowered cell zzso Based on the in zzso and functional zzso we zzso that this protein plays a role in zzso processing during the growth and zzso separation and designated the gene as zzso zzso zzso
