zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, plays a critical role in the maintenance of embryonic stem zzso cell zzso Here, we report the identification of an zzso zzso of zzso This zzso lacked a stretch of zzso acids zzso zzso located between the HD and zzso zzso of the zzso full length zzso suggesting that the deleted sequence functions as a zzso and possibly affects the flexibility of the zzso zzso domain relative to the DNA binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso designated as zzso 48, was much lower than that of the full length version in human zzso zzso The ratio of zzso 48 transcript to full length transcript increased, however, in zzso adult zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both forms of zzso were able to bind a zzso binding sequence with roughly the same zzso A reporter zzso zzso also showed that both zzso of zzso modestly zzso zzso of zzso whose expression is proposed to be inhibited by zzso with comparable zzso We conclude that, despite the difference in primary structure and expression pattern in various stem cells, the zzso zzso of zzso has similar activity to that of the full length zzso
