The zzso zzso unit of zzso zzso has been previously shown to be required for activity of the three zzso systems, Mo zzso V zzso and zzso zzso present in this zzso We studied regulation of expression and the role of the zzso region by means of zzso zzso zzso to each of the five open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the first three open reading frames was observed under all three zzso zzso expression of zzso was never zzso Genes zzso and zzso were expressed at similar zzso With zzso expression of zzso and zzso was approximately zzso and approximately zzso lower than that of zzso zzso Without zzso expression of zzso dropped three- to fourfold and that of zzso dropped to the detection zzso However, expression of zzso increased zzso The products of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso in zzso zzso as zzso fusion proteins with the expected molecular zzso The zzso fusion lacked activity for any of the three zzso systems and showed an zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso resulted in reduced zzso activities, especially when V was zzso zzso activity in extracts was similarly affected, suggesting a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not affect any of the zzso under standard zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in an increased zzso zzso Mo requirement for Mo zzso activity, a zzso already observed with zzso zzso No effect of the zzso zzso on V or zzso zzso was zzso this is consistent with its very low expression under those zzso zzso in zzso had no effect on zzso zzso
