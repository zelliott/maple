The kinetic mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reaction was investigated in the forward and reverse zzso In the forward direction, initial zzso obtained by varying zzso and the zzso zzso indicated a sequential addition of the two zzso The zzso zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor versus the zzso zzso and a zzso inhibitor versus zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso group zzso only a zzso increase in zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor versus zzso and a zzso inhibitor versus the zzso zzso These results prove that the addition of zzso is zzso Furthermore, there appears to be little binding zzso as the zzso approximately equal to zzso The zzso zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor versus zzso and a zzso inhibitor against zzso suggesting that a dead end complex can form between zzso the zzso zzso product, and the zzso The reverse reaction was investigated by varying zzso and the zzso zzso The initial zzso pattern was indicative of a sequential zzso There was even less binding zzso in the reverse direction as the zzso approximately equal to zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor versus zzso and a zzso inhibitor versus the zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor versus the zzso and a zzso inhibitor versus zzso These data prove that addition of the zzso in the reverse direction is zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor against zzso zzso and a zzso inhibitor against zzso therefore a dead end complex can form between zzso zzso and the zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso reaction follows a sequential zzso random mechanism in both directions, with dead end complexes forming when either zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso bind to the zzso The kinetic zzso determined from the forward and reverse reactions were used in the zzso equation to determine a zzso constant for the forward reaction of zzso corresponding to a delta G of zzso zzso This further confirms that the zzso bond of zzso is similar in energy to that of the zzso of zzso
