Analysis of human zzso virus type II zzso zzso from North America and Europe have demonstrated the existence of two molecular zzso of the virus, zzso and zzso Recently, studies on zzso infections in Brazil have revealed zzso that are related zzso to the zzso zzso but have a zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso To more clearly define this relationship, zzso was isolated from peripheral blood of an zzso from zzso zzso Brazil zzso and the complete zzso was cloned and zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences to other available complete zzso zzso sequences revealed that zzso is most closely related to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and tax regions unequivocally demonstrated that zzso and all other Brazilian sequences examined are members of the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the major coding regions of zzso are also most closely related to zzso with the important exception of zzso The tax protein zzso by zzso is zzso identical to the tax of zzso zzso and is similar in that it has an additional 25 zzso acids at the zzso compared to the zzso tax with which it shares zzso zzso Analysis of tax stop zzso usage of a number of zzso zzso from North American, Europe, and Brazil demonstrated that zzso from the last region appear to be unique in their extended tax zzso It could be demonstrated that the extended tax proteins in the zzso and Brazilian zzso had equivalent ability to zzso the viral zzso and studies with deletion zzso indicated that the extended zzso is not essential for zzso In contrast, the zzso tax was found to have a greatly diminished ability to zzso the viral zzso which appeared to be a consequence of reduced expression of the zzso The studies show that although the Brazilian strains do not represent an entirely new zzso based on zzso sequence analysis they are a zzso unique molecular zzso within the zzso zzso
