We zzso the E gene and adjacent zzso and zzso junctions zzso zzso of 48 zzso zzso zzso collected between 1981 and 1999 from 8 Caribbean islands and from 7 South and Central American zzso zzso analysis confirms a single introduction in the early 1980s and a high degree of gene flow resulting in a pattern of evolution defined more by time period than geographic origin, especially within the Caribbean zzso A modern Caribbean zzso consisting of four distinct lineages has zzso comprised of zzso from Caribbean islands and nearby regions of South zzso This zzso is defined by three zzso acid zzso in the E zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings highlight the importance of migration and gene flow in dengue viral change and suggest that efforts to understand disease dynamics in the Caribbean basin need to focus at zzso rather than local zzso
