The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso complex that degrades zzso proteins in zzso zzso It consists of a zzso core (the zzso zzso as well as regulatory zzso which contain six zzso zzso zzso involved in unfolding and zzso of zzso to the zzso chamber of the zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso to analyze the zzso modifications of the zzso zzso zzso which contains the zzso recognition sequence for zzso Our results revealed that following the removal of the initiation Met zzso of zzso zzso the zzso Pro zzso is either zzso zzso or zzso and that this zzso has not been zzso throughout zzso In order to gain a better understanding of the possible zzso of the zzso zzso sequence at positions 3 and 4 of zzso zzso we generated zzso strains expressing an zzso zzso that lacks this zzso The absence of the zzso sequence abolished zzso decreased cell growth, and increased sensitivity to zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso and/or its zzso sequence might be important in cell growth or stress tolerance in zzso
