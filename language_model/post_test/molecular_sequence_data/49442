It has been established that zzso Lewis zzso in core 2 zzso zzso serves as an zzso and zzso zzso Recently, it was discovered that zzso Lewis zzso in extended core 1 zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso in high zzso zzso zzso core 1 zzso can be zzso when a core 1 extension zzso is zzso In this study, we first show that zzso zzso is almost exclusively responsible for core 1 extension among seven different zzso and thus acts on core 1 zzso attached to zzso We found that transcripts zzso zzso were expressed in human zzso and zzso but that their levels were lower than those of transcripts zzso core 2 zzso I zzso zzso also expressed transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso expressed only small amounts of transcripts zzso zzso To determine the roles of zzso Lewis zzso in extended core 1 zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso to express zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso structural analyses disclosed that zzso expressed in these zzso cells carried comparable amounts of zzso Lewis zzso in extended core 1 and core 2 zzso zzso In a rolling zzso zzso cells expressing zzso Lewis zzso in extended core 1 zzso supported a significant degree of zzso zzso and rolling of zzso and zzso although less than zzso cells expressing zzso Lewis zzso in core 2 zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso Lewis zzso in extended core 1 zzso can function as an zzso zzso and is potentially involved in zzso zzso on zzso bound to activated zzso zzso
