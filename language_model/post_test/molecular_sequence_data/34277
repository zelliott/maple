For first time in Greece zzso influenza virus infection was confirmed, by isolation and molecular analysis, as the cause of clinical respiratory disease among zzso horses during 2003 and 2007 zzso 

zzso influenza virus zzso zzso was isolated in zzso cells from 30 zzso zzso from horses with acute respiratory disease, which were tested positive by zzso zzso zzso Isolation was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the M, zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso sequences of the Greek zzso appeared to be more closely related to viruses isolated in early 1990s in zzso These results suggested that viruses with fewer changes than those on the main evolutionary lineage may continue to zzso On the other hand, analysis of deduced zzso zzso acid sequences were more closely related to viruses isolated in outbreaks in Europe and Asia during zzso zzso analysis characterized the Greek zzso as a member of the zzso lineage by the zzso zzso protein zzso but appeared to be a member of the Florida zzso zzso 2 by the zzso zzso protein sequence suggesting that zzso might be a possible zzso 

Our findings suggest that the Greek strains represent an example of zzso zzso and probably zzso between genetically distinct zzso zzso Therefore expanding current zzso influenza surveillance efforts is a zzso
