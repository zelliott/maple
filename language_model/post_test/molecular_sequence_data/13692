In order to differentiate zzso populations bearing two zzso forms of zzso an zzso zzso surface protein of zzso zzso two sets of zzso zzso were designed to amplify either of the two zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso Each set of the zzso zzso amplified either of zzso or zzso zzso zzso By using this zzso zzso and restriction zzso zzso of amplified products, zzso populations within field zzso collected from different geographical regions in Japan were zzso Both of the zzso forms were detected in 13 samples out of 20 zzso and stocks by zzso Either of zzso or zzso type of zzso zzso was detected in the other 7 zzso These results indicated that the majority of zzso zzso calves zzso in Japan zzso mixed zzso populations bearing at least two different zzso of zzso
