zzso (also known as zzso members are thought to be involved in zzso guidance during neural network zzso Here, we report the isolation of a novel member, mouse zzso G zzso zzso which encodes a zzso domain followed by a single putative zzso domain, a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso G is most closely related to zzso zzso which we previously reported, and zzso and zzso These four members appear to constitute a zzso type zzso in mouse zzso In contrast to the zzso expression of zzso F zzso in the nervous zzso zzso G zzso are strongly expressed in zzso zzso especially in the zzso as well as in the nervous zzso The zzso are also detected in various cell lines from zzso zzso By generating specific zzso we confirmed the strong expression of zzso G proteins on the surface of zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso is expressed on zzso and suggest that zzso may play an important role in the immune system, as well as in the nervous zzso
