The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the tobacco zzso necrosis strain of potato virus Y zzso was zzso The sequence revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso of which the start was not identified, and an untranslated region of zzso zzso upstream of a zzso zzso zzso of the open reading frame with the zzso sequence of the viral coat protein enabled mapping of the start of the coat protein at zzso acid zzso and indicated that maturation of this protein requires zzso processing from a larger zzso precursor at a zzso zzso zzso The coat protein of zzso displayed significant zzso to zzso sequence zzso to the coat proteins of four other zzso tobacco etch virus, tobacco vein zzso virus, plum pox virus and zzso mosaic zzso Even higher sequence zzso zzso was detected with the coat protein of a fifth zzso pepper zzso virus zzso This zzso was of the same level as found between the coat proteins of zzso and a second strain of this virus, zzso zzso moreover, zzso and zzso were the only zzso displaying zzso in the zzso zzso regions of their zzso we conclude that zzso should be regarded as a strain of zzso
