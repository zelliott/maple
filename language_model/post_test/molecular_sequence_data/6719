Eight independently isolated unstable zzso of the zzso zzso locus were zzso genetically and at the DNA zzso The whole series of zzso was isolated from a zzso strain carrying a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso element zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Previous work with another unstable zzso of the same series has shown that it was indeed caused by the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso the remaining eight zzso were not caused by the designated zzso element, but by other insertions that are structurally similar or identical to one of two different autonomous zzso zzso Six zzso were caused by the zzso of a zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso were the result of the zzso of a zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tests carried out with plants carrying the unstable zzso demonstrated that all were caused by the zzso of an autonomous zzso zzso
