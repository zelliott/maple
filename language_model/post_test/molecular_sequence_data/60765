The mouse zzso gene potentially encodes several proteins that differ in their zzso zzso including an zzso zzso factor, zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the originally described zzso gene product zzso zzso exists about the function of these potential zzso of the zzso zzso To examine the zzso potential of different zzso gene products, we compared the ability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to activate an zzso zzso construct in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso These three cell lines were zzso zzso with a zzso mouse zzso promoter zzso construct zzso and different amounts of expression zzso containing the respective full-length zzso zzso zzso Using zzso protocols with lower amounts of expression zzso zzso we found that all three zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in each of the cell types, consistent with the their ability to induce expression of an zzso gene both in zzso cells and in zzso cell zzso However, using zzso protocols with higher amounts of expression plasmids containing zzso zzso we found that the zzso and zzso had less zzso potential compared with zzso Our studies suggest that the zzso acid zzso of zzso is not crucial for optimal zzso whereas the zzso acid zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso only at high doses of the expression zzso The zzso significance of these in zzso findings remain to be zzso
