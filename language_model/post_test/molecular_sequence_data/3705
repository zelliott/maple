zzso binding protein zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso are key factors for the assembly of zzso zzso initiation zzso We used a rice zzso extract in zzso zzso system to characterize the functional interactions of zzso plant zzso and zzso zzso expressed rice zzso zzso bound to the zzso box of the rice pal gene zzso zzso zzso caused DNA bending, and enhanced zzso zzso from the pal promoter in a zzso zzso zzso zzso rice zzso zzso zzso the DNA binding and zzso activities of zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso from the pal promoter and the promoter of Rice zzso zzso virus but not from the barley zzso zzso We also demonstrate a physical interaction between zzso and zzso a rice zzso zzso factor that bound to the box II zzso element of the promoter of Rice zzso zzso virus, resulting in enhanced zzso from the viral zzso Enhancement of rice zzso extracts with zzso zzso factors thus provides a powerful tool for the in zzso determination of plant gene regulation zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso functional interactions with both the zzso zzso factor zzso and the accessory zzso factor zzso
