The zzso zzso controls cell zzso tissue zzso and zzso Its zzso zzso the association of zzso with nuclear zzso proteins and results in zzso zzso of target zzso The mechanism by which nuclear zzso controls zzso is largely zzso Here we genetically identify a novel zzso zzso component that mediates the zzso zzso of zzso We show that zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso components of the zzso Factor 1 zzso complex, are required for nuclear zzso of the zzso signal and bind directly to the zzso region of zzso Moreover, we find that the zzso potential of zzso depends on the recruitment of zzso to zzso Our results assign to the tumor zzso zzso an unexpected role in zzso signaling and provide a molecular mechanism for zzso target gene control, in which the nuclear zzso signaling complex directly engages the zzso complex, thereby controlling zzso initiation and zzso by zzso zzso zzso
