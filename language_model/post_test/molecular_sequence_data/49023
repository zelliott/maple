Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso was used to establish a novel in zzso screening system that allows rapid detection of protein folding and protein zzso with increased zzso stability in the zzso of zzso zzso The system is based on the simultaneous fusion of the green fluorescent protein zzso to the C zzso of a protein X of interest, and of zzso protein zzso to the N zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso in the zzso fusion protein is observed in zzso only when protein X is folded and brings zzso and zzso into close zzso while zzso is lost when zzso and zzso are far apart due to unfolding or zzso degradation of protein zzso The screening system was validated by identification of zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso from expression libraries after random zzso bacterial cell zzso and colony zzso
