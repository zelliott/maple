In systemic zzso diseases such as lupus the immune system produces zzso to nuclear zzso including DNA and zzso zzso In the present study, we describe three zzso zzso zzso that have been obtained from zzso zzso zzso These three zzso react with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a region of the zzso that is accessible in zzso Using a series of overlapping zzso synthetic peptides and structural zzso we have mapped the different zzso recognized by these zzso We have also zzso the combining sites zzso zzso of the zzso and modeled their interactions with the corresponding zzso Overall, the data suggest that the mechanisms of interaction with zzso are different for each of the three zzso even though they all react with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso The results also suggest that the binding between these zzso and zzso zzso is different from that between most zzso and conventional protein zzso since the heavy chain zzso region 3 appears to play only a limited role in the three zzso zzso The study of the interaction between zzso and spontaneously occurring zzso may help us zzso the mechanisms driving the expansion of zzso zzso
