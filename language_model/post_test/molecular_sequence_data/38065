zzso cell divisions require the establishment of an axis of zzso which is subsequently communicated to downstream zzso During the zzso cell division of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso establishment of polarity depends on the establishment of anterior and zzso cortical zzso defined by the zzso of the zzso zzso followed by the orientation of the zzso zzso along the previously established axis of zzso To identify genes required for these events, we have screened a collection of zzso lethal zzso on zzso II of zzso zzso We have identified a zzso in one zzso zzso with zzso division axes at the zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso and molecular characterization of zzso zzso is required for the correct zzso of zzso and zzso cortical zzso after the first cell zzso zzso is a novel putative zzso zzso which zzso to a zzso membrane zzso probably the zzso zzso that spans the whole zzso and is enriched on the nuclear envelope and zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is required to form the cortical zzso essential for polarity after cell zzso
