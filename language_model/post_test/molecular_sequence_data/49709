zzso infections are common in zzso zzso isolation is the only diagnostic method to confirm zzso zzso infections, however, is not always zzso 

A new approach for the diagnosis of zzso infections was performed, using the reference strain zzso from sequence analysis of zzso zzso 

zzso isolation, zzso zzso and sequence analysis were performed from clinical samples or stored zzso from two zzso with fever and zzso zzso test zzso zzso against zzso reference virus were measured in paired zzso 

zzso isolation was negative in both patients but the zzso zzso was amplified in the acute phase zzso obtained from the two zzso From the results of sequence analysis of 109 zzso located in the zzso of the zzso region of zzso a high zzso to zzso types 25 and 30 was zzso More than a zzso increase in zzso zzso against reference viruses was demonstrated in the acute and zzso phase zzso They were confirmed as zzso type 25 and 30 infection, zzso 

These zzso examinations are practical and useful for clinical settings for a diagnosis of zzso infections because of an insufficient positive rate in virus zzso
