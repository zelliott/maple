We isolated zzso and explored their diversity from the zzso zzso of some medicinal zzso 

We used the helper bacteria baiting technique to isolate zzso from the zzso zzso collected in South China zzso Garden and zzso National Forest zzso The zzso were identified by zzso characteristics and zzso zzso gene sequences zzso 

A total of 50 strains were isolated from 22 soil samples, which were identified into 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The dominant zzso were zzso and zzso 

Environmental factors were associated with the diversity of zzso zzso better adapt in high organic matter content and neutral pH zzso The strains of zzso and zzso had a good zzso for different zzso Meanwhile, the dependence of the strains of zzso and zzso on organic carbon content was not too obvious, and they can also be found in the poor zzso Our findings provided an important scientific base for the development and zzso of zzso zzso
