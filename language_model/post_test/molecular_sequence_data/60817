Most simple zzso induce tumors of a single cell type when infected into susceptible zzso The zzso 19-6 zzso leukemia virus zzso which originated in mainland China, zzso zzso of multiple cellular zzso Indeed, infected mice often harbor more than one tumor zzso Since the enhancers of many zzso are major zzso of tumor zzso we tested the role of the zzso 19-6 zzso enhancers in its broad disease zzso The zzso elements of the zzso zzso zzso were replaced by the zzso enhancers of zzso 19-6 zzso yielding the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso normally zzso zzso tumors in all infected zzso Surprisingly, when zzso mice were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso all tumors were of zzso origin, typical of zzso rather than zzso 19-6 zzso Thus, the zzso 19-6 zzso enhancers did not zzso the broad disease specificity of zzso 19-6 zzso to zzso However, all tumors contained zzso zzso zzso with common zzso zzso These zzso consisted of tandem zzso of a zzso of the zzso 19-6 zzso encompassing the zzso zzso and core sites and adjacent zzso Moreover, when tumors induced by the parental zzso 19-6 zzso were zzso most of the zzso tumors had similar zzso zzso in the same region whereas tumors of other lineages retained the parental zzso 19-6 zzso zzso These results emphasize the importance of a zzso of the zzso 19-6 zzso zzso in induction of zzso zzso The relevant sequences were consistent with crucial sequences for zzso zzso identified for other zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso These results also suggest that other regions of the zzso 19-6 zzso zzso contribute to its broad zzso zzso
