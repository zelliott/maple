The essential zzso zzso and zzso often limit plant growth but are toxic in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso membrane major zzso zzso protein required for zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso enhances the zzso into zzso of the low molecular mass metal zzso zzso and leads to pronounced zzso zzso in roots, accompanied by zzso buildup of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso and enhances zzso contents of zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso without zzso a zzso zzso that additionally lacks zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso in roots of zzso but not of Fe, is enhanced in zzso zzso at the expense of the zzso Furthermore, these lines exhibit impaired zzso zzso movement in leaves and zzso zzso zzso symptoms, thus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso has profound, yet zzso effects on zzso and zzso with respect to their zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also hypersensitive to zzso zzso even in media lacking added zzso zzso accurate levels of zzso expression are critical for both zzso and zzso zzso This will help to advance the zzso of zzso
