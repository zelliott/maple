zzso zzso T cell responses in cancer patients are strongly controlled by zzso and increased numbers of zzso zzso correlate with reduced zzso However, the tumor zzso recognized by zzso in cancer patients and the impact of these cells on zzso T cell responses have not been systematically zzso Here we used a broad panel of long synthetic peptides of defined tumor zzso and normal tissue zzso to exploit a newly developed method to identify and compare ex zzso the zzso zzso of zzso with those of zzso T cells in peripheral blood of zzso cancer patients and healthy zzso zzso in tumor patients were highly specific for a distinct set of only a few tumor zzso suggesting that zzso exert T cell suppression in an zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were zzso in the majority of zzso cancer patients but not in healthy zzso We detected differences in the zzso of zzso recognized by zzso and zzso T cells in the majority of zzso cancer zzso In addition, only zzso T cell responses against zzso recognized by zzso strongly increased after zzso zzso The selection of zzso according to zzso T cell responses may improve the efficacy of future zzso for cancer and zzso zzso
