The solution structures of the zzso form of native chicken zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso and zzso The structures turn out to be very similar, despite the zzso and the zzso of the zzso Their dominant feature is a zzso zzso which is wrapped around a zzso zzso as shown by X-ray zzso studies of zzso chicken zzso However, the zzso analysis shows that the second zzso observed in the crystal is not present in zzso The zzso occurs at zzso which is located in a flexible zzso For this reason, very few effects on the structure are zzso zzso of structures of the zzso zzso and the zzso shows small effects on zzso which is located in the supposed recognition site of the zzso zzso This recognition site appears to be well structured as a large zzso zzso of the zzso The N zzso of both zzso which contribute to a large extent to the binding to the zzso are very zzso A loop structure involving the zzso zzso to A10 as found in related zzso such as in the zzso zzso 2 and 3, is not sufficiently populated to be zzso
