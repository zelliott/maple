Some zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso were found to exhibit a special affinity to central zzso zzso zzso their affinity to peripheral zzso receptors our knowledge is still zzso The results of our experiments indicate that CM derivatives interfere with peripheral zzso receptors and that there is a close connection with the affinity to different zzso of this zzso
