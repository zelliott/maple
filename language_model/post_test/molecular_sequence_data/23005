Target of zzso zzso is a zzso regulator of cell growth and metabolism that zzso energy, growth factor, and zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein functions as the zzso component of two large zzso complexes and consists of an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe an zzso series of zzso in the zzso zzso gene and show that combinations of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso display the rare genetic phenomenon of zzso zzso in which two or more defective proteins assemble to form a functional zzso We present zzso evidence that zzso zzso in zzso and show that this zzso is unaffected by positive or negative signals upstream of zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso can zzso interfere with zzso zzso function in cells lacking zzso or zzso zzso zzso thus partially accounts for the high apparent molecular weight of zzso complexes and offers novel therapeutic strategies for zzso stemming from zzso zzso
