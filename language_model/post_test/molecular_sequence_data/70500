Recent molecular data provide strong support for the view that all zzso zzso including zzso are of zzso zzso The relationship of zzso including the zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso has only rarely been studied by using zzso coding for zzso zzso data from zzso suggested a relationship of zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso studies of zzso did not support these zzso In the present study, we compared zzso acid sequences that are found in a variety of zzso (including zzso with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to obtain an answer to this zzso We used the four sequences from 70 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain found in protein zzso zzso and zzso The latter two sequences were deduced from zzso isolated from the sponge zzso zzso for the zzso analyses zzso These revealed that the sponge molecules were grouped into the same branch as the zzso which is statistically zzso separated from those branches that comprise the sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso From our molecular data it seems evident that the zzso zzso existed at an earlier stage of evolution, and the zzso and especially the zzso and the zzso only appeared zzso
