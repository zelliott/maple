zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) is a zzso expressed integral membrane protein that regulates zzso pH in zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso segments have unusual properties, acting as zzso breakers and increasing flexibility of membrane zzso since they lack an zzso zzso We examined the importance of three zzso zzso zzso in TM IV zzso segment zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso Ala or zzso and zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were expressed at levels similar to zzso zzso and were targeted to the plasma zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at lower levels compared with zzso zzso and a significant portion of zzso and zzso were retained zzso possibly indicating induced changes in the structure of TM zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso abolished zzso activity, and zzso and zzso zzso caused markedly decreased zzso In contrast, the activity of the zzso zzso was not significantly different from that of zzso zzso The results indicate that both zzso and zzso in TM IV of zzso are required for normal zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso affects the expression and membrane targeting of the zzso Thus both zzso and zzso are strictly required for zzso function and may play critical roles in the structure of TM IV of the zzso
