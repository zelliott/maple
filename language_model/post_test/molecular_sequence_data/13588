zzso nuclear factor zzso a zzso expressed zzso functions in patterning of the zzso zzso contains a number of defined protein zzso implicated in the regulation of some zzso zzso Among these is a zzso motif zzso a zzso zzso finger and zzso domain next to a predicted zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this motif is found in a variety of protein including several zzso Here we describe the solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain determined at zzso pH by zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure represents the first three-dimensional structure of this new motif and comprises a zzso have two zzso two zzso turns and three extended loop regions packed in a novel zzso The zzso zzso for the best 18 structures is zzso A for backbone atoms and zzso A for all zzso zzso calculations and zzso data shows one zinc atom zzso in a zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso peptides to determine the metal zzso scheme which surprisingly shows that not all of the seven zzso zzso in the zzso motif are involved in metal zzso The zzso structure is not similar in zzso fold to any other known zzso zzso
