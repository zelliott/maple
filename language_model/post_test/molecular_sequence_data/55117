A zzso zzso zzso site located zzso to the zzso center has been identified in several zzso zzso zzso zzso but the characteristics of such a site have not been systematically zzso Here, all available zzso structures that follow the zzso structural motif were screened for the presence of a zzso zzso close to the zzso site but distinct from zzso metal zzso Such zzso zzso were found in all zzso virus families for which there were high-resolution zzso structures zzso Bound zzso were always located in structurally similar locations at an approximate zzso distance from the zzso zzso Furthermore, the second zzso zzso in the highly zzso zzso sequence was found to be involved in the coordination of the bound zzso in all viral zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso zzso site is zzso across zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso was also observed in a similar position in the reverse zzso of the human zzso zzso Moreover, two members of the zzso DNA zzso B family displayed an zzso at a comparable distance from the zzso site, but the position was clearly distinct from the zzso zzso sites of zzso
