Large varieties in the lengths and the zzso acid sequences of the third zzso determining region of the zzso heavy chain zzso have made it difficult to establish a relationship between the sequences and the zzso structures, in contrast to the other zzso which are classified by their zzso zzso A total of 55 zzso segments from well determined crystal structures were zzso and we have derived several remarkable rules, which could partly govern the zzso zzso dependence on the zzso Since the rules are physically reasonable, they are expected to be zzso to structural modeling and design of zzso
