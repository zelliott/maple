As part of continuing studies of the zzso components present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso cone snail collected in the western Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, two major zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso Their zzso acid sequences were determined by automatic zzso sequencing after reduction and zzso Their molecular masses, established by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso confirmed the chemical analyses and indicated that zzso and zzso have free zzso Each zzso contains zzso zzso arranged in a pattern zzso framework zzso The primary structure of zzso is zzso zzso zzso mass zzso calculated zzso mass zzso whereas that of zzso is zzso zzso zzso mass zzso calculated zzso mass zzso Both zzso peptides zzso scratching and grooming activity in mice, and zzso also caused body and rear limb extension and tail zzso immediately upon zzso The high sequence similarity of zzso zzso with zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso suggests that the former might block zzso zzso
