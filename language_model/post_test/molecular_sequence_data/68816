To test the feasibility of gene therapy for AIDS patients, an animal model is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso or viral zzso derived from zzso zzso virus zzso were efficiently targeted into zzso zzso through zzso gene zzso After challenging with infectious zzso the zzso zzso that received zzso genes were not only protected from zzso infection, but also from infection with zzso for at least 25 zzso Furthermore, little or no zzso effect zzso zzso was observed in the protected zzso These data demonstrated that zzso or zzso replication could be effectively blocked by zzso zzso or negative dominant factors which were introduced into targeted cells through zzso gene zzso
