A fusion protein consisting of the zzso B zzso zzso and the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso in conjunction with zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso was used to investigate the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso fusion protein displayed very similar pharmacological properties when expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso The integrity of the fusion protein was verified by low temperature PAGE analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso fusion zzso Fluorescence zzso of Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso fusion protein demonstrated strong signals at the plasma zzso On addition of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso occurred within 5 zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso On further zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in the zzso region, zzso with fluorescent low density zzso a marker of the late zzso pathway, but not with fluorescent zzso a marker of the recycling zzso No zzso of zzso from the zzso was seen within 4 zzso Using zzso or zzso binding sites were again zzso at the cell surface within 2 zzso The reappearance of binding sites was abolished by prior treatment of the cells with zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso The data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso however, it does not zzso like most of the G zzso receptors but is sorted to the late zzso zzso in a manner similar to that of the family of zzso zzso
