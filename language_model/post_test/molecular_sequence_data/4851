Distribution of zzso molecules to the two daughter cells at cell division is of major importance for their stable zzso Several mechanisms that control zzso of zzso plasmids have been described in molecular zzso However, no zzso or analogous systems have been identified for intermediate or zzso zzso including rolling circle replicating zzso zzso It has been suggested that distribution of such plasmids at cell division relies solely on random zzso zzso zzso is a 2 zzso zzso zzso that was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains a DNA region of approximately zzso zzso that is associated with its zzso zzso An zzso that consists of two genes zzso and zzso is followed by a putative zzso site that contains an integration host factor zzso binding site, flanked by several zzso zzso in zzso resulted in zzso zzso In addition, this DNA region was able to stabilize partially a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso stabilization system have been detected on numerous zzso and bacterial zzso
