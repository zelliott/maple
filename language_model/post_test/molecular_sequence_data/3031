zzso acutely reduced blood zzso can compromise energy zzso alter zzso balance and damage cellular zzso including zzso We show in zzso in the rat brain that respiratory zzso leads to formation of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso DNA damage and to increased expression of a DNA repair zzso involved in protection of the zzso from the zzso consequences of zzso The zzso is a zzso of the zzso coli zzso DNA zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso opposite the oxidized base, zzso We have cloned a full-length rat zzso zzso zzso which encodes 516 zzso zzso and by in zzso zzso analysis obtained expression patterns of zzso zzso in zzso cortical and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA damage was induced and zzso expression strongly zzso This is the first evidence for a regulated expression of a DNA repair zzso in the context of respiratory zzso Our findings support the premise that zzso DNA damage is repaired in zzso and the possibility that the zzso expression of a DNA repair zzso in the brain represents an zzso mechanism for protection of zzso DNA from zzso consequences of disrupted energy metabolism and zzso zzso
