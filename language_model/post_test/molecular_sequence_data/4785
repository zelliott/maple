We describe a method to design zzso proteins zzso to the basic zzso zzso zzso family of zzso DNA binding zzso zzso The zzso specifically zzso with the zzso zzso domain of the zzso factors and abolish DNA binding in an zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that a zzso between a zzso zzso domain and a zzso consisting of a zzso acid sequence appended onto the Max zzso domain zzso is zzso zzso more stable than the zzso zzso One zzso equivalent of zzso can totally abolish the DNA binding activity of a zzso zzso This zzso extension also has been appended onto the zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso a member of the zzso factor zzso binding zzso to produce zzso The zzso between zzso and the zzso domain of zzso is zzso zzso more stable than the zzso zzso Cell culture studies show that zzso can inhibit zzso zzso both in zzso extension and in a zzso zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso formation twice as well as the Max zzso domain zzso This strategy of producing zzso may be zzso to other zzso or zzso proteins because it provides a method to inhibit the DNA binding of these zzso factors in a zzso zzso
