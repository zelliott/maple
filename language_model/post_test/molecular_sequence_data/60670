zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of proteins that are implicated in regulation of the zzso zzso All family members share a zzso structural organization, zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 domain, a more divergent zzso central part, and a common zzso zzso region of about zzso zzso zzso Using chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso analyses of different truncated zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso region is both necessary and sufficient for zzso Moreover, zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso showed that the zzso region binds and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso to stress fibers in zzso zzso Analysis of the functional contribution of highly zzso blocks within this region indicated that zzso zzso of human zzso are essential for the interaction with zzso whereas zzso zzso are required for zzso probably via zzso zzso zzso with zzso are enhanced by zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso zzso segment is not only zzso in sequence but also forms a distinct functional zzso The data suggest that the zzso segment represents a novel zzso and zzso binding zzso
