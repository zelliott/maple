zzso zzso relevant to zzso cell wall components were zzso in order to understand the functional roles of such zzso A series of linear zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso zzso were zzso by chemical methods from readily available zzso building zzso Upon the synthesis of zzso constituted with a double zzso zzso zzso core and zzso fragments, biological studies were performed to identify the effect of synthetic zzso on the zzso formation and sliding zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed an zzso effect on the growth profile, but mostly on the zzso formation and zzso Similarly, synthetic compounds also influenced the sliding zzso of the zzso Further, zzso studies were zzso so as to identify the interactions of the zzso with a pulmonary zzso zzso namely zzso protein A zzso with the aid of the surface zzso resonance zzso zzso of each zzso interacting with zzso were thus zzso From this study, zzso were found to exhibit higher apparent association zzso than the corresponding zzso portion alone, without the double zzso zzso zzso zzso
