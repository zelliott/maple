The zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso possesses two regions in the zzso half of the protein that are enriched in basic zzso zzso Presumably, these basic regions are important for packaging the zzso zzso within the zzso of the zzso The zzso computer program identified the same regions as nuclear zzso signal zzso sequence zzso N protein zzso to the nucleus of infected zzso and zzso pulmonary zzso was observed following zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso with human zzso zzso serum identified the zzso as the primary site for N protein zzso within the zzso The zzso of the N protein in the absence of infection was studied by following zzso in zzso cells zzso with a zzso which expressed the zzso protein fused to an enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso Similar to infected cells, zzso localized to the zzso and the zzso zzso following the zzso of cells with zzso fused to truncated portions of the N gene identified a region containing the second basic stretch of zzso acids as the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso Another outcome following zzso was the rapid disappearance of cells that expressed high levels of zzso However, cell death did not correlate with zzso of zzso to the zzso
