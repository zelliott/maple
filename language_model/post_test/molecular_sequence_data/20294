Although most protein folding studies are carried out on zzso zzso over two-thirds of proteins in zzso are built up from multiple individually folded zzso A significant fraction of these zzso proteins are zzso zzso in which one guest domain is inserted into a surface loop of a host zzso zzso zzso and kinetic zzso between the two zzso can have a profound impact on their folding zzso Here we use an engineered mutually exclusive protein as a model system to directly illustrate one such complex dynamic process: the zzso process during protein zzso By inserting a guest protein zzso into a host protein zzso zzso we engineered a novel, mutually exclusive zzso zzso in which only one domain can remain folded at any given time due to zzso constraints imposed by the folded zzso Using zzso techniques, we obtained the first kinetic evidence that the guest and host zzso engage in a folding zzso as they attempt to fold, in which the host domain folds rapidly into its three-dimensional structure and is then automatically zzso driven by the folding of the guest zzso Our results provided direct evidence that protein folding can generate sufficient mechanical strain to unravel a host zzso Using zzso atomic force zzso we provide direct evidence for the existence of a zzso equilibrium between the two mutually exclusive zzso Our results highlight important roles played by the intricate zzso between folding zzso zzso stability, and mechanical strain in the folding of complex zzso zzso which cannot be addressed in traditional zzso protein folding zzso
