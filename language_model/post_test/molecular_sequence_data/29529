zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have recently shown that deletion of zzso in mice results in increased zzso of zzso cells during zzso leading to early embryonic zzso Here we describe the organization of the zzso gene and of its promoter zzso The zzso gene spans approximately 7 zzso and contains 8 zzso The zzso zzso regions of mouse and human zzso lack a zzso box and a zzso box, are highly zzso and contain potential zzso factor binding zzso Interestingly, sequence analysis of human zzso showed its zzso region contains the first zzso of another gene zzso in the zzso data zzso zzso on the opposite zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso region between both genes (54 zzso exhibits zzso promoter zzso However, deletion analysis demonstrated that zzso of both genes is regulated by different zzso zzso analysis and zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that two short zzso and zzso elements in the zzso region of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso are critical for the regulation of zzso zzso
