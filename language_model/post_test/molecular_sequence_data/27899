zzso clones from zzso zzso have been isolated by zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The largest one encodes a zzso zzso of 956 zzso acid zzso which exhibits a zzso of zzso with a limited protein sequence obtained from zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso and zzso Plant zzso 86, zzso 1988) and an zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 86, zzso It is therefore concluded that the zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a plasma membrane zzso Southern zzso zzso indicates that the plant zzso gene belongs to a zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso clones show that at least three zzso genes are expressed in root zzso
