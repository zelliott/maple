We zzso and zzso have introduced a human zzso zzso into mice zzso zzso contain 2 zzso variable zzso zzso zzso and zzso 10 diversity zzso 6 zzso joining zzso and either constant zzso or C zzso and C gamma gene zzso Several founder lines were established and studied before zzso zzso zzso transcripts were cloned and zzso from zzso zzso B zzso and zzso use was assessed before and after zzso In general, the repertoire was zzso in appearance with little evidence of zzso zzso in any gene zzso The two zzso gene segments were found rearranged to zzso and zzso C zzso with a preference of zzso We observed a preponderance of the zzso D gene zzso segments among the zzso transcripts zzso The zzso zzso use mimics most patterns seen in human zzso zzso in zzso was extensive and included clear examples of D zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that a human zzso zzso can undergo zzso processes in a manner analogous to that seen in the human zzso zzso This model, in addition to providing a potential source of human zzso zzso is ideal for the study of further questions concerning zzso zzso zzso
