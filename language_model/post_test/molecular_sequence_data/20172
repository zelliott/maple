The rough coat zzso an zzso zzso arose spontaneously in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice develop severe skin and hair zzso including zzso and progressive hair loss and zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus was previously mapped to zzso zzso To zzso the genetic basis underlying the zzso zzso development, we carried out zzso zzso and mapped the zzso locus to a zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso within a novel open reading frame in the zzso mice, which is predicted to zzso a cell zzso zzso with the highest zzso to zzso protein zero zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 zzso also called zzso zzso zzso We therefore named this gene zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso mice occurred at a highly zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso domain, thus likely altering the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses revealed expression of the zzso gene in various adult zzso including the zzso Using indirect zzso we detected zzso protein in the zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso from this study identified a novel gene zzso a predicted zzso protein whose zzso in the zzso mice likely caused the zzso zzso
