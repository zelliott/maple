zzso sequence alignment of zzso sequences of different zzso zzso shows that in each zzso there are two clusters of zzso zzso zzso The first is the well-known zzso cluster which includes six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that do not bind the zzso but belong to its immediate zzso The second cluster revealed here zzso zzso zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso is distant from the zzso It is entirely zzso and includes one turn zzso zzso zzso from each of zzso A, G, and zzso It is known that A, G, and H zzso formed at the earliest stage of zzso folding remain relatively stable in the equilibrium molten zzso state, and are likely to be tightly packed with each other in this zzso We have shown the existence of two similar zzso clusters in c zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso The second cluster in c zzso includes one turn from each of the N and zzso zzso These N and zzso zzso in zzso c are formed at the earliest stage of protein zzso remain relatively stable in the molten zzso state, and are tightly packed with each other in this state, similar to the observed behavior of the zzso At least these two large protein families zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a close similarity in the existence and mutual positions of zzso zzso zzso We assume that zzso zzso zzso are requisite for the fast and correct folding of both of these protein families into their stable zzso zzso
