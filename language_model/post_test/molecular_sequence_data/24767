A natural animal model for human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso The domestic cat has a high spontaneous occurrence of zzso zzso which is similar to the human disease in aggressiveness and zzso We have developed a cell line zzso from a zzso SCC of a zzso zzso were maintained in culture for greater than 50 zzso zzso had strong zzso zzso zzso weak zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso features included zzso filaments and zzso as well as features of zzso zzso zzso and nuclear margins, surface zzso and abnormal intermediate filament zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso with a zzso zzso number of zzso The cells grew zzso for 6 d until zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso and zzso the protein into the zzso Treatment of zzso with transforming growth zzso increased zzso production but did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to amplify a zzso pair region of zzso zzso zzso zzso portions of the zzso and coding zzso The complementary zzso acid zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequences had a high degree of zzso to human and canine zzso zzso was used to confirm alternate zzso of zzso zzso for translation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cell line will permit zzso experiments on genetic zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and development of an in zzso model for zzso zzso
