Grand zzso zzso zzso is a useful model system for studying the zzso molecular zzso and regulation of defensive zzso formation in zzso a process involving both the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in specialized zzso structures and the induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso by zzso cells at the site of zzso A zzso cloning strategy, employing zzso designed to zzso regions of existing zzso zzso and anticipated to amplify a zzso fragment, unexpectedly yielded a zzso zzso with sequence reminiscent of a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso as a zzso probe afforded four new, full-length zzso species from a wounded zzso stem zzso library that appeared to zzso four distinct zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, followed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and analysis of the zzso products by zzso phase gas zzso and mass zzso confirmed that these sequences zzso four new zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso that produces both zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences indicated these zzso to be zzso to zzso zzso in length (71 to 73 zzso and to be translated as zzso bearing an zzso zzso targeting sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso to delete the transit zzso allowed functional expression of the zzso forms of these zzso which exhibited no change in product outcome as a result of zzso zzso comparison revealed that these new zzso zzso from grand zzso are members of the zzso gene zzso and resemble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso more closely than mechanistically related zzso zzso from zzso zzso The availability of a nearly complete set of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from grand zzso (now zzso zzso will allow molecular dissection of the zzso defense response in this conifer species, and detailed study of zzso relationships among this large and diverse family of zzso all of which exploit the same zzso in the coupled zzso zzso
