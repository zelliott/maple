zzso specific toxins from zzso are powerful zzso used in the structural and functional characterization of different zzso of zzso which are thought to be the most diverse zzso zzso However, only a limited number of zzso toxins have been identified from zzso so zzso moreover, little is known about the mechanisms for the generation of a zzso zzso library in a zzso zzso of a zzso Here, we identified and characterized three new zzso zzso peptides from the scorpion zzso zzso zzso which were referred to as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two new members of zzso zzso and have been classified as zzso and zzso zzso zzso represents a new zzso of zzso specific toxins which was classified into zzso zzso was thus classified as zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso gene has two zzso interrupted by an zzso inserted in the signal zzso zzso region, whereas zzso (a close zzso of zzso gene was interrupted by two zzso located within the zzso of the gene and in the signal zzso zzso region, zzso zzso analysis for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso of the transcripts of zzso and zzso are much higher than that of zzso it suggests that the zzso in zzso could markedly increase the expression level of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso revealed that an alternative zzso event occurred at the zzso zzso 2 junction in the zzso of zzso zzso
