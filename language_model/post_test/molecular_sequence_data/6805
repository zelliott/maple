We have investigated the in zzso state of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of chronically zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in a high percentage of zzso but not in the plasma of these zzso By quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status in the zzso was characterized by extremely low or zzso levels of zzso or zzso spliced zzso and predominantly multiply spliced zzso Upon stimulation in zzso however, the larger zzso species and infectious virus production were rapidly induced in the zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that viral production was induced in association with differential increases in the levels of each multiply spliced zzso coding for zzso regulatory zzso From these results, we suggest that replication of zzso is blocked at an early stage of gene expression in zzso as described in zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso patients, and that zzso infection in cats may be a useful model for clinical zzso of zzso infection in zzso Moreover, we propose that the replication of zzso in zzso may be controlled by the differential expression of each multiply spliced zzso
