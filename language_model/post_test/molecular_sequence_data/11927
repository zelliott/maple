The structure of the zzso domain of the zzso coli zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso which is regarded as the contact site for zzso zzso proteins and for the promoter UP element, was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Its compact structure of four zzso and two long arms enclosing its zzso core shows a folding zzso distinct from those of other zzso zzso The UP element binding site was found on the surface zzso zzso 1, the zzso end of zzso 4, and the preceding zzso zzso experiments indicated that the contact sites for zzso zzso proteins are also on the same zzso
