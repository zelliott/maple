Two zzso zzso zzso that bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated from mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso were constructed by cloning the variable region sequences of the zzso connecting them in tandem with a zzso zzso zzso and expressing them in zzso coli using the zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso using zzso by virtue of a zzso sequence introduced to the zzso of the heavy chain variable region during the cloning zzso The secondary structure and zzso binding properties of the two zzso the parent zzso and zzso derived zzso fragments were examined using zzso zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso CD zzso of both zzso possessed predominantly beta character, as did those of the zzso and the zzso CD spectral data for zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso occurred upon zzso zzso The affinity zzso determined for the two zzso zzso and zzso were nearly zzso
