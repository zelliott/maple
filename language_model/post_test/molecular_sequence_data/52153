A restriction map of the zzso of zzso pneumoniae, a small human zzso zzso was constructed by means of an ordered zzso library which spans the complete bacterial zzso The positions of 143 zzso zzso restriction fragments were determined and aligned with the physical zzso In addition, restriction sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (13 zzso zzso (2 zzso and zzso (2 zzso were zzso The resulting map consists of 185 restriction sites, has a mean resolution of zzso zzso and predicts a zzso size of zzso zzso In addition, several genes were identified and mapped to their respective zzso zzso restriction zzso
