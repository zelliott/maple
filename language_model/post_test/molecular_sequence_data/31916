We report the construction and characterization of a zzso zzso library from the zzso zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso a commercially valuable tropical zzso A total of 288 clones were zzso and 250 unique sequences were zzso The zzso library showed a small sequence zzso zzso and high numbers of zzso zzso and independent clones zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso library generated in this study is a profitable resource for efficient gene discovery for zzso zzso zzso functional zzso by Gene zzso term assignment revealed the identification of sequences potentially involved in aquaculture and zzso relevant processes such as zzso growth, zzso zzso zzso development, response to stress and zzso
