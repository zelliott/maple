Small zzso binding zzso proteins of the zzso hand family play important roles in zzso and immune cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso and very zzso zzso binding zzso proteins of the zzso hand family, with possibly redundant zzso In particular, zzso has been proposed to be involved in B cell signaling and zzso zzso Little is known thus far about the expression of zzso on the single cell level in tissue sections or blood zzso Here we describe the generation of four specific zzso zzso zzso These recognize zzso and human zzso but not zzso zzso and their binding site maps to a region in the zzso part of zzso where zzso and zzso differ zzso Moreover, to detect zzso specifically, we also generated zzso zzso zzso making use of a singular zzso of the zzso part of the zzso Using zzso zzso we reveal two zzso pools in B cells, one at the membrane and one zzso zzso zzso of human peripheral blood zzso cells shows zzso expression in B cells but a zzso fold higher expression in zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso will be valuable to assess the real zzso zzso and expression level of zzso in healthy and diseased primary cells and zzso
