Epstein zzso zzso zzso plays a significant role as a zzso in the process of zzso and has consistently been associated with a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the most abundant viral transcripts in zzso zzso cells and their role in viral infection is still zzso zzso fixed zzso embedded zzso zzso of surgically removed zzso zzso are widely available form but have never been exploited for zzso studies previously in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso biopsy zzso remains the gold standard for proving zzso relationship in a zzso zzso but their zzso associated limitations confines their reliability in some zzso Recently introduced targeted drug delivery systems induce viral zzso gene expression and therefore require more sensitive method to zzso viral as well as cellular gene zzso 

Eight zzso zzso samples were screened to detect the zzso zzso zzso and quantitative expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso positive zzso tissue samples were then zzso by using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and real time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

In this study we have successfully zzso elevated zzso levels of both cellular and viral zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso specimens of Pakistani zzso 

These results indicate that zzso samples may retain viral as well as cellular zzso expression information at zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is first study which represents elevated zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso tissue samples of zzso zzso in zzso These observations will potentially improve current zzso in clinical as well as diagnostic practices in Pakistan and can be further exploited to develop new strategies for studying cellular and/or viral gene zzso
