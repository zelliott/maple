The zzso zzso zzso gene is a potential quantitative trait locus in dairy zzso In zzso the production of alpha LA is tightly coupled to the onset of zzso and it serves as a regulatory zzso of the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso controlling water movement in the zzso zzso To better understand the control of bovine alpha LA zzso the zzso region of a zzso alpha LA gene was cloned and zzso The zzso clone contains 1952 zzso of zzso region and zzso of the zzso zzso Three zzso zzso were identified within this zzso These zzso occur at positions zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso start point zzso The zzso and zzso variations occur in the region zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a silent zzso in the zzso region of the zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso zzso screening method has been employed to analyze the zzso of cattle at the zzso zzso A total of zzso randomly selected cattle from seven breeds were screened for this zzso Of these animals, only the zzso breed of cattle was found to contain the zzso variation and it occurs at a gene frequency of zzso zzso comparisons were conducted between the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and alpha zzso which are zzso zzso zzso of similarity extending to 350 zzso in length were observed between these zzso
