zzso sequences of a part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 3' untranslated region were studied among zzso zzso zzso orangutans and zzso An identical sequence to the human zzso zzso was found in chimpanzees and zzso whereas that to the zzso zzso was found in zzso Based on the sequence data and the zzso zzso zzso it was suggested that an zzso zzso at zzso position zzso 801 in humans and gorillas was independently introduced into each lineage after the specific divergence and an ancestral zzso sequence of this site zzso zzso was deduced as zzso The present data showing a zzso hot spot on this site suggest the possible presence of multiple origins of the worldwide distribution of the zzso zzso in zzso
