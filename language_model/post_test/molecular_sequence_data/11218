The primary mechanisms proposed for zzso zzso necrosis should zzso protein zzso either by zzso binding and zzso formation or by zzso reactions such as zzso However, in previous studies we did not detect significant losses of protein zzso contents in response to administration of zzso doses of zzso in zzso In the present study we employed zzso with the zzso agent zzso and separation of proteins by zzso to investigate the possible loss of specific protein zzso during the course of zzso zzso zzso zzso adult male mice were given zzso and protein zzso status was examined subsequently in zzso zzso isolated by differential zzso No decreases in protein zzso contents were zzso with the exception of a marked decrease in the fluorescent intensity, but not of protein content, as indicated by zzso with zzso blue, of a single band of approximately 130 zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This protein was identified by isolation and zzso sequence analysis as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were decreased in mice given zzso doses of zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso activities were lower, and plasma zzso levels were elevated in mice given zzso doses of zzso The observed zzso may contribute to the adverse effects of toxic doses of zzso and zzso of the specific mechanisms responsible for the zzso may prove to be useful zzso However, the preferential depletion of protein zzso content of a zzso protein by chemically zzso zzso generated in the zzso zzso presents a challenging and potentially zzso zzso zzso
