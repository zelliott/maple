Previous genetic analysis showed that the polar effects of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are dependent on the presence of a single putative zzso termination element within the zzso zzso In fact, all zzso zzso causing translation termination are strongly zzso whereas zzso ones are zzso The element was mapped by zzso zzso able to relieve the polar zzso and they were found to be small deletions in the region downstream of the zzso stop zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Roth, zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso in zzso in different strains harboring the polar zzso zzso zzso The nature of the polarity effects is clearly zzso since shorter zzso molecules were zzso When the zzso zzso was transferred in a zzso background or in strains harboring the small zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso was zzso The zzso termination element was characterized in more detail by performing high-resolution zzso zzso mapping zzso This analysis showed that zzso termination or zzso degradation following termination produced transcripts with zzso 3' ends; zzso this process is dependent on the zzso termination factor zzso since relief of termination occurs in a zzso background; and zzso the element appears to function as a zzso zzso at least to some extent, even in the course of active translation of the zzso zzso
