The complete zzso sequence of zzso segment 4 from the human group C zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso with the consensus zzso and 3' terminal zzso sequences of the human group C zzso zzso revealed characteristic zzso and 3' sequence zzso Human group C zzso zzso segment 4 is zzso long and encodes a single open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso starting at zzso 55 and terminating at zzso zzso giving a 3' untranslated region of 30 zzso zzso with the zzso group C zzso equivalent gene showed the human gene is one zzso acid longer, and that the proteins have zzso zzso acid sequence zzso A zzso potential zzso binding motif shared with the zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso with the group A zzso suggested that the zzso segment 4 encodes the group C zzso zzso
