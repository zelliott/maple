The mating reaction is triggered by specific zzso in a wide variety of zzso Small peptides are used as mating zzso in zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a C terminally zzso zzso zzso from zzso and its counterpart, zzso is a simple zzso composed of 23 zzso zzso The primary structure requirements for the biological activity of zzso peptides remain to be zzso Here, we conducted comprehensive substitution of each of the zzso acids in zzso zzso and inspected the mating ability of these zzso zzso Thirty-five sterile zzso were found among an array of 152 zzso with single zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso sites clearly indicated that the sterile zzso were associated exclusively with four zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast, the substitution of four zzso zzso zzso with any zzso acid had no or only a slightly deleterious effect on zzso Furthermore, deletion of the three zzso zzso caused no sterility, although zzso of a fourth zzso had a marked zzso We conclude that a zzso zzso zzso is the minimal zzso that retains zzso zzso At least 15 zzso peptides were found to be zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso peptides are no longer recognized by the zzso zzso
