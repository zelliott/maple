We recently isolated and characterized the 24 zzso and zzso 28 zzso zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso from the zzso rat zzso cell line zzso 129 (1991) zzso To examine the prevalence of zzso zzso by cells of neural origin, we assessed the expression of zzso in different neural cell types using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with relevant zzso A specific zzso zzso raised against a synthetic 20 zzso acid zzso was used for zzso zzso In all the neural cells tested zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso and primary fetal zzso zzso was definitively identified by zzso zzso zzso using a rat zzso probe revealed expression of zzso zzso transcripts by all these zzso Using a combination of the same techniques, expression of zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The zzso cells zzso primarily zzso zzso cells zzso predominantly zzso and small amount of zzso both primary zzso zzso and fetal zzso zzso zzso as the major zzso accompanied by a small quantity of zzso zzso was not identified in any of the cell zzso When zzso with the respective zzso zzso the zzso abundance generally reflected the media zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso was examined as well and compared to that of zzso and zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso were found in all gross anatomical divisions of the rat brain from embryonic day 15 until adulthood, whereas zzso was not detected at any zzso zzso zzso tended to be more abundant at the youngest ages whereas zzso increased during zzso These data indicate that zzso is produce by a variety of neural cell types and suggest that it may play a role in brain zzso
