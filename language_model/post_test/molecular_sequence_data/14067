Using a zzso library prepared from zzso zzso of the Mexican scorpion zzso zzso Hoffmann the genes that zzso toxins 1 and 2 were identified, cloned and zzso In view of the proposed mechanism for processing the mature peptides coded by these two zzso the corresponding zzso were zzso de zzso Mass zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso of both toxins indicated that the last zzso is zzso zzso comparison revealed that these two genes have a similarity of zzso and zzso at the zzso acid and zzso levels, zzso Small corrections to the published primary structures were zzso zzso toxin 1 has an extra zzso zzso at position 65 and the zzso in position 60 is a zzso while the zzso acids at positions 34 and 35 of zzso 2 are, respectively, zzso and zzso zzso comparison of toxins from the zzso zzso suggests the presence of at least three classes of distinct peptides in these zzso
