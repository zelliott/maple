In zzso coli synthesis of several proteins is zzso depressed upon heat shock zzso A comparison of zzso sequences of the genes zzso these proteins revealed the occurrence of a consensus zzso zzso in their translation start signal zzso To examine whether this sequence is involved in heat zzso depression of protein zzso DNA segments corresponding to this region of four of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and each of them was fused in frame with the zzso gene on the open reading frame zzso zzso The effect of heat shock on the synthesis of zzso zzso by these fused genes was then studied in zzso zzso It was thus found that zzso synthesis starting from the inserted translation start signal was arrested zzso upon temperature zzso from 30 to 42 degrees zzso I conclude that the heat zzso depression of gene expression is an event taking place at the initiation of zzso
