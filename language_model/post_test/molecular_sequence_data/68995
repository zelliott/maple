zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso control of gene expression in animals, plants, and zzso It has been assumed that all zzso in zzso is at symmetrical sequences such as zzso because this can explain perpetuation of zzso zzso Here the zzso zzso sequencing method was used to examine zzso in DNA from a zzso gene exposed to zzso point zzso zzso was not limited to symmetrical sites and individual molecules showed different patterns and amounts of zzso The zzso extended beyond the zzso region and even beyond the edge of the duplicated zzso
