A zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli in a soluble form as native zzso zzso A significant fraction of the precursor was spontaneously zzso producing the zzso zzso and the mature zzso A strong zzso of the mature zzso by its own zzso in the crude zzso was observed even in the absence of the zzso linkage between zzso zzso zzso zzso and the mature zzso were isolated and kinetic parameters of the mature zzso zzso by the zzso were zzso The zzso is of the zzso competitive type with Ki zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso was much weaker or zzso
