The zzso zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in circulating zzso and zzso We report here an zzso between the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso and sequences within the plasma zzso high molecular weight zzso zzso which are involved in binding to zzso charged surfaces such as zzso zzso also binds to zzso and is competitively inhibited by zzso and by peptides corresponding to zzso tail and the zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and the tail zzso inhibit the zzso cascade in zzso giving functional relevance to the zzso between zzso and zzso At inflammatory sites, zzso is zzso to areas of close contact between zzso cells and zzso The results of this study identify a potential binding region in zzso and suggest that it could function by interfering with zzso formation at sites of zzso zzso zzso
