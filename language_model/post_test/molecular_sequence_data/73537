zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso coli zzso results in an approximately zzso ratio of zzso zzso proteins and zzso In this work we characterize zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso Previously, the main target of zzso of zzso into zzso proteins was shown to be zzso which is also part of the one strong binding site of zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso on zzso zzso map exclusively to the central loop of domain V zzso zzso and zzso which is part of the zzso zzso zzso However, experiments performed with zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso activity is not affected by zzso zzso solely to the zzso zzso Three different positions are zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The positions of these zzso zzso correlate well with zzso on the zzso zzso produced either by zzso or the protein zzso This suggests that the zzso are zzso by zzso bound to the strong binding site on the zzso zzso In addition, our results demonstrate that the well known zzso of zzso binding to the zzso is solely due to zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso suggest that interactions of the zzso with zzso zzso might be involved in its mode of zzso
