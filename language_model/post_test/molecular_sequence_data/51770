The zzso acid sequences of two zzso zzso of complex I from bovine heart zzso have been zzso Both proteins have an apparent molecular weight of zzso zzso and their zzso groups are zzso They are known as zzso zzso and zzso Neither protein is evidently related to any known protein and their functions are zzso A total of 34 zzso zzso of bovine complex I have now been zzso and it is thought that the primary structure of the complex is now complete, although with such a complicated structure it is difficult to be certain that there are no other zzso remaining to be zzso Seven additional zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso in zzso DNA, and therefore bovine heart complex I is an assembly of about 41 different zzso If it is assumed that there is one copy of each protein in the zzso these zzso contain zzso zzso acids in their zzso more than are found in the zzso coli zzso which contains zzso zzso acids in its 32 zzso
