Much remains unknown of the zzso and evolution of zzso zzso an zzso that kills 2 million people zzso Using a zzso approach that analyzes multiple zzso around the zzso we demonstrate that neutral genetic variation in genes associated with zzso drug resistance has sufficient variation to construct a robust zzso tree for zzso zzso The data describe a zzso population with a minimum of four distinct zzso tuberculosis zzso closely related to zzso zzso The lineages are strongly geographically zzso zzso zzso proven to cause drug resistance are distributed throughout the tree, whereas zzso base zzso unrelated to drug resistance have a restricted zzso The zzso structure is zzso with all the previously described zzso and zzso groupings of zzso tuberculosis strains and provides a unifying framework for both zzso and evolutionary analysis of zzso tuberculosis zzso
