A zzso zzso a zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated through random sequencing of a zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence possesses the 12 strictly zzso zzso acids around zzso 52 zzso to zzso 50 or 51 in other zzso A single zzso band was detected in Northern zzso zzso In synchronized zzso zzso cells, the transcript level peaked at early zzso and decreased dramatically on the entry to S zzso Although this has not been previously reported, studies of budding zzso zzso zzso and certain zzso cell types suggest a role for zzso in the zzso transition of the zzso cell zzso zzso trees constructed with 26 other published zzso sequences suggest that zzso while falling within the zzso zzso forms a lineage separate from those of the plants, animals, and zzso The zzso modification of zzso by a transfer of a zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso 50 or 51, forming zzso acid zzso is the only demonstrated specific function of zzso in cell zzso It has been suggested that zzso stimulate population growth of zzso zzso in the zzso We demonstrate here zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the specific zzso inhibitor zzso exhibited zzso effects in two species of zzso The possible links of zzso and zzso synthesis to the zzso cycle are also zzso
