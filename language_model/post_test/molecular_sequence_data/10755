With efficient zzso zzso in zzso zzso a rapid in zzso cloning technique has been zzso Here we demonstrated that 30 zzso of a zzso sequence at each end of a DNA zzso is sufficient to integrate the zzso into a zzso zzso in zzso To obtain a high yield of zzso zzso however, more than 60 zzso are zzso Interestingly, we observed that 20 zzso of zzso at one end of a DNA zzso is sufficient for efficient zzso provided that the other end contains 80 zzso of zzso zzso Some applications, including zzso transferring of zzso zzso to the zzso expression systems for the Human Genome Project, are zzso
