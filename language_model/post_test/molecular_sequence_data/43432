To determine the key position for the unusual stability of zzso zzso from extreme zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence comparisons were carried zzso As a result, a motif which is characteristic to the zzso zzso was found between two highly zzso zzso The sequence motif was introduced into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one by zzso zzso to our zzso introduction of the whole motif led the zzso zzso to be more unstable whereas substitution of only one zzso acid zzso in the motif zzso the zzso From the zzso structure of the zzso a mechanism for the zzso is zzso
