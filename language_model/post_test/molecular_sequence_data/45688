zzso and zzso are two highly similar zzso DNA zzso which are each zzso by a group I zzso inserted into zzso sites within the DNA zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we present a comparison of the DNA zzso and zzso activities of these zzso with zzso target zzso zzso has properties that are typical of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso genes in either host zzso three zzso downstream of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso nicks both the zzso and zzso site in its own host zzso but does not act on the target from Bastille zzso Although the zzso have distinct DNA zzso zzso both bind to an identical zzso region of their respective zzso DNA zzso genes surrounding the zzso zzso zzso The zzso appear to interact with the DNA zzso in the downstream zzso 2 in a similar zzso However, whereas zzso is known to make its only zzso contacts within this zzso region, structural modeling analyses predict that zzso might make specific base contacts both upstream and downstream of the site of zzso zzso The predicted requirement for zzso contacts in zzso 1 for zzso by zzso was confirmed zzso This explains the difference in zzso zzso between the two zzso including the observation that the former zzso is relatively insensitive to the presence of an zzso upstream of zzso zzso These differences are likely a consequence of divergent evolutionary zzso
