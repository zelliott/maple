zzso zzso zzso causes black zzso the most important disease in bananas and zzso Disease control is mainly through the application of systemic zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso Their intensive use has zzso the appearance of resistant zzso However, no studies have been published on the possible resistance zzso 

In this work, the zzso gene was isolated and zzso in 11 zzso zzso strains that had shown different degrees of in zzso sensitivity to zzso one of the most widely used zzso zzso Six zzso that could be related to the loss in sensitivity to this zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were zzso using a zzso model of the protein that was constructed from the zzso structure of zzso tuberculosis zzso Lehmann & zzso Additionally, gene expression was determined in 13 zzso zzso strains through quantitative analysis of products obtained by zzso 

Several changes in the sequence of the gene zzso zzso zzso were found that have been described in other zzso as being correlated with resistance to zzso zzso No correlation was found between gene expression and zzso zzso
