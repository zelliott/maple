Certain major zzso complex zzso class I zzso are strongly associated with control of human zzso virus and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso T cells specific for zzso restricted by these molecules may be particularly zzso zzso how zzso T cells contribute to control of viral replication should yield important insights for vaccine zzso We have recently identified an Indian zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso associated with elite control and low plasma zzso after infection with the zzso isolate zzso Here, we infected four zzso zzso with zzso to investigate why some of these zzso control viral zzso Three of the four zzso controlled zzso replication with plasma virus zzso below 20,000 viral zzso zzso at 20 weeks zzso two of four zzso were elite controllers zzso Interestingly, two of the four zzso preserved their zzso memory T zzso during peak zzso and all four recovered their zzso memory T zzso in the chronic phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso responses dominated the acute phase and accounted for zzso to zzso of the total zzso immune zzso Additionally, the zzso mounted strong and broad zzso zzso responses against several zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells accounted for the majority of zzso in the virus at 18 weeks zzso Interestingly, patterns of viral variation in zzso differed between the zzso and the other two zzso Natural zzso of AIDS virus replication in zzso zzso may, therefore, be related to a combination of zzso and viral escape from zzso zzso zzso
