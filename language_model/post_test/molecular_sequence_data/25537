The zzso nuclear envelope protein zzso is located at the nuclear pores and mediates its essential function via the zzso zzso The passenger zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso was fused to the 220 zzso long zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso this zzso protein was tightly associated with nuclear structures and was localized at the nuclear periphery very similar to authentic zzso Furthermore, the zzso fusion protein was able to complement a zzso zzso lacking a functional zzso gene showing that zzso zzso the same basic function as compared to the zzso zzso zzso These data also show that the zzso protein is composed of separate functional zzso a zzso domain that is sufficient to mediate the association with the nuclear periphery and an zzso and middle repetitive domain with an as yet unknown zzso It is suggested that zzso repeats found in the zzso zzso domain, which are similar to those found in intermediate filament zzso are crucial for zzso the association with the nuclear zzso
