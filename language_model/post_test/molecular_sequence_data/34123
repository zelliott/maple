zzso of the zzso precursor zzso acid zzso is a key zzso trait found in many plant zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso genes zzso of bacterial zzso colonizing zzso potato zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of two types of zzso zzso the dominant one showing high zzso to an zzso gene derived from zzso zzso Construction, functional screening and sequence analysis of zzso libraries revealed clones containing the zzso gene identified in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of one zzso clone identified the entire zzso zzso of an zzso zzso and revealed that the zzso gene is coupled upstream with an zzso zzso regulator gene as previously found in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and Glick zzso However, zzso analysis of 195 fully zzso zzso bacterial zzso revealed that the majority of zzso including numerous strains belonging to the zzso zzso do not contain an zzso regulatory gene in the vicinity of the zzso gene or elsewhere in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was exclusively found in several zzso and zzso most prominently in the zzso zzso
