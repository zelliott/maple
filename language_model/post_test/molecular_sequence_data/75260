To isolate zzso clones of zzso zzso expressed in monkey cerebral zzso but absent from zzso we developed an improved zzso zzso cloning procedure that requires only modest quantities of zzso zzso DNA from a monkey zzso zzso library was zzso in large excess to zzso monkey zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso on zzso and used to probe colonies from a monkey zzso zzso zzso Of 60,000 colonies screened, zzso clones were isolated and confirmed by colony zzso or zzso zzso to represent zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso specific to or highly enriched in cerebral zzso relative to zzso zzso of one zzso zzso were recovered almost zzso Two of the zzso zzso were expressed at levels reduced by a factor of 10 in zzso disease relative to normal human zzso One of these was identified as the monkey zzso I zzso
