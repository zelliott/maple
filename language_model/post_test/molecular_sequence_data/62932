The beta zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of zzso hormone zzso were cloned from Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These three zzso hormone beta zzso possess the main characteristics common to their counterparts in other zzso Taking advantage of the zzso position of the zzso close to the root of zzso a maximum zzso tree was zzso from these new sequences and sequences from representatives of the diversity of zzso The zzso of the tree was imposed so that it reflected as closely as possible the real evolutionary history of the zzso This tree was used to estimate the relative evolution rate of the three zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the species zzso were calculated and zzso It showed that a burst in evolutionary rate occurred for the zzso zzso in the zzso lineage sometime after the emergence of zzso The rate of evolution of the zzso zzso was particularly high throughout the radiation of zzso while zzso and zzso zzso kept quite stable in this zzso A burst in evolutionary rate was also observed for the zzso zzso in the lineage leading to zzso sometime after the emergence of zzso and the dynamic of evolution was high throughout the radiation of zzso These results were consistent with data obtained from zzso zzso
