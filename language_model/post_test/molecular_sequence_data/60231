The zzso zzso zzso zzso is being engineered by the introduction of zzso zzso genes in an attempt to improve the zzso of plant material in zzso However, relatively little is known about the diversity and distribution of the native zzso genes in strains of zzso zzso In order to identify the most appropriate hosts for such zzso the zzso zzso of 28 strains from the three zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso Only 4 of the 20 strains from zzso zzso group 2 contained zzso of the strain zzso zzso zzso However, these four zzso zzso and two other group 2 zzso contained members of a second zzso gene family clearly related to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a second previously described zzso gene from zzso zzso were identified only in three of the seven group 1 strains and not in the group 2 and 3 zzso However, six of the group 1 strains contained one or more members of the two zzso of zzso of zzso The distribution of genes and the zzso sequence relationships between the members of the two zzso zzso are consistent with the zzso of all strains of zzso zzso having contained a zzso zzso I zzso Since many zzso strains of zzso zzso did not contain members of either of the zzso zzso or of the zzso family, at least one additional zzso gene family remains to be identified in zzso zzso
