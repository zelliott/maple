To correlate zzso with response to early copper zzso therapy in zzso disease, an zzso disorder of copper zzso we performed zzso analysis in 2 related males who began treatment at the age of 10 days and zzso at 32 zzso zzso zzso A G to T zzso at the zzso zzso position of a zzso donor site was identified, predicting a zzso to zzso substitution at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso proper zzso and generates five zzso transcripts that skip from one to four zzso None of these transcripts is predicted to zzso a functional copper transport zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso circulating copper and zzso levels but did not improve the baseline zzso of zzso a zzso zzso At the age of 36 months, the first patient was living and had zzso abilities ranging from 10 to 15 zzso The second patient also showed delayed zzso and died of pulmonary complications at the age of 5 1/2 zzso We conclude that early copper zzso therapy does not zzso neurological outcome in patients with the zzso zzso zzso and suggest that preservation of some residual zzso zzso activity may be a general prerequisite for significant clinical efficacy from such zzso
