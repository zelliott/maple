zzso zzso zzso has multiple zzso roles zzso by G protein coupled receptors designated zzso or zzso zzso Evidence supports an important role for the zzso zzso in regulating zzso vascular tone and zzso zzso 

The full-length rabbit zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso with seven zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the cloned rabbit zzso exhibited specific zzso binding with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was displaced by zzso zzso in the following order: zzso zzso of zzso was also displaced by zzso zzso zzso selective zzso with a rank order of affinity consistent with the zzso zzso zzso zzso free acid produced a zzso increase in zzso zzso in rabbit zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso effective concentration of zzso zzso zzso protection zzso revealed high expression in the zzso zzso and liver with lower expression in the zzso zzso heart, zzso adrenal zzso and skeletal zzso In zzso zzso localized zzso zzso to the zzso zzso but showed no distinct zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expression along the zzso was determined by zzso and its expression was present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso In cultured cells zzso zzso was not detected in collecting ducts but was detected in zzso zzso cells and vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso zzso and zzso vessels of the zzso 

zzso expression pattern is consistent with the known functional roles for zzso coupled zzso effects in zzso and vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso It remains uncertain whether it is also expressed in zzso zzso
