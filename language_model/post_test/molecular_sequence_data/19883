zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso channels that mediate the fast actions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are of interest as they are targets of zzso zzso and drugs that control zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of zzso a candidate zzso zzso from the blood fluke, zzso zzso which is the third zzso zzso zzso to be zzso While zzso possesses key structural features common to all zzso its zzso acid sequence shares considerably low identity with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In particular, the second zzso domain of zzso which lines the zzso channel, bears unusual zzso acid zzso which will likely give rise to a zzso with distinct functional zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso is a divergent zzso zzso that may define a zzso of zzso zzso We discuss our findings in the context of potentially exploiting this zzso as a target for controlling zzso zzso
