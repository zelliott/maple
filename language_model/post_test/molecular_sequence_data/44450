The family of zzso zzso representing repeats in the structural zzso toxins is composed of several protein toxins with a characteristic zzso zzso repeat zzso Most of its members were shown to have zzso zzso By comparing the genetic relationships of the zzso toxin genes we established a set of 10 gene zzso to be used for screening zzso zzso toxin genes in bacterial zzso The zzso include parts of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso coli, zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso A panel of zzso and zzso zzso bacteria were investigated for the presence of zzso toxin zzso The zzso detected all known genes for zzso zzso Moreover, we found potential zzso toxin genes in several zzso bacterial species for which no such toxins are known zzso This indicates that zzso or zzso toxins are widely distributed among zzso zzso zzso The zzso generated by zzso and the zzso method were zzso to allow zzso screening for zzso toxin genes in one zzso This included the binding of zzso zzso to a nylon filter and subsequent zzso of the filter with zzso zzso DNA of the strain to be zzso The method constitutes a powerful tool for the assessment of the potential zzso of poorly characterized strains intended to be used in zzso zzso Moreover, it is useful for the detection of zzso or new zzso toxin genes in bacteria of medical zzso
