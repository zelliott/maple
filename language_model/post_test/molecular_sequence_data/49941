Comparative zzso analysis of pea zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested a similar function for the zzso and zzso genes in early stages of root zzso zzso Both the pea and zzso zzso zzso are zzso but normal in their zzso zzso zzso Both are characterized by excessive root hair zzso in response to the bacterial zzso lack of infection thread zzso and absence of cortical cell zzso To investigate the molecular basis for the zzso we cloned and zzso the zzso zzso taking advantage of sequence information from the previously cloned zzso zzso An zzso analysis on zzso zzso lines mapped zzso to the same zzso arm as the zzso locus and direct evidence demonstrating that zzso is the zzso gene was subsequently obtained by zzso analysis and sequencing of three independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pea root zzso develop through different zzso zzso so it was of interest to compare the expression of the two zzso genes during zzso zzso Overall, a similar zzso regulation of the zzso and zzso genes was shown by the zzso zzso in root zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In the indeterminate pea zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso cells of zone I and in the cells of infection zone II, corroborating expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso At the protein level, seven zzso including the putative DNA zzso zzso motif and the zzso zzso domain, are zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
