We have shown that zzso of zzso can rescue sympathetic zzso from nerve growth factor deprivation in zzso We have also examined the distribution and expression of zzso zzso in the developing and adult nervous system using Northern zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso is widespread during development of the nervous zzso In embryonic spinal cord, zzso levels increase at the beginning of the naturally occurring cell death period, suggesting that zzso may be involved in the selection of zzso during this zzso In the brain, zzso expression increases after birth to reach a high level in the adult zzso zzso from the cortex, zzso bulb, and zzso cells are among those expressing the highest levels of zzso zzso The widespread expression of zzso during development and in adult brain suggests of a role for zzso beyond simply protecting zzso from zzso cell zzso
