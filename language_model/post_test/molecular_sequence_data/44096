zzso is a zzso in the cellular immune zzso It increases the zzso of association between a T cell and an zzso cell by interacting with zzso portions of the complex between class II major zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and it contributes directly to signal zzso through its zzso association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso also serves as the zzso zzso for cellular attachment and entry of the human zzso virus zzso The zzso portion of zzso comprises four zzso zzso zzso This part of human zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as a zzso soluble protein zzso and crystal structures have been described for the human zzso zzso and for the rat zzso zzso We have now determined the structures of intact zzso in three crystal zzso These structures have a zzso zzso at the zzso to zzso junction that might be important in immune recognition and zzso fusion, and a common zzso association through zzso zzso Dynamic light scattering zzso and chemical zzso of zzso corroborate zzso at high protein zzso We suggest that such zzso zzso relevance as zzso of signal zzso in T zzso
