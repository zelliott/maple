Three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated as zzso for zzso DNA zzso The results reveal that zzso DNA zzso is an efficient catalyst for template directed synthesis of DNA zzso duplexes containing a large number of zzso zzso by primer extension zzso Furthermore, zzso DNA zzso is shown to be suitable for the zzso amplification of an zzso DNA zzso
