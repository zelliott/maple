zzso zzso a zzso zzso pathogen of zzso is endemic in several areas of the United zzso Many geographic zzso of zzso zzso that occur in the United States are characterized by the major surface protein zzso which varies in sequence and molecular weight due to different numbers of tandem repeats of 28 or 29 zzso zzso Recent studies zzso zzso Palmer, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001) of an zzso zzso zzso of cattle in an area of zzso demonstrated that multiple zzso zzso were present but that only one zzso was found per individual zzso These findings suggested that infection of cattle with other zzso was zzso The present study was undertaken to confirm the phenomenon of infection exclusion of zzso zzso zzso in infected bovine zzso and cultured tick zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso one from Virginia and one from Oklahoma, were used for these zzso In two separate trials, cattle zzso with equal doses of the two zzso developed infection with only one zzso zzso cell cultures zzso with equal doses of the two zzso became infected with only the Virginia isolate of zzso zzso When cultures were zzso with different ratios of the Oklahoma and Virginia zzso of zzso zzso the isolate zzso in the higher ratio became established and excluded infection with the zzso When cultures with established infections of one isolate were subsequently infected with the other, only the established isolate was zzso We documented infection exclusion during initial infection in cell culture by labeling each isolate with a different fluorescent zzso After 2 days in culture, only a single isolate was detected per cell by zzso zzso Finally, when zzso zzso infections were established in cultures that were subsequently zzso with the Virginia or Oklahoma isolate of zzso zzso zzso zzso infection was zzso These studies confirm that infection exclusion occurs with zzso zzso in bovine zzso and tick cells, resulting in the establishment of only one zzso and appears to be the first report of infection exclusion for zzso and zzso zzso
