The predicted full-length zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene was characterized by assembling pig zzso from zzso The coding sequence zzso shares high sequence identity with the corresponding sequences of human zzso and mouse zzso The reverse zzso chain reaction zzso displayed that zzso zzso gene is expressed in all eight zzso zzso small zzso stomach, heart, zzso zzso muscle and zzso Analysis of the zzso cell hybrid panel zzso and the zzso of Minnesota zzso radiation hybrid zzso panel indicated the gene maps to zzso zzso zzso and most closely links to the zzso zzso zzso One zzso deletion zzso in the 3' untranslated region zzso detected by zzso strand zzso zzso zzso analysis shows zzso frequency differences between zzso zzso Black, zzso zzso Tibetan, zzso Large White and zzso The association analysis using pigs of zzso zzso zzso zzso White zzso zzso and Large White zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the deletion zzso was associated with the zzso muscle pH zzso
