zzso diversity at the highly zzso zzso locus was investigated by DNA sequence analyses of 18 African cattle from two breeds representing the two subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was compared with that found in a sample of 32 European cattle from four breeds, all classified as zzso zzso zzso Particularly extensive genetic diversity was found among African zzso in which as many as 18 zzso were recognized in this small random sample of animals from two zzso The observed similarity in zzso frequency distribution between the two African zzso zzso and zzso zzso is consistent with the recent recognition of gene flow between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cattle in zzso A total of 30 zzso zzso were documented and as many as 26 of these were classified as major zzso types showing at least five zzso acid zzso compared with other major zzso The observation of extensive genetic diversity at zzso zzso in zzso as well as in other farm animals, provides a compelling argument against zzso preferences as a primary cause in maintaining major zzso complex diversity, since the reproduction of these animals has been controlled by humans for many zzso
