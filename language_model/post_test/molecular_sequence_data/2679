zzso zzso in North Africa is frequently associated with the alpha zzso zzso zzso characterized by an abnormal alpha I zzso instead of the normal alpha I zzso zzso following limited zzso zzso of whole zzso A similar zzso (although it yielded a zzso zzso has been shown recently, in two black patients, to result from the zzso of a zzso zzso at position 148 zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine if the underlying molecular zzso was the same in North Africans and blacks (who originate from both sides of the zzso zzso we performed analysis directly at the DNA zzso Starting from the DNA of an Algerian alpha zzso zzso in whom the zzso was associated with identifiable zzso we cloned and zzso the zzso gene region, which includes the zzso We thus identified an extra zzso zzso zzso between zzso 147 and zzso the coding sequence becoming zzso zzso zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso zzso We then used the zzso chain reaction zzso method and zzso zzso of the amplified DNA with zzso and normal zzso zzso to screen the DNA from four other unrelated North African subjects with zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso In all families we zzso these subjects were zzso for the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso has the same molecular basis in North Africans and zzso
