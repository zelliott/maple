A zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from traditional zzso in zzso Province, zzso The zzso was characterized by a zzso approach, including zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso gene sequence analysis, fatty acid zzso zzso zzso analysis, determination of DNA zzso content, zzso zzso and an analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, zzso zzso gene sequence similarities and zzso zzso gene sequence similarities to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based upon the data obtained in the present study, a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed and the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
