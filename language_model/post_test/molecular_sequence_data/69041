zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso via a zzso zzso zzso The formation of this zzso radical in zzso requires an zzso system composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a reduced zzso zzso and zzso as an zzso zzso The need for large quantities of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso studies on the mechanism of protein radical formation has prompted us to clone the act gene and zzso the gene product in zzso zzso Using zzso technology, the act gene was isolated and zzso into various expression zzso The zzso of the protein was as high as zzso of the total cellular zzso However, the majority of the protein resided in the form of zzso inclusion zzso A procedure was developed to zzso and isolate the inclusion bodies followed by zzso under zzso zzso This zzso method zzso 5 zzso of zzso protein from 1 g of zzso zzso characterization demonstrated that the zzso can bind one zzso per protein zzso and the protein did not exhibit any visible zzso as previously zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso into the protein with similar zzso zzso studies showed that the rate of radical formation was independent of zzso strength and the zzso for SAM and inactive zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso Fluorescent binding data revealed that the zzso for SAM binding to the zzso zzso alone was comparable to the zzso for SAM in the zzso zzso indicating that the binding site for SAM resides on zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
