The common virus integration site zzso zzso was recently identified within the gene zzso the zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso zzso (also referred to as zzso Here we show that zzso is a frequent target zzso for zzso of zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso in primary tumors in zzso zzso Multiple zzso insertions in zzso were cloned and shown to be located within the 3' untranslated region of the candidate zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in the zzso gene is an important step in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To isolate zzso collaborating zzso we searched for novel common zzso in the zzso zzso primary tumors and identified a novel frequent common zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso primary tumors contained insertions in zzso as well, which suggests cooperative action of the target genes in these two common zzso in zzso By zzso zzso analysis it was shown that zzso resides on mouse zzso 10 in a region that shares zzso with human zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is located upstream of the gene zzso the molecular zzso zzso which was previously mapped to mouse zzso 10 and human zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a candidate target gene for zzso zzso or zzso in zzso However, Northern and Western zzso analyses did not provide evidence that zzso zzso had altered the expression of zzso Additional studies are required to determine whether zzso or another candidate zzso in zzso is involved in zzso
