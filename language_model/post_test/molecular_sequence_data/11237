We have isolated by zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso and zzso library screening a zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a strongly zzso transcript from birch zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis suggests that it encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the first one isolated from zzso The isolated birch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso bases zzso a 364 zzso acid zzso The deduced protein is zzso similar to bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence to known zzso zzso proteins and the existence of an zzso stop zzso upstream of the initiation zzso suggest that the isolated zzso is zzso Southern zzso analysis of birch zzso DNA shows that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso during zzso stress imposed by ozone is zzso already at 2 h and it is at maximum zzso 12 h after the beginning of an 8 h ozone exposure zzso zzso A second zzso peak at zzso h did not increase transcript levels zzso zzso exposure for 2 h was sufficient for zzso zzso Birch zzso transcript levels remain at moderately low level during leaf development and is lower in roots and leaves when compared to young shoots undergoing wood formation and zzso
