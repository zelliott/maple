zzso zzso zzso zzso is an economically important fish in zzso However, zzso research on this species is still in its zzso and zzso resources are largely zzso In order to isolate functional genes involved in zzso a zzso zzso library was constructed from the zzso of the zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso from the library were zzso and compared with sequences in the zzso zzso The zzso high-quality zzso were assembled into zzso zzso Based on sequence similarities, 193 immune genes were identified such as major zzso complex, zzso and zzso zzso adhesive zzso stress zzso zzso factors for immune response, zzso and zzso zzso Our study thus provides both a detailed zzso of immune genes in zzso zzso and a collection of novel transcripts of zzso zzso 5 in zzso for the first zzso
