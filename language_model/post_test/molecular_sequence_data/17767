zzso findings are presented in 17 unrelated patients with a form of zzso dominant zzso zzso and the same C to A zzso in zzso 23 of the zzso zzso These patients zzso age, zzso zzso had, on average, significantly better visual acuity and larger zzso zzso than 131 unrelated patients zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso dominant zzso zzso without this zzso These 17 patients from separate families as well as 11 relatives with the zzso from 4 of these families showed zzso and zzso zzso with respect to severity of their zzso zzso This clinical zzso among patients with the same zzso with older patients sometimes showing less loss of visual function and less zzso bone zzso zzso than younger patients, suggests that some factor other than the gene zzso itself is involved in the expression of this zzso This form of zzso zzso can now be detected by testing zzso DNA from peripheral zzso Patients so identified should have an zzso examination to determine the extent of their disease in view of the clinical zzso that exists among patients with this zzso Some mechanisms by which this zzso in the zzso gene could lead to zzso cell death are zzso Opportunities for future clinical and laboratory research in search of possible treatments are zzso
