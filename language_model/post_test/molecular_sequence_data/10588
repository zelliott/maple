zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso in human kidney zzso zzso cells was found in the present study to inhibit the subsequent ability of insulin to stimulate the zzso zzso of an expressed insulin zzso zzso This zzso was also observed in an in zzso zzso reaction if the insulin zzso and its zzso were both isolated from cells in which the protein zzso C had been zzso To test whether zzso zzso of the insulin zzso zzso was contributing to this process, zzso zzso of this zzso was changed to an zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the associated zzso zzso activity of the expressed zzso were found to be comparable to those of the expressed zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso nor its subsequent association with zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of in zzso labeled zzso and the zzso zzso revealed that zzso stimulates the zzso of a zzso from zzso zzso that is absent from the zzso zzso maps of the zzso zzso Moreover, a synthetic zzso containing this zzso and its nearby zzso was found to be zzso by the insulin zzso to a much lower extent than the same zzso without the zzso zzso of protein zzso C was found to stimulate by zzso the ability of a zzso zzso to zzso this synthetic zzso as well as the intact insulin zzso zzso Finally, zzso extracts from the zzso of zzso mice showed an zzso increase in a zzso activity capable of zzso this synthetic zzso compared to extracts of zzso from lean litter zzso These results indicate that zzso of protein zzso C stimulates a zzso which can zzso insulin zzso zzso at zzso zzso resulting in an zzso of insulin signaling in the cell, posing a potential mechanism for insulin resistance in some models of zzso
