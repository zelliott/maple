zzso detection zzso are prone to zzso by substances present in environmental samples, thereby potentially leading to inaccurate target zzso or zzso zzso Internal amplification controls zzso have been developed to help alleviate this problem but are generally applied in a single zzso thereby yielding zzso results across the wide range of microbial gene target zzso possible in environmental samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cook, zzso Wagner, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso for each quantitative zzso zzso sample individually, however, typically reduces sensitivity and, more importantly, the reliability of zzso Fortunately, current advances in zzso zzso platforms offer the possibility of multiple reactions for a single sample zzso thereby allowing the zzso of more than one zzso concentration per zzso Here, we describe the development of a novel zzso approach that is specifically designed for the state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso Different zzso targets were applied at a range of zzso yielding a zzso zzso curve for each individual DNA zzso The developed zzso were zzso tested, and validated by using more than 5,000 unique zzso zzso allowing accurate zzso of zzso when applied to soil DNA extracts containing various levels of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study using a suite of zzso at different target zzso to monitor zzso zzso across a wide target range, thereby allowing reliable and accurate zzso of zzso in zzso DNA zzso The developed zzso is zzso suited for zzso screenings of, for example, ecological and agricultural samples on next-generation zzso zzso
