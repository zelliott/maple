Previous studies have identified the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso which play a role in the control of cell proliferation and zzso Through data base analyses and zzso we have identified a human zzso zzso that shows significant zzso to the known zzso zzso family zzso Northern zzso has shown expression of this gene in a number of zzso including brain, liver, and muscle, with two transcripts being apparent zzso and zzso zzso In addition, expression was observed in cell lines including those derived from a number of zzso tumors such as the zzso zzso cell line zzso We have also demonstrated that zzso which was shown to be an active zzso zzso is induced in response to zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we have demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso blocks proliferation and can initiate zzso in both zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso These findings suggest that human zzso like the zzso zzso family members, is zzso induced in response to zzso and can, when zzso zzso block growth zzso zzso
