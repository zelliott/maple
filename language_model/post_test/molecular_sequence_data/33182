A zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a marine solar zzso of the Yellow Sea, Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso The similarity values between the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso and those of the type strains of the three currently recognized zzso species were zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso values between strain zzso and the type strains of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of strain zzso together with the zzso and genetic zzso revealed that this strain could be differentiated from other zzso zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
