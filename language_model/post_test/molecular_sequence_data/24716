zzso zzso with zzso zzso plus zzso is an zzso dominant syndrome characterized by zzso zzso zzso and a variety of zzso generalized seizure zzso zzso has previously been linked to zzso in two genes zzso the zzso sodium channel zzso zzso and zzso zzso We studied a large family with zzso and partial as well as generalized seizure zzso 

All but two living affected family members were interviewed and zzso Information on deceased affected family members was zzso zzso for 11 affected family members and one unaffected family member were zzso zzso linkage analysis and zzso screening of zzso were performed on blood samples from 16 affected individuals and their first-degree zzso 

There were 27 affected family members; 18 were alive at the time of the zzso All affected family members had zzso seven had zzso only, and 19 also had zzso zzso Eleven individuals continued to have zzso beyond 6 years of zzso zzso were complex in 12 family members, usually with prolonged zzso The index patient had right zzso lobe zzso and zzso zzso Four other patients had strong historical evidence of zzso lobe zzso and three others had zzso evidence of partial zzso zzso analysis indicated zzso dominant zzso All affected individuals who were tested and one zzso individual had a sodium channel zzso of zzso an zzso zzso at zzso zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso segment zzso as zzso 

Our findings indicate that partial zzso preceded by zzso can be associated with sodium channel zzso and may represent a zzso of zzso
