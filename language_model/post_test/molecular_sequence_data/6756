zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso form of the mouse zzso zzso zzso was genetically engineered and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso 2 to zzso of zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso The expression level of zzso zzso zzso was at least four times greater than that of zzso zzso zzso Since zzso was quite stable and was expressed as a peripheral membrane zzso it can be easily zzso from the membrane fraction treated with zzso without using any zzso during the zzso zzso The zzso zzso retained the spectral and zzso properties of the unmodified zzso with a similar zzso value for steroid 15 zzso activity zzso zzso in comparison to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso in the zzso buffer was an zzso with an approximate molecular mass of 450 zzso The replacement of the zzso anchor domain with an zzso zzso such as zzso therefore, may provide a general method for engineering zzso zzso to soluble zzso
