zzso stem cells interact with a complex zzso both in zzso and in zzso In association with this zzso zzso stem cells are maintained in zzso for several zzso zzso zzso cells appear to be important components of the zzso since several laboratories have demonstrated that cloned zzso cell lines support zzso in zzso The importance of the tissue of origin of such cell lines remains unknown, since systematic generation of zzso cell lines from adult zzso has never been zzso In addition, the capacity of zzso cell lines to support zzso stem cell has not been zzso We have previously described an efficient and rapid method for the zzso of primary bone zzso zzso cell lines zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1988) which can be used to systematically derive cell lines from multiple zzso of the adult zzso Here we report the zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso skin, and bone zzso zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso virus large T zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The interaction of these zzso cells with zzso cells zzso zzso colony forming zzso zzso and zzso zzso stem cells was studied in order to analyze the ability of such lines to support zzso stem cells in zzso These studies revealed that zzso cell lines from these diverse zzso were zzso and zzso similar and that they zzso bound zzso and zzso cells equally zzso However, only those cell lines derived from bone zzso maintenance of day 12 zzso in zzso One zzso zzso cell line, zzso supported the survival of day 8 zzso but not the more primitive zzso A bone zzso zzso cell line, U2, supported the survival of long-term zzso stem cells for up to 3 weeks in zzso as zzso by zzso 1 year zzso These studies suggest that adherence of zzso to zzso cells is necessary but not sufficient for maintenance of these stem cell populations and that bone zzso provides specific signals relating to zzso stem cell survival and zzso
