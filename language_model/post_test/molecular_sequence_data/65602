zzso C virus zzso infection is a common cause of chronic zzso and is currently treated with alpha zzso zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso therapy remains to be zzso To identify the cellular proteins that mediate the zzso effects of zzso we created a zzso cell culture system to zzso express individual zzso genes zzso and determined their zzso effects against zzso By screening 29 zzso that are induced in zzso cells by zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso we discovered that zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibited the replication of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso replication by zzso and zzso depends on their zzso zzso and protein zzso activities, zzso Moreover, our work, for the first time, provides strong evidence suggesting that zzso is a putative radical zzso zzso zzso In addition to demonstrating that the zzso activity of zzso depends on its radical SAM domain, which contains zzso motifs to coordinate zzso cluster and zzso SAM and is essential for its zzso activity, zzso studies also revealed that zzso requires an aromatic zzso acid zzso at its C zzso for proper zzso zzso Furthermore, although the zzso 70 zzso acid zzso of zzso are not absolutely required, deletion of this region significantly compromises its zzso activity against zzso Our findings suggest that zzso represents a novel zzso zzso that works together with other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso to mediate the zzso response against zzso zzso
