zzso adopting a fold very similar to that of zzso are found in diverse organisms, including sea zzso zzso zzso and zzso These molecules of approximately zzso zzso acid zzso possess disparate activities, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The family of zzso structures generally consists of a short zzso or turn followed by a small twisted zzso zzso The six zzso zzso which are paired in a zzso zzso 3-6 fashion are crucial for determining and maintaining the compact core zzso of the zzso The primary structural similarity between members of the family suggests that the global fold is robust and that the nature of the zzso determine the functional zzso The distinct compact fold shared by these zzso may be useful in the design of molecules with desired pharmacological zzso
