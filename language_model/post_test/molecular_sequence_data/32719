A zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated from the marine zzso zzso zzso a zzso that produces large amounts of zzso acid zzso A functional analysis of this gene was performed in zzso zzso Isolation of the zzso fatty acid zzso was achieved via reverse zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso designed from zzso zzso motifs and zzso and 3' zzso Two almost identical copies of zzso zzso were found, differing by nine silent zzso The existence of two such genes may be a result of a recent gene zzso event, or may have arisen from the possible zzso nature of zzso zzso This appears to be the first instance of two zzso zzso zzso sequences existing in the same zzso The isolated zzso sequences and their corresponding hypothetical zzso zzso were found to contain features characteristic of a zzso zzso zzso including zzso regions separating zzso zzso boxes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso was used to confirm zzso zzso and the function of zzso Both zzso and zzso precursors can be used by zzso in zzso with similar zzso zzso One zzso site was found in the zzso zzso fusion region of zzso Although the conservation of zzso junctions has been found for several zzso in humans and in zzso zzso a comparison of zzso in zzso and other zzso zzso has not revealed any strong zzso
