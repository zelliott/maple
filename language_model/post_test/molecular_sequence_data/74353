zzso zzso is being developed as a model system to study temperate zzso and forage zzso We have begun to investigate its utility to understand seed development and grain filling by identifying the major seed storage proteins in a zzso zzso zzso With the use of ID zzso and mass zzso we detected seven major storage protein bands, six of which were identified as zzso A subset of the major seed proteins isolated from three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also identified as zzso Several zzso zzso clones zzso zzso were completely zzso Two types of zzso genes were identified, zzso and zzso which are similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The derived zzso sequences of the zzso contain a typical signal zzso sequence in their zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single copy zzso zzso zzso belongs to a gene zzso
