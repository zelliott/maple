zzso channels zzso zzso electrical zzso in most excitable cells, including zzso and the zzso of skeletal muscle and zzso These proteins are targeted by a variety of current therapeutic drugs to combat such maladies as pain, zzso zzso and cardiac zzso Typically, these problems are associated with zzso of sodium channels leading to zzso in the relevant zzso More than ten distinct but closely related molecular zzso of zzso sodium channel are now known to be specifically expressed in different cell types and zzso zzso zzso of sodium channel activity must be zzso with great precision in both targeting and the degree of reduction in channel activity if a malfunction is to be corrected without introducing deleterious or even catastrophic side zzso Numerous natural toxins have evolved to target sodium channels, either by blocking current through the pore or by zzso channel zzso Among the well studied zzso the zzso zzso from cone snail zzso show a remarkable ability to discriminate among closely related forms of sodium channel, as well as exhibiting a variety of modes of zzso Here, we examine the molecular basis of action of different Na channel targeted zzso and explore their potential as models for the future design of more specifically targeted zzso
