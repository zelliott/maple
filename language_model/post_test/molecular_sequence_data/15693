The zzso of a zzso zzso instrument for the tandem mass zzso sequencing of zzso was zzso The sample set consisted of 21 synthetic zzso ranging in length from 5 to 42 zzso The sequences were randomly zzso For the majority of tested zzso two or three different charge states were selected as precursor zzso Each precursor zzso was fragmented applying several different collision zzso zzso 282 zzso zzso mass zzso were zzso zzso interpretation of zzso zzso mass zzso was accomplished with a recently introduced comparative sequencing zzso zzso The applied version of zzso was specifically zzso for the interpretation of zzso zzso obtained on the zzso zzso of zzso as large as zzso were correctly verified in zzso of cases zzso of 192 zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso of larger zzso were not specific enough for zzso Because of the occurrence of extensive internal fragmentation causing low sequence coverage paired with a high probability of assigning zzso zzso to wrong zzso tandem mass zzso obtained from zzso consisting of 30 and more zzso could not be used for sequence zzso neither manually nor with zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
