To investigate the role of type IV zzso in the zzso of zzso bacteria, four zzso strains for zzso zzso genes were generated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso protein as a major zzso of type IV zzso and the zzso product is reported to be required for zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are predicted to produce minor zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso failed to construct type IV zzso Although the swimming zzso of all zzso strains was not impaired in liquid zzso they showed remarkably reduced zzso on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that type IV zzso are required for surface zzso zzso toward host tobacco plants and hypersensitive zzso ability in zzso zzso leaves of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains were zzso These results might be a consequence of reduced expression of type III zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso Further, all zzso strains showed enhanced expression of zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso and higher tolerance to zzso zzso These results indicate that type IV zzso are an important zzso factor of this zzso
