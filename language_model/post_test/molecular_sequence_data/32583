The zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso responsible for spotted fever, was analyzed using two complementary zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso and zzso with zzso This strategy allowed identification of 165 proteins and helped to answer some questions raised by the zzso sequence of this zzso We successfully identified potential zzso factors including two putative zzso four proteins of the type IV zzso system, four zzso zzso four components of ABC zzso some zzso zzso zzso and one antitoxin of the zzso zzso zzso the antitoxin was the first to be identified in zzso zzso Only one protein containing zzso zzso repeats was found, whereas none of the split zzso zzso or zzso repeats were zzso zzso zzso of the protein expression profiles of zzso zzso and 23 other bacterial species according to functional categories showed that zzso bacteria express more proteins related to translation, especially zzso zzso However, the remaining bacteria express more proteins related to energy production and zzso acid zzso In conclusion, this study reveals zzso zzso zzso factor expression and highlights the unique protein expression profile of zzso zzso
