zzso plays an important role in the development of various diseases, including zzso and zzso In our laboratory we recently identified a number of specific human zzso peptides containing a zzso consensus zzso displaying a low zzso affinity for zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso In search of more potent zzso for zzso we have zzso the zzso zzso core motif via a zzso zzso chemistry zzso A dedicated library of zzso derivatives was generated by introducing seven zzso at the N and C zzso of the zzso In particular, zzso with zzso acid or zzso acid zzso at the N zzso proved to be considerably more potent zzso of zzso binding than the parental zzso After removal of the zzso zzso acid from the core zzso which appeared to be zzso by a zzso function without loss of zzso a second library was zzso to map the chemical zzso within the zzso acid or zzso acid groups responsible for the enhanced zzso zzso Moreover, by varying the length and rigidity of the zzso zzso we have further zzso the spatial orientation of the zzso zzso The combined use of zzso display and subsequent zzso chemistry led to the design of a number of zzso zzso containing peptides with low zzso affinity for zzso both under zzso and dynamic conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso These small synthetic antagonists, which are equally as potent as the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso are promising leads in zzso zzso
