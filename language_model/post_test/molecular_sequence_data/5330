Transport of zzso proteins into the nucleus is zzso by nuclear zzso signals zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso are recognized by the zzso alpha zzso in the zzso to form a stable complex, termed the nuclear zzso complex zzso To date, three different zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso In this study, we report the identification of three additional mouse genes zzso to the known alpha zzso using zzso methodology and show that the mouse alpha zzso can be classified into at least three zzso zzso zzso and zzso families, each composed of closely related members (more than zzso zzso acid sequence zzso These three zzso however, have approximately 50% zzso acid identity to one zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that all were zzso expressed in various mouse zzso These results suggest that the function of these proteins may be controlled in a zzso manner and that their zzso expression may play a role in differentiation and zzso
