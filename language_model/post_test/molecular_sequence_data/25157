We have expressed six previously cloned zzso of human zzso zzso protein in zzso coli and zzso them to zzso in a biologically active zzso They range from 352 to zzso zzso acids in length and differ from each other by the presence of three or four tandem repeats in the zzso half and by the presence or absence of 29 or 58 zzso acid zzso in the zzso When mixed together they gave a set of six bands on zzso gels with apparent molecular weights of zzso zzso and with a characteristic pattern of zzso Four of these bands aligned with the major zzso bands found in adult human cerebral zzso following zzso acid extraction and alkaline zzso zzso They consisted of zzso with three repeats and no zzso four repeats and no zzso insertions and three- and zzso containing zzso with the 29 zzso acid zzso In fetal human brain extracts treated with alkaline zzso one of the two major zzso bands aligned with the zzso containing zzso with no zzso whereas the molecular nature of the second major zzso band remains to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso were biologically active at zzso zzso as assessed by their ability to promote zzso zzso The rates of assembly were zzso times faster for zzso containing four repeats when compared with zzso containing zzso with no significant contribution by the zzso zzso
