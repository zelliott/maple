We recently reported the zzso location of the zzso zzso gene in four strains of zzso zzso Transfer of this gene from strain zzso to an zzso recipient was accompanied by transfer of numerous other zzso resistance zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso A restriction map developed by comparing zzso of the regions surrounding the zzso gene in donor and recipient zzso resembles published maps of previously described zzso zzso zzso particularly in the area of the structural gene and its downstream zzso In addition, DNA sequence analysis of the region immediately downstream of the zzso gene from both zzso and its zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso repeat region found in zzso and zzso two previously described zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso is incorporated into a zzso element derived from zzso
