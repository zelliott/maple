The zzso zzso zzso are important zzso proteins of the small zzso zzso and zzso and control zzso zzso and cell zzso The direct interaction of zzso with zzso zzso exchange factors from the zzso family, which is responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso to focal complexes in the cell, is zzso by a zzso zzso segment in zzso and an zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso domain in zzso The zzso segment of zzso contains the zzso zzso motif zzso which is required for unusually high affinity zzso In order to understand the structural basis for the high affinity and specificity of the zzso interaction, we solved crystal structures for the zzso zzso domain of zzso and for the complex of the zzso binding segment of zzso with the zzso zzso domain of zzso at zzso A and zzso resolution, zzso The zzso unit of the crystal contains two zzso zzso and two zzso zzso The bound zzso adopts a zzso that allows for intimate contacts with three grooves on the surface of the zzso domain that lie between the zzso and zzso Most notably, the zzso zzso of the zzso motif forms a zzso and is tightly coordinated by a number of zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso interaction appears to be the key zzso for the high affinity binding of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of the zzso engage in additional interactions with the surface of the zzso which significantly increases binding zzso Compared to a recent zzso structure of a similar complex, our crystal structure reveals an alternate binding zzso Finally, we compare our crystal structure with the recently published zzso complex structure, and suggest the existence of a molecular zzso
