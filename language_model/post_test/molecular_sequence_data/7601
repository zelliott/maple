The current model for replication of duck zzso B virus has reverse zzso initiating and copying a zzso motif within the zzso zzso zzso near the zzso end of the zzso zzso This results in synthesis of four zzso of zzso This short zzso DNA product is then transferred to a complementary position, at zzso near the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA then zzso We have examined the transfer of zzso DNA during replication of duck zzso B virus in cell zzso The initial aim of this work was to examine the effect of zzso at zzso on the transfer zzso We found that when zzso were introduced into the zzso motif overlapping zzso the zzso end of zzso no longer mapped to position zzso but was shifted two or four zzso zzso were predicted to exist at the new sites of zzso zzso from zzso zzso could be restored in these zzso by making zzso changes in the zzso motif within zzso This finding led us to examine limitations in the shifting of the site of zzso When the zzso motif in zzso was changed to six different zzso motifs surrounding position zzso transfer of zzso DNA shifted zzso albeit zzso Also, when multiple zzso motifs were introduced near zzso the zzso motif at zzso zzso was used zzso Overall, our findings confirm the current zzso DNA transfer model and demonstrate a marked preference for the site of the zzso
