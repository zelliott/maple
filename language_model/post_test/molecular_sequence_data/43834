An indirect zzso zzso for the detection of human zzso to the agent of human zzso zzso zzso was developed and zzso zzso was prepared from a human zzso leukemia cell line zzso infected with a zzso isolate of the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso presentation and preservation of cellular zzso were obtained when infected cells were applied and cultured on the slide, excess medium was removed, and cells were fixed with zzso Use of a buffer containing bovine serum zzso and goat serum reduced background fluorescence, and use of an zzso G zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso The zzso readily detected specific zzso from zzso patients and did not detect zzso from healthy zzso No significant zzso was noted in zzso from patients with high zzso of zzso to other zzso zzso We were able to identify zzso zzso to zzso zzso in samples from areas where zzso is endemic that had tested negative to other zzso zzso Animal zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso may be useful for veterinary zzso zzso between two different laboratories was assessed by using coded human zzso exchanged between zzso zzso from the two laboratories were similar, indicating that the zzso can be easily integrated into use for routine testing for zzso The zzso was then compared to an zzso using horse zzso infected with zzso The two zzso gave comparable results, indicating that the cell zzso zzso can be used for testing samples that have been previously tested with zzso zzso as an zzso The new zzso offers several advantages over other zzso methods that use zzso zzso and is suitable for use in testing for human zzso to the zzso zzso
