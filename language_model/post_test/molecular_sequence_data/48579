The existence of zzso variations in G zzso zzso sequences has been recognized early zzso Recent advances in large-scale zzso sequencing techniques are expected to dramatically increase the number of zzso identified in G zzso zzso giving rise to new challenges regarding their functional zzso The current zzso will illustrate these challenges based on the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso for which zzso sequencing revealed 40 rare zzso zzso in the general population and in type 2 diabetes zzso zzso zzso characterization of these zzso zzso revealed 14 zzso with loss of zzso protein zzso that associate with increased risk of zzso zzso This repertoire of zzso zzso is a rich source for zzso studies and will help to define the still poorly understood role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso development in zzso Defining the functional defects in carriers of rare zzso zzso will help to provide personalized therapies to these patients in the zzso
