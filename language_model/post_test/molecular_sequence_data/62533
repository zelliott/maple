zzso in the zzso tumor zzso gene are present in approximately 50% of all human zzso We sought to determine the frequency and type of zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of the oral cavity in a Brazilian zzso To identify zzso zzso we used zzso in tumor tissue zzso from zzso embedded and from zzso sections followed by direct sequencing of zzso bands with altered zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso in zzso of the human SCC zzso The zzso were of a broad spectrum, with a preponderance of G zzso A and A zzso G transitions with an apparent hotspot at the zzso zzso at zzso zzso Patient samples were zzso according to tobacco and alcohol consumption as well as by zzso location of the zzso and although trends did emerge, no statistically significant associations were obtained between the zzso of zzso zzso and these lifestyle zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are common among oral cavity zzso in this population, and stress the significance of this study since it is the first analysis of zzso zzso in oral cancer in a southern Brazilian zzso
