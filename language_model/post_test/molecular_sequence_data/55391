A zzso element of 624 zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), was identified in the plant zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso contains terminal direct repeats zzso zzso that are surrounded by zzso zzso It has a short internal domain of 178 zzso and shows characteristics of zzso zzso in miniature zzso zzso We used zzso sequence to develop molecular markers for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to different races were zzso A total of 45 zzso were zzso The zzso index showed significant differences among the populations divided according to race, indicating that they are structured according to zzso No clear correlation between zzso and zzso markers with zzso characterization was zzso zzso zzso has high genetic diversity, and the analysis of molecular zzso showed that 51% of zzso is found among the populations of different zzso The markers were also tested in different zzso zzso In every case, multiple bands were zzso indicating that these markers can be successfully used in different species belonging to the zzso zzso
