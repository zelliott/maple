An industrial wastewater treatment plant at zzso Denmark, has suffered from zzso problems for several years caused by zzso zzso Five strains were isolated from the sludge by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strains formed a zzso cluster in the zzso and they were zzso different from their closest relatives and from all zzso known zzso bacteria described zzso relative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso In pure culture, the cells zzso zzso in filaments are zzso and contain zzso and zzso The optimum temperature for growth is 30 degrees C and the strains grow in 2 % zzso and are zzso and zzso zzso 10 is the major zzso The major fatty acid zzso : zzso and smaller amounts of zzso fatty zzso zzso fatty acids with a chain length of 16 and 18 carbon atoms and small amounts of zzso fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms zzso : zzso zzso affiliated the strains with the zzso group in the zzso The zzso content of the DNA is zzso zzso (for strain zzso The two most dissimilar zzso by zzso zzso gene comparison zzso and zzso zzso % zzso showed zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for the pure cultures were designed for zzso in zzso zzso and demonstrated that two zzso zzso were present in the zzso wastewater treatment zzso It is proposed that the zzso represent a new zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
