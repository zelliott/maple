zzso sequences specific for a range of zzso species were defined by zzso sequence comparisons of small zzso zzso zzso A zzso chain zzso sequencing strategy was used to demonstrate that the zzso zzso sequence can be used for the rapid identification of zzso zzso Identification at the species level can be obtained within 2 zzso requiring less than 10,000 zzso This procedure reliably zzso zzso zzso which are difficult to identify by classical methods, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
