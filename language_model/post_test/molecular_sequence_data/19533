zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso addition triggered zzso expression and increased the rate of zzso concentration decline in culture zzso of zzso already cultivated with zzso suggesting that zzso induced the synthesis of its own zzso zzso Four open reading frames zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso proteins of ABC zzso were found in the zzso by probing the zzso repeat sequence required for regulation of zzso zzso zzso named zzso showed zzso induction by zzso and zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis showed that zzso zzso protein exhibited the highest affinity for zzso zzso zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the rate of decline of the zzso concentration in the culture zzso was about zzso of that in strain zzso The in zzso and in zzso data clearly demonstrated that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso and downstream of zzso the zzso regulator gene zzso and two putative integral membrane protein genes zzso are located in the opposite and same zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso which seemed independent of zzso transcription, was also induced by zzso and zzso
