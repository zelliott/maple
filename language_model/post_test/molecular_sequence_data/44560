We have shown in earlier studies, using a mouse model, that the expression of the zzso zzso 5 protein zzso is restricted to the zzso and that the zzso of its corresponding zzso is zzso zzso and temporally regulated throughout zzso zzso We report here, using zzso zzso transient expression experiments as well as zzso and zzso analyses on the findings that at least part of the zzso control of the zzso expression is exerted at the zzso level via an zzso response element localized in the zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso response element zzso is found to be consistent with the consensus zzso zzso target sequence zzso but exhibits a quite weak conservation in the left half zzso The data presented here further expand the diversity of sequence able to zzso zzso zzso
