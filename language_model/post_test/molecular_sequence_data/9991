zzso of zzso secondary zzso protein zzso genes is zzso regulated at the zzso level, and is disrupted in specific zzso zzso and zzso We analyzed the regulation of zzso gene expression by zzso reporter gene zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids were zzso zzso into zzso zzso cell zzso zzso activity was detected from reporter plasmids containing zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, but not in a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso into a zzso cell line resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region revealed three zzso repetitive zzso the deletion of which restored zzso levels of zzso activity to the zzso reporter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified a protein of approximately 180 zzso that binds to this region in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso This protein was identified to be the zzso displacement protein zzso zzso has been shown to zzso expression of zzso a gene expressed relatively early in the zzso zzso Our observations suggest that the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso element serves to suppress zzso promoter activity of the zzso gene in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in cultured zzso stem cells blocks zzso expression upon zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation without blocking zzso zzso This block in zzso expression may be due, in part, to the persistence of zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso
