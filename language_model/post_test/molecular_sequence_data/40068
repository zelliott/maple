The zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are evolutionary precursors of the zzso natural killer zzso cells and an important element of innate zzso The zzso zzso cell zzso protein zzso is a characteristic cell surface protein with main functions in target cell recognition and zzso with sequence information available for many species of zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso the zzso zzso of fish zzso out of limb zzso zzso and zzso its expression by zzso zzso analysis revealed a high degree of zzso with zzso zzso on zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso motifs zzso characteristic for this protein zzso zzso is expressed in multiple zzso with high levels in limb zzso zzso The present work describes for the first time the cloning of the zzso gene in a zzso zzso providing a valuable link between fish and higher zzso Our findings suggest the existence of zzso in zzso and a role of the innate immune system in the processes of limb zzso
