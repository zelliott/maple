The zzso for the synthesis of the organic zzso zzso zzso is proposed based on the activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but an zzso gene coding for zzso zzso zzso was zzso The gene upstream of the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso that was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso product had zzso activity, catalyzing the synthesis of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso with a high zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso and was also able to zzso zzso zzso but no other zzso zzso Similar zzso in zzso specificity were confirmed in zzso for the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had zzso activity at 50 degrees zzso The zzso activity of zzso was at 50 degrees C with zzso as the zzso and at 60 degrees C with zzso Despite the similarity of the sugar donors zzso and zzso the zzso for the synthesis of zzso or zzso share no zzso acid sequence identity, save for short zzso However, the zzso of zzso and zzso is carried out by zzso zzso by zzso genes and capable of using both zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of the zzso of a zzso zzso for zzso
