To explore the structural basis for regulation of human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we used primer extension and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso techniques to estimate levels of and identify zzso elements of zzso zzso and zzso cloning to place these elements within the overall map of the zzso zzso zzso extension on zzso cell zzso suggested the presence of significant zzso zzso sequence upstream of the zzso end of our cloned zzso zzso Using zzso and reverse zzso zzso zzso we cloned these sequences from brain and zzso and found this material to be composed of alternatively spliced zzso using a previously reported zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed both zzso zzso and zzso to be regulated in a zzso zzso zzso To clarify the structure of the zzso gene including zzso zzso we isolated and characterized zzso zzso clones from Lambda Fix II and zzso artificial zzso zzso In agreement with previous findings, a single zzso gene was identified that accounts for zzso bands on zzso Southern blots and was found to zzso 13 zzso to zzso the zzso coding sequences along with the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified approximately 14 zzso downstream of zzso zzso in the zzso gene and 737 zzso upstream of zzso 2, where the initiation site for translation is zzso zzso zzso is surrounded by several elements potentially suitable for regulating zzso zzso gene expression in zzso including consensus sites for zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data reveal additional complexity in zzso gene structure and expression that may be relevant to regulated and compromised zzso expression in zzso
