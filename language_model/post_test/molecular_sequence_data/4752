zzso is a zzso oriented plasma membrane protein and zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso is a protein associated with the zzso zzso zzso These two proteins form part of a complex which is thought to mediate the fusion of plasma and zzso zzso during zzso This paper reports the identification of zzso and zzso zzso in sea zzso zzso During zzso sea zzso zzso release the contents of a single zzso the zzso zzso exposing the membrane destined to fuse with the zzso During zzso zzso the plasma membrane over the zzso zzso zzso at multiple points with the zzso membrane zzso and zzso and zzso are shed with the resulting membrane zzso Sea zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated in a complex as detected by zzso Following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to denser zzso on zzso zzso showing that they have undergone zzso changes during or after the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and loss during zzso zzso support a role for these proteins in regulating the zzso zzso
