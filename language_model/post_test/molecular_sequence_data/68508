A rat brain zzso zzso protein was isolated by binding zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex with zzso and zzso on immobilized zzso and wheat germ zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular mass of zzso zzso Recovery of this protein was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the highly zzso zzso zzso but not by the highly zzso zzso zzso when these compounds were added as competitors at the binding zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso through the zzso column with zzso protein recognized by zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso influenced zzso of the zzso zzso complex and zzso of the zzso and G protein from zzso in fashions consistent with the pharmacology of zzso zzso A zzso acid zzso sequence from the zzso zzso differs at 4 positions from a similar sequence in the zzso zzso zzso and is zzso within a novel rat brain zzso isolated by zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
