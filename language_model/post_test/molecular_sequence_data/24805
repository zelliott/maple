Conventional as well as molecular techniques have been used to determine the microbial communities present on the concrete walls of sewer zzso The genetic fingerprint of the zzso on corroded concrete sewer pipes was obtained by means of zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso profiles of the bacterial communities present on the concrete surface changed as observed by shifts occurring at the level of the dominance of bands from zzso places to the most severely corroded zzso By means of statistical tools, it was possible to distinguish two different groups, corresponding to the microbial communities on corroded and zzso surfaces, zzso zzso of the microbial communities indicated that the sequences of typical bands showed the highest level of identity to sequences from the bacterial strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and different zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the presence of zzso zzso signal molecules was shown by two zzso of the zzso on the concrete under the water level and at the most severely corroded places on the concrete surface of the sewer zzso
