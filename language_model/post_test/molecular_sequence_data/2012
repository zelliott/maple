The genes corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso equivalent zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso coli have been cloned and zzso from two widely divergent species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso and four different zzso genes have been cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso between the deduced zzso acid sequences of these proteins and to other available zzso proteins of zzso and zzso have been zzso The data suggest that the zzso are a distinct coherent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso proteins reveals that the zzso region, believed to be responsible for interaction with release factor 1, is the most highly zzso region and that there is specific conservation of most of the zzso zzso which may be important in maintaining the highly zzso structure of the zzso Although zzso is the most highly zzso protein in the zzso coli zzso the sites of zzso are not zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins of zzso and zzso show two regions of very high similarity near the center and the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso proteins of all zzso are zzso and contain approximately three zzso of an zzso protein fused to their zzso zzso although much of this fusion has been lost in the truncated zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso proteins are zzso whereas the zzso protein has suffered a zzso through what appear to be gene fusion zzso Within the zzso derived region of the zzso proteins there exists a repeated module of 26 zzso zzso present in two copies in zzso three in zzso and one in zzso This modular sequence is apparently also present in the zzso proteins of all zzso and may play a role in zzso zzso zzso complex formation, and the function of the zzso complex in zzso
