Few data regarding molecular diagnosis of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso population are zzso 

zzso male patient from zzso parents of zzso origin diagnosed with zzso and without hearing impairment observed later in zzso zzso gene sequencing demonstrated a novel zzso G deletion in zzso 13 zzso zzso leading to a premature stop zzso 

A novel zzso gene zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso with normal hearing in the zzso zzso analysis may help to rapidly diagnose zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
