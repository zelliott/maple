We observed that the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso region zzso weak promoter activity in activated zzso T cells, suggesting that additional regions are required for optimal zzso gene zzso We therefore examined a zzso segment of the zzso zzso which contained a putative zzso zzso for its ability to enhance zzso promoter zzso This segment zzso zzso promoter activity in an zzso manner in zzso zzso cells but not in human B cell or zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso identified a zzso zzso site in the zzso region near the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso regulatory zzso This was further supported by zzso analysis and zzso zzso which indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was critical for zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that the zzso zzso bound the zzso form of the zzso gene contained in human T cell nuclear protein zzso This binding also appeared to occur in zzso in zzso T cells based on zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso gene zzso region acts as a T zzso classical zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso
