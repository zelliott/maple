Conventional methods for the identification of species of zzso zzso causing infections have zzso By using a zzso alternative, the present study tries to develop a new tool for this zzso zzso patients living in zzso (in the south of zzso were suffering from visceral or zzso zzso DNA of the zzso in clinical samples zzso zzso peripheral blood, or zzso from these patients were amplified by zzso and were directly zzso The sequences observed were compared to these of 30 strains of the zzso causing Old World zzso collected in Europe, Africa, or zzso In the analysis of the sequences of the zzso two different sequence patterns for zzso zzso one sequence for zzso zzso one sequence for zzso major, two sequences for zzso zzso and one sequence for zzso zzso were zzso Four sequences were observed among the strains from the zzso one was similar to the sequence for the zzso major zzso two were identical to the sequences for the zzso zzso zzso and the last sequence was not observed within the strains but had a high degree of zzso with the sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains from all zzso patients had the same zzso The zzso zzso strains from zzso patients suffering from visceral zzso had three different zzso This fact might signify that some zzso of zzso zzso acquire zzso exclusively in zzso zzso To dispense with the sequencing step, a restriction zzso with zzso was zzso Some restriction patterns might support genetic exchanges in members of the zzso zzso
