The influence of the zzso zzso composition of cereal zzso on microbial zzso was studied using an in zzso model of the zzso gastrointestinal zzso Ten zzso barley zzso six barley zzso with zzso six zzso zzso and six zzso zzso that differed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and starch contents and starch type were zzso zzso and incubated for 72 h with pig zzso zzso zzso were zzso and microbial compositions and zzso fatty acid zzso profiles were analyzed using terminal restriction zzso length zzso and gas zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso revealed different effects on zzso and microbial ecology depending on the type of zzso and zzso First, in zzso of barley with zzso and zzso the cellulose and zzso zzso contents zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso production, and zzso decreased zzso zzso Second, in zzso barley zzso the zzso zzso zzso crude zzso and soluble zzso contents determined the microbial community composition and activity as zzso zzso the zzso contents of the zzso barley varieties increased the zzso production and the abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso content determined the total amounts of zzso and zzso the zzso and starch contents affected the abundance of zzso zzso zzso members of zzso cluster zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso zzso in the model was zzso zzso cell counts were not affected, but the relative proportion of zzso decreased with zzso barley zzso and increased with zzso zzso as revealed by quantitative zzso Our results shed light on the complex interactions of cereal zzso with zzso bacterial zzso and the possible impact on host zzso
