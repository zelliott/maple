The zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso with diverse functions in zzso zzso fusion, zzso and protein zzso zzso Here we report a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was cloned from mouse zzso From protein sequence zzso zzso is more closely related to snake zzso zzso zzso than to other zzso and hence may cleave similar zzso to zzso perhaps including components of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of selected mouse zzso revealed that zzso is expressed highly and in alternatively spliced forms in the zzso suggesting a possible role in zzso zzso and at lower levels in zzso The zzso maturation of zzso expressed in zzso cells resembles that of other zzso in that zzso is made as a precursor and processed to a mature form in a late zzso compartment of the zzso zzso Most or all of the mature, and thus presumably zzso active, form of zzso in zzso cells is accessible to cell surface zzso suggesting that zzso functions mainly on the cell zzso A zzso converting the zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso even though this zzso form of zzso can be transported to the cell surface in a manner similar to the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso removal and maturation of zzso may be, at least in part, zzso This is in contrast with several other zzso for which zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso and in which a zzso zzso in the zzso site does not alter zzso zzso
