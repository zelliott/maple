We have investigated a possible involvement of zzso in nuclear protein import using an in zzso transport system involving zzso cells supplemented with zzso zzso Transport in this system was measured with a novel zzso zzso that allows rapid quantitative zzso zzso gamma S and other zzso zzso of zzso were found to rapidly inhibit the rate of in zzso nuclear zzso Transport zzso by zzso gamma S was dependent on the zzso of zzso cells and zzso and was strongly enhanced by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso component responsible for this zzso was found in a zzso fraction in molecular zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso of this zzso fraction was itself required for efficient nuclear zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed protein demonstrated that this essential zzso gamma zzso transport factor was zzso a previously described zzso of the Ras zzso found in both nucleus and zzso zzso and its zzso zzso release protein zzso have previously been implicated in DNA zzso cell cycle checkpoint control, and zzso zzso processing and zzso Our results suggest that zzso serves to integrate nuclear protein import with these other nuclear zzso
