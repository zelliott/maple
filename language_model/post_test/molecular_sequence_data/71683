A database of primary sequences of 28 zzso zzso known to elicit T cell response, derived from five different zzso was compiled to identify zzso specific helper T cell zzso sites using a rule based zzso zzso The prediction was based on the identification of zzso specific patterns in the form of zzso shape and zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso from weighted connected graph models of zzso acid side chains and peptides were used in this zzso The system was trained by 10 Ad and 10 zzso restricted zzso zzso assigned zzso and zzso respectively, chosen randomly from the database, and four Ad and four zzso restricted sequences were kept as test zzso This allowed the system to learn about zzso shape and zzso specific for Ad restricted peptides from the differences, if any, they had with the inactive peptides in that zzso The system made zzso correct prediction for the training set peptides and zzso only one inactive zzso of the test zzso The system also identified crucial zzso for zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso This identification also shows that activity zzso zzso could be located at varying distances from the zzso zzso To our knowledge, the method is unique of its kind in the literature and may find application in the rational design of synthetic vaccines and other peptides of zzso zzso
