The gene coding for a zzso zzso inhibitor analog zzso in which zzso at position 6 was replaced by zzso was zzso zzso The synthetic gene was cloned into zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein composed of zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso with zzso as a connecting zzso After zzso zzso zzso and reduction of the fusion zzso followed by zzso with zzso zzso as a zzso and affinity zzso on the immobilized zzso the fully active zzso was zzso The zzso zzso activity and zzso acid composition of the zzso zzso were consistent with those of the natural zzso The zzso gene was also cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso in zzso zzso In order to make the reading frame of the gene compatible with the zzso a zzso was inserted into the zzso gene via zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and found to be correctly processed at the junction between the zzso leader zzso and zzso zzso Of the two expression systems, the latter is more advantageous in the high yield zzso than 2 zzso easy zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
