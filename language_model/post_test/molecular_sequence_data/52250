Several functional zzso especially the active site regions, in zzso zzso zzso were zzso by alignment of zzso acid sequences of the zzso from five species, human, zzso zzso chicken, and trout, and that of zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso structure has been determined zzso zzso zzso zzso and Howard, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted functions of these zzso have been evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso including seven new zzso have been generated in this zzso The seven newly prepared zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and N delta 20 (a zzso without the first 20 zzso zzso The preparation and characterization of these new zzso are zzso The structural model described in this paper should be very useful for future zzso studies of zzso by zzso zzso
