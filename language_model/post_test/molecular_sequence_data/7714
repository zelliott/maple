zzso zzso is commonly present in the zzso but strains of zzso zzso have also occasionally been isolated from human blood or zzso zzso Studies were undertaken with zzso zzso gene sequences and DNA zzso to define the genetic relationships between these two groups of zzso zzso strains were found to yield zzso DNA restriction zzso digest patterns different from human strains when either the zzso zzso gene amplified from zzso zzso zzso strain zzso or a zzso universal zzso zzso zzso was used as zzso A DNA probe based on the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso to zzso of other zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso five new zzso zzso and weak zzso was found with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and six other zzso zzso No zzso occurred with strains representing different major human zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso strains had a zzso plus zzso DNA content of zzso zzso and, based on zzso zzso zzso could be separated into two zzso groups, one of which included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso groups had less than 38% DNA zzso to the human zzso indicating zzso strains are clearly two separate species distinct from the human zzso
