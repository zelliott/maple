One of the main limitations of using synthetic peptides for zzso in allergic patients is the difficulty to delineate the zzso T cell zzso which are necessarily dependent on zzso zzso We have thus addressed the question of the role of zzso II molecules in zzso zzso selection in the particular case of the major bee zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso and easily explore it, we used zzso mice whose zzso zzso is associated with high zzso and zzso responses to zzso zzso By means of extensive sets of synthetic zzso we investigated the specificity of zzso T cells and zzso zzso from mice zzso with zzso zzso and delineated four zzso regions, restricted to either the zzso or the zzso zzso All the peptides were also tested for their capacity to bind to zzso zzso II zzso Eight zzso of high affinity were zzso They clustered into three distinct regions and were largely zzso They included all the zzso zzso but half of them were not capable of stimulating T zzso zzso interacting surfaces with either the zzso or zzso II zzso greatly differed from one zzso to zzso In one case, we observed that zzso regions exerted a particular action on T cell stimulation which prevented the fine zzso zzso Our results underline the diversity and complexity of zzso zzso zzso and T cell zzso from the major bee zzso zzso even in a single zzso These data also participate in the development of alternative approaches to conventional zzso
