It has been demonstrated previously that respiratory zzso contain three zzso zzso zzso one of these was identified as the product of the zzso gene zzso Here we demonstrate that the other two zzso are zzso of the zzso gene zzso This was accomplished by zzso treatment of the zzso reduced zzso zzso populations and zzso sequencing of the liberated zzso The products of zzso zzso were separated by gel zzso into high molecular weight zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso The latter were zzso by reverse phase zzso and four of the major peptides were zzso Three of these peptides were identical to and zzso within a zzso acid sequence deduced from a zzso clone zzso zzso a portion of the zzso zzso The other zzso is also present within this sequence but showed identity in only 9 of its 10 zzso A zzso zzso raised against one of these peptides was zzso with the two putative zzso zzso Analysis of the high molecular weight zzso indicated that the zzso zzso contained different types and lengths of zzso zzso one domain of Mr zzso zzso zzso two zzso of Mr zzso zzso zzso and a third domain of Mr zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of the larger two zzso was similar in zzso zzso and zzso content but distinct from that of the smallest zzso Each of these zzso in the zzso zzso is separated by a zzso region, and the relative abundance of the major peptides derived by zzso of these regions and their occurrence in a zzso sequence suggest that they contain a common zzso zzso
