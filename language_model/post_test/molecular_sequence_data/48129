The zzso protein zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso can provide precursors for synthesis of complex zzso secondary zzso in zzso therefore the regulation of their own synthesis is of zzso DNA sequences upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso have been obtained in this laboratory or as part of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso zzso of zzso and zzso typical features of classical zzso systems can be zzso in particular hypothetical short zzso with runs of zzso and zzso zzso zzso No such features are apparent upstream of other genes or gene clusters zzso All five upstream regions were fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a reporter gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso regions showed strong depression of CO activity in the presence of all three zzso zzso acids whether or not the zzso features were zzso By zzso zzso the zzso and zzso triplets in the putative zzso peptides for zzso and zzso were replaced by ones for other zzso zzso In the case of zzso this had no effect at all; for zzso the zzso regulatory zzso persisted in at least some zzso It was concluded that zzso an unknown regulatory mechanism must be operating in the zzso system of zzso zzso zzso in place of classical zzso and zzso it is unsafe to zzso the functioning of a regulatory mechanism from sequence zzso zzso
