Isolation and characterization of new environmental zzso are performed for zzso analyzing microbial evolution and ecology and zzso delivering biological zzso The sampling of environmental zzso appears, however, to be limited by the procedure (usually liquid enrichment zzso used to zzso zzso An alternative, less competitive procedure is developed here for the purpose of zzso new zzso This procedure involves extraction directly into and then propagation in a dilute zzso zzso zzso of this procedure are used to avoid repeated isolation of the same zzso Some newly isolated zzso grow so poorly that they appear zzso to liquid enrichment zzso Four comparatively high zzso zzso were isolated and characterized by a zzso sequence zzso Some had zzso with extremely distant relationships to those of other zzso based on a tree built from the large zzso zzso These methods find novel zzso by rapidly zzso and screening diverse zzso
