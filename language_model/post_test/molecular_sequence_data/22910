The human zzso BK zzso contains a zzso zzso control region zzso which regulates DNA replication and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to characterize zzso zzso in kidney zzso and urine samples from zzso patients and to see whether there is any association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and urine samples were examined from 11 patients with elevated serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso copies per zzso of zzso zzso was diagnosed in seven zzso Using zzso zzso zzso was amplified from urine from all zzso zzso The dominant zzso corresponded to the archetype zzso In addition, a total of 14 zzso zzso were zzso Thirteen of these zzso were found in urine from one single zzso patient also suffering from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was amplified from kidney zzso of six zzso zzso Three patients demonstrated zzso zzso while three other patients zzso rearranged zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also detected in urine from control patients, except for one patient who zzso two zzso zzso zzso However, these zzso were not resulting from complex zzso but instead had a linear zzso anatomy with zzso in the zzso No zzso DNA was detected in zzso from control zzso The results indicate that rearranged zzso zzso is associated with zzso
