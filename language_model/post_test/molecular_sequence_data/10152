zzso are muscle diseases in which the function of the muscular zzso channel zzso is zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso gene on mouse zzso zzso 6 provide animal models for human zzso It was shown that the zzso zzso zzso is due to an zzso of an zzso type zzso that is transcribed and leads to multiple zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso involves a stop zzso near the zzso We have determined the zzso organization of the mouse zzso gene and the sequence requirements for the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene is composed of 23 zzso ranging from 39 to zzso zzso and spans approximately 23 zzso of zzso zzso The zzso organization is highly zzso to that of the human zzso zzso the zzso of the coding sequence is zzso to rat and zzso to zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is inserted into zzso 12, the largest zzso Whereas the zzso and 3' zzso sequences of the zzso zzso are zzso to those reported for other zzso zzso of the zzso no consensus motif for an zzso target site could be zzso On the basis of zzso zzso we provide duplex zzso diagnoses for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Close to the 3' end of zzso 12, a zzso repeat zzso was found that is zzso between mouse species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and can thus be used for zzso mapping zzso
