In plants, zzso zzso is a group of zzso existing as a gene zzso and plays important roles in zzso zzso important zzso However, to date only a limited number of zzso have been identified and characterized in zzso In this study, data mining methods were used, and 151 putative zzso genes in the model zzso zzso zzso were identified, including 135 novel zzso These genes were classified into 9 clans and 44 families by sequence zzso and among those 4 new clans and 21 new families not reported previously in zzso By comparison of these genes with zzso genes in zzso and rice, it was found that most of the known zzso families in zzso species exist in zzso zzso The representative protein sequences of putative zzso were zzso and the secondary elements were assigned based on the known structure zzso zzso zzso recognition sites zzso and zzso binding sites were also identified in these zzso In addition, the zzso expression profiles zzso zzso of the putative zzso genes were zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso analyses of several selected zzso zzso These results will provide a base for zzso information on zzso genes in zzso zzso and for further functional analysis of zzso zzso genes in zzso
