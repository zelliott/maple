zzso plants produce zzso and zzso that play essential roles in zzso zzso Together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso plants is fundamental in the construction of these zzso active zzso Although zzso of zzso plants zzso only zzso to zzso zzso with this function are referred to as type zzso zzso zzso convert both zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso respectively zzso to as type zzso In this study, we isolated multiple zzso zzso zzso from a model zzso zzso zzso In contrast to previous zzso the zzso acid sequence of zzso was highly zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were the conventional zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sequence analysis revealed that four zzso genes zzso and a putative zzso zzso form a tandem cluster within 15 zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli confirmed that zzso and zzso are type II zzso and that zzso is a type I zzso The occurrence of both types of zzso is probably common in zzso plants, and it was suggested that type II zzso evolved from an ancestral zzso by gene zzso and began to produce zzso along with the establishment of the zzso
