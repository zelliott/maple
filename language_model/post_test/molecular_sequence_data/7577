The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally identified zzso its high level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is also highly zzso during early zzso In cultured cells it is localized to focal zzso contacts and becomes zzso and activated in response to zzso binding of cells to the zzso zzso suggesting an important role in cell zzso and/or zzso We have generated zzso mice by gene targeting to examine the role of zzso during zzso zzso zzso displayed a general zzso of zzso development, and cells from these zzso had reduced mobility in zzso Surprisingly, the number of focal zzso was increased in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso may be involved in the turnover of focal zzso contacts during cell zzso
