zzso zzso zzso possesses a small zzso island that is involved in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This island appears to have been zzso acquired as it is flanked by zzso zzso sequences and has a much lower zzso content than the average zzso zzso zzso Most of the gene products zzso by the island are zzso of proteins that have been shown to be involved in zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso specific as zzso of them results in the loss of only a band for the zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso and zzso of zzso affects only zzso this finding supports the notion that zzso zzso occurs within the cell before the zzso are exported and assembled and not at the surface once the sugar has been zzso The proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are thought to make up a zzso acid zzso pathway, and zzso of any of these genes resulted in the loss of zzso zzso zzso and a band for the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso acid was shown to be present on both zzso zzso that make up the polar zzso filament, to be present in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain, and to be absent from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
