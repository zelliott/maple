We investigated the composition and the basis of zzso expansion in the core zzso zzso using zzso zzso the zzso donor of bread zzso We zzso an unfiltered zzso shotgun zzso and a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso and analyzed wheat expressed sequence tags zzso to estimate the expression of genes and zzso elements zzso The sampled zzso sequences consisted of zzso repetitive zzso zzso known zzso and zzso zzso sequences of unknown zzso zzso constituted zzso of the zzso compared with 50% in zzso and zzso in zzso The DNA zzso constituted zzso of the zzso compared with zzso in zzso zzso were zzso zzso within and among elements and families, and most were transcribed which contributed to zzso expansion in the core zzso zzso The copy number of a majority of repeat families increased gradually following zzso Certain TE families occupied discrete zzso zzso zzso insertions and illegitimate zzso occurred extensively between the TE families, and a majority of the zzso contained internal zzso The zzso content varied significantly among the three sequence sets examined ranging from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso in the zzso Based on enrichment of zzso zzso zzso offers one option, although not as efficient as in zzso for zzso zzso regions from the large zzso of zzso
