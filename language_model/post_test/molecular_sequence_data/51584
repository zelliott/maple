In an effort to identify zzso factors regulating specific zzso we cloned a novel human zzso zzso The zzso clone contains a predicted open reading frame coding for a potential zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso corresponding to zzso is zzso distributed, and the gene is zzso zzso zzso analyses with several cell lines indicate that the protein is localized to the zzso zzso analysis revealed unusual features of the predicted protein structure, including four completely zzso zzso The zzso conservation of zzso the ubiquity of its zzso its nuclear zzso and its ability to bind DNA zzso raise the possibility that zzso may play a role in the organization of zzso zzso and/or in zzso zzso
