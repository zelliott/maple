The protein product of the zzso zzso has been implicated in the normal development of zzso cells zzso and zzso We have previously shown that 151 base pairs of zzso zzso sequences are sufficient for zzso zzso expression and include functional binding sites for zzso zzso and a novel nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Simon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso This novel zzso zzso factor, termed zzso zzso expression zzso binds to a zzso element that is located at zzso -9 to zzso of the zzso promoter between two zzso binding sites (at zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso which bind zzso We now show that a zzso binding site exists in the zzso zzso regulatory region of a second zzso the zzso pair zzso of chicken zzso The zzso zzso site is immediately zzso to a zzso 1 site, analogous to their arrangement in the zzso promoter, and allows the formation of a preliminary zzso consensus site, zzso This consensus site does not match any sites for known zzso zzso zzso although zzso binds immediately 3' of the zzso site in both the zzso promoter and the chicken zzso zzso zzso we show that they bind zzso The zzso sites are required for high levels of zzso by both the zzso and the zzso promoter in transient zzso zzso zzso elimination of the zzso zzso site zzso all zzso activity of this zzso zzso zzso of the adjacent zzso site in either the zzso promoter or the zzso reduces activity by approximately zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso cells requires zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso binding activity consists of a single zzso protein in both human and zzso cell zzso zzso binding activity is not affected by zzso that specifically recognize a number of cloned zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that we have identified a novel zzso factor that is functionally important for the expression of at least two zzso zzso zzso
