The binding of a synthetic zzso junction in DNA by T4 zzso zzso has been studied using gel zzso and footprint zzso Two specific zzso complexes have been observed, but only one is stable in the presence of moderate zzso of zzso The footprint of T4 zzso zzso in the zzso complex has been zzso using zzso zzso generated by the reaction of zzso with hydrogen zzso The zzso radical zzso pattern indicates protection of approximately 5 zzso in two strands that are zzso opposed across the junction zzso
