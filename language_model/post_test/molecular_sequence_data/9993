Although the zzso membrane contains only a small set of major zzso more sensitive zzso indicate the presence of a plethora of zzso zzso We have used an zzso zzso approach to zzso block the differentiation of zzso into zzso cells, and, in combination with a differential screening zzso identified novel zzso that are activated during this zzso One zzso zzso recognizes a zzso zzso that is strongly zzso in zzso after release of the differentiation block and that is expressed at high levels in brain tissue during active zzso This zzso represents at least two zzso differing from each other in their zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso with a predicted zzso of zzso that contains two regions zzso to zzso zinc finger zzso zzso zzso studies suggest the enriched presence of zzso in zzso structures along the major zzso processes of zzso zzso along with zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso cells, form a novel family of proteins with multiple zzso zzso possibly serving as membrane spanning zzso We zzso that in zzso zzso encodes a protein factor involved in zzso zzso
