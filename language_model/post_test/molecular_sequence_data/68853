The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso is preceded by base pairing of the zzso to the internal guide sequence zzso at the zzso end of the zzso to form a short zzso duplex zzso zzso interactions between zzso and the zzso core dock zzso into the active site of the zzso These include interactions between the zzso core and zzso of the zzso at zzso positions zzso and perhaps zzso In this study, zzso of the zzso strand that contribute to zzso recognition by the zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso positions zzso were individually modified to either zzso or zzso within full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso generated using T4 DNA zzso zzso and kinetic characterization of the resulting zzso zzso zzso justify the following zzso zzso zzso at zzso positions zzso and zzso play a critical energetic role in zzso zzso into the zzso core, contributing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The loss of binding energy is manifest primarily as an increase in the rate of zzso Because turnover for the zzso zzso is limited by product zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display up to a zzso increase in the zzso rate at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions are energetically coupled with the zzso interactions made to the zzso consistent with zzso becoming zzso from its binding site in zzso upon substitution of either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso loses energetic zzso between zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that in this zzso the zzso zzso is also zzso from its binding site in zzso the proposed site of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in combinations with previous studies four zzso zzso are implicated as important for zzso The contributions of the zzso zzso interactions are not equivalent and follow the zzso order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso appears to mediate zzso zzso into both zzso and zzso it may serve as the molecular linchpin for the recognition of zzso by the zzso zzso
