A unique zzso zzso influenza virus has so far caused zzso cases with 44 zzso zzso the host factors contributing to disease severity, we found that lower levels of plasma inflammatory zzso on hospital admission correlated with faster recovery in 18 patients with zzso influenza virus, whereas high zzso of (in zzso zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso were zzso of a less favorable or fatal zzso Analysis of zzso zzso samples showed up to zzso greater zzso levels relative to zzso Furthermore, patients with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had more rapid disease progression and were less likely to zzso Compared with patients with the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso patients with the zzso zzso had a shorter time from disease onset to the time point when they sought medical aid zzso admission or zzso zzso and a shorter zzso to development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome stage zzso by shorter intervals between clinical onset and zzso treatments and higher rates of mechanical zzso zzso as well as experiencing zzso lung virus zzso and zzso production and higher zzso The present analysis provides reported data on the zzso zzso zzso zzso at the site of infection in humans and identifies the zzso zzso that compromises zzso function as a primary genetic correlate of severe zzso zzso Together with zzso sequencing, early monitoring of plasma zzso is thus of zzso value for the treatment and management of severe influenza zzso
