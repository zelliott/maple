Thirteen strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso spotted zzso zzso zzso and plains zzso zzso zzso in Tanzania were characterized by zzso and zzso zzso Although the colony appearance of the zzso zzso wildlife strains differed from that of the zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso all zzso reactions of the wildlife strains were similar to those of the type zzso In addition, all wildlife strains produced zzso and were capable of zzso zzso three strains zzso zzso zzso but only eight strains zzso produced acid from zzso zzso indicated that different clones of zzso zzso were distributed among the zzso and zebra populations in the study zzso zzso zzso patterns in zzso and zebra strains suggest that a direct transmission of zzso zzso between these species may zzso The presence of a zzso protein zzso gene was demonstrated in all zzso zzso strains including the type zzso zzso of the zzso protein gene revealed a zzso region within the deduced zzso acid zzso Most of the strains clustered with previously described strains based on the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated that identical zzso protein sequences were shared among zzso zzso strains from different host zzso
