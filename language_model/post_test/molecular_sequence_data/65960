A large number of novel compounds with significant medical potential have been isolated from zzso motivating efforts to develop techniques for the sustainable zzso of sponge zzso To date, 33 sponges from nine different orders have been examined to assess their ability to be cultured in zzso However, little consideration has been given to the relationships between these zzso only one report has considering the zzso relationships between the zzso On the basis of zzso data, no zzso specificity was apparent as an indicator for the successful zzso of the zzso As the systematic zzso of the zzso is poorly zzso we collated available information on the success of in zzso sponge cell zzso reports and examined the zzso relationships of these sponges through the use of zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso Based on molecular data, the ability of sponges to form primary zzso from the zzso cells of marine zzso indicates that zzso trends may exist, emphasizing the need to better characterize sponges being investigated for zzso zzso
