zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso are clustered in a small region of one zzso Genes are grouped within this locus according to their expression in either early, middle, or late stages of zzso The entire set of late genes and a large fraction of the middle genes have been cloned and extensively zzso We report here the first molecular characterization of a set of early zzso genes clustered within a zzso zzso zzso zzso to these genes appear in the very first zzso zzso but disappear with different zzso One of the three early zzso zzso is the first example of a zzso gene which is not a member of a zzso family, or zzso paired with another zzso zzso The other two early zzso zzso and zzso are zzso paired with each other in the manner of the middle and late zzso zzso The common zzso region between zzso and zzso is significantly shorter and does not contain certain sequence elements shared by the highly zzso zzso regions of middle and late zzso gene zzso This evidence taken together with the fact that zzso is zzso indicates that the early genes may zzso a regulatory mechanism somewhat different from the middle and late gene zzso
