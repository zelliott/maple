zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso inject a repertoire of zzso proteins into host cells via a type III zzso system zzso zzso by the locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein initially identified in zzso that was shown to inhibit the host innate immune zzso In this study, we found zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso zzso by the LEE was able to inject these different zzso zzso into host zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso inhibited the zzso innate immune response via a zzso zzso However, an zzso zzso zzso zzso was still able to inhibit zzso zzso transfer to the nucleus in infected cells zzso by zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso In addition, no difference in the inflammatory response was observed between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the rabbit zzso zzso loop zzso These results suggest that zzso is not the sole zzso protein involved in the zzso of the host innate immune system during zzso zzso zzso
