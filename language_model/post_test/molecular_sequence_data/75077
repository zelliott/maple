We have mapped the zzso regulatory elements required in zzso for initiation at the human zzso promoter by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was used to evaluate the zzso zzso of clustered base substitution zzso in the human zzso zzso The promoter consists of two major zzso a large upstream region, composed of several zzso that lies between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso initiation site and affects zzso up to zzso and a core element that lies between zzso zzso and zzso and affects zzso up to zzso The upstream region is able to retain partial function when positioned within zzso zzso of the zzso initiation site, but it cannot stimulate zzso from distances of greater than or equal to 600 zzso In addition, we zzso using zzso hybrid zzso zzso that the sequences responsible for human zzso zzso in zzso appear to reside in both the core and upstream zzso and sequences from the mouse zzso promoter cannot be zzso for zzso
