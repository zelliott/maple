zzso oxide zzso is essential for normal zzso but excessive production of NO during inflammatory processes can damage the neighboring zzso zzso nitrogen oxide species zzso including zzso zzso are powerful zzso zzso Biological protein zzso is involved in several disease states, including inflammatory diseases, and it is evident by detection of zzso zzso in inflamed zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso modifications zzso in human zzso by accurate mass measurement as well as by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso on zzso zzso were zzso Also characterized were zzso of all three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso as well as zzso zzso determined as zzso acid on zzso and zzso acid on zzso zzso and zzso These modifications are detected in zzso freshly isolated from human blood and the zzso of modifications were zzso relative to the reference peptides by zzso liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso under the selected reaction monitoring zzso zzso The results showed a statistically significant positive correlation between cigarette smoking and the zzso of zzso zzso at zzso and at zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on identification and zzso of multiple zzso in zzso from human blood and association of a specific zzso zzso with cigarette zzso This highly sensitive and specific zzso only requires zzso isolated from one drop zzso zzso of zzso Thus, measurement of these zzso in zzso might be feasible for assessing zzso stress in zzso
