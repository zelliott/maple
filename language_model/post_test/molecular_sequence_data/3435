This report deals with the molecular characterization of a zzso difference analysis zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Genome Database zzso zzso zzso and zzso from three zzso twin pairs zzso for schizophrenia zzso The results suggest that it is a zzso heavily zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence of the human zzso We have mapped this sequence to zzso using two zzso positive zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso Database zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso zzso End sequencing of the zzso zzso clone has allowed identification of nearby genes from the human zzso database at zzso that may be of interest in schizophrenia zzso These include zzso sequences zzso hot spots for zzso zzso channel, and signal zzso zzso as well as genes affecting expression of certain receptors in zzso Furthermore, when used as a probe on Southern zzso zzso detected no difference between schizophrenia patients from southwestern Ontario and their matched zzso However, it identified zzso zzso in one of the eight patients and none of the 21 unaffected zzso Although additional experiments will be required to establish the significance, if any, of zzso zzso in the complex zzso of zzso molecular results included offer a novel insight into the role of zzso sequences in the origin, organization, and regulation of the human zzso
