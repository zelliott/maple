The loop between zzso 6 and zzso 6 in the zzso active site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in discriminating between gaseous zzso zzso and zzso Based on numerous zzso crystal structures, loop 6 is either closed or open depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of zzso zzso The zzso zzso folds over loop 6 in the closed zzso prompting speculation that it may trigger or latch loop 6 zzso Because an zzso crystal structure of tobacco zzso revealed that zzso is located at a site in the open form that is occupied by the zzso group of zzso in the closed form, it was proposed that zzso may serve as the latch that holds the zzso zzso over loop zzso To assess the zzso of zzso in zzso we used directed zzso and zzso transformation of the green zzso zzso zzso to create zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso strains can grow zzso indicating that zzso is not essential for zzso However, both zzso caused zzso decreases in zzso zzso efficiency zzso and approximately zzso decreases in zzso zzso If the zzso zzso is required for stabilizing loop 6 in the closed zzso there must be additional zzso at the zzso zzso 6 interface that contribute to this zzso Considering that zzso at zzso zzso can influence zzso zzso further study of interactions between loop 6 and the zzso zzso may provide clues for engineering an improved zzso
