We used a panel of zzso zzso to zzso zzso to select 18 escape zzso of zzso influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso and the sequencing of zzso genes revealed two minimally overlapping zzso We mapped the zzso acid changes to two areas of the recently reported three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso The grouping of the zzso relevant zzso acid positions in zzso zzso differs from the pattern observed in zzso and zzso zzso Several positions in site B of zzso zzso are distributed in two sites of zzso zzso Unlike any zzso analyzed so far, zzso zzso does not contain an zzso site corresponding to site A in zzso zzso zzso 145 and 193 zzso zzso which in zzso zzso belong to sites A and B, respectively, are within one site in zzso zzso This finding is consistent with the zzso of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso that is, the absence from zzso zzso of the lateral loop that forms site A in zzso and the equivalent site in zzso zzso The escape zzso analyzed displayed zzso variations, including decreased zzso for mice and changes in affinity for zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a correlation between zzso differences in three-dimensional structure and variations among zzso in the distribution of zzso zzso Our findings also suggest that zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso may be important in the evolution of zzso influenza virus, a possible zzso agent of a future zzso
