The zzso zzso b gene zzso of zzso coli was fused to the gene for zzso protein zzso The zzso gene was cloned into the zzso zzso using zzso The construct consists of the signal sequence of zzso zzso which directs the export of the fusion protein to the zzso and the zzso protein fused to the zzso zzso A sequence zzso a factor zzso zzso site is present between zzso and zzso The fused genes are controlled by zzso a strong zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the zzso strain expressed a 47 zzso zzso which was easily zzso from zzso shock fluid by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the fusion protein with factor zzso generated the zzso protein zzso zzso and a zzso of approximately 5 zzso corresponding to the molecular mass of mature zzso A zzso zzso rabbit zzso raised against zzso zzso reacted in zzso with the fusion protein and the zzso zzso A positive response was observed when testing the zzso shock fluid containing the fusion protein in a rat zzso loop zzso On average, zzso zzso of zzso protein was recovered per zzso of induced zzso zzso
