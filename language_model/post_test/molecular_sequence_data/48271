Transport of zzso streak virus zzso DNA into the nucleus of host cells is essential for virus replication and the presence of virus particles in the zzso of infected cells implies that coat protein zzso must enter the zzso To see if zzso is imported into the nucleus in the absence of other viral gene products, the zzso zzso gene was expressed in insect cells with a zzso zzso system, and also in tobacco zzso with a cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso transient gene expression zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso accumulated in the zzso of both insect and tobacco zzso zzso of a potential nuclear zzso signal in the zzso resulted in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We have shown previously that the zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso zzso viral zzso To investigate if zzso might also be involved in viral DNA nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso viral zzso or zzso DNA, was zzso into zzso and tobacco zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso DNA moved into the nucleus when zzso with the zzso but not with zzso coli proteins zzso These results suggest that, in addition to entering the nucleus where it is required for zzso of the viral zzso DNA, the zzso zzso zzso the rapid transport of viral zzso or zzso DNA into the zzso
