zzso zzso and zzso transport zzso a zzso essential for zzso play important roles in embryonic development and cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso is required for the early development of zzso sensory outer segments zzso an elaborate zzso that sequesters the many proteins zzso the zzso zzso As in other zzso and zzso zzso members of the zzso 2 family have been implicated as the zzso zzso motor in zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso 2 zzso plays an essential role in some, but not all sensory zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is known for its role in zzso trafficking in zzso but a function in zzso has not been zzso We show that in zzso zzso is widely expressed in the nervous system and zzso In zzso zzso zzso with zzso proteins within the zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso has little if any effect in early zzso including the formation of zzso sensory zzso in the zzso However, zzso formation and targeting of the visual zzso protein is severely zzso Our analysis shows that zzso is essential for zzso zzso development, and suggests that zzso plays a cell type specific role in zzso zzso
