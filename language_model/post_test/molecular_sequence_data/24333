Individual peptides with zzso at the zzso as well as protein zzso zzso were reacted with zzso converting zzso zzso to their zzso zzso The mass zzso of zzso zzso exhibit a greater number of more intense features than their zzso counterparts, thus increasing the information obtained in zzso mapping zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of the zzso peptides are greatly simplified in comparison to their native species, yielding primarily an easily zzso series of zzso Finally, this novel label also enables differential zzso studies, as a stable zzso form containing four zzso atoms can readily be zzso
