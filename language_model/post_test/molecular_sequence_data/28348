The structures of four novel zzso present in the amplified DNA of a Syrian zzso cell line highly resistant to zzso were zzso Novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were formed by zzso between two regions of zzso DNA, whereas joint zzso is the end point of an zzso zzso A fraction of the zzso copies displays a zzso structure in the zzso zzso zzso The formation of zzso and zzso apparently involved a simple breakage and joining of the two zzso zzso whereas extra zzso are present at the junction point of zzso and zzso The two regions of the zzso DNA which have zzso to form zzso zzso and zzso show few sequence similarities, indicating that these zzso probably resulted from zzso zzso zzso regions are present in the vicinity of the zzso for the four zzso and eight of 10 crossover points could be associated with putative zzso I zzso zzso Our results indicate that different types of novel zzso are present in the amplified DNA of this cell line, which was isolated after several steps of zzso
