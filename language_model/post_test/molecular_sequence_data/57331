Previous studies from this laboratory have suggested the presence of zzso molecules on the surface of zzso zzso zzso We now report the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein which has an equivalent molecular size zzso zzso is zzso similar and exhibits significant zzso acid sequence zzso to zzso zzso The similarities in molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B of zzso zzso the close zzso acid sequence zzso between the zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso zzso and zzso B of zzso zzso and the zzso similarity of the zzso zzso protein with zzso indicates that this family of zzso proteins are closely zzso The known characteristics of zzso zzso zzso B zzso binding zzso disruption of complement zzso and the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso suggests that this class of proteins may be multifunctional, fulfilling not only a structural role but also as components interacting with the host immune system to increase zzso zzso
