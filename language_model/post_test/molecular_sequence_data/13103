The zzso loop of zzso coli zzso zzso is a zzso structure involved in the binding of zzso factors Tu and G and is the site of action of the zzso proteins zzso One such group, the zzso zzso act by the removal of a single zzso zzso zzso believed to exist in a zzso zzso zzso The action of two zzso the zzso zzso from the zzso toxic zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which are known to be highly zzso in zzso structure, was determined on native zzso or naked zzso zzso containing zzso designed to affect the structure of the zzso zzso One such zzso zzso containing zzso which zzso the potential zzso by zzso the zzso zzso involved in closing it, resulted in a loss of zzso by zzso but not by zzso A similar result was observed for zzso zzso The double zzso zzso + zzso which restores the zzso zzso but in the reverse orientation, resulted in sensitivity to both zzso and zzso as in the zzso Thus, the zzso structure is required for the action of zzso but not of zzso and unlike zzso zzso does not require G at position zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso which lies outside the zzso served as a zzso for both zzso and zzso The comparison of the recognition elements for zzso and zzso was made with naked zzso zzso because zzso does not act on zzso coli zzso However, zzso is active on zzso coli zzso and it was found that the action of zzso on zzso containing the above zzso paralleled exactly that on the corresponding naked zzso It is concluded that the recognition elements for zzso and zzso differ and may account, at least in part, for the fact that zzso but not zzso zzso the zzso of zzso coli zzso
