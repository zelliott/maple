We identified and isolated a zzso zzso gene which, when zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of cells expressing a zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of as yet unknown function which, nonetheless, has human, rice, and zzso zzso zzso with high degrees zzso zzso of zzso acid sequence zzso zzso is not an essential zzso but zzso strains do not grow above 37 degrees C and show some zzso defects at 30 degrees C as zzso This gene is expressed at both 30 and 38 degrees C, producing little or no differences in zzso levels at these two zzso zzso of zzso could not complement an zzso zzso indicating that suppression was not due to the bypassing of zzso zzso Of 10 other zzso zzso tested, five could also be suppressed by zzso zzso There were no common zzso zzso of the strains expressing these zzso that give any clue as to why they were zzso while others were zzso An zzso zzso virus zzso form of zzso in single copy zzso an zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to be at comparable levels and in similar multiply modified forms in cells growing at both 30 and 38 degrees zzso Surprisingly, when localized either by cell zzso procedures or by zzso these proteins were found not in zzso but in the zzso The zzso of zzso had significant effects on the cellular levels of zzso zzso the proteins zzso and zzso two other zzso protein zzso but not on zzso zzso a number of other zzso or zzso proteins zzso The implications of these findings are zzso
