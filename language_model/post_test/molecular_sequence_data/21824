zzso plays a critical role in DNA replication regulation by controlling zzso In zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso which is triggered by DNA binding of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and that DNA loading of zzso is needed for zzso zzso after DNA damage and in S zzso zzso of this zzso by ultraviolet zzso DNA damage requires upstream involvement of zzso zzso repair or zzso repair zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which both have basic zzso zzso function zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso of zzso which occurs after DNA damage, reduces zzso zzso This provides a mechanism for zzso the activity of the zzso zzso towards zzso allowing zzso zzso to be more efficient in S phase than after DNA zzso
