The zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated using the zzso coli zzso gene as a zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to those characterized from other bacteria revealed three distinct zzso of zzso zzso one of which consists of the zzso zzso zzso and those from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified to contain six zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used to replace the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These strains were unaffected in growth and zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso zzso was competent to carry out all essential zzso zzso During a zzso zzso highly zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso affinity zzso followed by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso the affinity zzso zzso zzso was shown to initiate zzso correctly from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An extension of this procedure yielded zzso core zzso zzso To facilitate introduction of the zzso zzso into other genetic backgrounds, a zzso in the adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in zzso zzso to provide a genetic marker to follow transfer of the zzso zzso The use of this affinity zzso zzso in combination with the ability to introduce the zzso zzso into different zzso strains by zzso will greatly facilitate the zzso analysis of zzso in members of this zzso
