zzso inhibit zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso can be demonstrated in cells that are arrested in late zzso This observation indicates that zzso of zzso expression is not dependent upon zzso within the cell cycle but is due to zzso regulation of this zzso zzso studies have been carried out using zzso genes in which restriction fragments of the zzso promoter were fused to zzso zzso or zzso zzso These zzso reporters were zzso for stable expression and zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso A zzso fragment, extending from zzso to zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso start site, was capable of both zzso and zzso zzso of reporter zzso The extent of zzso by zzso was similar to that observed for the zzso zzso and no increase in zzso expression or the extent of zzso was observed with zzso containing additional zzso zzso The zzso zzso core promoter zzso binds to zzso factors in extracts from zzso zzso Control cell extracts contain factors that bind to and protect (from zzso I) a zzso promoter element from zzso to zzso zzso relative to the zzso start zzso A second, zzso element was protected at zzso to zzso zzso The zzso element of the zzso promoter resembles an zzso zzso II zzso zzso No other elements were zzso zzso inhibit the amount or activity of the zzso factor that binds to this zzso element within the zzso zzso This element, when fused to upstream zzso sequences from the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso promoter, conveys zzso sensitivity in zzso
