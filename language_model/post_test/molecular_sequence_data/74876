We have isolated two dominant zzso from screening approximately 50,000 zzso zzso lines that have short zzso zzso The zzso zzso were inserted near a putative basic zzso zzso gene and expression of this gene was increased in the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso gene produced the original zzso zzso indicating it was responsible for the zzso zzso expression was observed during seed zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso OF zzso zzso gene caused small and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso showed retarded growth after the heart stage although abnormal zzso and pattern formation of the zzso and zzso was not zzso We named this zzso gene zzso zzso expression was determined in zzso cells using the zzso reporter gene and reverse zzso chain zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso chain reaction analysis showed specific zzso of putative zzso motif zzso genes in the zzso zzso indicating possible involvement of these genes in seed zzso These data suggest that zzso expression in the zzso at the heart stage of zzso development plays an important role in controlling zzso zzso
