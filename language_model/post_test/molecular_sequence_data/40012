Human organic zzso zzso 3 zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso of the kidney and plays a major role in the urinary zzso of a variety of organic zzso The promoter region of zzso was characterized to zzso the mechanism underlying the zzso expression of zzso The minimal promoter of zzso was identified to be located approximately 300 base pairs upstream of the zzso start site, where there are zzso zzso and zzso nuclear factor zzso binding zzso which are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso markedly increased zzso promoter activity, where the zzso potency of zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso in the zzso binding motif prevented the zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated binding of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso to the zzso zzso It was also demonstrated that the promoter activity of zzso is zzso by DNA zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso was activated de zzso by forced expression of zzso alone or both zzso and zzso together with the zzso DNA zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells that lack expression of zzso zzso and zzso whereas forced expression of zzso alone could not activate the expression of zzso This suggests a synergistic action of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and DNA zzso for the zzso expression of zzso These results indicate that the zzso expression of zzso might be regulated by the concerted effect of genetic zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
