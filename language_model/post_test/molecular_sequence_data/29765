zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso It grows in fully defined media without requiring serum, which zzso zzso zzso We have constructed a series of expression systems that allows expression of zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These cells can be readily zzso with zzso DNA by zzso and zzso selected with various zzso resistance zzso zzso signals and poorly defined regions within the zzso regions of genes are required for optimal expression of genes in zzso zzso therefore, inserted the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes A and B, which allows zzso of the target gene and spliced leader addition to the zzso marker zzso Part of the zzso region of the zzso locus was added upstream of the target gene to permit its zzso A zzso sequence from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also added to allow the zzso of the zzso marker zzso Genes can be readily inserted using a multiple cloning site and can be expressed as a fusion protein with a zzso sequence at either the N or zzso or fused with green fluorescent zzso zzso active proteins can be expressed in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso by affinity zzso using a metal zzso zzso
