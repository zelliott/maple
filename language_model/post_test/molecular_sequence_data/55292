zzso (also named zzso is a zzso gene located on the X zzso and encodes a protein harboring an zzso domain in human and zzso Although identified in 1988, the function of zzso remains zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso we generated a conditional zzso knockout mouse in which zzso 2 was flanked by two zzso zzso We obtained viable and fertile mice with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso transmission was confirmed by crossing the mouse bearing zzso targeted zzso with an zzso transgenic zzso zzso was successfully depleted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice are viable and exhibit normal development compared with zzso zzso within 6 months during our zzso We also observed that zzso knockout male mice were functionally normal in the zzso system where zzso was specifically zzso zzso and zzso conditional mice provide a tool for further zzso function analysis of the zzso protein under different zzso
