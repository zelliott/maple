zzso derived from vitamin B12 zzso are particularly important for core metabolism in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso is the main contributor of vitamin B12 to such zzso zzso In nature, there are both zzso and zzso pathways for B12 synthesis - the latter is only partly zzso Until now, there has been no investigation of B12 synthesis in zzso zzso which must use an zzso zzso This paper reports the cloning of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso which is responsible for the first committed steps in zzso zzso Five open reading frames were found in the cloned zzso All deduced zzso acid sequences had similarity to defined proteins in the databases that are involved in zzso and zzso zzso Of particular interest is the gene designated zzso + zzso which encodes a single zzso possessing two zzso functions - zzso III zzso and zzso III zzso This zzso converts zzso to zzso The functions of the protein coded by zzso + zzso were established by zzso expression in zzso zzso The zzso activity has been demonstrated for three distinct types of proteins - zzso zzso with zzso formation and, this report, zzso with zzso III zzso The type found in zzso zzso zzso + zzso is probably restricted to zzso zzso zzso zzso
