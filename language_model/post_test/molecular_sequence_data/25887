A zzso zzso zzso restriction fragment, which increases the production of several zzso zzso including alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was cloned in zzso zzso from the DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene (named zzso showed a positive gene dosage effect on production of zzso zzso When the zzso gene was introduced into cells in high copy numbers it delayed the formation of zzso and spores in zzso zzso and also retarded zzso production in zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso with specific bands in the DNA of several zzso strains zzso A 1 zzso zzso containing the zzso gene was zzso and contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of Mr zzso This zzso is contained within a zzso of 432 zzso which retained activity in zzso A zzso with promoter activity is present upstream of the zzso reading zzso The predicted zzso zzso has a strong positive charge, and does not show a typical zzso acid composition for a membrane zzso and contains a zzso domain similar to those found in several regulatory zzso
