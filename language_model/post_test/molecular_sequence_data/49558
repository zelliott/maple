zzso are a group of small zzso proteins involved in cellular zzso regulatory processes as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso and share structural and functional zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso a functional zzso and zzso system have been demonstrated and are considered to be attractive targets for zzso drug zzso Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel 22 zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso As demonstrated by in zzso sequence zzso the zzso named zzso zzso is highly zzso but found exclusively in zzso zzso It is a member of the zzso zzso but clusters separately from other members in a zzso zzso We amplified the gene from a zzso zzso library and zzso it in zzso zzso The zzso gene product can be reduced by zzso but much faster by zzso like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is active in an zzso zzso and reduces zzso zzso with a rate constant of 640 zzso at pH zzso and 25 degrees zzso zzso reduction of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso is zzso Furthermore, zzso provides electrons for zzso zzso the zzso catalyzing the first step of DNA zzso As demonstrated by Western zzso the protein is present in zzso forms of zzso zzso Based on these results, zzso offers the opportunity to improve diagnostic tools based on zzso or zzso zzso It may also represent a specific target for zzso drug development and is of zzso zzso
