zzso studies in zzso zzso have been hindered by the lack of a zzso zzso zzso Currently, the only zzso marker is zzso a zzso form of the zzso zzso gene that encodes the B zzso of DNA zzso and zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso The utility of the zzso zzso gene for targeted gene disruption is limited by a high frequency of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso resistance gene zzso was introduced into zzso zzso and its use as a zzso marker was explored in an effort to improve the genetic manipulation of this zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene expressed from its native promoter were susceptible to zzso In striking contrast, zzso with the zzso gene expressed from either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso promoter were resistant to high levels of zzso The zzso resistance marker allows efficient direct selection of zzso in zzso zzso and hence is a significant improvement in the ability to construct zzso zzso strains in this zzso
