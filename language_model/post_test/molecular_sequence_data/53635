We report here on the cloning and functional characterization of the protein responsible for the system A zzso acid transport activity that is known to be expressed in most zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso was cloned from rat skeletal zzso It is distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of 504 zzso acids and bears significant zzso to zzso and system N zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in rat zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso mediates zzso transport of zzso acid, a specific model zzso for system zzso The zzso is specific for neutral zzso zzso It is zzso and zzso The zzso acid zzso is zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso transport of neutral zzso acids via zzso is associated with inward zzso The zzso current is zzso and zzso The zzso acid transport system A is particularly known for its zzso and hormonal regulation, and therefore the successful cloning of the protein responsible for this transport activity represents a significant step toward understanding the function and expression of this zzso in various zzso and pathological zzso
