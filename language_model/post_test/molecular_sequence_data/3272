The zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso patterning and cell fate determination, involving stabilization of nuclear and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso factors and activates the expression of growth regulatory target genes such as zzso or zzso zzso In zzso and other zzso zzso zzso signaling results frequently from zzso in one or more zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in nuclear and/or zzso zzso of zzso In the present study, the most frequent zzso in the zzso and zzso genes were investigated in primary zzso zzso tumors and cell zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso of different stages and grades and 4 cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated for zzso zzso deletions by loss of zzso zzso zzso The most frequent zzso regions of zzso zzso box in the third zzso and zzso zzso cluster zzso were directly zzso zzso expression was analyzed by zzso in the cell zzso zzso at the zzso gene locus on zzso zzso was found in 7 of 72 zzso of the zzso zzso No zzso were found in either zzso or zzso A previously described zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in 8 tumors and 3 cell zzso All cell lines showed normal zzso zzso zzso without evidence for nuclear or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which are the most frequent zzso zzso zzso in many tumor types, are rare events in zzso zzso Other zzso zzso members, such as zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso
