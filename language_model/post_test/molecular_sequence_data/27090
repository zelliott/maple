The pepper zzso zzso bacterial spot zzso resistance gene zzso and its zzso zzso zzso mediate recognition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso type III zzso protein zzso and its deletion zzso zzso zzso specificity resides in the zzso and zzso promoters and is determined by a defined promoter region, the zzso (for zzso by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we defined the exact boundaries of the zzso box of the zzso promoter and the zzso box of the zzso promoter and show that both boxes overlap by at least 11 zzso Despite partial sequence identity, the zzso box and the zzso box were bound specifically by the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso respectively, suggesting that selective promoter binding of zzso proteins is the basis for promoter zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso box retains its functionality at different positions within the pepper zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso in a novel promoter zzso zzso the transfer of the zzso box to different promoter locations is always correlated with a new zzso start zzso The analysis of naturally occurring zzso zzso revealed many pepper zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso These zzso showed no apparent zzso supporting the supposition that zzso functions only in disease resistance and not in other zzso or zzso zzso
