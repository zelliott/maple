The zzso zzso which leads to the zzso zzso of zzso diversity, and joining zzso is the mechanism accountable for the diversity of T cell zzso and zzso zzso The products of the zzso and zzso genes are the zzso factors responsible for the initiation of the zzso zzso through the generation of a DNA double strand zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso in the mouse leads to abortion of the zzso zzso process, early block in both T and B cell zzso and, ultimately, to severe combined immune zzso zzso A human zzso condition is also characterized by an absence of mature T and B zzso and is associated with zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso Based on the predicted zzso three-dimensional structure model for zzso we found that six out of the seven zzso described to date in zzso patients are clustered on one side of the zzso in regions exposed to zzso This finding reinforces the biological significance of this predicted model and suggests that zzso interacts with zzso on one of the side of the scaffold formed by the zzso
