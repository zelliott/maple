The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described to accommodate two species formerly assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bona zzso is restored from zzso based on zzso zzso The new zzso is biologically associated with the plant family zzso of the order zzso and is endemic to the zzso Our molecular analysis of zzso nuclear genes failed to zzso place zzso in the zzso zzso but revealed that this zzso is distinct from either zzso zzso + zzso and zzso The distinctiveness of zzso is also supported by zzso traits in wing zzso zzso zzso of the last zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the adult and life zzso A key to the species of zzso is zzso The zzso zzso in external zzso coupled with minor differences in zzso traits, an apparent narrow specialization on zzso host plants, restricted geographical range and molecular evidence based on zzso genes jointly suggest that the generic diversification of zzso is a relatively old phenomenon and driven strongly by host zzso
