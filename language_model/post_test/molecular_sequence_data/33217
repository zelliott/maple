In an attempt to discover novel zzso proteins in type 2 diabetes zzso we investigated the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zzso zzso on the differential levels of plasma proteins in zzso mice using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated that 92 spots from about 900 zzso spots were zzso zzso of which 40 spots were identified as principal zzso zzso By comparing control with zzso mice, we found that at least six proteins were significantly altered in zzso mice, including zzso zzso IV, zzso zzso zzso protein 4, and zzso and their levels were interestingly zzso after zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the altered levels of the two regulatory molecules highlighted in diabetes and obesity zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso in response to zzso The Mouse Diabetes zzso zzso profiles showed that the expression of 84 genes related to the zzso development, and progression of diabetes were significantly zzso in liver, zzso and muscle of zzso zzso zzso might act as a potent regulator of gene expression for a wide variety of genes in zzso mice, particularly in zzso insulin resistance, and complications from diabetes zzso
