The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso after 1 h of exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso largely by the loss of receptors from the cell surface and zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso in the zzso tail is essential for zzso early zzso presumably by serving as a primary zzso site for G zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we determined that zzso was also responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed 50% reduction of zzso zzso zzso compared with wild type zzso zzso upon 1 h of exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso toxin treatment, indicating involvement of a mechanism independent of G protein zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked wild type zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso wild type zzso zzso was completely zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso at zzso zzso indicating that the zzso was a direct zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the four zzso zzso zzso resulted in complete zzso of the G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso by two distinct cellular signal zzso zzso One is G zzso and zzso which can be abolished by zzso toxin treatment of wild type zzso or by zzso of zzso The other novel zzso is G zzso but zzso zzso blocked by zzso treatment, and one in which zzso has no regulatory role but zzso of zzso zzso appears zzso
