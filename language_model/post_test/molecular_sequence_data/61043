Mechanical induction of growth factor synthesis may mediate zzso responses of smooth muscle cells zzso to increases in physical zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso mechanical stretch zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso an observation that suggests that this growth factor may be involved in zzso zzso zzso In the present study we provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor plays a critical role in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso with a series of zzso deletion zzso of a zzso construct containing zzso 7 zzso of the mouse zzso promoter that was previously shown to be stretch zzso The zzso increase in promoter activity was completely zzso with deletion of zzso positions zzso to zzso zzso of zzso as evaluated by zzso mobility shift zzso to a synthetic zzso containing an zzso binding site increased in response to stretch, and binding was inhibited by excess zzso DNA corresponding to zzso zzso to zzso from the zzso promoter, a region that contains a previously recognized composite zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso components of this zzso zzso with the promoter and zzso studies, zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso induction after zzso zzso also specifically increased zzso levels for zzso zzso zzso the promoter of which contains a functional zzso element, but not for zzso the promoter of which does not contain an zzso zzso The stretch response of the zzso gene was also completely inhibited by zzso zzso these findings indicate that zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in zzso muscle in response to mechanical zzso
