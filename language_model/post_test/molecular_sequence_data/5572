The human zzso zzso virus zzso is unique in its ability to target viral integration to a specific site on zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retain the ability to integrate but have apparently lost this ability to zzso In this report, we characterize the zzso integration for zzso zzso zzso and in zzso systems to gain a better understanding of these zzso Cell lines zzso for either zzso or zzso were characterized by a variety of techniques, including zzso Southern zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso More than 40 zzso integration junctions were zzso zzso and then subjected to comparison and zzso In both immortalized and normal zzso human cells, zzso zzso targeted integration to zzso Integrated zzso structures consisted of zzso tandem zzso with the majority of the junction sequences involving the zzso zzso terminal repeats zzso No complete viral zzso were directly zzso In some examples, the zzso zzso promoter sequence was found to be fused at the zzso zzso Data from dot zzso analysis of zzso products were consistent with the occurrence of zzso of zzso and/or viral DNA sequences at the zzso integration zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso junctions mapped to a subset of zzso zzso Southern analysis supported the integration of zzso from two independent cell lines at the same locus on zzso In addition, zzso terminal repeat sequences existed in both the flip and flop zzso with zzso evident at the zzso In all cases with the exception of the zzso the zzso integrated zzso zzso junction sequence data were consistent with the occurrence of zzso zzso by deletion and/or zzso at the integration zzso Finally, junctions formed in an in zzso system between several zzso zzso and the zzso target site were isolated and zzso Linear zzso zzso typically zzso the end of the virus DNA zzso as the point of integration, whereas products derived from zzso terminal repeat hairpin structures in the presence or absence of zzso protein resembled zzso junctions generated in zzso These results describing zzso zzso zzso and in zzso integration junctions suggest that the viral integration event itself is zzso by terminal repeat hairpin structures via zzso cellular zzso zzso with specificity for zzso in zzso requiring additional viral zzso These studies should have an important impact on the use of zzso zzso in human gene zzso
