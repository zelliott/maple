zzso protein A zzso is selectively zzso in zzso of cells lining the respiratory zzso where its expression is regulated by various zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso promoter is zzso by binding of zzso at four distinct zzso sites located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso sites zzso 1, 3, and 4 in combination markedly decreased zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso gene sequences from zzso to zzso In contrast, the same zzso enhanced zzso activity in zzso containing additional zzso zzso sequences from zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso elements within the region zzso to zzso influence effects of zzso on zzso promoter zzso A consensus zzso site was identified within the region, located at positions zzso to zzso in the mouse zzso zzso of the zzso site decreased activity of zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, a cell line expressing zzso zzso also expressed zzso zzso bound to the zzso in the zzso gene as assessed by zzso mobility shift zzso While zzso of zzso cells with a zzso expression zzso activated the zzso zzso promoter about zzso zzso of zzso with zzso A and zzso to enhance zzso of zzso increased zzso activity of zzso zzso approximately zzso Taken together, the data support zzso of zzso gene promoter activity by zzso which acts at a zzso element in the zzso zzso
