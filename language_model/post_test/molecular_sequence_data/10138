zzso zzso which contain the sites for both zzso zzso and targeting zzso on their surfaces, were prepared as a novel carrier for genetic zzso The zzso were obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso by using either a zzso evaporation method or a zzso zzso The size of the particles prepared by the zzso method was controlled by varying the initial concentration of the graft zzso zzso as small as 60 zzso in diameter were successfully obtained from the graft zzso with high zzso contents but not from the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the surface of the zzso were found to interact specifically with a particular zzso as verified by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso capacity of the zzso was increased with increasing zzso contents in the graft zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the graft zzso on the zzso surface is different from that in zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso from the graft zzso exhibited resistance against zzso and zzso zzso of serum zzso presumably due to the zzso brush effect and/or exclusion effect from the zzso graft zzso These results suggest that the zzso prepared from zzso zzso and zzso zzso can serve as a good DNA carrier in zzso
