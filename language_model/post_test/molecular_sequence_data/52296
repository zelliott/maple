Type zzso and zzso von zzso disease zzso result from defects in von zzso factor zzso Although both type zzso and zzso zzso are characterized by the absence of high molecular weight zzso in zzso zzso from patients with type zzso zzso demonstrates a decreased affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso from patients with type zzso zzso show an increased affinity for zzso To investigate how structural zzso in zzso affect its interaction with zzso we reproduced the reported potential zzso in type zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and expressed the zzso proteins in zzso zzso The type zzso zzso potential zzso was represented by a zzso zzso which results in the substitution of zzso for zzso at position 875 in the mature zzso zzso zzso The type zzso zzso zzso zzso to a duplicated zzso zzso resulting in three zzso zzso starting at position zzso in the normal zzso sequence zzso The zzso composition and zzso structure of both zzso proteins were similar to the zzso zzso The zzso bound to fixed zzso in the presence of zzso similar to zzso zzso The zzso bound to fixed zzso in the absence of zzso The zzso appears to interact normally with zzso and the decreased affinity for the zzso zzso observed in plasma is probably a consequence of prior reduction in zzso size resulting from the zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso increases the zzso of zzso for its zzso zzso
