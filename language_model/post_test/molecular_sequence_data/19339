A marine zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso Island, Korea, in October zzso The strain produced zzso colonies on marine zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that the novel isolate belonged to the family zzso and showed relatively high sequence similarities with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on nearly complete zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the novel isolate shared a lineage with members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso rods producing zzso zzso zzso In contrast to all other members of the family zzso cells of zzso zzso were zzso by means of a polar zzso zzso growth occurred in the presence of zzso % zzso sea zzso zzso to zzso % zzso at pH 8 and at temperatures of zzso degrees zzso The novel strain required zzso zzso in addition to zzso for zzso The dominant fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso an unusually high value for members of the family zzso On the basis of these zzso zzso data, strain zzso zzso should be classified as representing a new zzso and novel species in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
