zzso is a serum protein consisting of two zzso zzso of 16 zzso which carries an 8 zzso zzso zzso chain, and heavy chain 3 zzso of 74 zzso The two zzso are linked through an zzso bond between an internal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso chain and the zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso and become linked as they pass through the zzso zzso zzso is zzso with both zzso and zzso extensions which are released during zzso zzso To be able to zzso the assembly of zzso in detail, we have cloned and zzso the zzso of rat zzso Upon expression of the protein in zzso cells, both zzso were found to be zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in the two zzso becoming zzso indicating that cells other than zzso may have the capacity to form zzso zzso zzso
