zzso proteins are zzso molecules that bind foreign and zzso and stimulate specific T cell zzso In the current study, we investigated zzso binding by zzso proteins by developing a fluorescent probe binding approach using soluble zzso human zzso zzso To increase stability and yield, soluble group 1 zzso zzso and zzso and group 2 zzso zzso proteins were produced as single chain zzso zzso proteins in which zzso was fused to the N zzso of the zzso heavy chains by a flexible zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso binding properties of single chain zzso zzso proteins by using fluorescent zzso zzso indicated significant differences in zzso preference and in pH dependence of binding by group 1 versus group 2 zzso zzso Whereas group 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso show stronger binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso group 2 zzso zzso proteins were stronger zzso of small zzso zzso such as zzso acid and zzso zzso Competition studies indicated that binding of fluorescent zzso zzso involved association of the probe with the zzso zzso binding groove of zzso zzso Analysis of selected zzso substitution zzso of human zzso known to inhibit zzso presentation showed that zzso zzso probe binding could be used to distinguish zzso that interfere with zzso binding from those that affect T cell zzso zzso Our findings provide further evidence for the functional specialization of different zzso zzso and demonstrate the value of the fluorescent zzso probe binding method for assisting zzso studies of zzso zzso
