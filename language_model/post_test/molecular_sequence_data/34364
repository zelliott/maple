zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors are the zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, which is critical for zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso can also function in a zzso zzso Recently, two novel classes of zzso zzso designated F1 and zzso have been identified in zzso The role of the zzso zzso proteins is zzso because the zzso zzso is not present in zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso play zzso roles in cell zzso and the coordination of cell and nuclear zzso zzso long zzso extensions are typical for zzso and zzso zzso family zzso In this study, we investigate the functional significance of these extended zzso of zzso zzso 

We identify 15 novel zzso family members from 7 zzso species and conduct zzso analyses of a combined zzso containing 34 zzso and 11 zzso zzso protein zzso We show that the long, zzso zzso tails of zzso zzso proteins are likely zzso and enriched in zzso sites and zzso zzso In a case study of zzso zzso zzso we provide experimental evidence that the protein is zzso processed and that the zzso zzso the zzso DNA binding activity in an zzso mobility shift zzso 

This study provides insight into the characteristics of the long zzso tails of zzso zzso proteins that may be crucial for controlling zzso and zzso zzso We propose that the regulation of DNA binding by zzso via its zzso region represents an important means by which zzso zzso strikes a balance between the class F1 and class zzso zzso zzso This mode of regulation might be shared with other zzso zzso some of which are relevant to human disease and zzso
