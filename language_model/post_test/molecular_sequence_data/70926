This paper describes a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso free zzso zzso The new test zzso free zzso utilizing a specific zzso that carries the zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso binding site on zzso zzso The zzso coupled to zzso was used in affinity zzso to separate free zzso from whole zzso zzso free zzso consisted of full length zzso and smaller zzso Additionally, free zzso levels determined by zzso as well as by zzso correlated moderately zzso zzso increased serum zzso of free zzso were found in coronary artery zzso The mean value of free zzso was three times higher in patients than in controls while the zzso zzso concentration was zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic zzso it was shown that the free zzso had a better diagnostic test performance in zzso risk assessment than the zzso specificity free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso sensitivity free zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In conclusion, the new free zzso allows for the specific zzso of free zzso This provides an interesting indicator for zzso risk zzso
