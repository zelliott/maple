zzso data from the zzso c zzso zzso I zzso zzso DNA gene and the second internal transcribed zzso zzso nuclear zzso region were used to test the current zzso zzso hypothesis regarding species of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from six sites in the tropical zzso Pacific zzso zzso and zzso Islands off the Great zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso New Caledonia, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The 16 zzso zzso differed from each other by a minimum of zzso zzso over the zzso zzso and zzso zzso over the zzso DNA zzso For two species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso specimens from the same host species in zzso differed at levels comparable to those between pairs of distinct zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso We take this as evidence of the presence of combinations of cryptic zzso however, we do not propose new species for these zzso because we lack identified zzso voucher zzso For seven species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A, samples from some combinations of localities had base pair differences that were equal to or greater than differences between some pairs of distinct zzso for one or both zzso and zzso zzso For three species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso one zzso differed from every other zzso by more than the zzso zzso In these cases zzso specimens could not be distinguished by zzso These data suggest extensive cryptic richness in this zzso For the present we refrain from dividing any of the zzso This is because there is a zzso of levels of zzso and zzso genetic variation in this system, so that distinguishing the two would be largely zzso
