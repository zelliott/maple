zzso red blood cells, unlike those of other zzso must withstand the rigors of circulation in the absence of new protein zzso Key to this is plasma membrane elasticity zzso from the protein zzso which forms a network on the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso made up of zzso zzso linked head to zzso We show here that one component of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a gene unique to zzso zzso analysis suggests that the other zzso gene zzso common to all zzso was duplicated after the emergence of zzso and that the resulting zzso gene was preserved only in zzso The activities of zzso and zzso zzso differ in the context of the human red cell zzso An zzso zzso containing the site of head-to-head interaction with the zzso binds more zzso than the corresponding zzso zzso to this zzso The latter competes so strongly with zzso zzso as to cause zzso of zzso at zzso lower concentration than the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso indicate that the partial structural zzso which binds to the complementary zzso element, and the adjacent complete repeat together determine the strength of the zzso interaction on the zzso zzso of all available zzso zzso sequences reveals three blocks of sequence unique to zzso Furthermore, human zzso is closer to zzso zzso than to human zzso consistent with adaptation of zzso to new zzso We conclude that zzso represents a zzso zzso adapted to the rapid make and break of zzso
