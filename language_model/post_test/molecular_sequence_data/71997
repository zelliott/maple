The zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso organisms allows them to survive severe environmental zzso A plant zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was isolated from the resurrection plant zzso zzso which accumulates high levels of zzso zzso comparison showed that zzso shares high similarity to zzso zzso genes from zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis indicated that zzso is present as a zzso zzso Transformation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted in the zzso gene with zzso zzso zzso restored growth on zzso zzso and the synthesis of zzso at high zzso Moreover, the zzso gene introduced into the zzso zzso was able to complement both zzso sensitivity to zzso heat treatment at 39 degrees C and induced zzso at 50 degrees zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso grown in zzso and zzso was also restored by the zzso zzso Thus, zzso protein is a functional plant zzso capable of sustaining zzso zzso and could play a major role in stress tolerance in zzso zzso
