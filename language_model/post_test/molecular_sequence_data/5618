A zzso single zzso insertions into zzso zzso are expected to be highly disruptive to protein structure and zzso We have carried out a systematic analysis of the zzso associated with Ala insertions into zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso coli inner membrane zzso zzso of zzso into the center of 7 zzso zzso was found to abolish stable integration of zzso zzso into the membrane or uphill zzso zzso A more detailed Ala zzso scan was made of zzso zzso zzso The results zzso a central region of approximately 2 zzso turns that is crucial for zzso zzso stability and/or zzso A zzso scan in this region identified 2 zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso From these results, it appears that zzso zzso have differential sensitivities to single zzso insertions and that such zzso may be useful for identifying structurally and/or functionally important zzso zzso
