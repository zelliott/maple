The protein zzso zzso problem is a central problem in zzso with wide applications in protein structure prediction and zzso zzso complexity results show that the problem is hard to zzso Yet, instances from realistic applications are large and demand fast and reliable zzso 

We propose a new global zzso algorithm, which for the first time zzso zzso reduction and zzso reduction techniques previously developed for the protein zzso zzso zzso We show that the proposed approach zzso dramatically the zzso of the underlining zzso zzso zzso show that our zzso zzso problems using only zzso of the time required by the zzso linear programming approach available in the zzso In addition, on a set of hard zzso zzso problems, our zzso runs zzso times faster than zzso zzso which is widely used for solving these zzso 

The zzso is available as an online server at zzso
