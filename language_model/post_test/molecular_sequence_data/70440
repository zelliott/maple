The primary structure of zzso a zzso isolated from zzso zzso scorpion zzso is zzso Its zzso acid sequence was determined by automated zzso sequential degradation of the reduced and zzso toxin and of relevant peptides obtained by zzso with zzso zzso strain zzso zzso or zzso and zzso by zzso The complete sequence showed 41 zzso acid zzso which account for an estimated molecular weight of zzso and eight zzso zzso which zzso the toxin zzso with four zzso zzso The molecular weight determined by mass zzso was zzso zzso of this sequence with those from other scorpion toxins showed a resemblance with toxins which act on different types of zzso zzso zzso was able to block zzso zzso channels of high zzso zzso is the first zzso short toxin from zzso zzso so far completely zzso
