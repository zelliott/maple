A zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso has been associated with zzso zzso zzso We created a bank of 40,000 random zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso of this bank in zzso coli zzso with absorbed serum from an zzso zzso person permitted the isolation and zzso of a clone with a zzso zzso zzso of this insert zzso permitted the expression of a zzso zzso zzso protein that had a mass of approximately 96 zzso and that was recognized by the human zzso zzso that were obtained from zzso zzso persons and that recognized the native zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso zzso protein to a significantly greater extent than did zzso that did not recognize the native zzso zzso zzso All 19 zzso zzso zzso producing the zzso to zzso zzso zzso with zzso none of 13 zzso did so zzso zzso zzso Because all 15 zzso producing the zzso zzso zzso with zzso we called the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso identified an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso without a termination zzso Parallel screening of a zzso zzso library with human serum revealed positive plaques with identical zzso zzso and sequences matching the sequence of the downstream region of zzso To clone the full-length zzso we used the zzso zzso as a probe and isolated a clone with a zzso insert from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of this insert zzso 2) revealed a zzso sequence that overlapped the downstream region of zzso zzso of the complete zzso sequence of zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids yielding a protein of zzso zzso There was no significant zzso with any previously reported protein zzso These findings indicate the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso potentially associated with zzso and with zzso zzso
