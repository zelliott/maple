Members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family play key roles in the regulation of zzso immune responses and tissue zzso Here we describe the identification of the chicken zzso of zzso B cell zzso factor of the zzso family zzso By searching a chicken zzso database we identified two overlapping zzso clones that code for the entire open reading frame of chicken zzso zzso which contains a predicted zzso domain and a putative zzso zzso zzso site like its zzso zzso The zzso acid identity between soluble chicken and human zzso is zzso considerably higher than for most other known zzso The zzso gene is most strongly expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by human zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso It bound to chicken B cells, but not to other zzso and it promoted the survival of zzso chicken B cells in zzso Furthermore, zzso expressed zzso induced the selective expansion of B cells in the zzso and zzso zzso when administered to young zzso Our results suggest that like its zzso counterpart, zzso plays an important role in survival and/or proliferation of chicken B zzso
