The X-ray zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been determined using multiple zzso replacement techniques and refined at zzso A resolution to a zzso zzso of zzso This is the first report of the structure of an zzso active zzso zzso and of the zzso with a bound zzso The structure has been determined in zzso and zzso crystal zzso The zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso The surfaces of the sheet are partially covered with five zzso zzso There are two protein molecules in the zzso unit of the zzso crystal zzso They form a zzso with an extensive interface in which zzso zzso per zzso is zzso The majority of the contact area in the zzso interface is between zzso or aromatic zzso Two zzso are related by a zzso zzso axis to yield a zzso This zzso is also present in the zzso zzso however, in this case, the 222 symmetry is entirely zzso Upon zzso formation, an additional zzso zzso of zzso surface area from each zzso becomes zzso The interface between zzso in the zzso is stabilized by salt zzso zzso zzso studies are consistent with the zzso being a zzso in zzso The structure of a complex of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso was determined and reveals that most of the zzso interactions with the protein are with the zzso and zzso groups, while the base has no hydrogen bonds with the protein and interacts only by stacking with the side chain of zzso The zzso interacts with the zzso of the zzso and via a zzso zzso with the side chain of the zzso zzso zzso The mode of interaction with the zzso is novel, with the zzso binding at the side of the zzso The structures of the zzso in zzso grown in the presence or absence of zzso are essentially zzso In addition, the zzso reaction from zzso zzso zzso to the zzso can occur without zzso This suggests that only the second step of the reaction in which the zzso transfers the zzso to a zzso zzso zzso is significantly zzso by the zzso
