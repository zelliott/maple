We isolated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso mushroom zzso zzso and termed it zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso zzso acid zzso contained a zzso domain and a zzso zzso Random zzso selection analysis of the zzso produced in zzso coli revealed that it bound to a zzso sequence with the consensus sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that it also bound to the consensus sequence zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso zzso analysis disclosed that zzso interacts with a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso and/or zzso C domain of zzso The expression of zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso of zzso zzso is induced by light exposure, suggesting that zzso can regulate the expression of the zzso gene in a zzso zzso
