In zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes nearly identical zzso and zzso promoter consensus sequences as the zzso zzso In zzso promoter selectivity of zzso zzso containing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso seems to be achieved by the differential ability of the two zzso to tolerate zzso from the promoter consensus zzso In this study, we suggest that many natural zzso promoters possess a zzso element, a feature that has been considered as not zzso among zzso zzso These zzso zzso are mostly zzso spaced from the zzso region, but nevertheless zzso A zzso 2 zzso zzso from the optimal zzso length of 17 zzso or the complete absence of a zzso consensus sequence decreases overall promoter activity, but at the same time zzso zzso in its competition with zzso for promoter zzso On the other hand, the reduction of promoter activity due to shifting of the zzso element can be zzso by an zzso feature such as zzso of the zzso region without compromising zzso zzso Based on zzso analysis of zzso we suggest a role of regions zzso and 4 of zzso in sensing zzso located zzso zzso
