The primary structure of zzso zzso B surface zzso protein produced in zzso has been confirmed by mass zzso zzso zzso These studies corroborate more than zzso of the zzso acid sequence derived by sequencing of the gene and identified the presence of an zzso zzso on approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Prior to the present work, direct structural analysis was largely prevented by the zzso of this integral membrane protein and its primary degradation fragments in zzso buffers and by partial zzso of the zzso zzso These difficulties were overcome by zzso isolation using zzso of the zzso 226 zzso acid protein from a zzso zzso gel in the presence of sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso of the reduced and zzso zzso produced a large number of small, predominantly zzso peptides zzso suited for zzso mapping by fast atom zzso mass zzso The percentage of zzso zzso blocked by zzso was determined by a new strategy involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and gas zzso zzso identification and zzso of the zzso zzso
