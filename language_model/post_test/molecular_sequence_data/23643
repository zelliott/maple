The potential of zzso zzso zzso surface protein 3 as a component of an zzso malaria vaccine is currently being zzso The precursor form of zzso zzso zzso during zzso to generate a mature processed zzso It is unknown if this zzso event is necessary for zzso function, but it may be an important consideration for assessing and developing zzso as an zzso vaccine zzso We have therefore determined the zzso site in zzso by sequencing the zzso of the processed form of zzso which was isolated from zzso zzso The position of the zzso site indicates that the processed form of zzso retains the three blocks of zzso zzso repeats, which are predicted to provide the structural framework for an zzso zzso The zzso motif has many features in common with the published zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso which are all located on the zzso surface and are implicated in the zzso invasion zzso The common cellular location and similar zzso motifs suggest that these zzso proteins may be zzso by the same or related zzso
