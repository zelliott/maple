To map the regions of the external envelope zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso involved in the process of membrane fusion, we determined the zzso capacity of a panel of zzso expressed zzso envelope zzso This panel was generated by exchanging gene fragments between four previously studied envelope genes that exhibited a high degree of sequence zzso yet displayed marked differences in zzso capacity when expressed by zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that multiple regions of the zzso envelope zzso are involved in zzso zzso Some fragments, most notably those containing the V2 or zzso region, can transfer zzso capacity to envelope proteins previously not capable of inducing zzso Moreover, it is shown that such regions functionally interact with other envelope regions, especially one encompassing the zzso and zzso regions of zzso or a region encompassing part of zzso to exert their function in membrane zzso
