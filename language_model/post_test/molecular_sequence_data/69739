zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been employed to assign zzso zzso quantum yields, and zzso zzso to the four zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displays two apparent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on specific zzso show that zzso has a lifetime of zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso have lifetimes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the specific zzso changes of the zzso segment involving zzso may be monitored zzso in the zzso zzso On the basis of quantum yield values, zzso is calculated to contribute approximately zzso of the zzso intensity of the zzso while direct zzso of the zzso show that up to zzso of the total intensity is really zzso by this zzso The zzso may arise from energy transfer from zzso to zzso with an efficiency of zzso Application of the assigned zzso lifetimes to probe zzso protein zzso changes has also been zzso
