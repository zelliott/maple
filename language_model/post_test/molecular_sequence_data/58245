We analyzed structural motifs of peptides bound to zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and found that: zzso zzso motif where A, B, and C are zzso zzso and neutral, respectively, is important for binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso at position C allow zzso binding specific to zzso which is strongly associated with insulin zzso zzso zzso among human zzso zzso fragments, the zzso of the human insulin alpha chain, which is exposed only under reducing conditions, has the highest affinity specific to zzso by binding with the zzso zzso zzso a short-term human zzso T cell line recognizes a zzso zzso containing the zzso motif as a major T cell zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso where A and B need to be zzso for binding to zzso neutral zzso is exceptionally allowed at position zzso The implications of our results are discussed in light of the zzso zzso to insulin zzso syndrome and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and systemic lupus zzso with zzso syndrome, in particular T cell responses to zzso
