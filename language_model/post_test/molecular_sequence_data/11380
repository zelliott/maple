The selection of fully matched unrelated volunteer donors zzso in zzso requires a molecular characterization of zzso zzso since most zzso zzso donors can be zzso when analyzed at a zzso zzso The present report describes a molecular typing protocol for zzso genes developed for the selection of zzso and its application to some zzso zzso The protocol involves three successive zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for zzso and zzso genes is performed to identify the major zzso of the zzso zzso matching is then introduced for zzso B, C and zzso zzso and zzso genes to screen prospective zzso Those showing matched zzso patterns are finally submitted to direct sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is assessed by zzso when there are several potential class I and zzso matched zzso This strategy was applied zzso to three zzso recipients and their previously selected zzso Three other patients and their 12 prospective donors were submitted to our protocol before zzso Clinical evaluation of transplant outcomes indicates the primary importance of complete zzso and class I matching, while zzso and zzso zzso seems to be less zzso
