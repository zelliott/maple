Terminal deletions of units from zzso repeat proteins have provided insight into the physical origins of their zzso To test if the same principles governing zzso apply to zzso repeat zzso we have created a series of zzso deletion zzso from a large zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso We have examined the structure and stability of the resulting deletion zzso by a combination of solution zzso equilibrium zzso studies, and limited zzso Surprisingly, a high degree of zzso was found in the stability distribution of zzso Unlike previously studied repeat zzso we identified several key zzso that on deletion disrupt nearby structure, at distances as far away as up to three repeats, in zzso This partial unfolding model is supported by limited zzso studies and by point substitution in repeats predicted to be zzso as a result of deletion of adjacent zzso We show that key zzso and zzso must be present to maintain the structural integrity in adjacent regions zzso four zzso zzso of decreased zzso The finding that full-length zzso maintains a high level of zzso in equilibrium unfolding underscores the importance of zzso interactions in stabilizing locally unstable regions of zzso
