zzso zzso cells are the sole colonists of a specialized light organ in the mantle cavity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The process begins when the bacteria zzso in zzso zzso outside the light zzso The cells eventually leave the aggregate, enter the light organ, and encounter a rich supply of zzso The need to zzso from zzso and presumably zzso peptides led us to zzso that zzso activity is integral to the colonization zzso zzso activity associated with whole cells of zzso zzso strain zzso was identified as the product of a putative cell zzso zzso zzso To characterize this activity, the zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso kinetic studies revealed that the zzso has broad activity, with a preference for basic and zzso side chains and zzso and zzso values that are lower and smaller, respectively, than those of zzso coli zzso A zzso zzso zzso unable to produce zzso is significantly delayed in its ability to colonize zzso within the first 12 zzso but eventually it establishes a zzso colonization zzso Likewise, in competition with the wild type for zzso the zzso is zzso at 12 h zzso but then competes evenly by 24 zzso Also, the zzso strain fails to achieve zzso levels of cells in zzso suggesting an explanation for the initial colonization zzso This study provides a foundation for more studies on zzso zzso zzso and role in the early stages of zzso zzso
