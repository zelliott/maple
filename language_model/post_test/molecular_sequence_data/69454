A gene zzso a protein with extensive zzso to the largest zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso has been identified in zzso zzso This zzso referred to as zzso is entirely zzso within a previously characterized zzso zzso which may thus provide the first example of a zzso zzso zzso in a higher zzso However, the growth rate and fertility of zzso plants do not appear to be significantly affected by this zzso even though disruption experiments in zzso have shown that most zzso zzso are zzso Analysis of zzso levels in developing zzso and mature plants indicates that expression of zzso is zzso regulated during development and is slightly induced in response to stress, as has been observed for zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso contains numerous sequences closely related to zzso consistent with recent reports of at least two other zzso genes in zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequences for all zzso genes reported to date suggests that multiple zzso zzso evolved in zzso prior to the divergence of plants and zzso
