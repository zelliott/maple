A novel zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample that was collected in Xinjiang Province, China, and characterized by using a zzso zzso zzso growth temperature was 28 degrees C and growth occurred zzso in culture media that contained 10 % zzso The zzso type was zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso one unknown zzso one unknown zzso and traces of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso and zzso (15 zzso zzso fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso zzso occupies a branch that is distinct from, although very close to, the family zzso in the zzso zzso Based on its zzso zzso zzso position (as determined by zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and zzso zzso signature zzso data, it is concluded that the isolate represents a novel member of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
