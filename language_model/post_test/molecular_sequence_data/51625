A large portion of the zzso zzso of human collagen VI was prepared from the culture medium of zzso zzso human embryonic kidney cell zzso The zzso product zzso to sequence positions zzso of the alpha 3 zzso chain that consists of eight zzso approximately 200 zzso motifs zzso to zzso being similar to the A domain motif of von zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso showed a molecular mass of 180 zzso and an zzso zzso zzso structures that consist of eight small globes zzso approximately 5 zzso were demonstrated by electron zzso The data indicate that each A domain motif represents a separate folding unit which are connected to each other by short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated about 38% alpha zzso zzso beta sheets and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso showed binding to zzso which could be abolished by moderate salt zzso zzso binding was assigned to zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were obtained after partial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lacked affinity for zzso In addition, zzso showed strong binding to zzso that required exposure to 6 M zzso for full zzso zzso binding studies indicated some affinity of zzso for the triple zzso region of collagen VI suggesting a role of the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso No or only little binding was, however, observed to zzso zzso I and III, several basement membrane proteins and other zzso zzso zzso zzso was also an inactive zzso for cell zzso
