In the zzso zzso zzso stimulates the release and synthesis of zzso and zzso by zzso cells via the zzso zzso zzso Little is known, however, about expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tissue and in zzso To learn more about the distribution and regulatory roles of zzso and its zzso we investigated the expression of both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human zzso and in various types of zzso zzso using the zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in combination with zzso (in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed in normal human zzso and in all types of zzso Similarly, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso human zzso and in most, but not all, zzso These included 5 zzso zzso 6 zzso cell zzso 1 of 2 zzso tumors, and 1 of 2 zzso zzso but not in the 2 zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies showed zzso and zzso zzso in all 3 zzso zzso and in 12 of 33 zzso and 10 of 33 zzso zzso zzso Using an indirect in zzso zzso technique to increase the sensitivity of the in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in 29 zzso and 25 zzso of 33 zzso zzso This is the first report of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in individual zzso zzso cells using in zzso zzso The frequent expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells suggests that zzso has zzso functions in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
