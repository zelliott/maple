zzso replication of zzso zzso is initiated by the zzso zzso zzso which has zzso zzso DNA strand zzso zzso zzso The zzso origin of zzso contains two regions, zzso the zzso site, constituted by three directly repeated sequences zzso or the bind zzso and zzso the sequence where zzso introduces the zzso to initiate replication (the zzso zzso A series of zzso belonging to the zzso family, show features similar to those of zzso and have DNA sequences zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In addition, they all share zzso at the level of their zzso zzso However, the bind regions of these plasmids are, in general, not zzso We tested the zzso specificity of zzso zzso of zzso The zzso protein has a zzso zzso action on zzso zzso as well as on zzso zzso zzso harboring the zzso zzso zzso The DNA strand zzso activity of zzso zzso was also zzso on two plasmids of the zzso family, zzso zzso and zzso zzso from both plasmids were relaxed by zzso provided they had a proper degree of zzso zzso it was necessary to zzso the zzso of zzso DNA to achieve zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso regions of various plasmids belonging to the zzso family, including those of zzso and zzso were zzso for zzso In zzso the zzso protein does not need to bind to the zzso for its zzso zzso
