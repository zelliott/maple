We examined the in zzso and in zzso zzso of several families of zzso zzso zzso constrained linear zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso The biological activities were assessed in zzso by examining the zzso effects of these agents on the zzso evoked zzso of the guinea pig zzso zzso and the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso were determined from the zzso activity of these agents on the zzso degrees C zzso test after spinal administration of rats with chronically placed spinal zzso zzso of the effect of zzso incorporation of zzso bonds and zzso of zzso or constrained zzso acids reveals systematic changes in the activity of these zzso There was a significant correlation between the potency of these agents in the zzso zzso and their activity in the zzso and, to a lesser extent, in the zzso zzso zzso of the ability of zzso (a delta selective zzso to reverse the drug action and the respective potency on the zzso and zzso showed that a correlation exists with actions on the zzso but not on the zzso consistent with the likelihood that agents with high zzso ratios in zzso act at the zzso sites, whereas those with low zzso ratios act at the delta zzso in the spinal zzso The close correlations between activity in the zzso and spinal zzso suggest that the structural requirements for potency in the smooth muscle and in the spinal zzso are essentially the same as those zzso receptors that mediate zzso zzso
