zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in tissue zzso by promoting cell zzso migration, zzso and zzso zzso zzso are of importance for tissue engineering because of their functions as scaffolds for zzso Previously, we developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated their zzso and zzso specific zzso Here, we zzso twelve zzso peptides derived from zzso proteins onto zzso zzso and examined biological zzso Seven zzso zzso promoted human zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and 531 zzso from collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso cell zzso Various zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were involved in the cell zzso to the zzso zzso Further, only the zzso and zzso zzso promoted zzso outgrowth with zzso rat zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso can regulate specific zzso cell responses and are useful zzso as zzso zzso
