The zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso class zzso from zzso zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso zzso zzso was successfully altered by localized zzso zzso The zzso evolution system introduces multiple point zzso designed on the basis of the zzso regions of the zzso zzso family, by using zzso gene fragmentation with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso According to the zzso of the zzso indicating the zzso of large amounts of zzso zzso in the cells, 13 zzso candidates were screened from a zzso library, with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso The in zzso zzso specificity of five candidates, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was evaluated by the zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso supplemented with zzso zzso the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was drastically increased in zzso that expressed evolved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (up to 60, 36, 50, and 49 zzso respectively), relative to the amount in the wild type (12 zzso zzso zzso zzso in which 14 zzso acids had been changed and which was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso not only exhibited broad zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso and 51 zzso zzso zzso zzso but also zzso the highest zzso production zzso dry zzso among the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso units of the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso were randomly zzso in a single zzso chain, as zzso confirmed by zzso zzso and the zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso
