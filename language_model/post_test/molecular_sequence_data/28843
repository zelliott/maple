We have cloned and characterized the zzso gene that is required for proliferation of zzso disc cells during zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso a zzso of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso is detected in most cell types throughout development, but it accumulates to its highest levels during early zzso A maternal component of zzso is required for the production of eggs and viable zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso zzso they die during zzso development, lack all mature zzso disc structures, and have zzso small zzso zzso zzso observations show that zzso zzso brains have a high zzso index and many zzso cells contain an zzso number of zzso zzso zzso However, cells are not stalled in zzso as zzso stages in which zzso are zzso at the equatorial plate are never zzso Interestingly, some zzso zzso such as zzso B are not zzso in zzso zzso whereas others controlling zzso separation appear to be turned zzso Taken together, these results suggest a model in which zzso controls regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso
