zzso protein zzso of zzso coli plays a key role in zzso zzso zzso assembly through its interaction with zzso zzso zzso also zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso protein expression through its interaction with zzso zzso zzso The binding site for protein zzso within the zzso zzso encompasses zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso and is composed of two base paired zzso regions that flank a zzso zzso core element containing nine zzso We have investigated the structure of the zzso binding site for zzso both in the free state and in the presence of protein using zzso zzso The integrity of the two zzso segments has been verified, and the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso base pairs within the zzso core, predicted from comparative analysis, have been zzso In addition, we have identified a base triple within the core that is composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso data suggest that zzso interaction is accomplished without significant changes in the zzso Nonetheless, zzso binding promotes formation of the zzso zzso zzso base pair and appears to stabilize the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso base zzso
