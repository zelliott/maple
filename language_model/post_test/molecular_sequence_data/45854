In zzso a hierarchy of zzso zzso zzso and segment polarity gene interactions regulates virtually simultaneous zzso zzso For the last decade, studies have focused on revealing the extent to which zzso zzso mechanisms are zzso in other zzso where segments are added zzso from anterior to zzso in a cellular zzso Despite our increased knowledge of individual zzso zzso details of their interactions in zzso insects are not well zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which display zzso expression zzso zzso zzso paired zzso and zzso zzso genes produced zzso zzso when their transcripts were severely reduced by zzso zzso In contrast, similar analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso genes produced severely zzso almost completely zzso zzso Analysis of interactions between zzso components revealed that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso circuit to regulate one another as well as their downstream targets, zzso and zzso The complement of primary zzso genes in zzso differs from zzso in that it includes zzso but not zzso This gene circuit defines segments zzso in double segment zzso Furthermore, this single mechanism functions in the early zzso stage and subsequently during zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso gene interactions reveals components of the genetic hierarchy that are regulated in a repetitive circuit or zzso zzso This zzso gene circuit provides insight into zzso zzso in zzso that may be more generally zzso to zzso in other zzso
