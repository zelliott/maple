In this study, a battery of zzso was directed toward the zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to search for zzso gene zzso in clinical zzso of zzso tuberculosis from different geographical zzso Since a complete deletion of the zzso gene was not found, it is suggested that deletion is not a major mechanism of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso resistance in these zzso However, 7 of 39 zzso (4 of 25 from South Africa and 3 of 14 from other geographical zzso showed mobility shifts by zzso analysis, suggesting aberrations in the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis confirmed that the mobility shifts were due to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso deletion in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso created altered restriction sites for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and sequence results, supported by restriction zzso length zzso analysis, suggested that the zzso procedure is a good indicator of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 463 and 275 were found in zzso from different geographical zzso This may suggest a common evolutionary event, but one of the control zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also had a zzso at zzso zzso The results suggest that variations in the zzso coding gene sequences of zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis are zzso and that defects in other regions of the zzso tuberculosis zzso are of equal or greater importance in contributing to the acquisition of resistance to zzso
