Three genes zzso clan zzso zzso zzso were identified from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequences predict mature proteins of approximately 46 zzso with a novel zzso structure zzso a zzso zzso domain, and an zzso domain of unknown zzso zzso expressed as a zzso protein in zzso zzso had zzso activity, which was inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso zzso into fifth zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae resulted in partial insect mortality associated with the zzso to sixth zzso with surviving insects showing retarded development and zzso zzso is expressed specifically in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a functional component of zzso zzso which is able to manipulate host zzso
