We isolated an zzso zzso zzso zzso P clone from a human zzso library and zzso zzso and characterized the zzso region of the human zzso P zzso zzso analysis revealed an zzso between base pairs zzso zzso and zzso upstream of the zzso zzso and another one between zzso zzso and zzso of the coding zzso The major zzso start site of zzso P in human zzso zzso cells was mapped to zzso zzso by zzso amplification of zzso ends and by primer zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence were fused to a zzso reporter zzso They exhibited functional promoter activity in zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso cells in transient zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso gamma zzso promoter zzso Nuclear extracts of zzso zzso cells bound to a signal zzso and zzso of zzso response element of the promoter in gel zzso zzso By zzso of zzso zzso a zzso box and a putative zzso site were identified to be necessary for zzso P zzso These data indicate that the human zzso P gene contains a strong promoter that is zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso by the liver, might react as a negative acute phase zzso
