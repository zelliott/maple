zzso zzso is a common zzso disease which is associated with high levels of zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The aim of this study was to produce a zzso zzso zzso which is usually manufactured from zzso zzso zzso carrying an immobilized zzso zzso zzso was modified by surface zzso of zzso zzso acid to enhance zzso of a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The modified zzso showed higher surface zzso and zzso of zzso 5 than the unmodified zzso Because zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and allows zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity was monitored by dye release from zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 did not release dye from the zzso zzso however, dye was detected as zzso was zzso from the zzso In an zzso zzso modified zzso decreased human zzso saliva zzso zzso adherence of zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso 5 onto unmodified zzso also abolished zzso zzso These experiments show that dental acrylic may be surface modified and loaded with zzso 5 as a means of controlled release of zzso 5 to an affected zzso This surface modification may additionally reduce zzso of zzso zzso cells to the zzso zzso
