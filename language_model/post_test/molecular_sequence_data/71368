We report the characterization of a zzso zzso zzso and its expression in developing zzso Using a zzso zzso from an expressed sequence tag project, we isolated a zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular size of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows 50% identity to the protein zzso domain of human zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso inhibited cell division and caused the cells to enlarge zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso coli is able to inhibit the activity of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso by a single gene at a locus on the long arm of zzso zzso zzso gel blots showed the zzso transcript is about zzso zzso in length and that its abundance reaches a maximum 15 days after zzso in zzso zzso High levels of expression of zzso at this stage of zzso development imply that zzso plays a role in zzso Our results show that control of zzso zzso activity by zzso is zzso among zzso from zzso to animals and zzso
