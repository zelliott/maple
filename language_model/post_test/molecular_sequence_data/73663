zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso the formation, breakage and zzso of zzso bonds during protein zzso zzso of this protein into its individual zzso has confirmed the presence of the a and zzso zzso which are zzso to zzso having related structures and zzso The a and zzso zzso both contain a zzso zzso sequence zzso The remainder of the zzso consists primarily of two further zzso designated b and zzso which are thought to be sequence repeats on the basis of a limited sequence zzso The functions of the b and zzso zzso are unknown and, until now, the structure of neither domain was zzso 

zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso methods have been used to determine the global fold of the zzso b zzso The protein has an zzso fold with the order of the elements of secondary structure being zzso zzso The strands are all in a parallel arrangement with respect to each other, except for zzso which is zzso The arrangement of the secondary structure elements of the b domain is identical to that found in the a domain of zzso and in the ubiquitous zzso protein zzso the three-dimensional folding zzso of the b domain is also very similar to that of these zzso 

Our determination of the global fold of the b domain of zzso by zzso reveals that, like the a domain, the b domain contains the zzso zzso even though the b domain has no significant zzso sequence similarities to any members of the zzso zzso This zzso together with indications that the zzso domain adopts a similar fold, suggests that zzso consists of active and inactive zzso zzso These zzso may have been adapted during evolution to provide zzso with its complete spectrum of zzso zzso
