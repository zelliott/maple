Here, we report the characterization of a human zzso coding for the recently published zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene is similar to most other zzso zzso It is composed of three zzso which are divided by two zzso of 900 zzso and 400 zzso The protein is zzso by sequences in zzso 2 and 3, with zzso 2 coding for the zzso 45 zzso acids and zzso 3 coding for the zzso 46 zzso zzso So far, ten zzso genes are known to be located on human zzso zzso in a clustered zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also localized in the zzso gene zzso We found both genes within the zzso with zzso being close to zzso and zzso between the genes zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene cluster now is composed of 12 zzso expressed family zzso
