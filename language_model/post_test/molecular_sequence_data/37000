A set of aligned zzso protein sequences is divided into two groups consisting of m and zzso most related zzso The value of position zzso for zzso protein sequences is defined as a number of failures to coincide in the intergroup comparison of all possible zzso pairs of zzso acid zzso in that position divided by zzso The position zzso value plotted versus the sequence position number with a window of 10 positions gives the intergroup local zzso zzso Area S of the figure included between the local zzso profile and the straight line corresponding to the mean local zzso value is compared with the average area Sr for 1000 random zzso protein zzso If S is greater than Sr by more than 2 standard zzso units zzso zzso the local zzso profile is assumed to contain zzso and hollows corresponding to significant variable and conservative regions of the zzso The profile zzso containing the area surplus delta S zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso are cut off by two straight lines to locate significant zzso The difference zzso given in standard zzso units zzso r is believed to be the zzso acid substitution overall zzso along the zzso protein sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso The significant conservative and variable regions of six zzso sequence families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso bacteria zzso zzso and human zzso were zzso It was shown that for artificial zzso protein sequences derived by zzso lengthening of natural protein zzso the zzso value rises as square root of zzso To compare the degree of substitution zzso in zzso protein sequence families of different lengths L the value of standard substitution overall zzso for L zzso 250 is zzso
