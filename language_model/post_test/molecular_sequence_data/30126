The dynamics of three synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso of different length and shape were studied in solution by zzso dynamic light scattering zzso and zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso For zzso zzso molecules the zzso spectrum is dominated by the rotation of the main symmetry axis of the zzso The experimental correlation times describe the rotation of the zzso under zzso stick boundary zzso It is shown that the zzso theory of zzso and Garcia de la Torre gives good predictions of the zzso diffusion zzso of zzso zzso molecules of the small zzso ratios studied zzso These relations are used to calculate the solution dimensions of the DNA fragments from measured correlation zzso The zzso diameter of the zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso A, assuming a rise per base of zzso zzso The zzso zzso adopts a hairpin structure with nearly zzso dimensions and a diameter of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso relaxation zzso provide a powerful method for distinguishing between different zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso versus hairpin zzso Furthermore, the zzso correlation times are a very sensitive probe of the length of different zzso The zzso results reflect the zzso motion of the molecules as well as the amount of local internal motion zzso The experimental correlation time from zzso is determined by the rotation of both the short and long axes of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
