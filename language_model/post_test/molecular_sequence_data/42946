The use of zzso zzso zzso to inhibit gene expression is a zzso method for determining protein function and has potential therapeutic zzso However, there is still great zzso in the zzso application of zzso technology to individual zzso In order to assess the ability of different cell types to take up zzso developing embryonic zzso were cultured in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso in individual cell populations was zzso by fluorescent zzso and the tissue sections were zzso for zzso basement membrane zzso High zzso levels of zzso were observed in all zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, a significant decrease in zzso levels was observed with the formation of new zzso in kidney and zzso whereas mature zzso cells in all zzso had no zzso levels of zzso The ability to inhibit gene expression in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, was consistent with the distribution pattern of labeled zzso These results may indicate a general resistance of zzso cells to take up zzso in culture and bear directly on the ability of zzso to affect gene expression in complex zzso with zzso zzso
