zzso zzso regulators of the diphtheria toxin zzso zzso family have been identified in a wide variety of bacterial zzso where they control gene expression in response to one of two metal zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso is the best characterized of these important zzso zzso The zzso zzso includes many zzso diverse species, and the prevalence of zzso regulators within the zzso is zzso We zzso zzso DNA from 42 different zzso zzso representing 33 different species, for the presence of a highly zzso region of the zzso gene that encodes the zzso zzso motif and zzso site 1 within zzso 1 and 2 of zzso The zzso of all of the zzso contained this zzso region of zzso and DNA sequencing revealed a high level of zzso sequence conservation within this region in all of the zzso species zzso from 62 to zzso identity and averaging zzso identity with the zzso zzso The level of identity was even greater for the predicted protein sequences zzso by the zzso zzso ranging from 81 to zzso identity and averaging zzso identity with zzso Using a zzso zzso we confirmed the presence of a zzso protein in extracts of most of the zzso zzso and determined the precise amount of zzso per cell in zzso zzso The high level of identity at both DNA and protein levels suggests that all of the zzso tested zzso a functional zzso zzso regulatory protein that can bind zzso of the zzso operator and regulate gene expression in response to zzso
