zzso improvement for yield and drought tolerance is challenging due to the complex genetic nature of these traits and environmental zzso This study reports that transgenic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso organ growth, grain yield, and zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited environmental zzso with yield increase under zzso Dry and yield reduction under zzso zzso or High zzso zzso Native zzso zzso variation associated with zzso zzso Two founder zzso identified in the zzso zzso of North America now predominate in zzso modern breeding zzso and have distinct zzso promoters and expression zzso These two major zzso show zzso group zzso with one zzso in zzso female and the other in the male zzso groups, zzso These two zzso also associate with zzso crop performance when zzso zzso zzso testing showed that, of the two zzso discussed here, each zzso differed in their impact on yield and environmental zzso Moreover, when zzso stacked together the zzso pair showed yield and environmental performance advantages over either single zzso resembling zzso zzso This work demonstrates differences in transgenic efficacy of native zzso and the differences reflect their association with hybrid breeding zzso
