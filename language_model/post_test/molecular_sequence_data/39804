Until recently, the zzso zzso included substance zzso zzso A and zzso zzso Following the discovery of the fourth member of this family, zzso 1, a diverse group of novel zzso and zzso zzso peptides have been identified in zzso These newly identified members are zzso expressed in peripheral zzso Currently, the impact of these new zzso peptides on the immune system remains zzso Some data imply an important role for zzso 1 in the generation of zzso zzso are traditionally viewed as zzso with zzso functions as zzso Many studies however, indicate that they may also be produced by zzso cells, and exert profound influence on inflammatory responses by affecting multiple aspects of immune cell zzso It is of great importance to determine whether the new zzso peptides have similar zzso A more detailed understanding of the interactions between zzso and immune cells may provide the basis for the development of new therapies for inflammatory and zzso zzso
