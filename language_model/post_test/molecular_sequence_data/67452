Cell surface structures termed knobs are one of the most important zzso related protein complexes deployed by the malaria zzso zzso zzso at the surface of the infected zzso Despite their relevance to the disease, their structure, mechanisms of traffic and their process of assembly remain poorly zzso In this study, we have explored the possible role of a zzso zzso class of zzso namely zzso zzso in protein trafficking in the infected zzso We found the gene coding for zzso to be located in a zzso cluster together with zzso components zzso and zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso too showed the presence of zzso motif required for transport to the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso showed zzso to be exported in the zzso zzso in a stage dependent manner zzso as punctuate spots in the zzso zzso distinctly from zzso zzso in structures which could be the reminiscent of zzso Double zzso analysis revealed zzso of zzso with the markers of knobs zzso zzso and zzso and components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to be in a complex with zzso zzso and zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso Our results suggest potential involvement of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso assembly in the zzso zzso
