Variation of core zzso acid zzso 70 of zzso C virus zzso has been shown recently to be closely correlated with liver disease zzso suggesting that the core region might be present as a zzso during persistent infection and that this zzso nature might have an influence on the progression of zzso In our investigation, the subjects were 79 patients infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso with chronic zzso zzso 29 with liver zzso zzso and 25 with zzso zzso zzso Deep sequencing of the zzso core region was carried out on their zzso by using a Roche zzso zzso Junior zzso Based on a zzso containing a cloned zzso sequence zzso the background error rate associated with zzso including the zzso zzso was calculated as zzso zzso zzso Deep sequencing of the core region in the clinical samples showed a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso R at the core zzso 70 position in most cases zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso to R in the mixture increased as liver disease advanced to zzso and zzso Meanwhile, zzso analysis of the zzso core region revealed that the zzso zzso differed genetically depending on the zzso status at core zzso zzso We conclude that the core zzso 70 mixture ratio, determined by deep sequencing, reflected the status of liver disease, demonstrating a significant association between core zzso 70 and disease progression in zzso patients infected with zzso zzso zzso
