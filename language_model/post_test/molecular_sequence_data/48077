The zzso segments of zzso sodium channels are important parts of the zzso elements of these zzso Furthermore, the addition of the isolated zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso results in zzso increases of zzso zzso In order to gain insight into the mechanisms of pore formation by zzso zzso the structure and orientation of the zzso segment of the first internal repeat of the rat brain II sodium channel was investigated in the presence of zzso zzso by zzso solution zzso zzso and solid-state zzso zzso on oriented zzso zzso Both the zzso chemical shift observed by zzso zzso solid-state zzso zzso and the attenuating effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicate that the central zzso portion of this zzso is oriented approximately parallel to the membrane zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics calculations of the zzso in a zzso zzso environment indicate that the zzso zzso extends over approximately 12 zzso A less regular structure further toward the zzso allows for the zzso zzso of this part of the zzso to be positioned in the zzso zzso The implications for possible zzso mechanisms are zzso
