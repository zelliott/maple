To understand precisely the mechanisms by which hormones like zzso regulate plant differentiation and development, it is essential to isolate putative hormone zzso We have zzso the major zzso binding protein from zzso zzso to zzso The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 22,000 Da and binds zzso acid with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis allowed the construction of zzso zzso to isolate a corresponding zzso coding for this zzso The open reading frame of this zzso predicts a protein of 201 zzso acids and zzso Da in zzso The zzso acid sequence includes a zzso zzso signal sequence and a zzso signal element consisting of the zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be responsible for preventing zzso of proteins from the zzso of the zzso zzso
