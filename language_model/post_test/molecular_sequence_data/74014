The evolutionary relationships of zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined by their degree of zzso their structural and functional properties and by the occurrence of zzso structural zzso The structural zzso formed by the different protein families were zzso The occurrence of zzso groups was investigated for each protein family within the zzso zzso trees were constructed between these organisms and together with the zzso sequences of the other zzso zzso All organisms belonging to the zzso clearly formed a zzso zzso The zzso sequence motifs were checked for the potential to form similar secondary structural zzso
