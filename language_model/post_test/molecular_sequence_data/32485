zzso zzso is the main prevalent zzso zzso strain in China and the dominant strain in zzso as well; therefore, obtaining and understanding the genetic characterization of this zzso become zzso To date only a few full-length zzso zzso zzso from China have been zzso We reported 13 full-length zzso zzso isolate sequences from zzso zzso DNA was zzso the zzso and 3' halves of each zzso were separately zzso and the zzso products were cloned and zzso The zzso analysis of the 13 sequences showed that they clustered with zzso zzso zzso these zzso were separated into a few distinct zzso and were dispersed among the Thailand zzso and the zzso diversity among zzso zzso was significantly zzso The high gene diversity among zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso viruses in zzso may be transmitted from multiple zzso The work is essential for the design and development of an effective AIDS vaccine for zzso
