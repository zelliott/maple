Cell migration and zzso guidance require proper regulation of the zzso zzso in response to zzso guidance zzso zzso small zzso are essential regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is required for various cellular zzso changes and migration events and is under the control of several guidance signaling zzso There is still considerable uncertainty regarding events following the zzso of guidance receptors by zzso signals and the regulation of zzso dynamics based on zzso restricted zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso domain protein zzso acts as a novel zzso for zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein has previously been identified as an zzso for Ras zzso and is now known to function as a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso zzso We found that zzso specifically binds to the zzso form of zzso and that zzso in zzso cause significant defects in migration and zzso guidance of restricted zzso cell types including zzso and HSN zzso in contrast to the various defects observed in zzso zzso Our analyses place zzso in the zzso genetic zzso that regulates repulsive signaling for zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso accumulated on both the zzso and zzso sides of the developing HSN zzso in contrast to its zzso zzso in wild zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso acts as an zzso for zzso and regulates zzso zzso in response to restricted guidance zzso
