zzso zzso zzso is an inherited disease characterized by premature onset of aging, increased cancer zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso with a central domain zzso to the zzso family of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA with zzso zzso and also possesses zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso may be aided by the identification of zzso zzso We show here that zzso functionally interacts with DNA zzso delta zzso zzso a zzso zzso required for DNA replication and DNA zzso zzso increases the rate of zzso incorporation by pol delta in the absence of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso but does not stimulate the activity of zzso DNA zzso alpha or zzso or a variety of other DNA zzso Moreover, we show that functional interaction with zzso is zzso through the third zzso of pol zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to the recently identified zzso zzso of human pol zzso zzso of the third zzso abrogates stimulation by zzso and stimulation is restored by zzso the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may facilitate pol zzso DNA replication and/or DNA repair and that disruption of zzso delta interaction in zzso cells may contribute to the previously observed zzso defects and/or the unusual sensitivity to a limited number of DNA damaging zzso
