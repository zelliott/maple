A total of 508 random clones from five zzso zzso zzso libraries were partially zzso and zzso This resulted in the identification of zzso unique zzso zzso information from these clones zzso zzso representing approximately zzso of this zzso zzso was analyzed by comparison to the DNA and protein sequence data zzso The frequency with which clones could be identified, by virtue of possessing zzso to another data base entry, was zzso zzso analysis indicated the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains many genes involved in various zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA may comprise as much as zzso of this zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene may be the result of horizontal transfer from an unknown zzso zzso Not all zzso pairs are present in this zzso at the expected zzso zzso This zzso potentially encodes approximately 390 proteins and makes very efficient use of its limited amount of zzso In addition, this study allowed us to estimate the number of genes involved with various cellular zzso
