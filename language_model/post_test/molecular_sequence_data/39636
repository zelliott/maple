zzso of class I major zzso complex zzso is severely zzso on zzso in chronic zzso caused by zzso zzso virus zzso To determine which of the viral proteins mediates class I zzso zzso suppression, cultured normal zzso zzso were zzso with the complete zzso zzso sequences zzso individual virus zzso or whole virus zzso in which zzso of selected proteins was disabled by zzso zzso It was found that zzso presentation of class I zzso zzso was significantly inhibited following zzso with complete zzso zzso or with viral zzso fragments zzso envelope zzso protein or zzso zzso which naturally encompasses zzso zzso acid zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with zzso X gene alone demonstrated a profound enhancement in the class I zzso display, whereas those expressing virus major S protein or zzso zzso protein were not different from control zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequences confirmed that the envelope zzso protein was responsible for zzso of the class I zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, treatment with zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso restored the inhibited presentation of the class I zzso Moreover, the class I zzso suppression was not associated with zzso of zzso genes for class I zzso heavy chain, zzso zzso associated with zzso processing, and zzso zzso These findings indicate that the defective presentation of class I zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso is a consequence of zzso suppression exerted by virus zzso protein and that this hindrance can be fully reversed by zzso
