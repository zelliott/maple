The zzso zzso strain zzso zzso locus is comprised of two zzso oriented zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso which encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso start point of zzso is immediately downstream of a strong zzso zzso repeat motif likely to be the zzso binding site, while the zzso zzso start site zzso the zzso start zzso generating a zzso zzso zzso By using the zzso reporter gene of zzso as a reporter, the zzso zzso zzso promoter was zzso zzso more active than either the zzso zzso promoter or the zzso promoter of zzso The zzso zzso promoter produced reporter protein levels comparable to those of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso promoter was built into a set of zzso and zzso fusion expression zzso which have been used for the zzso expression of numerous zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso strain zzso as well as the expression and zzso of soluble zzso human zzso
