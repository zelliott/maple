Using an zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso numerous zzso zzso cells were identified within the zzso of the European common frog, zzso zzso An zzso zzso extract of pancreatic tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the extract resolved a single peak of zzso zzso with synthetic bovine zzso zzso zzso phase zzso of this material resolved a single peak of zzso which was zzso to zzso following zzso on a zzso zzso column and an zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso mass zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resolved a single component with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso gas phase sequencing established the sequence of the first 26 zzso Following incubation of the zzso with zzso zzso and direct application of the digest to the zzso the entire primary structure of the zzso was established zzso zzso The derived molecular mass of this zzso incorporating a zzso zzso was zzso Da which is entirely consistent with that obtained by zzso
