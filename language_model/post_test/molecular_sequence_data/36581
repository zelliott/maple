The short segments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso 4 were amplified using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso in order to characterize various types of zzso Cell lines with zzso features zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be present in zzso zzso and zzso cells, while only zzso cells expressed zzso or zzso These results suggested that zzso cell lines could be zzso into two groups, one with the zzso transcript and the other without zzso zzso zzso was present in the cells obtained from one zzso syndrome patient with transient zzso disorder and in one patient with primary zzso and zzso On the other hand, one patient with acute zzso leukemia transformed from zzso anemia had a poor prognosis with zzso leukemia cells which expressed no zzso zzso These observations suggested that the expression of zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso may indicate the absence of a true zzso zzso
