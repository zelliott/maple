Genome sequencing enhances our understanding of the biological world by providing zzso for the evolutionary and functional diversity that shapes the zzso However, microbial zzso that are currently available are of limited zzso zzso zzso to our historical inability to cultivate most zzso in the zzso We apply zzso zzso to target and sequence 201 zzso zzso and bacterial cells from nine diverse zzso belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called zzso dark zzso With this additional zzso information, we are able to resolve many zzso and zzso relationships and to propose two new zzso We uncover unexpected zzso features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three zzso of zzso These include a novel zzso acid use for the zzso stop zzso an zzso zzso synthesis in zzso and complete zzso factors in zzso similar to those in zzso The zzso zzso also served to zzso anchor up to zzso of zzso reads in some zzso zzso zzso interpretation of zzso zzso This study greatly expands the zzso representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our zzso
