zzso stem cells zzso are maintained through the regulation of zzso and zzso cell zzso We report that conditional zzso of the zzso protein zzso results in a failure of zzso maintenance and zzso caused by a loss of zzso and increased commitment zzso zzso to previous studies, we found that these zzso were independent of zzso Global zzso profiling and zzso target analysis uncovered zzso interactions at multiple zzso within pathways that govern zzso translation, stem cell function, and zzso zzso zzso zzso are insensitive to zzso expansion and have decreased signaling zzso resulting in a loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an important regulator of the zzso zzso and balances zzso zzso and lineage zzso
