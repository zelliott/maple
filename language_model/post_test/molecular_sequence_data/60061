A zzso bacterial strain zzso capable of zzso zzso was previously enriched in continuous culture from a landfill zzso treatment plant and isolated as a pure zzso The zzso position of this isolate within the zzso of the zzso was determined by zzso zzso sequence analysis and by conventional zzso including zzso spectrum, zzso type zzso zzso and cellular fatty acid zzso zzso of the specific zzso zzso supports the membership of strain zzso in the zzso of the zzso The results of zzso zzso sequencing showed that the strain clustered with, but was separate from, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the new isolate represents a new species of the zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso
