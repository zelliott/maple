zzso are zzso sensors that regulate gene expression upon binding specific zzso or zzso zzso zzso control gene expression primarily by promoting intrinsic zzso termination or by zzso translation zzso We now report a third general mechanism of zzso zzso governing the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to terminate zzso We establish that zzso promotes zzso termination in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli when the corresponding zzso zzso are zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso enabled zzso of the coding regions at these two zzso in bacteria experiencing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso A zzso in the zzso leader that favors the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoted zzso zzso termination in zzso and in zzso and enhanced the ability of the zzso to stimulate zzso zzso activity in zzso These effects were overcome by zzso in a zzso region of the zzso that is alternately folded at high and low zzso suggesting a role for this region in regulating the activity of zzso Our results reveal a potentially widespread mode of gene regulation zzso zzso dictate whether a protein zzso can interact with the zzso machinery to prematurely terminate zzso
