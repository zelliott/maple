Limited zzso of large pea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso in zzso M Na zzso pH zzso yielded a zzso zzso of zzso fragments of zzso Further SEC in zzso M zzso pH zzso plus various zzso of zzso indicated that the zzso complex contained an zzso of 7 fragments of molecular mass from 38 to 55 zzso The zzso sequence of each zzso was determined from the samples zzso from sodium zzso zzso gels onto zzso zzso zzso in order to zzso the various fragments on the zzso zzso zzso All of the 7 fragments in the zzso were found to be derived from the zzso half of zzso A portion of the zzso chain (from zzso to zzso common to all the zzso fragments has been assigned as the zzso of contact of the zzso The zzso complex, as well as large zzso itself, has been shown by SEC to zzso to zzso in 2 M zzso The result indicates that the main force involved in maintaining the complex and in contacts between zzso of zzso is zzso in zzso zzso between the contact zzso of the zzso complex and large zzso zzso is zzso
