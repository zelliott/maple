This report describes the difference in the zzso generation of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the regulation zzso We identified a new zzso short zzso termed zzso The previously identified long zzso is referred to as zzso zzso shares the C zzso with zzso but has its unique N zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso but is also expressed in very low levels in tumor cells, whereas zzso is expressed in tumor cells and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso in tumor cells resulted from regulation at transcription, although alternative zzso also participated in the generation of the zzso In addition, zzso zzso to a zzso zzso were significantly higher than that to zzso zzso in the zzso from patients with zzso Finally, the zzso to full-length zzso in the zzso from patients with tumors were correlated with the zzso in the zzso from these patients to zzso which is a fusion protein with a zzso N zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso is mainly responsible for the zzso zzso Our studies have identified the alternative promoter in combination with alternative zzso as a novel mechanism for regulation of the zzso generation of a zzso zzso
