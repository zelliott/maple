zzso zzso cell types are generated at characteristic times and positions in the zzso horn of the spinal zzso We provide evidence that the identity and pattern of generation of zzso zzso depend initially on zzso signals that derive from the zzso zzso and induce zzso zzso cells of the roof zzso zzso plate cells provide a secondary source of zzso signals that are required for the generation of distinct classes of zzso zzso These zzso interactions involve both qualitative and quantitative differences in signaling by zzso factors and zzso changes in the response of neural zzso zzso
