A new family of human zzso zzso has recently been zzso The best known example of a full length member of this family, zzso is located on zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a long open reading frame within its zzso gene which is expressed in various zzso and mainly in zzso as a protein that we called zzso A search for new zzso sequences related to the zzso family allowed the characterization of such elements in zzso zzso A novel full length zzso with an zzso gene of the zzso type, potentially zzso a truncated form of zzso has been identified on zzso zzso The distribution of zzso related sequences close to or within genes offers the possibility that the expression of these genes may be regulated by their companion zzso zzso
