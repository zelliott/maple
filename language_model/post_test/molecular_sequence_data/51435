The human DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which protects cells against the zzso effect of zzso zzso was found to be localized in the cell nucleus (except the zzso by zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The supporting experiments came from differential zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, Western zzso analysis, and specific zzso depletion studies with the immobilized fusion zzso zzso Its zzso in the nucleus agrees with its biological function and possibly explains the ineffective protection of zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso coli zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso
