The bovine zzso protein is zzso by zzso zzso cells and shed into milk as an integral component of the milk fat zzso zzso however, the structure and functions of this zzso particularly in relation to zzso are poorly zzso The objectives of this investigation were to investigate the zzso gene and protein structures in the context of zzso and to test the hypothesis that zzso has a role in innate immune zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso DNA from 630 cattle revealed extensive zzso in the variable number of tandem repeats zzso in the bovine zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso spanning 7 to 23 zzso units, each zzso 20 zzso were zzso Three zzso containing 11, 14, and 16 zzso units, respectively, were zzso In addition, a zzso in one of the zzso units has the potential to introduce a unique site for zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated weak associations between the zzso zzso and milk protein and fat percentages in a zzso population of zzso dairy zzso No association with zzso cell count could be zzso zzso zzso was zzso from milk fat zzso zzso and zzso The protein was highly zzso primarily with zzso zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, with zzso zzso which together accounted for approximately zzso of the apparent mass of zzso zzso bovine zzso directly bound zzso labeled zzso coli zzso zzso Mount zzso zzso and inhibited their binding to bovine zzso zzso cells grown in zzso It was also demonstrated that the expression of zzso zzso in bovine zzso zzso cells was markedly zzso by zzso zzso may be a pattern recognition protein that has the capacity to zzso bacteria and prevent their attachment to zzso surfaces by zzso and subsequently shedding zzso bacteria from the cell zzso It was concluded that bovine zzso is probably an zzso innate immune zzso and an important component of the first line of defense against bacterial invasion of zzso surfaces, particularly zzso zzso surfaces and the zzso zzso
