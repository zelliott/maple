The zzso which is the structure that appears around the zzso of zzso zzso is assumed to be involved in nuclear shaping during zzso and the transport of various proteins between the nucleus and zzso zzso In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a mouse zzso zzso protein 1 zzso from a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso zzso clones could be divided into three zzso based on sequence zzso zzso analysis showed that these zzso were zzso zzso from a single locus of the mouse zzso The three putative proteins consisted of zzso zzso and 175 zzso zzso zzso Although 155 zzso acids of the N zzso were common to the three zzso they were distinguished by their zzso zzso Western zzso analyses using specific zzso showed that zzso expression was specific to the zzso and that only the zzso form was translated into zzso zzso revealed that zzso was localized to the zzso of step 9-12 zzso zzso The protein appeared in a cap formation that covered the zzso sides of the zzso zzso This zzso pattern coincided with that of the zzso zzso may play an important role as a functional protein that zzso with zzso zzso
