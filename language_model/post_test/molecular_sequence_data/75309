zzso coding for human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from a human liver and a zzso zzso zzso differentiated zzso zzso library constructed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the insert zzso had an opening reading frame coding for 222 zzso acid zzso The first 24 zzso acids of the primarily translated zzso might constitute the leader zzso for transport of the precursors to the zzso zzso of the zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the mature zzso zzso of human, rat and mouse are highly zzso while the sequences of the leader peptides of these species are moderately zzso
