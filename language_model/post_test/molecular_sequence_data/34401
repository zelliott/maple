The zzso zzso zzso gene family encodes G zzso receptors for zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The human family has 3 functional zzso whereas the mouse family has 7 functional genes and 2 possible zzso zzso and zzso Here we characterize zzso a zzso of zzso Compared to zzso the zzso zzso is 186 zzso shorter but zzso zzso Due to a deletion and frame shift, the sequences lack zzso from zzso acid zzso Both transcripts were detected zzso in multiple immune zzso however, zzso was consistently less abundant than zzso zzso induced expression of zzso but not zzso in zzso and bone zzso Both transcripts were detected zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas only zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso Both transcripts were induced in zzso zzso zzso fusion protein appeared in zzso but not plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso labeled only plasma zzso Survival of zzso mice was zzso shorter than that of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but no signature pathology was zzso Since zzso is expressed in zzso and regulated by bacterial products, and may affect zzso we propose zzso it zzso an zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
