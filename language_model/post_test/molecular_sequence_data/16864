zzso in zzso DNA zzso remains a controversial zzso Here we present a survey of 279 animal zzso data sets, of which 12 were from asexual zzso Using four separate tests, we show that there is widespread evidence of zzso for one test as many as zzso of the data sets reject a model of zzso inheritance and in several data sets, including zzso the zzso can be identified zzso We show that none of the tests give significant results for zzso zzso species zzso zzso and that the sexual species show significantly greater evidence of zzso than asexual zzso For some data sets, such as zzso zzso additional data sets suggest that the zzso are not zzso For others, it cannot be determined whether the zzso are real or produced by laboratory zzso Either way, the results have important implications for how zzso is zzso and zzso
