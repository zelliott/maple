zzso C zzso a zzso protein of the thin filament of muscle, plays a regulatory role in skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso zzso reveals a small zzso change in the cardiac regulatory zzso domain of zzso zzso on binding of zzso such that the total exposed zzso surface area increases very slightly from zzso zzso 86 zzso for zzso to zzso zzso 71 zzso for zzso Here, we show that measurement of zzso accessibility for backbone zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso exchange followed by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transform Ion zzso resonance mass zzso is sufficiently sensitive to detect such small zzso zzso zzso changes of that zzso The extent of zzso incorporation increases significantly on binding of zzso for each of four zzso segments derived from zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso forms of zzso The present results demonstrate that zzso exchange monitored by mass zzso can be sufficiently sensitive to detect and identify even very small zzso changes in zzso and should therefore be especially zzso for proteins too large (or too zzso or otherwise zzso for zzso zzso
