zzso zzso calcium zzso channels are zzso proteins that are regulated through zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso We demonstrated that the beta 2 zzso was a zzso for zzso in intact cardiac zzso through zzso zzso In addition, a zzso expressed rat beta zzso zzso was zzso at two sites in zzso by zzso zzso This beta zzso zzso contains two potential consensus sites for zzso zzso at zzso and zzso However, upon zzso of both of these zzso to zzso the beta zzso zzso remained a good zzso for zzso The actual sites of zzso on the beta zzso zzso were identified by zzso mapping and zzso zzso maps of a zzso expressed beta zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso was zzso similarly to the beta 2 zzso isolated from heart tissue and that the zzso sites were contained in the unique zzso zzso zzso identified three zzso zzso each of which zzso to loose consensus sites for zzso zzso zzso of these zzso to zzso resulted in the loss of the zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso of the beta zzso zzso by zzso occurs at three loose consensus sites for zzso in the zzso and not at either of the two strong consensus sites for zzso The results also highlight the danger of assuming that consensus sites represent actual sites of zzso The actual sites of zzso zzso are zzso in most beta 2 zzso zzso and thus represent potential sites for regulation of channel zzso The sites zzso by zzso are not zzso for protein zzso C zzso as the zzso beta 2 zzso lacking zzso sites remained good zzso for zzso
