A repetitive region of zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso was expressed as a fusion protein with either zzso binding protein or the B zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of mice with the fusion proteins indicates that this region of zzso is zzso as evidenced by an zzso zzso The fusion proteins were also expressed in zzso and mice were orally zzso with the zzso zzso Some of the vaccinated mice survived a challenge with zzso zzso zzso zzso without developing zzso All control mice became patent and succumbed to the challenge zzso This partial protection was also observed with zzso zzso protein and was independent of the zzso zzso Mice zzso with zzso zzso showed either extremely low or no zzso response to zzso suggesting that zzso immunity is important for the observed zzso These studies show that it is feasible to develop a cost effective oral vaccine against the blood stage of the zzso zzso
