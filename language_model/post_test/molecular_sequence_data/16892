The neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso mediates a multitude of central nervous functions by zzso zzso zzso zzso A dysfunction of zzso zzso is considered to play a major role in the zzso of complex zzso zzso In our study, a zzso screen of the zzso zzso gene zzso was carried out to explore a putative contribution to the zzso of bipolar affective disorder zzso and schizophrenia zzso zzso of 49 patients suffering from zzso 78 patients with zzso and 62 control individuals revealed zzso sequence variations including a 3 zzso deletion within the zzso zzso untranslated zzso four zzso and five zzso zzso as well as a point zzso in the zzso of zzso Four of these sequence variations have not been described zzso zzso zzso rated most zzso as probably zzso related zzso However, zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso C were solely detected in bipolar affective patients and in none of the zzso Interestingly, we observed a significant zzso of the 3 zzso deletion zzso in an extended sample of 162 bipolar affected patients compared to controls zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that this deletion may influence zzso efficiency, thereby possibly affecting the development of bipolar affective zzso
