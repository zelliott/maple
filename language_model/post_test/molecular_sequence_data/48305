The contribution of zzso accessory gene of zzso infectious anemia virus zzso to the zzso of zzso strains was investigated in the present study by reverse zzso of all four consensus zzso zzso sites in an attenuated zzso zzso strain, zzso to the corresponding sequences of a highly zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso with similar zzso to zzso in cultivated target zzso In contrast to the results of other studies of zzso with dysfunctional zzso reverse zzso of zzso only zzso and moderately increased the plasma viral load of zzso horses, and induction of transient zzso did not boost viral zzso In addition, zzso of zzso induced partial protection to a challenge zzso zzso These results suggest that the attenuated zzso vaccine strain with multiple zzso in multiple genes will not easily zzso to a virulent zzso
