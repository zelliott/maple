zzso zzso zzso is a destructive zzso pathogen that zzso economically important zzso zzso zzso and other crops in the United States and zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic structure of 255 zzso zzso zzso assigned to zzso host, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from six continents, 21 countries, 19 zzso states, and 26 host species were zzso for four zzso and six nuclear zzso zzso zzso revealed some population structure by host, geographic origin, and zzso sensitivity, with some clusters occurring more or less frequently in particular zzso zzso zzso split networks, and statistical zzso zzso also detected the presence of zzso zzso individuals in our sample corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso 9) and zzso of a distinct cluster closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings of genetic structuring in zzso zzso populations highlight the importance of including zzso from all detected clusters that represent the genetic variation in zzso zzso for development of diagnostic tools, zzso and host zzso The population structure detected will also impact the design and interpretation of association studies in zzso zzso This study provides an initial map of global population structure of zzso zzso but continued zzso of zzso will be necessary to expand our knowledge of genetic variation in this important plant zzso
