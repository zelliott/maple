zzso zzso is an emerging human pathogen and a significant cause of zzso infections among hospital patients zzso The enormous increase in zzso resistance among hospital zzso and the recent emergence of zzso strains underscores the urgency to understand how zzso zzso zzso in hospital zzso To this end, we undertook a zzso study of a zzso outbreak of zzso zzso zzso at the zzso National Institutes of Health Clinical zzso Comparing the complete zzso sequences of the three dominant outbreak strain types enabled us to conclude that, despite all belonging to the same epidemic zzso the three strains zzso before their arrival at the National Institutes of zzso The simultaneous presence of three divergent strains from this lineage supports its increasing prevalence in international hospitals and suggests an ongoing adaptation to the hospital zzso Further zzso comparisons uncovered that much of the diversification that occurred since the divergence of the three outbreak strains was zzso by zzso zzso across zzso of their zzso zzso of zzso regions revealed that several regions were associated with either the loss or swapping out of genes zzso proteins that are exposed to the cell surface or that zzso zzso zzso zzso our analysis to a larger set of international clinical zzso revealed a previously unappreciated ability of zzso zzso to vary surface molecules through horizontal gene transfer, with subsequent zzso dissemination by zzso zzso These findings have immediate implications in zzso zzso and treatment of zzso zzso zzso
