The central role that tumor zzso peptides play in induction of zzso immunity makes them ideal candidates for zzso cancer zzso We have demonstrated that zzso is an efficient strategy for importing short zzso zzso into zzso cells in zzso zzso that the zzso procedure might effect zzso zzso by zzso cells in zzso as well, we tested this approach for the generation of zzso cancer zzso In the zzso zzso system, we vaccinated mice by zzso injection of a single, known natural zzso derived from zzso zzso Whereas vaccination with zzso alone or mixed with incomplete zzso zzso was zzso application of the zzso in conjunction with the zzso zzso protected a significant number of animals against tumor zzso zzso upon the type of zzso applied, protection against tumor take was comparable to that achieved with zzso zzso vaccines, genetically modified to zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso melanoma zzso a combination of four putative tumor zzso peptides was tested as a cancer zzso zzso in combination with zzso these peptides evoked potent zzso immunity that could not be obtained with the peptides alone or peptides zzso in incomplete zzso zzso However, zzso vaccines applied to the zzso model were not as efficient as cellular control vaccines, consisting of zzso zzso 2 or zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso
