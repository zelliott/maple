zzso in the zzso B virus zzso have been implicated in the persistence of zzso B virus infection and the zzso of zzso B virus related liver zzso In view of the zzso in published zzso data from zzso studies of unrelated subjects cannot differentiate true zzso from infections with zzso zzso 

We compared the zzso B virus core gene sequences of 42 zzso positive subjects from 11 Chinese families with those of the index patients zzso zzso to determine the frequency and rate of true zzso B virus core gene zzso in patients with chronic zzso B virus zzso 

zzso identical zzso sequences were present in all the family members and index patients in two families, suggesting that the zzso B virus core gene can be zzso for more than 20 zzso The high degree of sequence conservation in these families is related to the young age of the subjects zzso zzso zzso the fact that they were all zzso positive and that zzso of them had persistently normal zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that zzso were rare in those who remained zzso positive with normal zzso levels zzso tolerant zzso but significantly more common in zzso positive subjects who had elevated zzso levels and in those who cleared zzso zzso clearance zzso the rates of zzso and zzso acid changes were zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso vs zzso zzso 

zzso zzso differences could be found in the sequences of all the subjects in some zzso These differences were more likely to be due to zzso transmission of stable zzso zzso analysis based on comparisons with published sequences would have led to zzso of zzso The zzso B virus core gene can remain highly zzso for more than two decades during the immune tolerant phase of zzso acquired chronic zzso B virus zzso However, significant changes can occur within 2-3 years during the immune clearance zzso
