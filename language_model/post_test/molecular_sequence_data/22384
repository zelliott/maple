zzso are members of the zzso zzso family and major components of zzso zzso of professional killer zzso Multiple zzso have been identified from human and zzso with different zzso zzso Although the significance of zzso A and B in zzso zzso has been extensively investigated, recent reports suggest that other zzso may have either equal or greater importance in zzso cell zzso Studies on the evolution of these closely related zzso were hindered by the lack of sequence and zzso information of zzso from zzso zzso Here we report the generation of a zzso active zzso zzso identified in the zzso cells of an zzso zzso zzso active, soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated using a zzso expression zzso In zzso zzso kinetic zzso using various zzso zzso zzso verified its zzso activity in full agreement with previous observations by sequence comparison and molecular zzso The zzso activity that was zzso from zzso zzso during an in zzso zzso zzso strongly correlated with the zzso induced by these zzso Evidence for additional zzso with different zzso zzso in zzso was obtained by analysis of the zzso activity of zzso collected from in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso database further confirmed the presence of zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso activity zzso suggested a predominance of zzso and zzso activities in zzso Further proof that the zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso mechanisms in zzso was provided by the expression of zzso components zzso zzso and zzso detected by zzso zzso These results demonstrate the evidence for a parallel evolution of zzso molecules of zzso zzso in zzso
