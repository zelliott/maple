In zzso zzso the genes coding for the zzso protein zzso are present in two copies per zzso zzso The two copies, which zzso proteins differing in only a few zzso zzso contribute zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso copy makes zzso of the zzso while the zzso copy makes only zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso B zzso did not lead to any zzso zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso copy zzso A zzso produced a zzso zzso associated with decreased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso No zzso compensation occurred at the zzso level in the disrupted zzso in fact, delta A strains contained reduced levels of zzso zzso whereas delta B strains had almost normal zzso The zzso zzso was restored in the delta A strains by transformation with extra copies of the intact zzso or zzso zzso As already shown for other duplicated genes zzso and Warner, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the difference in expression of the two gene copies could be accounted for via differential zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso promoter regions has shown the presence of zzso zzso boxes which are slightly different in the two zzso
