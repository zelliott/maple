zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of peptides in host zzso and zzso cells of the central nervous system zzso and zzso and zzso cells of the zzso This zzso has now facilitated the characterization of two new members of the zzso family from zzso of zzso zzso The zzso given the names zzso and zzso are 24 and 39 zzso acids in length with the sequences zzso and zzso The sequence of zzso is identical to the zzso 24 zzso acids of zzso The zzso zzso of each is identical to a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso This sequence is preceded by a potential processing zzso In zzso insects zzso was present at zzso the amount of zzso In zzso insects zzso and zzso accumulate in the middle and zzso regions of the zzso which are enriched in zzso cells reacting with zzso zzso In the combined brain and zzso zzso zzso was not detected and the amount of zzso never exceeded 2 zzso per zzso Of the three zzso only zzso was found in the zzso Thus, zzso and zzso may be zzso in the zzso of zzso and may themselves be released locally from zzso cells in the zzso zzso
