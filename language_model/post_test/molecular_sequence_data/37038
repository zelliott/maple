zzso zzso 423 produces a small zzso zzso protein designated zzso zzso This protein is zzso for many zzso zzso pathogens and zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso region on zzso zzso revealed a four open reading frame zzso zzso structure similar to zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso The first ORF, zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso consisting of a zzso acid mature zzso with a zzso acid zzso leader zzso The second ORF, zzso encodes a putative immunity protein with protein sequence similarities to several zzso immunity zzso The zzso and zzso genes are virtually identical to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 423 was cloned on a shuttle zzso under the control of a zzso promoter and zzso produced in zzso zzso
