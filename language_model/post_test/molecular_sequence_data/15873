zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso locus reverse the zzso of zzso zzso in a number of genes located throughout the zzso zzso To understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon, the zzso locus was isolated by zzso walking from a cloned zzso zzso The exact location of the gene was determined by Southern analysis of the DNA zzso associated with several zzso zzso A zzso zzso fragment, where all the DNA changes associated with zzso zzso were zzso was able to rescue the zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso This DNA zzso encodes a zzso zzso that is expressed in all stages of zzso zzso the size or abundance of this zzso is affected in several zzso zzso zzso This transcript encodes a protein that contains a highly zzso region and 12 repeats of the zzso zzso domain characteristic of some zzso and zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis that the zzso locus might zzso a zzso factor that plays a role in the expression of the gypsy zzso
