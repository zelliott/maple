DNA zzso I zzso is a ubiquitous nuclear zzso It is specifically inhibited by zzso a natural product derived from the bark of the tree zzso zzso zzso and several of its derivatives are presently in clinical trial and exhibit remarkable zzso zzso The present study is a further investigation of the molecular interactions between the drug and the zzso zzso We zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared its activity against calf zzso zzso in a DNA zzso containing a single zzso zzso site with the activity of its zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso produced a DNA zzso that migrated more slowly than the zzso DNA zzso observed with zzso zzso was unable to zzso this zzso in the presence of high zzso concentration or zzso K at 50 degrees zzso This zzso was resistant to zzso treatment and was also formed with an zzso containing a zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso + zzso It was however zzso by zzso acid treatment followed by zzso These observations are consistent with zzso of the zzso base zzso or zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso complexes and provide direct evidence that zzso inhibit zzso by binding at the zzso zzso
