An understanding of the relative contributions of different evolutionary forces on an zzso zzso requires an accurate description of the patterns of genetic variation within and between natural zzso To this end, I report a survey of zzso zzso in six zzso from 118 strains of the zzso zzso zzso These strains derive from wild populations of several regions within France, Germany, and new localities in Scotland, in addition to stock center zzso zzso levels of zzso diversity are low within and between populations of this zzso species, averaging zzso in European samples and zzso zzso zzso structure is present despite a lack of association of sequences with geography, and migration appears to occur at all geographic zzso zzso zzso is extensive in the zzso zzso zzso extending even between zzso Nevertheless, zzso is clearly present in the pattern of zzso indicating that zzso is an zzso but important, feature in this species zzso The range of zzso rates consistent with the data is zzso from linkage zzso using zzso samples representing the collecting phase of the zzso process in a subdivided zzso I propose that genetic variation in this species is shaped largely by population subdivision due to zzso coupled with long- and short-range migration between zzso
