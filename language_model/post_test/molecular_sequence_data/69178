The product of the zzso zzso zzso gene is involved in the zzso of zzso When grown at the zzso temperature, zzso zzso cells lyse in the absence of an zzso stabilizer and display a reduced zzso zzso content and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned by the rescue of the zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso library and subsequently verified by integration of the appropriate insert into the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of this gene revealed a putative open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso The zzso DNA zzso to a main transcript, the zzso end of which maps to a position 469 zzso upstream of the predicted start of zzso The sequence between the zzso and the translation start sites is unusually long and has several short open reading frames which suggest a zzso control of the gene zzso Comparative analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence shows that it possesses significant similarity to three zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso genes respectively, which are beta zzso of different zzso When grown at 37 degrees C, zzso zzso extracts were specifically deficient in zzso type I activity, as measured in zzso Multiple copies of the zzso gene can partially suppress the growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the restrictive zzso In a similar manner, the zzso gene can partially suppress the zzso growth zzso These results indicate that zzso is the structural gene for the beta zzso of zzso type I in zzso zzso and that this zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional zzso of zzso with zzso which has been implicated in the control of cell zzso suggests a link between two zzso events such as establishment of cell polarity and cell wall zzso
