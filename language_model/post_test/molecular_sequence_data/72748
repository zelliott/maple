zzso analysis of a copy of the novel mobile element zzso and its zzso region into the cut locus of zzso was zzso The zzso was shown to be a zzso containing a single open reading frame zzso It does not contain zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso and zzso which are required for zzso However, multiple insertions of this copy of the mobile element into a zzso region of the cut locus zzso zzso were observed zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso zzso contains two successive regions zzso to the proteins zzso by the zzso and zzso of the gypsy zzso in N and C regions, zzso The zzso zzso into this region of the cut locus interrupts its ORF, since the mobile element is transcribed in the opposite direction compared with the zzso in the zzso This is presumed to account for the arising of a lethal zzso The hot site of this element integration into the locus zzso to the recognition site of zzso zzso zzso
