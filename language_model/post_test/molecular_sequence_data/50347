A three-dimensional zzso molecular model of the zzso site of a bovine zzso zzso zzso has been zzso In the model, the zzso and a single heavy chain framework region zzso zzso associate to form a zzso cavity large enough to accommodate a single zzso of zzso zzso of zzso lies at the bottom of the cavity with its zzso group exposed to zzso Using the model and data from binding studies, we predicted that the cavity forms the zzso zzso and on binding testosterone a hydrogen bond is formed between zzso of zzso and the zzso group on the zzso of zzso This prediction has subsequently been tested by zzso zzso An zzso with zzso in place of zzso at position 97 in zzso has its affinity reduced by approximately 800 zzso The reduction in binding energy associated with the reduced affinity has been calculated to be zzso zzso which is within the range zzso zzso expected for the loss of a single hydrogen zzso The model has been used to suggest ways of increasing the zzso affinity for zzso
