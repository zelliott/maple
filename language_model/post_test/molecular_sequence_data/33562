In this study, a full-length zzso heat shock protein 70 complementary DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso as zzso was obtained by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso coupled with rapid amplification of zzso zzso The full length of zzso zzso was zzso zzso with a zzso untranslated region of 248 zzso a 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso and an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 657 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an estimated zzso point of zzso There was highly repeated sequence of zzso in zzso untranslated region of zzso The result of zzso tree of zzso the zzso program, analysis and zzso zzso motif of zzso verified that the cloned zzso belonged to zzso zzso zzso Three typical zzso signature motifs were detected in zzso by zzso zzso Under different stress conditions, zzso zzso zzso expression levels of zzso were zzso by quantitative zzso To zzso zzso zzso kept in different temperatures for 1 zzso the expression level of zzso at 30 degrees C was highest and twofold higher than that at 10 degrees zzso To zzso zzso zzso kept at 25 degrees C for different times, the zzso expression level of zzso reached a maximum level after 7 h and then dropped zzso The expression level of zzso at 0 or 5 per thousand salt concentration for 2 h was twofold higher than that at 30 per thousand salt concentration for 2 zzso The results showed that zzso may be a kind of potential zzso used to monitor environment zzso
