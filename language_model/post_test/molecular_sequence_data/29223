The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso of zzso zzso has been localized to a zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso and its entire zzso sequence zzso The zzso content of the entire sequence is 66 zzso which is within the range zzso zzso previously determined for zzso zzso total zzso zzso encodes a replication initiation protein zzso zzso zzso which shares substantial similarity with putative proteins of the zzso zzso plasmids zzso and zzso and the replication protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the opposite zzso orientation to zzso encodes a putative protein that shares similarity to a zzso of zzso involved in zzso zzso The highest similarity was observed with zzso proteins zzso zzso by the zzso family of zzso found in several plasmids of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The predicted product of zzso was similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A strong zzso zzso zzso was localized between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The origin of replication of zzso contains a short zzso region and several imperfect zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso bears genes required for growth in minimal media and can therefore be referred to as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to carry closely zzso incompatible zzso It has been shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cloned into zzso zzso which does not replicate in zzso zzso can be trans activated not only by zzso but also by zzso Using zzso it was demonstrated that replication systems related to zzso are also present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
