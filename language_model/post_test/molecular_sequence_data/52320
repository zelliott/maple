zzso coli zzso was inhibited by high zzso of zzso at alkaline zzso The mechanism of the zzso was studied with two zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso with a zzso for zzso that was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of wild type but with minimal changes in zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso with little change in zzso zzso zzso but with a zzso that was zzso lower that of wild type zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a mutually zzso manner; that is zzso decreased the apparent affinity for zzso and vice zzso The zzso zzso for both zzso most zzso zzso increased with increasing pH while the zzso zzso Studies with zzso suggested that zzso zzso was not dependent on a zzso group with a zzso in the alkaline range and that the zzso was not caused by zzso binding of zzso to the wrong zzso zzso zzso was not the result of differential affinity of zzso for the R and T states of the zzso The low zzso zzso zzso did not display zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso results from zzso antagonism coupled with a steady state random mechanism wherein the high rate of zzso does not permit zzso of zzso
