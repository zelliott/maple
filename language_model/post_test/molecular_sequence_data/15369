The zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso as a putative gamma zzso zzso acid zzso zzso based on its sequence similarity to a zzso zzso transporting gene zzso A zzso of zzso was expressed in zzso and analyzed for zzso acid transport zzso Both direct measurement of zzso acid transport and zzso growth experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso exhibits transport activity for zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not for zzso or zzso zzso unlike other zzso acid zzso described in plants to date, zzso displayed both export and import zzso Based on that zzso it was named zzso zzso acid zzso 1 zzso zzso comparisons show zzso is not a member of any previously defined zzso acid zzso zzso It does share, however, several zzso protein zzso found in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso suggesting membership in an ancient family of zzso zzso is a single copy gene in the zzso zzso and its zzso is zzso expressed in all zzso A zzso zzso insert in the zzso gene displays zzso zzso in the vascular zzso zzso in Ann zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso may function in zzso acid export from the zzso into sink zzso
