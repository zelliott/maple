We have isolated and characterized two zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso At beta zzso and At beta zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso Our sequencing results showed that the gene At beta zzso is located downstream of the zzso carrier protein zzso III gene zzso At beta zzso and 4 are functional and organized into seven zzso and six zzso with an identical zzso The At beta zzso and At beta zzso genes zzso respectively, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso that contain all the characteristic hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first plant of which both zzso (At beta zzso and At beta zzso and zzso (At beta zzso and At beta zzso genes are zzso The same number of zzso and zzso is seen in the genes At beta zzso At beta zzso and At beta zzso as well as in all other zzso genes described to zzso However, the position of the third zzso is different in At beta zzso and At beta zzso At beta zzso shows a different zzso A zzso distance tree shows that the zzso zzso zzso zzso described here are, as expected, more closely related to zzso zzso from other plant species zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The evolution of plant zzso genes from a common ancestral gene is zzso Our results demonstrate that in zzso zzso at least two genes zzso zzso zzso are expressed during the development of the zzso Southern zzso zzso experiments suggest the presence of one copy of, respectively, At beta zzso and At beta zzso per zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso genes are highly expressed in zzso roots, flowers and at very low levels in mature zzso
