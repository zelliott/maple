The zzso promoter isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on curved DNA upstream of the zzso region for efficient zzso Short DNA insertions of zzso base pairs were used to simultaneously change the linear placement and zzso orientation of this curved DNA relative to the zzso zzso When these zzso promoters were analyzed in zzso using zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso orientation of the curved DNA correlated with changes in promoter zzso The most efficient zzso promoters contained insertions of 11 and 21 base pairs, and insertions of 15 and 25 base pairs resulted in the least efficient zzso zzso The importance of the proper zzso alignment of the curved DNA to promoter activity was also observed in zzso at the level of zzso of zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso of DNA fragments containing the various zzso zzso zzso there was a second region of curved DNA downstream of the zzso zzso The findings are consistent with the idea that the curved DNA zzso the zzso back toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso to allow the zzso to interact directly with upstream zzso These interactions are proposed to structure the DNA for the formation of the open promoter zzso
