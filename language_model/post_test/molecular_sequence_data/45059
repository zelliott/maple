Data mining of the zzso zzso zzso identified 4 genes analogous to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes that are involved in zzso of zzso in zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso Individual deletion of these genes was carried out in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso lost the ability to produce zzso but zzso zzso produced zzso as the wild type zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were the same as the wild type when grown in LB or zzso media, but zzso zzso and zzso were not able to grow in mineral medium with zzso or zzso as carbon zzso zzso zzso assimilated zzso and zzso via a zzso zzso zzso In this study it was found that the zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, needed zzso as a zzso This zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso actively zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of 34 zzso The apparent zzso and zzso values for zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies had shown that zzso played roles in zzso of zzso chemicals and antibiotics in zzso and zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that zzso is essential for growth of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso as carbon sources and the first characterization of a zzso zzso zzso
