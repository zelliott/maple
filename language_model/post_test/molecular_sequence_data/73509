The liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and CO2 and the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso is about zzso identical to a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso We expressed the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso in insect cells using a zzso expression zzso The zzso protein was released from insect cells to the culture medium and was zzso from the medium by a zzso zzso zzso with zzso saturated ammonium zzso followed by zzso on zzso The zzso zzso domain displayed zzso zzso activity similar to that of native zzso but had neither zzso nor zzso activity toward folate zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso domain and zzso was independent of the presence of zzso while zzso zzso activity of zzso occurred only in the presence of zzso The zzso domain existed as a zzso showing that the sites for zzso of zzso in native zzso resides in this zzso Using zzso of zzso fluorescence, it was found that the zzso domain bound zzso to the same extent as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but did not bind zzso Both zzso and its zzso domain also bound zzso zzso 11 and 16 zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso Both proteins were able to catalyze the zzso zzso reaction utilizing zzso or zzso but the zzso for zzso was three orders higher than that for zzso (2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso required for the reaction was high compared with the zzso level of zzso suggesting that the reaction does not occur in zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso reaction performed by zzso or its zzso domain using zzso
