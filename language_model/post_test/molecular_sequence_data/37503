The zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso plays an important role in the metabolism of zzso and fatty zzso and seems to protect against the development of zzso To evaluate the possible protective role of zzso on cardiovascular function, the effect of the zzso zzso zzso was assessed with respect to zzso injury and zzso function in zzso 

zzso treatment reduces zzso zzso size and improves zzso zzso zzso Hearts from zzso zzso mice exhibit increased zzso to zzso damages and were zzso to protection by zzso treatment suggesting that the beneficial effects of zzso were zzso via zzso Furthermore, zzso improves zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso vascular zzso A decreased zzso effect of zzso oxygen species in the vessel wall accounts for enhanced zzso zzso However, the latter cannot be explained by an increase in zzso oxide zzso expression nor by an increase sensitivity of the arteries to zzso zzso 

zzso the present data suggest that zzso exerts zzso effect against zzso and improves zzso zzso response probably by enhancing zzso capacity of the vessel zzso These data underscore new therapeutic perspectives for zzso zzso in zzso zzso injury and in cardiovascular diseases associated with zzso zzso
