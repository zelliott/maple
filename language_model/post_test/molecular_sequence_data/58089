zzso zzso zzso substance P zzso gene expression in cultured rat superior cervical zzso zzso zzso In order to study the molecular mechanism of this action of zzso the presence of an zzso zzso zzso activity and the identity of an zzso zzso to known zzso sequence was determined in zzso The SP increase is blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso so zzso must be interacting with a specific zzso We have cloned zzso zzso to zzso type I from rat zzso using a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The resulting zzso sequence is strongly zzso with mouse and human zzso zzso of the T cell and zzso type zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso can be readily detected in intact zzso by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso increases zzso by 2 days in zzso This increase is independent of the presence of zzso zzso beta or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The increase of zzso following zzso a model of nerve injury, may provide a mechanism linking inflammatory zzso to zzso zzso zzso
