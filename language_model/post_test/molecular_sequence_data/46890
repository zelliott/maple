zzso binding proteins zzso are small proteins (17 zzso on zzso present at high zzso ( approximately 10 zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso where they play a key role in the perception of zzso By expression in zzso coli, we have obtained large quantities zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These quantities are compatible with the requirements of X-ray and zzso zzso The zzso protein has been characterized by zzso gel zzso Western zzso zzso sequencing, mass zzso gel zzso circular zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso has been shown to be able to bind the specific zzso and a structural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in displacement zzso Our results on zzso confirm and extend previous findings on zzso zzso and two zzso from different species have been found to exist as zzso under zzso zzso The CD and structural prediction data confirm a markedly zzso structure for insect zzso rather than the zzso fold found in zzso zzso binding zzso We have tentatively identified the location of the zzso and the short zzso with respect to the binding zzso Currently we have obtained small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and determined their space group and molecular zzso
