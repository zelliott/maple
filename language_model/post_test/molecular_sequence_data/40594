To determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on left gastric artery zzso flow and to unveil the structural or functional important sites that may be critical for discrimination of different zzso zzso 

zzso including zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso were zzso by a simultaneous multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of an ultrasound zzso blood zzso were placed around the zzso of beagle zzso When peptides were infused zzso the blood flow was zzso 

zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso action which was similar to that caused by zzso The zzso blood flow response to zzso zzso was significantly higher than that to zzso which was similar to that to zzso zzso zzso zzso at the same zzso zzso did not increase the peak zzso zzso zzso showed a similar activity to zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change the activity of peptides at all zzso 

zzso zzso is more important to biological activity of peptides and specific zzso recognition than zzso
