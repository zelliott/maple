zzso structural models of three members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso were constructed by zzso modeling based on the known crystal structure of rabbit muscle zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso each have 50% or more identity with rabbit muscle zzso at the zzso acid level and all are reported to exhibit no or minor zzso zzso There are four major insertions and two deletions in the zzso sequence relative to zzso all of which are located in zzso zzso connecting secondary structural zzso The remaining zzso acid zzso are distributed throughout the sequence and are not predicted to alter the zzso zzso zzso contains a putative protein zzso C site located on a surface loop in domain II that is not present in the zzso Although the general domain structure and the active site of rabbit muscle zzso are preserved in the model of zzso zzso a major structural difference is likely to occur in domain 1 due to the absence of 55 zzso acid zzso in zzso This deletion predicts the loss of three zzso and one zzso from an zzso zzso in this domain as compared with the rabbit muscle zzso
