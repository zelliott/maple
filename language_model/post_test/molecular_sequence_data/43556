We constructed 10 different zzso of zzso by substituting all or some of the zzso in the zzso zzso operator binding motif with the respective zzso acids from zzso or zzso The zzso were zzso negative zzso over zzso in zzso and as active as zzso zzso in zzso binding in zzso The zzso zzso of the 10 zzso occurs in single zzso zzso which are centered around zzso M zzso zzso is zzso supporting a simple two-state mechanism in which the folded zzso protein is in equilibrium with unfolded zzso An analysis according to the two-state model yields a Gibbs free energy of stabilization (at 0 M zzso 25 degrees zzso of about 75 zzso typical for zzso proteins of this zzso Even a deletion of 24 zzso from the reading head decreased the stability by only zzso zzso These results suggest that the DNA reading head of zzso zzso is a zzso independent domain and that the zzso stability of the zzso zzso zzso is determined by the association of the zzso zzso of the individual zzso zzso containing replacements in the first zzso of zzso did not show any DNA binding activity zzso We attribute this to the zzso of the two zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso were active in zzso DNA zzso when either all or only the zzso zzso in the recognition zzso of zzso were exchanged to the respective zzso zzso Replacement of the same zzso by the respective zzso acids from zzso yielded hybrid proteins that specifically recognize zzso in zzso Taken together, these results establish that the similarity of operator recognition between zzso and zzso is greater than between zzso and zzso and confirm that prediction of the recognized DNA sequence is not obvious from the sequence of the respective zzso or recognition zzso
