Increased zzso zzso has been correlated with increased transcription, and regions of zzso are generally zzso In investigating the zzso relationship between zzso zzso and gene activity, we have characterized two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an approximately zzso complex that is highly sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an approximately zzso complex that is much less sensitive to zzso zzso The zzso protein (a zzso of the zzso zzso shares sequence similarity to zzso a factor required for optimal zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso zzso also shares similarity to three new open reading frames in zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso We find that both zzso and zzso deletions increase zzso levels in zzso at all sites examined in both core zzso zzso and zzso with zzso deletions having a greater impact on zzso zzso zzso positions 5 and zzso Surprisingly, both zzso and zzso deletions increase repression at zzso zzso which resemble zzso with zzso having a greater zzso In addition, zzso deletions zzso full induction of the zzso promoter fused to the reporter zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso state has a role in regulating both zzso zzso and regulated gene zzso
