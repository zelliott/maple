zzso fragments of a zzso region of the zzso C virus zzso zzso were isolated by the reverse zzso chain reaction from zzso extracted from plasma samples of healthy Japanese zzso Their zzso sequence was compared with that of the original isolate which had been zzso twice in zzso No deletions or insertions were observed between the two sequences in the regions zzso Both the zzso untranslated and putative zzso zzso protein regions were highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the region immediately downstream which encodes a putative envelope zzso showed only zzso zzso identity between the two zzso At the zzso level, the core and envelope zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso This envelope variation may reflect the adaptation of zzso to the different hosts and/or the result of zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso sequence of the zzso untranslated and core regions may play an important regulatory role in the life cycle of zzso
