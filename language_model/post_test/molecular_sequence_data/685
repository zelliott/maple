zzso cells zzso constantly exposed to zzso flow increase zzso oxide production via the zzso of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as an important zzso modification that may alter zzso and/or protein zzso zzso of zzso proteins after zzso flow treatment has not been fully zzso In this study, the zzso switch method was zzso to examine zzso proteins in zzso after exposure to zzso zzso 

Human zzso vein zzso were subjected to zzso flow for 30 zzso and zzso proteins were detected by the zzso switch zzso In principle, free zzso in proteins become blocked by zzso the zzso bond is reduced by zzso and then zzso labels zzso zzso that separately zzso with zzso or zzso were mixed and subjected to two-dimensional gel zzso for further zzso More than 100 zzso were detected in zzso and zzso zzso Among these, 12 major proteins of zzso function showed a significant increase in zzso following zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso and zzso which were localized in the zzso motif of each zzso were identified as zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of proteins in zzso can be detected by a reliable zzso switch zzso This zzso zzso of zzso proteins may be essential for the adaptation and zzso of zzso under flow zzso
