zzso cataract is a rare, distinct variety of zzso cataract that was reported in a large Danish family in zzso This cataract zzso is characterized by zzso bodies embedded in the lens in a zzso zzso and is inherited as an zzso dominant zzso We retrieved the family and performed linkage analysis to determine the disease locus and identify the zzso zzso 

The family zzso was identified in a National Register of zzso Eye Diseases and updated based on The Danish Civil Register zzso Genome wide linkage analysis and zzso using zzso marker systems were carried out to achieve a zzso score above zzso The zzso candidate gene was zzso and the zzso was identified and verified by restriction zzso zzso of zzso DNA from all individuals in family zzso and 60 healthy zzso 

zzso analysis resulted in a zzso score of zzso for marker zzso located close to the known cataract gene zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso was found by sequencing DNA from two affected zzso The zzso was present in all affected individuals and was neither found in unaffected family members nor in 60 healthy individuals by restriction zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso cataract zzso is caused by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso located in the signal zzso zzso Further studies are needed to unravel the mechanism leading to the formation of the zzso
