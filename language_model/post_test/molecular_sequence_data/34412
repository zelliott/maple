Heat shock zzso factor zzso is a zzso master regulator that zzso the protection of normal cells from zzso However, zzso also protects abnormal cells and is required for zzso Here, we generate an highly specific zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding to zzso In zzso animals, zzso reduces normal zzso levels and promotes zzso zzso mimicking the spectrum of zzso that occur when zzso activity is zzso The zzso zzso also effectively suppresses the abnormal growth zzso induced by zzso active forms of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso contributes toward the zzso development of animal traits by controlling the expression of molecular zzso under normal growth zzso Additionally, our study demonstrates the utility of the zzso zzso technology as a promising chemical genetic approach to investigate biological mechanisms, including cancer and for identifying effective drug targets in zzso
