A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso obtained from an zzso drain of a zzso plant in zzso The zzso stained zzso and was a zzso zzso rod capable of zzso with zzso zzso and nitrate as terminal electron zzso The major cellular fatty acids of the strain were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso Though the nearest zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed only 14 % zzso between these zzso a level that is clearly below the value recommended to zzso different zzso This, together with the zzso differences zzso of electron zzso zzso zzso suggests that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
