zzso zzso zzso zzso an essential reaction of converting zzso to zzso leading to formation of the DNA precursor zzso Unlike the preceding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso little is known about regulation of zzso after zzso cells exit from zzso and enter the cell zzso In this study, zzso of zzso zzso was isolated and zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso cells was shown to be regulated during zzso to zzso transit at both zzso and zzso activity zzso Its timing was distinctive from that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the regulation of zzso in response to serum growth factor stimulation was abolished in cells transformed by either zzso or Kirsten zzso and zzso expression became zzso zzso This finding is in zzso with previous results showing that transformed cells exhibit more relaxed control than normal cells in their initiation of DNA zzso
