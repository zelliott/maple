zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Despite its importance, little is known about its zzso pathways or mechanism of zzso due to it being zzso The recently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso and compared to those of other available zzso zzso showed that in zzso genes involved in zzso metabolism are limited to zzso of the zzso pathway, with zzso appearing to be the sole energy zzso The majority of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the de zzso synthesis of zzso were zzso as were cell division protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso containing putative surface expression zzso comprised zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso coverage respectively, the majority of which were present in a small number of zzso zzso Limited mass zzso and zzso data matched a number of characterized proteins and zzso zzso confirming their expression and zzso in zzso data have allowed further characterization of these important zzso including their limited zzso capabilities, which may contribute to their zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso and a potential mechanism for host immune system zzso have been zzso
