zzso are zzso zzso zzso from zzso in the plant zzso They represent zzso and long-term zzso reserves and have been associated with zzso stress tolerance in zzso zzso We report the isolation and characterization of a putative zzso zzso zzso gene from a zzso grass species, zzso zzso tolerant to drought and cold zzso zzso and functional analyses of this gene were performed by Southern and Northern zzso Sugar content, quality and zzso activity were studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The putative zzso gene had all the zzso motifs of zzso and showed zzso identity at the zzso acid level with other zzso from winter zzso zzso studies, and determination of sugar content and zzso activity were performed on five sections of the zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in leaf zzso where zzso activity and zzso content are zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso showed different patterns in the evaluated leaf sections during a 7 d time course experiment under chilling zzso The zzso pattern suggests that the zzso zzso zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso leaf sections even under control temperate conditions, in contrast to previous reports in other zzso zzso Low temperatures caused an increase in zzso expression and zzso zzso in leaf zzso This is the first study of the isolation and molecular characterization of a zzso in a native species from the zzso zzso zzso in zzso systems will confirm the zzso allowing future developments in generation of functional markers for assisted breeding or zzso zzso
