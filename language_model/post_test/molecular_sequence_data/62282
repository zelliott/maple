Cellular and zzso evidence suggests the presence of a novel class of zzso mobile plant molecules that are recognized by zzso against zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso In order to characterize the function of these zzso we have expressed the full-length zzso zzso and demonstrate that this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso at zzso zzso and thus affects cell zzso A similar response is also seen with a zzso that does not contain the signal zzso zzso as well as a short domain zzso that shows zzso to the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso has an important and systemic role in plant growth and zzso
