The zzso acid sequence of human zzso 17 zzso zzso (17 zzso zzso was found to be similar to that of the zzso protein of zzso zzso The computer-based comparison score is zzso zzso higher than that obtained with zzso comparisons of zzso sequences of these zzso The probability of getting such a score by chance is 6 zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso is also similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso We propose that the steroid recognition site on 17 zzso zzso evolved from an ancestral recognition site for zzso such as zzso and zzso
