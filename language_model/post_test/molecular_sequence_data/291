zzso zzso are lipids involved in several zzso processes in animal and plant zzso In brain, zzso are zzso of zzso zzso which zzso various signaling zzso In plant, zzso regulate seed zzso and root development, and they are involved in plant defense against pathogen zzso This signaling activity is started by an zzso called zzso zzso zzso This zzso the zzso of zzso to form zzso which is most likely zzso by zzso D zzso zzso to generate zzso This compound is further zzso by fatty zzso zzso The genes zzso the zzso involved in zzso metabolism are well characterized except for the zzso zzso zzso By zzso expression in zzso coli and zzso in plants, we characterized an zzso from zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the synthesis of lipids identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso The ability of free fatty acid and zzso to be used as zzso donor was compared in zzso with zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso In both cases, zzso was zzso only in the presence of zzso zzso promoter experiments revealed a strong expression in roots and young zzso of zzso Using yellow fluorescent protein fusion, we showed that the zzso zzso is located in the zzso of plant zzso
