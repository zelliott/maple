zzso of zzso proteins is important for many biological zzso such as protein sorting and cell zzso and also for zzso processes such as two-dimensional zzso We have used large-scale simulations to study the lateral organization and dynamics of zzso zzso containing multiple inserted zzso Using zzso molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied model zzso zzso zzso lipids and 16 identical copies of model zzso proteins of either zzso or zzso zzso Through variation of the zzso tail length and hence the degree of zzso zzso our simulations display levels of protein zzso ranging from negligible to zzso The nature and extent of zzso are shown to be influenced by membrane zzso and the shape or orientation of the zzso Interestingly, a model zzso protein zzso to form one-dimensional strings within the zzso plane, whereas a model zzso bundle forms two-dimensional zzso Overall, it is clear that the nature and extent of membrane protein zzso is dependent on several aspects of the proteins and zzso including zzso zzso protein class and shape, and membrane zzso
