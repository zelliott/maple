The zzso zzso fraction of latex from the rubber tree zzso zzso contains a limited number of major zzso These are, besides the zzso protein zzso its precursor and the zzso zzso of this zzso proteins with zzso activities: three zzso zzso which are zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity, and a zzso zzso zzso from three zzso clones differed in their contents of these zzso zzso The zzso components and zzso were isolated and several zzso and structural properties were zzso These zzso are basic proteins and cause zzso of the zzso charged rubber zzso The zzso occurs in a rather narrow range of ratios of added protein to rubber zzso which indicates that zzso zzso is the determining zzso zzso in zzso of rubber particles by zzso zzso from various rubber clones can be explained by their content of zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso fraction may zzso callus tissue and this may explain the observation that zzso clones with a high zzso content in this fraction produce more latex than clones with little zzso zzso studies of two zzso peptides of the zzso indicate that this protein is zzso with zzso from other plants, and that a zzso zzso possibly involved in zzso zzso may have been zzso zzso
