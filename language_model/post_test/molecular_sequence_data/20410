The gene locus for zzso zzso zzso involved in the primary metabolism was identified from the zzso library of zzso zzso which produces a zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso cloned gene was comprised of 5 zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to confirm the zzso characteristics of zzso the gene was zzso in zzso coli cells, and the zzso protein was zzso through zzso affinity zzso Because most of the expressed zzso was zzso by host zzso coli zzso in the presence of zzso the zzso zzso was zzso after gene induction without zzso followed by exclusion of zzso using zzso zzso The separated zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso This result supports that this gene cluster of zzso zzso encodes the functional zzso zzso zzso to be zzso
