To examine the zzso as well as zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have generated several transgenic mouse lines expressing a human zzso zzso which extends zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso start and zzso within zzso zzso This construct zzso was expressed in a zzso pattern identical to the zzso mouse zzso zzso The zzso initiation sites of the transgenic construct were similar to the zzso gene expressed in human zzso To investigate the zzso regulation of zzso the transgenic animals were made zzso by zzso zzso zzso In these animals, zzso diabetes resulted in a parallel decrease in zzso mouse zzso zzso and the transgenic human zzso zzso in white zzso zzso brown zzso zzso and cardiac zzso Similarly, insulin treatment of the zzso animals restored both the zzso mouse and transgenic human zzso zzso zzso To further define zzso regions responsible for this zzso regulation, the same analysis was performed on transgenic animals which carry zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso region fused to a zzso reporter gene zzso This reporter construct responded similarly to the human zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso controlling zzso regulation and tissue specificity all reside exclusively within zzso zzso of the zzso initiation zzso
