A zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso activity was isolated from zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso column zzso This zzso was shown to be homogeneous as demonstrated by a single band on zzso gel zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso sequence zzso The molecular weight was determined to be zzso Da with an zzso point of zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso activity demonstrated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bonds of oxidized insulin B zzso This zzso did not convert zzso to zzso yet it did zzso the A zzso B zzso and gamma chains of zzso The zzso was shown to cleave a zzso analog with the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of the preparation was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso acid or zzso acid are involved in this zzso This protein was stable to heat and over the pH range of zzso
