For the efficient degradation and zzso of cellulosic zzso it is important to efficiently disrupt and convert zzso regions of cellulose into easily zzso regions than to simply zzso zzso zzso proteins such as zzso have disruptive functions on zzso including zzso zzso via zzso zzso In this work, we produced the zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein was then zzso into the zzso form with simultaneous zzso via a novel zzso zzso We devised a novel, simple, and efficient method to zzso determine the zzso disruptive activity of zzso on zzso zzso This method is based on the zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The change from zzso regions into easily zzso forms, due to zzso zzso might be slight and not easily be zzso However, disrupted regions of cellulose could be zzso by zzso and reducing zzso were formed by the zzso The disruptive function of the zzso was zzso characterized by measuring the release of reducing zzso These methods and processes will be useful for further research on zzso disruptive zzso and provide novel approaches for the efficient and economical zzso of cellulosic zzso
