Ion channels may be formed by zzso of zzso zzso aligned parallel to one another and spanning a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso faces of the zzso lining a central zzso In order to provide insight into the packing of such zzso in zzso a method has been developed to evaluate zzso surface maps of zzso zzso and to display these surfaces in a readily zzso zzso The procedure is based upon empirical energy calculations of interactions of a water zzso with an zzso zzso The method has been applied to three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso emphasis is placed upon the effects of zzso zzso flexibility on zzso surface zzso A family of models of the zzso zzso is generated by a simulated zzso zzso The results of zzso surface map analyses provide more exact definition of the zzso of the zzso face of zzso zzso and of the variation of the position of the zzso in response to changes in zzso zzso This information is used to define families of preliminary models for a given zzso channel, as is illustrated for zzso
