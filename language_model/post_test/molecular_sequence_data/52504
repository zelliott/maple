zzso of zzso zzso has been frequently observed during large-scale protein zzso An enhanced zzso of SK to degradation has been correlated with its existence in a partially unfolded zzso The influence of the zzso zzso on the stability and functional characteristics of SK has been examined by obtaining the zzso of SK following its zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the protein product was achieved by replacing the native zzso signal zzso of SK with those from zzso leader zzso and expressing the fusion construct under the control of the zzso alcohol zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso after its integration into the host zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis of proteins zzso from the zzso zzso zzso indicated that SK was zzso by the host cells, which resulted in the appearance of a SK species zzso slowly, corresponding to a zzso protein product as compared to the zzso native zzso The zzso SK retained a zzso zzso capability identical to that of its zzso zzso zzso SK exhibited an enhanced stability profile at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C and improved resistance towards zzso treatment compared to zzso SK zzso through zzso zzso after zzso treatment or that zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The results presented thus illustrate that zzso zzso of SK results in zzso enhancement of the protein stability and resistance towards degradation but does not interfere with its zzso zzso
