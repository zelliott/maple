zzso short zzso zzso zzso and zzso are components of the elastic zzso system and are implicated in the formation and zzso of elastic zzso In this study, we report new structural and functional properties of the short zzso zzso human short zzso were zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and zzso by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso All three zzso showed various levels of degradation after the zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that all three zzso are highly susceptible to zzso within the zzso zzso region of the first zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso correlated with its zzso Exposure of these zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in similar zzso fragments with zzso and zzso being the most potent zzso zzso zzso was almost completely inhibited in cell culture by the addition of 25 zzso zzso (a broad spectrum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were consistently observed by zzso Western zzso and mass zzso Atomic force zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso preparations with sizes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All short zzso strongly zzso to human zzso and smooth muscle zzso Although only zzso has an zzso zzso binding site, all short zzso adhere at a similar level to the respective zzso Solid phase binding zzso detected strong zzso binding of the short zzso to immobilized zzso suggesting that these zzso may bind cell zzso zzso zzso
