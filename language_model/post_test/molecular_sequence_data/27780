We examined the contribution of a cryptic zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso by strain zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso in zzso was found to zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso promoter region as a zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso showed a zzso region displaying high zzso with the DNA upstream of the zzso start points of the zzso and zzso symbiotic zzso zzso zzso promoter consensus sequences were zzso in this DNA zzso zzso of DNA downstream of the zzso zzso zzso monitored by zzso activity of different zzso zzso was demonstrated to depend on a functional zzso zzso both in zzso zzso cells and in zzso Individual zzso zzso insertions in this DNA region caused a reduced zzso zzso This new symbiotic region, occupying approximately 5 zzso of zzso DNA, was called zzso zzso formation zzso
