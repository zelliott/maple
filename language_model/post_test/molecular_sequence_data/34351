The zzso membrane protein zzso is a zzso iron zzso in zzso The protein contains a zzso zzso domain that is essential in regulating the import of iron and zzso zzso to many zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is not well zzso In particular, it is not yet known how the pivotal step in zzso zzso is zzso alignment of a zzso water zzso In the current study, the crystal structure of the soluble zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a novel mode of water alignment involving contacts with the protein backbone zzso In parallel to the structural studies, a series of seven zzso proteins were constructed that targeted zzso zzso at the active site of zzso and the zzso binding and zzso properties of these were measured and compared to the zzso zzso The results show that zzso in zzso abolish zzso activity of the zzso while other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not required for water alignment by zzso Together with the crystal structure, the findings suggest a new mechanism for zzso initiation in small zzso in which the attacking water zzso is aligned by contacts with the protein backbone zzso
