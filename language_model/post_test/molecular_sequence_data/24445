zzso zzso comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We identified three zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso and investigated the functional consequences of these zzso These zzso inhibited zzso binding and also zzso zzso activity, suggesting interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso In fact, the zzso were found to physically associate, and zzso of the zzso domain enhanced activity of the isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso which alters zzso domain structure, disrupted zzso zzso even though the zzso activity of zzso is zzso for zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso domain appears to have two critical zzso zzso interaction and maintenance of zzso zzso
