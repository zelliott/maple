zzso zzso activated receptors are zzso activated zzso factors belonging to the nuclear hormone zzso zzso Three zzso zzso such receptors have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the gene coding for zzso beta has been zzso thus being the first member of this zzso whose zzso organization has been zzso zzso zzso alpha as well as its mouse and rat zzso are thought to play an important role in zzso metabolism due to their ability to activate zzso of a reporter gene through the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the rate limiting step in the zzso zzso of fatty zzso zzso is achieved by the binding of zzso alpha on a regulatory element zzso found in the promoter region of this zzso zzso beta and gamma are also able to recognize the same type of element and are, as zzso zzso able to form zzso with zzso X zzso All three zzso appear to be activated by synthetic zzso zzso as well as by naturally occurring fatty zzso suggesting that a common mode of action exists for all the members of this zzso of nuclear hormone zzso
