Human zzso zzso have been shown to be the major zzso agent for mild respiratory infections, but also associated with more serious diseases, such as acute zzso media and pneumonia in children, and zzso Despite the economical and medical importance of zzso little is known about the circulation and genetic diversity of zzso during a given zzso The aim of this study was to genetically characterize zzso strains causing acute respiratory infections in a cohort of small children during a 2 years follow-up zzso zzso relationships between 61 zzso field zzso were studied using partial zzso sequencing in the zzso region zzso zzso and zzso analysis of these zzso zzso from the clinical zzso clustered in the two previously known zzso zzso the designated genetic group 2 (including zzso zzso being more zzso The maximum genetic variation within group 1 was zzso and within group 2 it was zzso Several distinct clusters could be observed, some of which were strictly seasonal, whereas some other zzso were detected during several zzso The results of this study show striking genetic diversity of the zzso strains circulating in a given community during a short zzso
