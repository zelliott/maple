zzso structural proteins belonging to the zzso family are components of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Here we report that zzso is critical for zzso assembly and the formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso egg zzso zzso of zzso disrupted zzso zzso and zzso the zzso pole protein zzso zzso assembly was completely rescued by supplementation with a zzso zzso zzso We identified two zzso zzso critical for its function in zzso zzso and organization utilizing dominant negative zzso The zzso zzso binding domain or zzso binding zzso domain peptides caused zzso zzso zzso Control peptides with low zzso or zzso zzso binding domain peptides that were incapable of binding zzso had no deleterious zzso zzso the addition of zzso domain peptides with reduced zzso binding caused severe zzso zzso in zzso dramatically zzso zzso and zzso assembly and also zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso peptides did not directly inhibit or destabilize zzso zzso from pure zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Our data showing that zzso is a crucial factor for assembly and maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso is involved in regulating both zzso dynamics and zzso These investigations underscore an important functional context for protein zzso in zzso zzso and highlight a previously unappreciated role for zzso in cell zzso
