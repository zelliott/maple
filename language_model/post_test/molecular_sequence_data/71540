The zzso sequence of the upstream region of the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of two open reading frames in the orientation opposite to that of the zzso zzso zzso The upstream open reading frame termed zzso encodes a protein composed of 375 zzso acid zzso possessing zzso acid sequence motifs for zzso Another open reading frame designated as zzso encodes a protein of 423 zzso acid zzso which shows significant identity in zzso acid sequence to the principal zzso factor, a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The close proximity of the open reading frames suggested that the two genes are transcribed in a zzso zzso By the use of an zzso coli expression system, zzso was produced in a soluble zzso An in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the core zzso zzso of zzso coli showed that zzso zzso functioned as a zzso factor to initiate specific zzso
