The ability of zzso zzso to adhere to zzso and to induce zzso of zzso is considered to be a critical factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To identify and characterize further bacterial factors involved in the zzso zzso interaction, we generated a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso DNA by use of the improved zzso zzso zzso The library was zzso against zzso immobilized zzso 

zzso isolated clones contained overlapping DNA fragments zzso a portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso In a flow zzso adherence zzso zzso zzso that zzso expressed either zzso or zzso which zzso zzso and zzso respectively, showed increased adherence to zzso zzso zzso zzso was promoted by the addition of zzso or zzso zzso which most likely act as bridging zzso Interestingly, promotion of adherence zzso by zzso was in the same range with zzso zzso producing either zzso or zzso whereas promotion of adherence zzso by zzso was significantly more pronounced with zzso zzso that produce zzso than with zzso zzso that produce zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso when present on zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate a substantial functional difference between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
