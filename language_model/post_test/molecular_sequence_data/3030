The goldfish zzso nerve can zzso after zzso To understand the molecular mechanism of zzso nerve zzso we identified genes whose expression is specifically zzso during the early stage of zzso nerve zzso A zzso library constructed from goldfish zzso 5 days after zzso was screened by differential zzso with zzso zzso derived from zzso or normal zzso Of six zzso clones isolated, one clone was identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso sequence zzso In northern zzso the expression level of the zzso was significantly increased at 2 days and peaked at zzso days, and then gradually decreased and returned to control level by 45 days after zzso nerve zzso Both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso have revealed the location of this transient retinal change after zzso nerve zzso The increased expression was observed only in the zzso cell layer and zzso nerve fiber layer at zzso days after zzso nerve zzso In an zzso culture system, zzso outgrowth from the zzso 7 days after zzso nerve zzso was spontaneously zzso A low concentration of zzso zzso zzso ) completely blocked the spontaneous zzso outgrowth from the zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regrowth of zzso cell zzso after zzso
