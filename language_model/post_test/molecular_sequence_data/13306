We have determined the complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso segment from zzso X carried by the zzso zzso The sequence encodes five complete open reading frames zzso none of which zzso to previously described zzso however, four of these zzso display interesting similarities with sequences present in the zzso The sequence also contains a tandem zzso of a zzso zzso An investigation of the zzso zzso in other strains has revealed that the original zzso occurred within an zzso Finally, the structure of the zzso repeat suggests a mechanism by which it may have been zzso
