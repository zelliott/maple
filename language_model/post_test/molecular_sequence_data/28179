zzso cells zzso two forms of the zzso to zzso heat shock protein that are zzso by distinct gene zzso In zzso cells, both proteins zzso alpha and zzso zzso are abundant under normal growth conditions and are zzso at increased rates in response to heat zzso Only the larger form, zzso zzso is induced by the zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso Simon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weber, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nevins, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a human zzso alpha gene that shows complete sequence identity with zzso and zzso zzso used as a zzso zzso The zzso region contained overlapping and zzso consensus heat shock control elements that can zzso zzso expression on a zzso reporter zzso The gene contained 10 intervening zzso The first zzso was located adjacent to the translation start zzso an arrangement also found in the zzso zzso zzso The spliced zzso sequence contained a single open reading frame zzso an zzso zzso showing high zzso with the zzso to zzso proteins of other zzso The deduced zzso alpha protein sequence differed from the human zzso beta sequence reported elsewhere zzso zzso zzso zzso Ware, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Stafford zzso zzso 1987) in at least 99 out of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso alpha gene was induced by serum during normal cell growth, but expression did not appear to be restricted to a particular stage of the cell zzso zzso alpha zzso was considerably more stable than the zzso zzso zzso which can account for the higher zzso rate of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso
