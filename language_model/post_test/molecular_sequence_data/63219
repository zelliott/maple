The zzso of influenza virus is a zzso zzso One zzso of zzso is the zzso zzso protein that functions in several ways to defeat the cellular innate immune zzso Recent large-scale zzso sequence analysis of avian influenza virus zzso indicated that four zzso zzso of the zzso protein is a zzso zzso domain of the zzso type and it was speculated that it may represent a zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, by using mice as a model system, the four zzso zzso acid zzso of a number of influenza virus strains were engineered into the zzso virus zzso protein by reverse zzso and the zzso of the viruses zzso zzso containing zzso sequences from the 1918 zzso and H5N1 highly zzso avian influenza zzso viruses demonstrated increased zzso in infected mice compared with zzso zzso virus, as characterized by rapid loss of body weight, decreased survival time, and decreased mean lethal zzso zzso analysis of infected mouse lung zzso demonstrated severe zzso zzso and spread of the virus throughout the entire zzso The increase in zzso was not caused by the overproduction of zzso suggesting the zzso protein C zzso may interact with zzso zzso and zzso zzso through alternative zzso
