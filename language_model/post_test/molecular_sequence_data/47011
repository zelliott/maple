Many genes whose expression is restricted to zzso in the brain contain a zzso element zzso that limits zzso in zzso cells by binding the zzso factor zzso (also named zzso or zzso Although two independent zzso of zzso are known to zzso repression, the mechanisms of zzso repression by zzso remain zzso We provide multiple lines of evidence that the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and type II zzso genes by recruiting the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the promoter region in zzso zzso These results identify a general mechanism for controlling the zzso expression pattern of a specific set of genes via the zzso zzso zzso
