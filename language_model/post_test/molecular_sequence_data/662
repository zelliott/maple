zzso zzso zzso zzso affected with zzso zzso were sampled from a river zzso in Tokyo Bay, zzso We amplified the gene for small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso with zzso using universal zzso The gene that we obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso sequence identity to that of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso With in zzso zzso the zzso specific for the gene that we obtained zzso with the zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso whereas zzso for the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso These findings indicate that, although the zzso found in the zzso are closely related to the zzso found in flounder, the two are clearly distinct zzso
