zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions is initiated by the zzso of its terminal alcohol group by alcohol zzso A DNA fragment, containing an alcohol zzso gene zzso was isolated using a combination of zzso zzso and inverse zzso The predicted translation product of zzso showed significant sequence similarity to bacterial alcohol zzso Furthermore, a zzso motif and signature patterns zzso in type III zzso alcohol zzso were zzso Two open reading frames zzso were found upstream of zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso of zzso and located on the opposite strand was an zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso showed that zzso is zzso with the putative zzso zzso and zzso genes during growth on zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli exhibited activity not only toward various zzso including zzso but also toward primary zzso and aromatic zzso
