zzso a key regulator of cellular zzso differentiation and zzso exerts its biological functions by zzso or suppressing the zzso of specific sets of target zzso zzso zzso factors play important roles during differentiation of various cell types and have been identified as critical targets for zzso and zzso suppression of zzso and fat cell zzso Here, we have addressed the mechanism by which zzso suppresses the activity of zzso We show that zzso is recruited to the zzso domain of zzso and interferes with the cooperation of zzso and the zzso zzso by preventing zzso zzso of zzso We have identified the protein zzso responsible for zzso zzso of zzso as zzso interacting protein zzso 2 zzso and show that zzso zzso the zzso from the zzso zzso Overall, our findings that the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso as a new mechanism of zzso suppression by zzso
