Following administration of certain chemicals zzso metals or zzso zzso zzso mice produce zzso reacting with various nuclear zzso such as zzso in the zzso and zzso in zzso In the present study, we have zzso zzso zzso mice and their zzso counterparts zzso zzso mice with bovine zzso zzso in zzso zzso As was previously observed with zzso mice, such active zzso did not elicit antinuclear zzso in any of the experimental zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso with zzso in zzso developed high zzso of zzso zzso that reacted exclusively with synthetic zzso We obtained several zzso zzso zzso from these mice and verified that these zzso zzso were not directed against a specific nuclear zzso The genetic analysis of the zzso zzso further confirmed their zzso zzso The mechanisms leading to the appearance of zzso zzso with highly basic molecules in zzso mice may be related to their predisposition to produce zzso to zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso
