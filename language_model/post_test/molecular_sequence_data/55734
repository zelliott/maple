The only known component of the infectious prion is a zzso modified protein known as the zzso zzso of the prion zzso zzso Upon limited zzso a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso is zzso Using in zzso zzso we examined the role of the N and C zzso in the formation of zzso in persistently zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso Neither deletion of zzso acids zzso which are also removed by zzso K in the formation of zzso zzso nor deletion of the five zzso repeats within this region altered synthesis of zzso zzso of zzso with one, two, four, or six zzso repeats in addition to the five found in zzso zzso did not alter the synthesis of zzso zzso of the C zzso was accomplished by substituting a translation stop zzso for the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso signal corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells produced zzso that appeared to lack a zzso zzso We conclude that neither the zzso anchor nor the zzso 66 zzso acids are required for the synthesis of zzso as measured by the acquisition of limited resistance to zzso K zzso Whether these truncated or zzso zzso molecules are competent to participate in the formation of infectious zzso remains to be zzso
