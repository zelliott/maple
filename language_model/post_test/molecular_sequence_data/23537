zzso zzso zzso catalyze the formation of zzso in zzso and have an essential role in collagen zzso The zzso zzso are zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso contain separate zzso and zzso zzso We report on the crystal structure of the zzso domain of the human type I zzso refined at zzso A zzso It was found to belong to a family of zzso repeat zzso that are involved in many zzso interactions and consist of five zzso forming two zzso repeat motifs plus the zzso zzso A prominent feature of its zzso surface is a deep groove lined by zzso a putative binding site for zzso zzso zzso side chains of three of the zzso have a repeat distance similar to that of a zzso type II zzso The aromatic surface ends at one of the zzso where the groove zzso almost 90 degrees away from the linear arrangement of the three zzso side zzso possibly inducing a bent zzso in the bound zzso This finding is consistent with previous suggestions by others that a minimal structural requirement for zzso zzso may be a sequence in the zzso type II zzso followed by a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that none of the zzso was critical for zzso zzso whereas most of them were critical for the binding of a zzso zzso and inhibitor both to the domain and the zzso zzso zzso
