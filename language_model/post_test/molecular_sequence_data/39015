zzso zzso require limited zzso processing to generate peptides for binding to class II zzso zzso but the zzso and processing sites involved are largely zzso Here we analyze the effect of eliminating the three major zzso zzso zzso sites in the microbial zzso zzso toxin C zzso The zzso zzso is highly resistant to zzso by zzso and crude zzso extracts and is dramatically impaired in its ability to be processed and presented to T zzso zzso processing at a single zzso zzso zzso is obligatory for optimal presentation of many T cell zzso in this zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso at a single processing site can be crucial for effective zzso zzso
