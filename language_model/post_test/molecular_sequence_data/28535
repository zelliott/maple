We describe the finding of an zzso repeat zzso within the first zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and their associations with the highly zzso zzso locus were determined for 51 human cell lines and for 109 and 200 Caucasians and northeastern zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso relationships revealed that zzso occurred at relatively low gene frequency zzso zzso but was strongly associated with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso locus provides a useful zzso marker for investigations on the level of linkage zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
