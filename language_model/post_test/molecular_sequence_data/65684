We have developed a general method for zzso quantitative zzso using differential zzso stable isotope labeling and mass zzso The method was successfully used to study the dynamics of zzso response in zzso zzso A number of known zzso proteins were confirmed, and some proteins not previously associated with heat shock were zzso The method is zzso in stable isotope labeling and allows for high degrees of zzso
