zzso toxin from zzso zzso is a zzso toxin consisting of lethal factor zzso zzso factor zzso and protective zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso components of the zzso whereas PA is the zzso zzso To identify zzso of PA that are involved in interaction with the cellular zzso two zzso zzso of domain 4 of PA zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were zzso and the altered proteins zzso and tested for toxicity in the presence of zzso In addition to the intended zzso novel zzso were introduced by errors that occurred during zzso zzso within the large loop zzso zzso to zzso had no effect on PA zzso A zzso zzso zzso with three zzso in the small loop zzso zzso to zzso bound zzso to the zzso and was zzso A zzso zzso zzso with changes in three separate regions did not bind to zzso and was zzso zzso was greatly decreased by zzso of the zzso 3 to 5 zzso but not by their substitution with zzso zzso or the extension of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the 28 zzso proteins described here showed that the large loop zzso zzso to zzso is not involved in zzso zzso whereas zzso in and near the small loop zzso zzso to zzso play an important role in zzso zzso Other regions of domain 4, in particular zzso at the extreme C zzso appear to play a role in stabilizing a zzso needed for zzso zzso
