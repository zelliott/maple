To investigate the zzso in protein zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso gene in patients with Noonan syndrome zzso 

Three sporadic patients with zzso were zzso zzso zzso were extracted from peripheral blood zzso All 15 coding zzso and their zzso zzso boundaries of the zzso gene were amplified by zzso chain reaction and followed by direct zzso zzso from parents were zzso in the corresponding region when the zzso was detected in their affected zzso The identified zzso was screened in 100 healthy individuals for exclusion of zzso by restriction zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso conservation analysis was performed among 10 species using an online zzso zzso 

zzso DNA sequence analysis identified a zzso zzso to A change in zzso 3 of the zzso gene in one patient, which resulted in the substitution of an zzso acid zzso by an zzso at zzso zzso The zzso was absent in his parents and 100 controls, and is located in a highly zzso zzso acid zzso No zzso in the coding region of zzso gene was observed in the other two zzso 

The zzso zzso was reported previously in Caucasians and is a zzso zzso in this zzso Our study further confirmed that the zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso and consistent with the clinical zzso Additional genes may be involved in the other two patients with zzso indicating high genetic zzso of this zzso
