zzso proteins comprise a large family of zzso proteins with a wide spectrum of activities in both zzso and zzso regulation of gene zzso Earlier, we have reported on the involvement of zzso in zzso regulation of zzso zzso virus long terminal repeats and the involvement of zzso in zzso regulation of zzso collagen zzso Here, we have investigated the potential role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We report that zzso and zzso are localized predominantly in the zzso and that they both can bind zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso domain and the alternating clusters of zzso and basic zzso acids located in the zzso ends of these two proteins were all found to be necessary for their zzso zzso Further, we demonstrate that these two proteins inhibit translation in zzso and that binding to zzso is required for this zzso The significance of these results is zzso
