A growing body of evidence suggests that the zzso molecular system is involved in the zzso and therapeutic mechanisms underlying bipolar zzso zzso a representative mood zzso has been reported to induce the Period 2 zzso zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanisms require further zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso expression at the zzso level in zzso differentiated zzso human zzso zzso zzso reporter analyses using serial deletions of the zzso promoter revealed that two early growth response 1 zzso sites zzso between positions zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced zzso zzso promoter activity, while a point zzso in zzso abolished zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso bound directly to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso by zzso was functionally linked to zzso expression through zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was strongly attenuated by depletion of zzso by zzso zzso also zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in mouse frontal zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was attenuated in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulates zzso zzso through the zzso zzso in zzso cells, indicating a connection between the zzso zzso and a zzso gene system in the mechanism of action of zzso
