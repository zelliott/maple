zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso protein zzso composed of two zzso zzso alpha and/or zzso and two regulatory zzso zzso In order to define similarities and zzso between the alpha and zzso zzso zzso which might account for their particular cellular functions, different forms of the zzso were expressed in zzso cells and their properties zzso Both zzso zzso were expressed zzso and also along with the regulatory beta zzso in order to obtain free alpha and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso Our results confirm that the beta zzso acts to stabilize the alpha and zzso zzso and also influences the zzso specificity and kinetic properties of the zzso Although significant differences between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as determined using a number of zzso were not zzso zzso studies on zzso and zzso revealed significant differences in this zzso The regulatory zzso beta was zzso less rapidly by the zzso zzso than by the alpha zzso and the extent of zzso of beta by alpha was also greater than that of beta by zzso It was also noted that the zzso and the extent of its zzso by zzso were greater for zzso than for zzso These different properties may relate to distinct functions of the two form of zzso
