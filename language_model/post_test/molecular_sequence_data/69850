We have developed a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for the quantitative measurement of levels of zzso zzso in total zzso preparations from skin zzso This method zzso the zzso detection of low abundance zzso zzso in the range of zzso copies per zzso The procedure is based on a competitive zzso zzso where a zzso zzso internal zzso standard is zzso and zzso together with the sample zzso target zzso In addition, zzso of several zzso of zzso zzso followed by DNA sequence analysis of zzso zzso products, revealed a previously unknown pattern of alternate zzso usage at the 3' end of the zzso gene in human skin zzso
