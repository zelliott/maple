The zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains several biologically active peptides and two zzso one of which is a zzso By using zzso zzso derived from the zzso sequence of this zzso reported by others, clones zzso the precursor for this zzso could be isolated from a zzso library prepared from zzso zzso of worker zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed that bee zzso zzso is a zzso composed of zzso zzso acids containing four zzso and three potential sites for zzso The sequence of the precursor also indicated that the conversion of the zzso to the end product must involve zzso of a zzso bond, a most unusual processing zzso The zzso zzso zzso could also be detected in zzso from zzso zzso of the cloned zzso in zzso coli yielded a zzso zzso that had zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso from bee zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso to zzso a membrane protein of guinea pig zzso involved in zzso zzso These structural data support the long-held view that zzso play a role in zzso
