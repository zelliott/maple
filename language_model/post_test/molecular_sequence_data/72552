zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso which replicates via a zzso intermediate by the rolling circle replication zzso zzso We identified an zzso zzso origin zzso of zzso zzso where the initiation of zzso synthesis takes place, located between the zzso and zzso genes in a zzso region which is functional in its natural zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is similar over 170 zzso to the zzso of the zzso plasmids zzso and zzso A previous report described that a zzso zzso zzso has an zzso activity zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To our surprise, we discovered that on zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso is in the wrong, zzso orientation and thus cannot be involved in the conversion of the zzso zzso replication intermediate to the zzso form of the zzso We revealed that this zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso Secondary structure analysis of these two zzso showed similarity to the consensus zzso which is zzso in zzso of zzso plasmids from zzso and the other several zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences caused loss of zzso zzso Our result shows that two types of zzso zzso type and zzso type, can function in zzso zzso
