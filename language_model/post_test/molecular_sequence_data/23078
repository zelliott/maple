Two zzso zzso constitute a branch point in zzso zzso zzso Products of zzso metabolism are the zzso zzso zzso cocaine, and zzso zzso zzso the zzso Both zzso zzso reduce the precursor zzso to yield either zzso or zzso In zzso zzso is incorporated into zzso and zzso zzso is the first specific zzso on the way to the zzso zzso cloning and zzso expression of both zzso zzso enabled kinetic zzso protein zzso and structure zzso zzso of reduction is achieved by binding zzso in the respective zzso active zzso in opposite zzso zzso of both zzso proteins in cultured roots revealed a zzso protein zzso zzso flux through both arms of the zzso zzso zzso appears to be regulated by the activity of both zzso and by their access to the precursor zzso Both zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid sequence similarity of more than 50% suggesting their descent from a common zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso in plant zzso other that zzso await functional zzso
