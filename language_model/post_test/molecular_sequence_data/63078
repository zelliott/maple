zzso I zzso I) is a zzso protein on synaptic zzso and presumably functions as a zzso sensor for neurotransmitter zzso Native zzso I protein in neuroendocrine zzso cells zzso several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and fatty zzso and the latter two modifications have been shown to be required for the proper function of zzso zzso I in zzso zzso However, nothing is known about the zzso significance of the zzso of zzso I in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we created an zzso zzso (named zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso I (named zzso and investigated their zzso distribution in zzso zzso zzso cells, where other zzso zzso zzso IV and zzso and other membrane trafficking proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are normally zzso We found that some cells expressing high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso I protein show zzso of zzso zzso protein to the plasma zzso whereas most of the cells show normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso was also observed in cells expressing high levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane was much more evident than with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso not zzso is partially involved in efficient targeting of zzso I protein to zzso zzso in zzso zzso
