The zzso zzso zzso family is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid zzso We isolated the zzso region of the type A human zzso zzso gene and identified an zzso zzso in this zzso We then assessed whether there is a genetic association between this zzso and essential hypertension zzso The deletion zzso lacks 8 zzso and alters binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We zzso 200 zzso and 200 zzso zzso individuals and found 9 subjects with the deletion (8 in the zzso group and 1 in the zzso zzso All 9 individuals were zzso The zzso subject with the zzso had left zzso zzso without zzso zzso activity of the deletion zzso was zzso that of the zzso zzso The plasma levels of brain zzso in zzso patients with the deleted zzso were significantly higher than the levels in the zzso patients with the zzso zzso and plasma brain zzso levels were significantly higher in subjects with the deleted zzso than in subjects with the zzso zzso despite comparable blood zzso These findings suggest that in Japanese individuals, this deletion in the human zzso zzso gene reduces zzso activity and may zzso increased zzso to developing zzso or left zzso zzso
