In zzso the positioning of the internal zzso relative to the zzso is zzso and zzso zzso A number of molecules have been shown to play critical roles in zzso zzso Using zzso difference analysis to identify genes that are zzso expressed on the left and right sides of the chick zzso we cloned chick zzso an integral component of zzso tight zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso on the right side of the chick zzso between zzso stages 4 and 7 zzso the direction of heart zzso This effect was not observed when zzso was zzso on the left side of the zzso A small, but zzso induction of zzso expression in the zzso region on the right side of the zzso was noted in zzso that were injected with zzso zzso particles on their right zzso However, no changes in zzso or zzso expression were zzso In addition, zzso expression remained higher in the left zzso zzso folds of zzso with zzso zzso hearts resulting from zzso zzso on the right side of the zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso tail is essential for this effect: zzso of a zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso domain at zzso eliminates zzso ability to zzso the direction of heart zzso Taken together, our data provide evidence that appropriate expression of the tight junction protein zzso is required for normal heart looping and suggest that zzso of its zzso tail is responsible for zzso this zzso
