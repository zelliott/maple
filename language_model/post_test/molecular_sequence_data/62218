A newly identified iron regulator, zzso appears to communicate body iron status and demand for zzso to the zzso and in turn, zzso zzso iron zzso zzso was first zzso from human blood and urine as an zzso zzso and was found to be predominantly expressed in the zzso A lack of zzso expression has been associated with iron overload and zzso of zzso results in zzso anemia in zzso In addition, zzso levels decrease in mice fed a low iron diet and increase in mice fed a high iron zzso These observations support the role of zzso as a signal that limits zzso iron zzso zzso expression is also affected by zzso and inflammation and is decreased in zzso zzso Thus, the relationship between body iron status and zzso is altered in zzso zzso In addition, zzso is decreased in zzso knockout mice, which demonstrates characteristics of iron overload as in zzso zzso zzso zzso is suggested to act as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso factors, such as zzso are also suggested to be involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso However, much remains to be investigated in the regulation of zzso by iron, zzso and zzso
