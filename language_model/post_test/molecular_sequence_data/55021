Based on preliminary investigation of microbial populations in a high zzso oil zzso an indigenous microbial enhanced oil recovery zzso field trial was carried zzso The purpose of the study is to reveal the impact of the indigenous zzso process on microbial community structure in the oil zzso using zzso DNA clone library zzso The detailed monitoring results showed significant response of microbial communities during the field trial and large discrepancies of zzso zzso in the laboratory and in the natural oil zzso More specifically, after nutrients injection, the original dominant populations of zzso and zzso in the production zzso almost zzso The expected desirable population of zzso zzso determined by enrichment experiments in laboratory, was zzso successfully in two zzso of the five monitored zzso zzso another potential population of zzso zzso which were not detected in the enrichment culture in laboratory was zzso in the other three monitored production zzso In this study, monitoring of microbial community displayed a comprehensive zzso of microbial populations during the field trial to remedy the zzso of zzso monitoring zzso The results would help to develop and apply more zzso zzso
