We describe zzso and zzso studies of native and zzso zzso finger peptides from zzso a putative zzso factor zzso by the zzso region of the human Y zzso The parent zzso based on zzso domain 6, exhibits zzso zzso formation within a rigid zzso zzso zzso zzso of the consensus aromatic group zzso zzso or zzso are surprisingly compatible with native architecture but result in loss of stability to pH or zzso zzso zzso these zzso are reverted by a zzso zzso in which an alternative aromatic zzso is introduced zzso zzso Design of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on the zzso zzso zzso a zzso symmetry among the zzso zinc finger zzso and is in zzso with recent zzso zzso structures of zzso finger zzso These experiments suggest general rules for zzso folding of the zzso finger zzso
