Comparisons of zzso and zzso sequences of zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso has led to the identification of nine major zzso and many zzso This zzso is based on either complete zzso sequences or sequence data from the zzso zzso region, core, zzso zzso or zzso zzso The relative merit of different gene segments as zzso markers and the zzso of the resulting assignments is not clear at this zzso To resolve the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso we have compared the complete zzso and zzso sequences of 19 zzso zzso available in the databases as well as sequences of individual genes and gene products of these zzso Based on the correlation between sequence relationships and zzso assignments of other zzso zzso we show that the nine major zzso of zzso represent nine distinct virus species and their zzso zzso Our sequence comparison of the zzso zzso regions and the individual gene products suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (in that zzso are the most appropriate regions for the discrimination between species, subspecies and strains of zzso The zzso zzso core and zzso regions are less effective in distinguishing between species, subspecies and zzso Based on a comparison of the zzso sequence identities of zzso zzso and zzso as well as the recent information on the size and zzso of zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso and zzso should be classified into three separate families, named zzso zzso and zzso respectively rather than three zzso of the zzso as currently zzso We also propose zzso as the zzso name for zzso
