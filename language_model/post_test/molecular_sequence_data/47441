zzso zzso and zzso zzso are genetically very closely related but differ significantly in their zzso zzso Using zzso zzso Analysis zzso 11 DNA fragments specific for zzso zzso zzso I or zzso zzso zzso were zzso All zzso zzso zzso fragments also zzso with zzso DNA from zzso zzso but not from the zzso zzso strains zzso I and zzso underlining the close zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso type strain zzso is a special case, as it contains DNA sequences characteristic for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso As demonstrated by zzso gel zzso several of the zzso fragments are present on a single zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequences of putative coding regions, four of these fragments may code for proteins involved in zzso metabolism or zzso In agreement with this notion, a zzso for one of these zzso zzso a significantly altered zzso that lacks the zzso side zzso The analysis of the corresponding zzso region in various zzso species showed that this locus is present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso This confirms that the zzso approach has identified a novel zzso zzso zzso locus which accounts for the differences between the zzso structures elaborated by different zzso zzso
