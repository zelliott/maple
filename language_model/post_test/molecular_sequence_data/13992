The ability of several zzso zzso proteins to mediate electron transfer between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been evaluated in a coupled zzso zzso The active electron zzso whatever their structure, must have a reduction potential compatible with the two zzso but for proteins of similar zzso a marked specificity is displayed by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Such zzso are small proteins exchanging electrons with many zzso involved in the metabolism of zzso zzso The forces underlying the interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso have been examined with an emphasis on zzso zzso zzso experiments have been used to individually convert all zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso into either neutral or positively charged zzso zzso Also, up to four of these zzso have been replaced zzso The biological activities of the resulting zzso depend very little on the number and the distribution of the zzso side chains on the surface of the zzso Only those molecular forms for which the immediate environment of the clusters is zzso independently of the charge distribution, display variations in their zzso zzso It is concluded that electron transfer between zzso zzso zzso zzso and its partners is far less dependent on zzso interactions than in many other well-documented electron transfer zzso
