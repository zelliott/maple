zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a vaccination strategy against zzso We investigated the structural requirements for binding of naturally zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The data show that zzso zzso binding requires intact zzso structures and that the zzso are directed predominantly against zzso with a zzso zzso structure with three zzso and marginally against the terminal fourth zzso The results provide valuable insight for exploiting zzso for the development of malaria zzso
