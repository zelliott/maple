Mouse zzso zzso factor zzso zzso affect the development of four cell zzso zzso mast cells, zzso and pigmented zzso cells of the zzso The zzso are zzso diverse and can be arranged in an zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso cause zzso syndrome type 2A zzso and zzso syndrome, zzso dominant disorders resulting in deafness and zzso zzso mice thus represent an important model system for the study of human zzso Here we report the complete zzso structure of the mouse zzso gene and show it to be similar to the human zzso We also found that the mouse gene is zzso complex and is capable of generating at least 13 different zzso zzso Some of these zzso are missing important functional zzso of the zzso suggesting that they might play an zzso role in zzso function and signal zzso In addition, we determined the molecular basis for six zzso zzso Two of the zzso are reported for the first time here zzso and zzso while the others zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been described but the molecular basis for the zzso not zzso When analyzed in terms of the zzso and zzso data presented here, it is apparent that these zzso result from zzso processing or zzso zzso Interestingly, three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso produce proteins that are missing important functional zzso of the protein identified in in zzso studies, further confirming a biological role for these zzso in the whole zzso
