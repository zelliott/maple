The zzso parameters of the zzso zzso from human zzso leukemia zzso cells were accurately zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso radius of zzso zzso when analyzed by zzso zzso A zzso protein was detected by Western zzso analysis using a zzso zzso directed against the F domain of zzso zzso in the zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso of a crude nuclear extract from zzso cells, zzso with zzso acid, yielded zzso material with zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso to 6 zzso From the zzso data, a molecular mass of 52 zzso was calculated for the zzso zzso whereas no precise value could be deduced for the zzso zzso form, since it zzso rapidly into the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso form of zzso alpha bound specifically to DNA, whereas binding of the zzso zzso form was sharply zzso These findings suggest that the zzso inactive zzso form zzso upon zzso binding and acquires a zzso zzso zzso
