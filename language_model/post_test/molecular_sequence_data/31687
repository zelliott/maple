zzso in zzso transient zzso potential channel 6 zzso have been identified as responsible for the development of focal zzso zzso a zzso disease with steroid resistance and poor zzso This study explores the prevalence of zzso zzso in Chinese children with idiopathic zzso syndrome zzso the zzso correlation of zzso zzso the therapeutic response, and the underlying molecular zzso 

Fifty-one children with sporadic zzso were zzso 23 zzso cases and 28 zzso cases zzso chain reaction was used to amplify 13 zzso and the promoter sequences of zzso before zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso was illustrated by zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso in zzso promoter was measured by the zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 240 zzso zzso were zzso The zzso frequency of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso syndrome zzso patients zzso was higher than that in the zzso zzso syndrome subjects zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso enhanced zzso from zzso promoter in zzso and was associated with increased zzso expression in zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso a zzso underlying enhanced zzso zzso and zzso may be correlated with the development of steroid resistance in Chinese children with zzso
