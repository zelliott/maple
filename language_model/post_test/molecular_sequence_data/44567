zzso is a central component of the zzso complex zzso a protein assembly that plays a critical role in a variety of muscular zzso In order to better understand the function of zzso in development and disease, we have generated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice are viable and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso exhibit gross zzso abnormalities beginning around zzso days of zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso indicates that an early zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso is a disruption of zzso zzso an zzso basement zzso zzso with the functional defects observed in zzso zzso zzso protein is localized in zzso to this structure in normal egg cylinder stage zzso We also show that the zzso of two critical structural elements of zzso zzso and collagen zzso specifically disrupted in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the data indicate that zzso is required for the development of zzso zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that disruption of basement membrane organization might be a common feature of muscular zzso linked to the zzso
