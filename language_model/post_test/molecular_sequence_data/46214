The absence of the zzso zzso zzso in humans makes the zzso of this zzso in zzso bacteria such as zzso tuberculosis potential candidates for developing novel zzso zzso One of these zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso exists as a complex of two zzso the large zzso and the small zzso zzso The functional zzso complex zzso the zzso conversion reaction of zzso to zzso Three zzso truncated zzso of zzso have been analyzed by X-ray zzso to resolutions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two most flexible parts of the structure are the regions of zzso zzso the zzso discriminating loop, and of zzso zzso the zzso binding zzso The three determined structures were also compared with the structures of other bacterial zzso This comparison suggests the presence of two zzso zzso A model for the structure of the inactive zzso complex has been obtained from solution X-ray scattering zzso The crystal structure of zzso was shown to be compatible with the solution X-ray scattering data from the small zzso In contrast, the solution scattering results suggest that the large zzso zzso and the zzso complex have overall shapes, which are radically different from the ones observed in the zzso of the functional zzso zzso zzso
