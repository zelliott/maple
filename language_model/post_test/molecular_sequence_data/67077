zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso clock component and zzso regulator in zzso zzso The authors cloned a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and examined its spatial and zzso expression in comparison to a zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their expression patterns varied in different zzso The level of zzso transcript in the brain was constant under zzso zzso while those of zzso transcripts zzso with a decrease at zzso In zzso zzso showed presumably identical distribution of zzso zzso and per transcripts in the putative clock zzso of the head zzso as well as in the zzso where zzso zzso zzso were zzso suggesting a possible involvement of both zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected at 4 zzso zzso in each zzso zzso 6 to 8 cells in the zzso zzso about 6 cells in the zzso zzso 2 zzso in the frontal zzso and most of the zzso All these cells contained zzso zzso and per zzso zzso The Northern analysis of zzso zzso transcripts at different zzso stages showed that both genes were expressed at relatively high levels during early zzso and in the zzso The levels of zzso transcripts were also high in the late zzso stages until the zzso zzso and then suddenly disappeared before zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso activity of both genes was low in zzso zzso
