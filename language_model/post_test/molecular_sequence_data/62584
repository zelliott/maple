During the past 8 years, changes in the prevalence and spread of different epidemic zzso zzso zzso zzso have been observed in central Europe, with the emergence of new strains possessing fewer resistance zzso This has also been demonstrated at the level of particular zzso Since variation in zzso specificity type has been proposed as a possible reason for population dynamics in zzso zzso the zzso specificity groups of different epidemic zzso strains were investigated by zzso using zzso zzso zzso Four of the zzso as well as two zzso epidemic strains exhibited zzso specificity group zzso One group of epidemic zzso zzso which has been observed since the beginning of the 1990s, exhibited the zzso specificity group zzso zzso the variable part ( zzso of the zzso locus revealed only six relevant zzso changes within this region, with three of them zzso the zzso sequence region of zzso On the basis of the results zzso it is proposed that the dynamics observed in the population of zzso in Germany is not due to different zzso group zzso in zzso and zzso epidemic zzso
