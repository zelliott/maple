In this study, zzso in gene expression patterns have been examined in zzso avian bone zzso zzso Using a conditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso cells in an zzso manner, we constructed zzso zzso libraries from zzso bone zzso zzso Several different sequences were identified whose expression was altered upon hormone zzso of zzso These include two genes related to the zzso zzso family zzso and a zzso zzso a cell surface zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso The expression of each gene was zzso in a number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso zzso cells tested express high levels of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso while zzso zzso of zzso failed to do so, suggesting a role for these two genes in zzso zzso zzso Finally, these genes are expressed at high levels in cells zzso zzso and truncated forms of zzso zzso that zzso zzso in part, by induction of zzso target zzso
