zzso of zzso X zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso is part of a zzso response that includes liver zzso tumor promotion, effects on zzso zzso and energy zzso Here, we describe an acute response to zzso and zzso zzso that is associated with induction of zzso a protein with zzso zzso We first observed that zzso of zzso and zzso in mouse liver results in zzso of zzso along with reduced protein levels of the active form of zzso regulatory element binding protein 1 zzso Studies in mice deficient in zzso and zzso revealed that the effect on zzso involves these two nuclear zzso Finally, we identified a functional binding site for zzso and zzso in the zzso gene by in zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Our experiments suggest that zzso zzso by drugs leads to reduced levels of active zzso and consequently to reduced target gene expression including the genes responsible for zzso zzso The reduction nuclear zzso by drugs is not observed when zzso expression is zzso by small interfering zzso In addition, observed that zzso is also a target of zzso zzso the zzso activity of which is increased by zzso of zzso and zzso and is known to cause a reduction of zzso The fact that drugs that serve as zzso or zzso zzso induce zzso might have clinical consequences and explains zzso zzso levels after drug zzso
