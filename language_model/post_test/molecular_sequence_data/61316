zzso factor 1 zzso functions at early stages of zzso zzso and contributes to zzso site recognition by interacting with the essential zzso factor zzso and binding to the zzso branch zzso We have identified an 80 zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso isolated from rat brain, which is identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso which zzso the zzso interaction leading to a block of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to Ala or zzso also zzso the interaction with zzso indicating that zzso is essential for zzso zzso is zzso in zzso by zzso but not by zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso of zzso also occurs in cultured zzso cells and is increased on zzso in response to a zzso zzso These results suggest a new role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso by regulating in a zzso manner the association of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
