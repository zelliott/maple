zzso zzso strain zzso was found to acquire iron from zzso zzso and goat zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as evaluated by zzso binding zzso required the organisms to be grown under zzso conditions in the presence of zzso Competition binding zzso revealed the presence of two distinct zzso zzso systems, one specific for bovine zzso and the other capable of binding all three zzso zzso zzso isolation procedures using total zzso yielded three putative bovine zzso zzso and one putative zzso and goat zzso zzso zzso amplification followed by DNA sequence analyses revealed that zzso zzso strain zzso possesses genes that zzso a zzso zzso zzso along with a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso would appear to be subject to a form of phase variation involving zzso zzso tracts within the structural zzso
