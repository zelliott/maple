The ability to perform multiple gene deletions is an important tool for conducting functional zzso We report the development of a sequential gene deletion protocol for the zzso fungus zzso zzso using the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso A zzso genetic marker has been constructed by incorporating zzso direct repeats either side of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso which is able to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso This construct can be directed to delete specific zzso regions by attaching zzso sequences corresponding to the desired zzso The zzso marker can subsequently be eliminated by zzso zzso between the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso which has been placed under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promoter thus providing a means to switch on zzso zzso or off zzso zzso zzso zzso has been integrated into the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso strain defective in zzso zzso zzso activity zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deletion system by zzso deleting two zzso yellow zzso and white zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso zzso
