Heat shock proteins zzso are involved in the response by cells to stress including zzso zzso and zzso Previous work has demonstrated expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso in animal brain in response to stimuli such as zzso We have used in zzso zzso zzso to assess the distribution and quantity of a specific zzso (called zzso zzso in frontal zzso and zzso from normal and zzso patients whose zzso course had been zzso In cortex, zzso zzso was concentrated over pia mater and zzso but was also present over zzso in zzso zzso zzso was prominent over zzso cells but absent from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso factors such as zzso or zzso Increased zzso zzso was found in frontal zzso white matter in Alzheimer's disease and in a mixed group of other neurodegenerative zzso No changes occurred in zzso The data provide further evidence for altered zzso gene expression in zzso and support the existence of a stress response occurring in brains affected by such zzso
