DNA sequence analysis of a segment of 15 zzso situated between zzso and zzso and present in the mouse but absent in human, revealed about 11 zzso of DNA harboring a large number of repetitive sequences and 4 zzso harboring a novel zzso zzso This gene is transcribed in zzso zzso having a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso shows stretches of zzso zzso with zzso leukemia virus zzso envelope zzso and the predicted protein encompasses viral envelope zzso The finding of a gene resembling zzso envelope zzso flanked by a long terminal repeat and zzso and zzso zzso leads to the assumption that zzso and zzso in the mouse were separated through the zzso of a zzso an event that might have taken place even before zzso of rat and zzso The zzso zzso forms a part of a zzso region, between zzso and zzso where zzso zzso takes zzso Several disease zzso genes have been mapped to this same zzso The position of zzso in or in the vicinity of a zzso hot spot might not be zzso The presence of adjacent putative zzso regulatory sequences is suggestive for the location of the crossover sites of zzso in this zzso
