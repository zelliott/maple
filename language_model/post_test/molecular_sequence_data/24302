The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates development and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling leads to changes in downstream targets via the zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor which is regulated by zzso and results in extended zzso Here, we describe the first identification of genes whose expression is controlled by the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso adults compared to zzso adults, whereas zzso zzso and zzso are zzso The latter genes are zzso regulated by zzso signaling and positively regulated by zzso Positive regulation by zzso on zzso zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso whereas zzso mediates only part of zzso signaling for zzso and zzso zzso by zzso is most likely zzso independent for zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso showed elevated expression in zzso adults, as well as being strongly expressed in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso transcript levels are low in zzso zzso adults though they are enriched in zzso larvae, indicating overlapping but not identical mechanisms of efficient life maintenance in zzso zzso larvae and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of the zzso binding proteins that interact with the zzso insulin zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso shows 33 % identity with human zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory patterns of zzso genes zzso their diverse positions within the signaling network of zzso pathway, and suggest they have unique contributions to development, metabolism and zzso
