Higher plant zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso the reduction of zzso the product of nitrate reduction, to zzso The expression of this zzso is controlled at the zzso level by light and by the nitrogen zzso In order to study the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were transformed with a zzso zzso construct containing the tobacco leaf zzso coding sequence driven by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants did not show any zzso difference when compared with the zzso although they zzso zzso activity in the zzso When these plants were grown in zzso on media containing either nitrate or ammonium as sole nitrogen source, zzso zzso derived from zzso expression was zzso zzso whereas zzso activity and protein level were strongly reduced on zzso zzso These results suggest that, together with zzso control, zzso regulation by the nitrogen source is operating on zzso zzso This zzso regulation of tobacco leaf zzso expression was observed not only in the closely related species zzso zzso but also in the more distant species zzso zzso
