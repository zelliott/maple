The zzso and deduced zzso sequences for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from a zzso the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and then zzso in the context of available zzso zzso sequences and the recently determined crystal structure of chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso As zzso last shared a common zzso with zzso roughly 700 million years ago, observed zzso zzso may serve to confirm or reject contemporary hypotheses about the roles of particular zzso acids in zzso processes such as zzso formation and membrane zzso The isolated zzso from the zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein having a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The percentage identity of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is as high as zzso The zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso The first 102 zzso of the open reading frame zzso a zzso leader zzso whereas the mature protein is composed of 375 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The percentage identity of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is as high as zzso This similarity is also evident in zzso zzso to be important in the structure and function of zzso and zzso zzso zzso presence of seven basic zzso acids in the zzso end thought to be important in binding of zzso to zzso zzso presence of a zzso zzso zzso in chicken zzso also thought to be involved in membrane zzso and zzso presence of a zzso zzso thought to be important in zzso stabilization which is present in all zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso zzso present in chicken zzso which is thought to mediate zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso zzso are very stable indicating that zzso binding into zzso may be zzso by additional and/or other zzso zzso analyses showed that both zzso and zzso evolved very early in the zzso zzso well before the divergence of zzso and zzso These results indicate that the zzso is a primitive feature of zzso rather than being a derived and advanced zzso
