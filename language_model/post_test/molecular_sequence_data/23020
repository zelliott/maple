Studies of zzso genetic diversity of zzso such as population zzso and zzso are particularly hampered by the lack of suitable DNA zzso For example, sequences of the zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso regions are often too zzso for zzso zzso We have therefore identified zzso for the zzso zzso c zzso I zzso gene and applied them for zzso investigations in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we obtained sequences of the ITS regions from the same strains and carried out comparative sequence analyses of both data zzso The zzso sequences revealed substantially higher variation in both zzso species, with zzso zzso up to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, an initial survey of the population structure discovered different zzso zzso of zzso zzso in one pond, thereby demonstrating the potential of this genetic marker for population genetic zzso Our zzso successfully amplified the zzso gene of other zzso This is the first report of zzso variation in zzso zzso based on zzso sequence zzso Our results show that the high variation in zzso DNA makes it a suitable marker for zzso and population genetic zzso
