The zzso acid sequences of the zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso bound to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso through zzso zzso After zzso zzso 4 distinct zzso peptides were finally isolated from zzso zzso zzso and 2 from oxidized zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the two zzso peptides which could not be isolated from the oxidized zzso zzso were very similar to those around the active site zzso of the other zzso zzso zzso and a unique replacement of zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso between the two zzso zzso was zzso The other two peptides isolated from both oxidized and reduced zzso zzso also show considerable zzso to the corresponding parts of human and zzso coli zzso zzso
