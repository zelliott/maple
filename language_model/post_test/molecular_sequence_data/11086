zzso zzso training, or procedures that mimic the training, produces long-term zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The long-term effects of these procedures require zzso and protein synthesis zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Using the techniques of differential display reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso zzso we identified a zzso whose zzso level was increased significantly in sensory zzso by treatments of isolated zzso zzso with zzso for zzso zzso or by long-term behavioral training of zzso The effects of zzso and behavioral training on this zzso were zzso by treatments that elevate zzso The zzso zzso increased by zzso and behavioral training was zzso identical to a zzso regulated gene family which includes zzso zzso and human bone zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso that might activate zzso zzso growth factor zzso molecules or process zzso zzso zzso protein zzso might regulate the zzso and efficacy of synaptic connections between sensory and motor zzso which are associated with long-term zzso
