We developed a method for expression in zzso of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso precursor consists of a leader zzso and two different zzso proteins zzso zzso originating from Dahlia zzso seeds and zzso originating from zzso zzso seeds, which are linked by an intervening sequence zzso zzso originating from a natural zzso occurring in seed of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be zzso in transgenic zzso plants and the individual zzso were zzso into the zzso zzso Both zzso were found to exert zzso activity in zzso It is surprising that the amount of zzso produced in plants transformed with some of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher compared with the amount in plants transformed with a zzso zzso a single zzso indicating that the zzso expression strategy may be a way to boost expression levels of small zzso
