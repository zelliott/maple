zzso cause changes in the expression of target genes via interaction with an zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso This signal zzso process can be divided into a number of steps, each of which represents a functional facet of the zzso zzso These steps include zzso zzso transformation to an active form resulting from specific interaction with zzso steroid hormones, zzso zzso zzso zzso to specific hormone response elements in the zzso and zzso zzso of the expression levels of linked zzso These aspects of zzso zzso function have been studied using a combination of zzso structure determination, zzso zzso and a genetic approach using a zzso system to screen for zzso receptors that are altered in zzso The results show that contacts involving both the DNA and steroid binding zzso are involved in zzso and high affinity DNA zzso zzso experiments have illuminated the role of zzso acids within the recognition zzso of the zzso domain in discriminating between zzso DNA response elements for the zzso zzso and closely related binding sites for other nuclear zzso zzso experiments suggest that the zzso zzso domain of the zzso contacts components of the general zzso machinery that appear to be distinct from the zzso binding zzso zzso during zzso of gene expression by the zzso zzso
