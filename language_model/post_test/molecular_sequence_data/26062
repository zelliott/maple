Various types of zzso or zzso persistence of fetal zzso zzso are caused by deletions at the human zzso gene zzso Many of these molecular zzso show a clear zzso as far as size and location of their zzso are zzso This might indicate common zzso mechanisms responsible for the generation of these zzso The Belgian G zzso gamma delta zzso results from a large deletion spanning the zzso gene cluster 3' of the A gamma zzso The extent of this zzso analyzed by zzso gel zzso is approximately 50 zzso and is very similar to that of the Indian zzso zzso gamma A gamma zzso zzso previously characterized by zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso Isolation of the deletion junction of the Belgian G zzso gamma delta zzso by means of inverse zzso chain reaction confirmed a very close relationship between these two independent zzso The 3' zzso of the Belgian deletion is located at the zzso of a zzso zzso only four zzso zzso from the correspondent zzso of the Indian zzso
