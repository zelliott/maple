The zzso zzso zzso contains five families of long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso The sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the patterns of molecular variation existing among the entire zzso complement of Ty zzso We report the results of an analysis of the zzso and zzso acid sequence variation within and between the five Ty element families of the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that individual Ty element families tend to be highly zzso in both sequence and size zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso and 3' zzso sequences indicate that the vast majority of Ty elements have recently zzso Furthermore, zzso Ty sequence comparisons reveal the action of negative selection on Ty element coding zzso These results taken together suggest that there is a high level of zzso turnover of zzso zzso Ty zzso which is presumably in response to selective pressure to escape zzso repression and elimination zzso
