The groove zzso of DNA zzso especially minor groove zzso are generally believed to be important for recognition of DNA by various types of zzso It has been zzso earlier that large negative zzso twist, in the AT rich regions zzso the minor groove of duplex zzso A systematic study has now been carried out by generating models with different values of local zzso and zzso parameters and calculating their minor groove zzso It is found that several local zzso parameters affect the minor groove zzso but it depends most strongly on the local step parameters roll and slide when each zzso is considered zzso However, a detailed analysis of the various local parameters within the zzso family of crystal structures indicates that zzso twist and slide are most strongly correlated with the observed values of minor groove zzso The groove depth is also strongly correlated with zzso Thus the local base sequence dependent variations in slide can modify both the groove zzso and depth and consequently determine the zzso binding properties of zzso
