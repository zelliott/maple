In higher plants, zzso zzso represents a branch point between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is believed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso actively compete for the zzso zzso for zzso and Met zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso of zzso designated zzso that zzso soluble Met zzso and contains markedly reduced levels of soluble zzso in young zzso The zzso zzso carries a single base pair zzso within the gene zzso zzso resulting in a zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein was normal in young zzso of zzso whereas functional zzso analysis of an zzso coli zzso zzso suggested that the ability of zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso We concluded that the zzso within the zzso gene is responsible for the zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso and a channeling of zzso to Met zzso in young zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso suggested that, in zzso the feedback regulation of zzso is not sufficient alone for the control of Met zzso in young zzso and is dependent on zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis of soluble Met and zzso zzso indicated that the zzso of these zzso acids is regulated in a zzso and spatial zzso
