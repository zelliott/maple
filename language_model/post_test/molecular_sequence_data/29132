The emergence of resistance to zzso drugs is a relevant matter worldwide, but the retrieval of zzso for zzso tuberculosis is severely delayed when zzso methods are zzso zzso methods allow earlier detection of resistance, although conventional approaches are cumbersome or lack sensitivity or zzso We aimed to design a new real-time zzso method to detect zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis strains in a single reaction zzso First, we characterized the resistant zzso in our area of Spain by DNA zzso Some zzso was found within the zzso core region in all the zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of the zzso zzso strains showed a zzso in zzso zzso zzso and most of these were associated with high zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso strains zzso were tested by our real-time zzso zzso and full zzso of the results of the zzso with the sequencing data was zzso In addition, a blind test was performed with a panel of 15 different susceptible and resistant strains from throughout Spain, and our results were also in zzso agreement with the sequencing zzso zzso is the first zzso based on zzso zzso able to simultaneously detect in a single reaction tube a large variety of zzso associated with zzso resistance (12 different zzso affecting 8 independent zzso including the most prevalent zzso at positions 526 and zzso and the most frequent zzso resistance zzso Our design could be a model for new, rapid zzso methods able to simultaneously detect a wide variety of zzso resistance zzso
