In this study we developed a zzso sequence typing zzso scheme for bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso This group, which includes the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is known to be genetically very zzso It is also very important because it comprises zzso organisms as well as bacteria with industrial zzso The zzso system was established by using 77 strains having various origins, including humans, animals, food, and zzso A total of 67 of these strains had been analyzed previously by zzso zzso zzso and they were selected to represent the genetic diversity of this group of zzso zzso were designed for zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso internal fragments of seven such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for all zzso The number of zzso at individual zzso ranged from 25 to 40, and a total of 53 zzso profiles or sequence types zzso were zzso Analysis of the sequence data showed that the population structure of the zzso zzso group is zzso zzso In particular, all five zzso zzso zzso analyzed had the same zzso The zzso scheme which we developed has a high level of resolution and should be an excellent tool for studying the population structure and epidemiology of the zzso zzso zzso
