zzso stability of alpha fragments of zzso in zzso coli has been studied by zzso zzso An alpha zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was relatively stable with an estimated zzso of about 12 zzso at 37 degrees C, whereas another zzso zzso zzso a less stable alpha zzso that had a different zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was found to be affected markedly by zzso attachment of other zzso An zzso fusion of a sequence derived from zzso domain 4 of the zzso protein shortened the zzso of the alpha zzso to less than 1 zzso In contrast, an zzso sequence from the zzso protein had no apparent effect on the stability of the zzso In a fusion protein in which the intact zzso protein was fused to the alpha fragment, stabilization of the zzso part by overproduction of the partner zzso protein resulted in an increased alpha zzso activity of zzso These results indicate that stability of alpha zzso can be dictated by the stability of the fused zzso The alpha zzso of zzso which is unique in that it is largely zzso but can be zzso in alpha zzso may be used as an in zzso indicator of stability of proteins attached to zzso
