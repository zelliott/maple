To identify potential pathways for zzso zzso by zzso zzso under conditions similar to zzso zzso 

A putative zzso acid cycle zzso for zzso zzso was generated utilizing the zzso zzso and zzso flux zzso Although it was possible to construct a unique zzso for zzso zzso its full functionality was zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was evaluated utilizing zzso analyses of zzso acid zzso during growth in modified chemically defined media zzso and zzso cheese extract zzso zzso suggest that under energy source excess and limitation in zzso this zzso produces mainly zzso acid and zzso acid, zzso Both organic acids were produced in zzso Additional end products include zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, ethanol, and zzso zzso of zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso was not zzso 

Under conditions similar to those present in zzso cheese, zzso acid is converted to zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso ethanol, and zzso zzso The zzso suggests that conversion of the zzso zzso zzso acid into zzso acid, instead of zzso acid, may yield two zzso per zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso reductive route was not zzso 

This research describes a unique zzso for zzso zzso Additionally, it describes the zzso acid zzso end product by this nonstarter zzso acid bacteria during growth, and under conditions similar to those present in zzso zzso It provides insights on pathways preferably zzso to derive energy in the presence of limiting carbohydrates by this zzso
