zzso zzso contacts in proteins can be predicted from both zzso templates and zzso machine zzso However, most structure modeling approaches only use the zzso contact predictions in guiding the zzso this is partly because the zzso contact predictions are usually considered to be less accurate than that by zzso With the rapid progress in sequence databases and zzso techniques, it is necessary to have a detailed and comprehensive assessment of the zzso methods in different template zzso 

We develop two methods for zzso zzso zzso is a zzso machine learning approach which trains a variety of zzso features on contact zzso zzso collects consensus contact predictions from multiple zzso zzso We test both methods on the same set of zzso proteins which are zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso targets based on the evolutionary and structural distance between templates and zzso For the Easy and zzso targets, zzso obviously zzso zzso but for the Hard and Very Hard targets, the accuracy of the zzso predictions is higher than that of zzso by zzso If we combine the zzso and zzso predictions together, the total number of correctly predicted contacts in the Hard proteins will increase by more than zzso (or zzso for the long-range contact with a sequence separation zzso or zzso compared with zzso zzso The advantage of zzso is also shown in the zzso free modeling targets where the zzso is around four times more accurate than zzso in the long-range contact zzso These data demonstrate that the state-of-the-art zzso contact prediction has reached a level which may be helpful in assisting zzso structure modeling for the targets which do not have close structure zzso The maximum yield should be obtained by the combination of both zzso and zzso zzso
