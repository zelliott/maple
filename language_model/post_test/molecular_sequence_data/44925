Besides natural zzso zzso screening of random zzso libraries has yielded novel zzso peptides for cell surface zzso A method is described that uses a modified zzso as a detection zzso to monitor the expression of zzso channels in zzso cells and to probe the molecular interaction between zzso peptides zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso By taking advantage of a specific zzso interaction between zzso zzso and the zzso target, zzso have been developed that use zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso an important zzso zzso channel in the nervous system, to monitor the zzso expression in cultured zzso zzso Combining these zzso zzso binding zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso random zzso zzso zzso were screened and candidate interaction zzso were zzso This dual zzso expression system offers a powerful approach to the molecular studies of zzso zzso
