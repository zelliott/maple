zzso zzso zzso zzso has been in clinical use for the treatment of zzso zzso heart zzso However, zzso has a very short zzso in zzso which limits its application to acute zzso and requires continuous zzso zzso To provide superior pharmacological benefits of zzso to other stages of chronic zzso heart failure and to eliminate problems associated with drug delivery via continuous zzso infusion, we have designed and evaluated zzso a zzso form of zzso by zzso fusion to human serum zzso for use in chronic zzso heart failure, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso was seamlessly fused to mature human serum zzso at zzso to create zzso The zzso of zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, and plasma zzso zzso The zzso properties were determined after single zzso or zzso zzso injection in zzso zzso 

zzso had zzso the same zzso zzso as zzso to activate zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In spontaneously zzso rats, zzso lowered both zzso and zzso blood pressure, having sustainable mean zzso pressure reduction for more than 2 zzso Six zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice increased plasma zzso level zzso over the zzso The elimination zzso in mice was dramatically increased from 3 zzso for zzso to zzso h for zzso 

zzso is zzso and has desired zzso properties for long-term zzso It has the potential to be further developed as a new therapeutic option for zzso zzso and zzso zzso to alleviate symptoms, improve clinical status, and slow the disease progression by sustained drug exposure via zzso simple subcutaneous zzso
