zzso to birch zzso is common in the Northern Europe, North America, and in Japan, mainly in zzso zzso Previously, we have reported the positive association of birch zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also have identified the recognition sites in zzso protein zzso zzso known as the major zzso of birch zzso by using T cell proliferation zzso against the zzso zzso materials of the zzso zzso In this study, overlapping synthetic peptides zzso to the zzso zzso sequences were used to investigate the specificity of T cell responses in two zzso positive zzso Three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recognized by T cells from both zzso These three zzso include zzso binding zzso Then we established T cell clone specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso was the core sequence of the zzso for the T cell clone contained the anchor zzso characteristic to zzso Within the core zzso five zzso were identified as critical for recognition on the basis of zzso of the T cell zzso response against zzso zzso analogue zzso
