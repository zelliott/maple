In this study we identified a novel protein which may contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso A human zzso clone zzso this protein zzso was isolated from a human expression library using zzso screening with an zzso zzso implicated in the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso and interacting with a zzso nuclear protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso is demonstrated to inhibit zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but showed no repression of zzso of a zzso gene or of a reporter gene under control of a Pol II zzso zzso zzso is also found to be zzso in zzso zzso cells, consistent with a possible zzso function of the protein in zzso zzso is mainly (but not zzso located in zzso and appears to be a member of a zzso characterized zzso protein family having a central, highly zzso sequence zzso zzso One member of the family identified earlier as zzso membrane protein zzso is known to interact in a zzso manner with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso A (an abundant zzso expressed zzso is known to interact with human zzso zzso zzso which is a major zzso zzso protein in human zzso It appears, therefore, that zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is a result of complex interactions of many proteins which bind to its Pol III zzso
