The human zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal zzso where it zzso the zzso of steroids and zzso zzso In this study, the zzso gene was isolated and its zzso promoter was zzso The zzso gene consists of 6 zzso and extends over 16 zzso zzso It does not contain a zzso zzso box but has a region zzso to zzso adjacent to the zzso start site that binds nuclear zzso This region contains a consensus zzso nuclear zzso zzso site and an overlapping zzso zzso zzso lengths of the zzso gene promoter, with and without these sites, were fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene and zzso into zzso zzso zzso promoter activity with the zzso element was zzso by zzso with zzso Additional zzso was observed when zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso However, zzso alone did not stimulate promoter activity and did not bind to the promoter in the absence of zzso zzso of the zzso region, or zzso in this region, abolished zzso gene promoter activity and prevented zzso increases in promoter zzso The presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the protein complex that bound to the zzso region was demonstrated by gel shift analyses with zzso specific to zzso and zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso factor zzso binds to, and zzso the zzso gene promoter and that the ubiquitous zzso factor, zzso enhances this zzso by directly interacting with zzso This interaction between zzso and zzso may fine-tune zzso zzso
