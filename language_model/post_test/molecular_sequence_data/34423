In order to obtain insight into the zzso diversity and community in zzso zzso a zzso zzso molecular zzso approach was performed with zzso and bacterial zzso zzso gene clone libraries derived from zzso zzso of an aged zzso A total of 59 zzso and 283 bacterial zzso zzso were identified in 425 zzso and 375 bacterial analyzed zzso All zzso clones distributed within two zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso especially zzso zzso are the most zzso dominant species of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the bacterial library revealed a variety of zzso and zzso zzso including 18 distinct zzso A substantial fraction of bacterial clones showed low levels of similarity with any previously documented sequences and thus might be zzso zzso Chemical characteristics and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso bacteria might form zzso to alleviate or avoid the negative influence of high ammonium concentration on other zzso and zzso members of the zzso found in the zzso might be involved in ammonium zzso This study is the first to report the composition of the microbial zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso populations extant in zzso zzso Additional work on microbial activity and contaminant zzso remains to be zzso
