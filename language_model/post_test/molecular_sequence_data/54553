zzso zzso play important roles in the zzso zzso survival within their host, in the development and reproduction of the zzso The present study described the isolation, zzso and characterization of a novel member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso designated zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of a signal sequence and two zzso zzso zzso zzso which showed the highest similarity with zzso a putative zzso zzso inhibitor with two zzso zzso in zzso zzso Each zzso domain of the zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and their zzso activities against zzso zzso from animals and human were zzso zzso Both of the two zzso zzso inhibited human zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso but different in zzso Although the first zzso domain of zzso inhibited bovine pancreatic zzso zzso zzso both of the two zzso showed no zzso activity against the human pancreatic zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso was localized in zzso zzso and zzso surface of the adult zzso These results suggested that zzso may be involved in the survival of zzso zzso in host by targeting related zzso zzso and zzso zzso
