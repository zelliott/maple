zzso the major structural protein of the zzso zzso virus, zzso is zzso To define the zzso structure attached to this zzso zzso released by zzso were zzso by mass zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Such analyses showed that the major zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso acid and a terminal zzso acid zzso This is the first observation of zzso acid, a zzso zzso sugar, in an zzso zzso zzso The importance of this zzso for viral infection was demonstrated upon incubation with zzso acid, a similar zzso Such treatment reduced progeny virus production by half zzso post zzso zzso analysis confirmed the presence of zzso precursors on two different zzso peptides bearing the zzso zzso zzso The same sites modified by the native host, zzso zzso strain zzso were also recognized by the zzso zzso zzso apparatus, as determined by zzso of zzso expressed zzso Here, however, the zzso zzso was the same as shown to decorate the zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso viral zzso zzso is zzso These results thus present additional examples of zzso zzso diversity and show the ability of zzso to modify zzso expressed zzso
