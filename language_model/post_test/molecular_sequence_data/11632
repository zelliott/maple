A zzso zzso has been attached at its zzso to a zzso zzso zzso and used to target a sequence which forms part of the coding region of the human zzso zzso The 20 base pair sequence is not a perfect triplex target since it contains three zzso interruptions within the zzso zzso Despite this, we have detected zzso zzso formation at pH zzso between the zzso zzso and a zzso duplex representing the zzso zzso zzso formation was found to be sensitive to zzso temperature, zzso concentration and the base composition of the third zzso By varying the base sequence of the target duplex around the zzso zzso site, we have zzso the site and mode of zzso zzso The attached zzso has been found to zzso at the zzso junction with a strong preference for one zzso We have shown that the zzso will bind at the junction even when there is a preferred zzso step at an adjacent zzso We have also compared the binding affinity and zzso of zzso linked to two different zzso derivatives and found differences in the rate of zzso and the extent of zzso zzso Finally, we have examined zzso which are attached to zzso by zzso zzso of different zzso
