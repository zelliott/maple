The zzso zzso zzso is one of the most pristine regions of zzso and biologically one of the richest areas on zzso How and when this massive diversity arose remains the subject of considerable zzso The prevailing hypothesis of zzso glacial zzso suggests that a part of the eastern zzso among other areas in zzso served as stable forested zzso during periods of zzso However, the recently proposed zzso hypothesis proposes that fluctuations in temperature on zzso zzso with some associated zzso have driven zzso zzso The expectations of the zzso and spatial organization of zzso differ between these two zzso Here, we compare the genetic structure of 12 zzso inhabiting zzso species from the zzso zzso using a combination of zzso and nuclear sequences in an zzso zzso approach that includes zzso zzso molecular dating, and zzso Information System zzso This comparative and integrated approach overcomes the well-known limitations of zzso zzso based on single species and single zzso All of the focal species exhibit distinct zzso patterns highlighting zzso historical zzso ecological zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, all but one species exhibit a history of zzso within the eastern zzso during the zzso with spatial and zzso zzso among zzso The signature of isolation in northern French zzso zzso during the early zzso is particularly zzso Approximate zzso zzso supports the zzso of the divergence between northern zzso and other zzso zzso zzso observed throughout the zzso suggests further zzso fragmentation and a role for zzso Our findings support fragmentation of moist tropical forest in the eastern zzso during this period when the refuge hypothesis would have the region serving as a zzso zzso zzso
