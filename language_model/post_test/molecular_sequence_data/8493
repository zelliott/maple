The complete zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence of zzso zzso which is a typical budding zzso and contains circular zzso DNA, has been zzso The zzso sequence contains genes zzso large and small zzso zzso 25 zzso three zzso of zzso c zzso zzso 1, 2 and zzso three zzso of zzso zzso 6, 8 and zzso zzso zzso seven zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, zzso 5 and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is considered to be a typical zzso zzso This is consistent with data on DNA and the deduced zzso sequence zzso comparisons of genes ubiquitous in zzso and zzso However, we have identified seven genes zzso zzso zzso zzso which are not found in other zzso zzso zzso thus placing the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a unique zzso In addition the zzso zzso zzso zzso also encodes one zzso zzso and one short unidentified zzso The zzso is compact with only two zzso both of which contain an zzso One zzso lies in the large zzso gene while the other is situated in the zzso c zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif zzso zzso which is a zzso start signal in zzso zzso zzso has also been found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso assignments for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso are different from those in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate a unique and novel structure for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in terms of characteristics which are typical for both zzso and for zzso zzso This is the first complete zzso DNA sequence report in zzso
