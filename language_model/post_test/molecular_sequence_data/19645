zzso proteins such as zzso regulate the expression of bacterial zzso zzso and ensure that zzso of the host DNA precedes restriction by delaying zzso of the zzso The operator DNA sequence to which zzso binds consists of two adjacent binding sites, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and to zzso + zzso has been investigated by circular zzso zzso zzso and by circular zzso zzso zzso CD indicates considerable distortion to the DNA when bound by zzso zzso to one or two sites to form zzso and zzso complexes increases the CD signal at zzso zzso by 40 and zzso respectively, showing identical local distortion at both zzso In contrast, zzso zzso gave similar bend angles for both zzso and zzso complexes zzso and 38 degrees, zzso The relative orientation of zzso zzso in the zzso complex and the structural role of the zzso zzso sequences found at the zzso of zzso sites are zzso
