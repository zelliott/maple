Mass zzso zzso quantitative zzso is an increasingly popular approach to study changes in protein zzso in biological zzso zzso isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso one of the more widely used methods for quantitative zzso is a zzso strategy that encodes whole cellular zzso zzso are grown in a culture medium where the natural form of an zzso acid is replaced with a stable isotope form, such as zzso bearing six zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid occurs through cell growth, protein zzso and zzso zzso allows zzso and zzso zzso to be distinguished by zzso while avoiding any chemical zzso and associated zzso In this chapter, we provide detailed zzso protocols and explain how to incorporate zzso into any zzso
