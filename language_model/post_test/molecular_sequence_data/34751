zzso analysis was conducted on structural and zzso genes of 7 strains of dengue virus zzso zzso zzso isolated in Indonesia and Thailand in the year 1973, 1994, and 1998 from patients with different clinical zzso In general, sequence similarity among zzso was greater than zzso indicating that the zzso rate of zzso circulating in this region was not more than zzso in the last 3 decades and suggesting that sequences that may responsible for viral zzso and/or biological function were strictly zzso zzso unique to viral strains associated with specific clinical manifestations were not zzso zzso of zzso and E zzso acid sequences followed by zzso analysis of sequences obtained in this study and published elsewhere allowed generation of zzso trees, demonstrating that zzso strains isolated in Indonesia in 1998 belonged to a separate cluster zzso 2) from those isolated between zzso zzso zzso
