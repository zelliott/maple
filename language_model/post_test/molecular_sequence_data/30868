The zzso DNA zzso human muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso to X has been cloned and the coding regions have been zzso The zzso boundaries are located at the same positions as those identified for the rabbit zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso French, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Chang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone lacking the sequences corresponding to zzso IX was isolated from a human zzso zzso library, suggesting that the zzso transcript may be alternatively zzso zzso IX is 93 zzso in zzso and the absence of this sequence from the zzso transcript would generate an zzso coding for a zzso zzso lacking 31 zzso acids compared with the zzso zzso zzso transcripts approximately zzso zzso in length are expressed in a zzso manner with high levels in cell lines and zzso muscle tissue and very low levels in peripheral blood zzso cells and liver zzso zzso of the structure of these zzso transcripts by zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrated that all the cell lines and zzso examined expressed the alternatively spliced transcript in addition to the transcript coding for the zzso functional zzso zzso
