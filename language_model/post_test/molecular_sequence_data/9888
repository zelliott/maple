We present a new zzso model of evolution of zzso zzso or zzso sequences and a tool rose that zzso this zzso By zzso deletion and substitution of characters, a family of sequences is created from a common zzso During this artificial evolutionary process, the zzso history is logged and the zzso multiple sequence alignment is created zzso We also allow for varying rates of zzso within the sequences making it possible to establish so-called sequence zzso The results are suitable for the evaluation of methods in multiple sequence alignment zzso and the prediction of zzso zzso
