Gene VIII zzso the zzso protein of the Class II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso coli and subjected to zzso zzso The two positively charged zzso clustered near the zzso zzso and zzso were systematically converted to zzso zzso and zzso was converted to an zzso zzso zzso of positive charge in the zzso region of the zzso seriously impaired the ability of the zzso zzso to undergo zzso at the zzso coli cell inner zzso as zzso by the diminished processing of the zzso leader zzso The basic zzso acids near the zzso of the coat protein are also involved in zzso the zzso charged viral DNA during virus zzso However, despite its additional positive charge, the zzso zzso protein was unable to participate in the assembly of Class I zzso zzso in zzso zzso This dual requirement of positively charged zzso in the zzso region of the coat protein for membrane processing and zzso and for zzso zzso of the zzso DNA poses important constraints on the evolution of zzso zzso with two different zzso zzso
