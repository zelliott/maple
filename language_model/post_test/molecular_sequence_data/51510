The DNA binding activity of zzso is required for its tumor zzso zzso we show here that this activity is cryptic but can be activated by cellular factors acting on a zzso regulatory domain of zzso A gel mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso human zzso binds DNA sequence specifically only zzso but a zzso zzso binding near the C zzso activated the cryptic DNA binding activity zzso zzso DNA binding could be activated by a zzso deletion of zzso mild zzso of full-length zzso zzso coli zzso (which zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso II (and zzso zzso of a zzso site on zzso zzso of zzso DNA binding may be critical in regulation of its ability to arrest cell growth and thus its tumor zzso zzso
