The zzso zzso processing of zzso envelope zzso zzso into zzso is an essential step for virus zzso Several zzso belonging to the zzso zzso family, have been proposed as candidate zzso processing zzso Here we demonstrate using zzso that resting human T4 zzso zzso express zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso activated under conditions favoring zzso replication express zzso higher levels of zzso and zzso In this report, we examined the capability of the newly cloned zzso zzso to cleave zzso into zzso and compared it to zzso This was carried out in a zzso zzso zzso both zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cells and in the regulated zzso cells, as well as using two in zzso zzso which examined the zzso of zzso or of a synthetic zzso spanning the zzso zzso The data demonstrate that zzso can cleave specifically and in a zzso specific manner zzso into zzso suggesting that both zzso and zzso are so far the major zzso candidate zzso zzso in T4 zzso
