To find zzso interactive sites in complement component zzso we examined regions of zzso that are zzso to sites of length zzso or zzso in the zzso protein zzso We reasoned that zzso probably mark protein interactive sites because they usually involve zzso at protein zzso To test for the involvement of individual zzso we examined the effects on complement function of synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso segments of zzso We zzso that if such a segment made direct contact with a zzso binding zzso then the corresponding zzso might also bind to that protein and inhibit binding to zzso zzso peptides were zzso four of these inhibited zzso zzso zzso at zzso or zzso zzso and zzso killing of zzso coli at about zzso higher zzso These results indicate that the four peptides act as specific zzso of zzso They also suggest that zzso can be effective guides for locating interactive sites in zzso and in any protein that is a member of a protein zzso Because only a linear sequence is required, a focus on zzso may be particularly useful for identifying interactive sites in proteins for which a three-dimensional structure is zzso
