By inserting appropriate zzso zzso into surface zzso on zzso zzso we expect to develop zzso for the location, accessibility, and zzso and zzso environment of these zzso sites on their zzso zzso Three zzso in a loop on the surface of zzso coli alkaline zzso were zzso by an zzso zzso containing the zzso segment of zzso without significantly affecting the zzso properties of the zzso This hybrid protein was then used to investigate the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the hybrid protein within the inserted zzso and binding of the hybrid protein to zzso zzso demonstrated the surface accessibility of the guest zzso Both the zzso zzso and the zzso hybrid displaced zzso zzso from rat brain membrane receptors only at high zzso However, chemical zzso of the hybrid zzso which again did not disturb the zzso activity, enhanced its zzso potency to a level only 23 times lower than that of zzso itself and 280 times higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso This alkaline zzso hybrid protein appears, therefore, to be a suitable starting point for the development of zzso for the zzso and zzso environment of the zzso site of zzso zzso
