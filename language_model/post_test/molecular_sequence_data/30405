zzso 2 and zzso 5 have been zzso from medium zzso by zzso cultured cells zzso and identified based on their zzso zzso acid sequence analysis and biological zzso When applied in high zzso zzso zzso 2, like zzso zzso 2, zzso expression of zzso markers from cultured zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso 5 is inactive in this zzso However, the zzso 's could be separated from the major zzso activity present in zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso 5 are approximately equivalent to zzso 1 in their abilities to inhibit the growth of mink lung zzso cells, induce zzso growth of rat zzso cells, inhibit the proliferation and zzso zzso of human zzso and stimulate zzso of human zzso These data establish the functional activity of zzso 5 and suggest that more complex zzso systems, in contrast to most isolated cells, discriminate between the different zzso zzso
