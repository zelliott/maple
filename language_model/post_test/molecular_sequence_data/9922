A new zzso zzso has been constructed that expresses genes zzso three different activities from a single zzso This feature has been exploited to enable the efficient marking and selection of cells that express a gene of zzso The marker gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for selection by the zzso zzso are expressed as a fusion, beta zzso The expression of beta Geo is coordinated with expression of a gene of interest at the zzso level using an Internal zzso zzso Site zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso promotes zzso initiation of translation therefore two reading frames can be translated from a single zzso In zzso the zzso has been shown to zzso zzso activity, transformation by zzso and resistance to zzso following infection of zzso To show that the zzso was able to mark infected cells in zzso cells infected with the zzso were transplanted into mouse zzso zzso where they grew and were successfully located by zzso for zzso over 2 months after zzso
