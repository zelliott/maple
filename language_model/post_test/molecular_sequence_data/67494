The changes in fast dynamics of zzso with a double zzso zzso dynamics label zzso as a function of the extent of zzso by zzso were investigated with two-dimensional infrared zzso zzso zzso echo zzso zzso zzso replaces the native zzso at two zzso in the zzso core of zzso providing zzso zzso zzso data show that zzso maintains the native folded structure similar to wild type and that both zzso zzso share essentially the same environment within the zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso echo zzso were obtained for the folded zzso and the increasingly unfolded zzso Analysis of the time dependence of the zzso zzso yields the system's spectral zzso which is caused by the sampling of accessible structures of the zzso under zzso equilibrium zzso The structural dynamics become faster as the degree of unfolding is zzso
