The zzso zzso are an important group of zzso that are responsible for zzso a range of biologically significant zzso zzso zzso information on these zzso has provided useful information on their molecular basis for the functional variations, while the characterization of the structural features that account for the high zzso of proteins is of great scientific and zzso zzso To these ends we have determined the crystal structure of the zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure is a zzso barrel zzso as seen in other zzso zzso family 1 members, and forms a zzso zzso of the active site and the surrounding area reveals two zzso zzso zzso consistent with the retaining mechanism and the surrounding polar and aromatic zzso consistent with a zzso binding zzso zzso of this structure with its zzso counterparts implicates a variety of structural features that could contribute to the zzso These include an increased number of surface zzso pairs, an increased number of internal water molecules and a decreased surface area upon forming an zzso zzso zzso
