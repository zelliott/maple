zzso a member of the mixed lineage zzso zzso family of protein zzso first reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1993, zzso zzso comprises several distinct structural zzso including an zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, a unique domain containing two zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso interactive binding zzso Each of these zzso has been shown in other systems to be associated with a specific type of protein interaction in the regulation of cellular signal zzso To study the role of zzso in recruiting specific zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso the zzso 100 zzso acids of zzso zzso including the zzso domain zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso This fusion protein was expressed in zzso coli, zzso using zzso affinity zzso and employed in an affinity approach to isolate zzso domain binding proteins from zzso of zzso zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso analysis of bound proteins revealed that two zzso proteins with a molecular weights zzso of approximately zzso and approximately zzso bound consistently to the zzso zzso To establish accurately the Mt zzso zzso point zzso zzso of these zzso domain binding zzso a number of abundant proteins in a two-dimensional zzso zzso master gel were identified to serve as zzso marker zzso zzso were identified by zzso direct zzso degradation following zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of peptides generated by zzso zzso and zzso by rapid zzso 12 zzso zzso column zzso zzso zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso mass zzso methods including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso column zzso or zzso zzso zzso Using this information, a preliminary zzso protein database for the human breast zzso cell line zzso zzso 21 identified zzso has been constructed and can be zzso via the World Wide Web zzso address: zzso zzso zzso
