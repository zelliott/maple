zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso 3, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, were tested for their ability to antagonize zzso zzso The activities were found to fall in the order 4 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics studies were carried out to estimate the most populated zzso of each zzso The zzso molecules 1-3 were found to populate a much wider range of zzso than the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of all four molecules were found to approximate zzso structures in the most populated zzso In 4 the zzso zzso hydrogen bond between C zzso O of the i zzso zzso and zzso of the i + 3 zzso zzso did not appear to be zzso The distance between the zzso of the critical zzso and zzso groups was found to be shorter in 4 zzso zzso zzso than in the less active zzso molecules zzso of zzso zzso
