We have isolated two zzso zzso clones from a zzso zzso zzso library by using the zzso zzso sequence zzso database of zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso by the clones zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso have zzso identity, and both proteins show zzso identities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences conserve well the zzso clusters that are zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses revealed that both transcripts of zzso 1 and zzso 2 were expressed predominantly in the zzso zzso Both transcripts detected zzso before adult zzso dramatically increased a day before adult zzso keeping the zzso levels high even after zzso These results, combined with the fact that zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a key step to zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso by zzso 1 and zzso 2 are involved in either or both of the zzso steps in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso 1 and zzso 2 were not affected by zzso or injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the adult female zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso 1 and zzso 2 is not regulated by zzso In addition to the clones in the zzso zzso eight other clones zzso the same zzso zzso zzso were found in an embryonic zzso library by searching from the zzso database of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from one of the clones zzso 3) shows zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso but only zzso identity to the zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso corresponding to the zzso 3 was detected in the zzso and fat body, but not in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso clones zzso out of the zzso randomly zzso zzso in the library prepared from zzso zzso zzso after zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso 3 plays an important role in embryonic development in zzso zzso
