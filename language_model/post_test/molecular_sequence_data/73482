The zzso of urinary degradation products of zzso zzso derived from the zzso chain of human type I collagen was investigated and zzso The urinary fragments characterized in this study consisted of two zzso zzso zzso acid sequences derived from the zzso zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso containing the sequence zzso with a zzso site being either zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso zzso was detected among the zzso zzso but there was a dominance of zzso and a zzso containing zzso having a molecular weight identical with that of zzso zzso A zzso zzso was also zzso The concentration of fragments derived from the zzso zzso region of type I collagen containing the sequence zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso in urine and in zzso zzso of zzso and cortical bone of young and old zzso It was shown that the urinary ratio between such fragments, zzso was higher in children compared with adults and that the ratio decreased with increasing age of zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso fragments derived from type I collagen zzso into urine originated mainly from zzso In conclusion, it is demonstrated for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso chain of type I collagen contains an zzso site prone to undergo zzso and that the degree of zzso of this linkage apparently increases with increasing age of zzso These findings indicate that the ratio zzso might be clinically important in diagnosing zzso bone zzso
