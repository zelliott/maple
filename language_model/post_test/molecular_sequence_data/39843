The zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso of the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso most closely resembles the zzso of zzso zzso receptors and in particular the zzso zzso zzso zzso We report the isolation and characterization of an zzso that has the highest known affinity for the zzso zzso and also zzso blocks the zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso the zzso also has high affinity for the zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso in combination with the zzso may serve as a model system for understanding the binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso bridge zzso The zzso is the first zzso with higher affinity for the closely related zzso zzso zzso versus zzso and selectively blocks these two zzso when compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
