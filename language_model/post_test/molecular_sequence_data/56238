In order to isolate genes that function downstream of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was screened for clones that inhibit growth of cells with diminished zzso zzso One such zzso zzso was found to zzso a zzso 52 zzso protein that shares weak zzso with the zzso zzso gene zzso Three lines of evidence suggest that the zzso gene product is a negative regulator downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso cells on zzso medium containing a low concentration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not affect zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso is partially suppressed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows similar zzso to zzso zzso it cannot grow on zzso containing zzso zzso at 25 degrees C, or on zzso or zzso at 37 degrees zzso The zzso zzso double zzso shows more marked zzso changes than the single zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in zzso regulation of several genes by zzso
