zzso genetic studies have shown that zzso of zzso zzso stability lie in both the zzso and 3' untranslated zzso While it is well-known that zzso zzso are unstable in the absence of certain zzso factors, little is known of the zzso mechanisms for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here we used a zzso zzso which zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to study the degradation zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso lacks a zzso factor required for zzso zzso zzso Upon inserting zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso or zzso relative to the mature zzso zzso end, zzso accumulate with zzso ends corresponding to the zzso zzso in addition to the normal zzso with its zzso end at zzso We interpret these results as evidence for continuous degradation of zzso zzso in zzso cells by a zzso zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso the accumulating zzso can be interpreted as a processing zzso suggesting that zzso end maturation may also involve this zzso When examined in the zzso zzso background, zzso zzso with the zzso zzso ends, but not normal zzso ends, zzso However, no expression of zzso the zzso gene product, was zzso zzso of zzso at zzso in zzso cells did not demonstrably affect zzso zzso suggesting that zzso scanning does not occur upstream of this zzso However, since neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso could be translated in zzso cells, this raises the possibility that the zzso product is essential for zzso
