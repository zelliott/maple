We report the development of a reliable and efficient method for molecular zzso of all extant elephant zzso We developed zzso that amplify two short zzso fragments zzso and zzso and one longer zzso zzso zzso developed from elephant sequences in one multiplex zzso All fragments were designed to be short zzso 200 zzso for use with zzso DNA and to be 50 zzso apart to zzso zzso on zzso gels or as zzso The multiplex zzso method matched sexes for at least zzso of the zzso zzso elephant samples and produced the expected zzso zzso patterns for 14 African forest and 11 Asian elephant zzso We found this method to be more zzso efficient and less prone to contamination than previously developed zzso methods for zzso
