The human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso domain zzso is located between the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso This flexible, zzso zzso zzso domain has been suggested to zzso interfere with zzso zzso activity in zzso proposing a contribution of either the zzso zzso zzso internal cryptic zzso zzso sites, or a zzso mechanism to a regulated zzso zzso To assess these hypotheses in the viral context, a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been established with clustered zzso acid zzso throughout the entire zzso coding zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso clones in different cell culture systems revealed that zzso within the zzso zzso zzso region modified the zzso ratio and thus resulted in the release of viruses with impaired zzso zzso zzso acid zzso destroying zzso the predicted cryptic zzso zzso sites or zzso zzso to the zzso zzso did not influence viral replication in cell culture, whereas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 62 to 68 altering proper release of the mature zzso from the zzso precursor drastically reduced viral zzso Thus, the critical contribution of zzso and overlapping zzso sequence elements to timely regulated virus maturation and zzso is closely linked to precise zzso zzso and proper zzso release of the viral zzso from the zzso zzso clearly zzso the hypothesis that sequence motifs in the central part of zzso zzso zzso zzso and viral zzso
