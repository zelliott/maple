Human zzso are permanently challenged by bacteria and zzso including zzso and zzso zzso In the gut, the fraction of strict zzso increases from zzso to zzso reaching zzso of bacterial species in the zzso At zzso zzso oxygen partial pressure is below zzso of airborne oxygen content, zzso microbial metabolism causes reduction to a low zzso potential of zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso characterized by three zzso zzso are key zzso molecules of innate immunity that protect the host from infectious microbes and shape the composition of zzso at zzso zzso Human zzso 1 zzso is one of the most prominent peptides of its class but despite ubiquitous expression by all human zzso comparison with other zzso suggested only minor zzso killing zzso Whereas much is known about the activity of zzso peptides in zzso zzso data about reducing environments are zzso zzso we show that after reduction of zzso zzso becomes a potent zzso zzso against the opportunistic zzso fungus zzso zzso and against zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differs structurally from oxidized zzso and free zzso in the zzso zzso seem important for the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso system is able to reduce zzso and zzso zzso with reduced zzso in human zzso Hence our study indicates that reduced zzso shields the healthy zzso against zzso by zzso bacteria and opportunistic zzso zzso an intimate interplay between zzso and innate immune zzso seems crucial for an effective barrier protecting human zzso
