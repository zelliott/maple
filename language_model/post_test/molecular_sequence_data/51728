zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is recognized by B and T cells from zzso zzso To identify helper T cell sites on the zzso 15 overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the entire zzso zzso were tested for their ability to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from animals zzso with peptides 6, 8, 9, 13, and 14, corresponding to zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, showed strong and specific responses to the zzso zzso while only those zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso with peptides 8, 9, 13, and 14 proliferated in response to zzso These results suggest the existence of at least two T cell zzso zzso zzso cells from infected zzso also responded to these peptides and to zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso cells, zzso cells from zzso animals failed to mount significant responses to any of the peptides or to zzso zzso T cell responsiveness was restored upon removal of nylon zzso adherent cells, suggesting active regulation of zzso zzso In zzso competitive zzso zzso peptides 1 zzso zzso and 6 zzso blocked zzso binding and, therefore, these regions contain zzso zzso zzso This model system should prove useful for analyzing regulation of zzso responses in experimental zzso
