The zzso zzso zzso has less than 50% coding capacity and zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that some zzso are zzso zzso defining zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso should increase our understanding of their impact on zzso zzso zzso 

Gene expression analysis identified transcripts from zzso of all zzso zzso genes including 57% of all zzso and zzso of all zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were randomly distributed throughout the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso of transcribed zzso with transcribed zzso within or exclusive of zzso zzso 2) the paucity of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso between transcribed zzso and downstream zzso and 3) predicted zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso transcripts included the lack of both zzso start zzso and strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contained multiple zzso stop zzso and high zzso ratios, compared to that of zzso in zzso tuberculosis and zzso in zzso zzso A zzso transcript containing an active promoter, strong zzso site, a start zzso but containing two in frame stop zzso yielded a protein product when expressed in zzso zzso 

zzso half of zzso zzso zzso consists of inactive gene products consuming energy and resources without potential benefit to zzso zzso zzso it is unclear what additional zzso zzso this large number of inactive zzso has on the functional capability of this zzso zzso of these zzso may play an important role in overall energy consumption and zzso zzso characteristics of zzso zzso However, this study also demonstrated that multiple zzso zzso mechanisms are present, reducing additional energy and resource expenditure required for protein production from the vast majority of these zzso
