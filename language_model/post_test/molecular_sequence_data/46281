zzso is a member of the TIM zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso family, which plays an important role in zzso responses and zzso zzso In this study, we cloned and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed little expression of zzso zzso in muscle and stomach, low expression in zzso brain, stomach and muscle, moderate expression in liver, small zzso and zzso and high expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso fusion protein was found to zzso on the cell zzso or zzso Association analysis indicated that the zzso zzso in zzso was significantly associated zzso zzso zzso with red blood cell count mean zzso zzso packed cell volume, zzso percentage and zzso zzso In conclusion, our results provide some information for conducting further studies on the functions of zzso zzso gene in type I diabetes and suggest that zzso zzso in zzso may be zzso as a marker for zzso selection in animal zzso
