Early in the zzso period of zzso zzso first observed the phenomenon of zzso in zzso when he noticed that the bread mold zzso grew as a zzso mold zzso on the surface of broth cultures but at the bottom of the flask where the environment was zzso it reproduced as budding zzso zzso Several infectious zzso pathogens of humans, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso change from a zzso zzso form to an zzso zzso when they invade zzso The ability of zzso zzso to assume a different shape is referred to as zzso This phenomenon has intrigued zzso and medical zzso since its discovery at the turn of the zzso The ability of pathogens to initiate infection, invade host zzso and survive in zzso hosts is critically linked to the induction of specific gene zzso In zzso zzso zzso regulated gene expression is particularly important, since they may exist in zzso distinct hosts with different body zzso Using zzso zzso as a model to study zzso interactions at the zzso and molecular level, my laboratory has attempted to relate the clinical spectrum of disease to natural variations in the characteristics of this zzso and to adaptations it must make as a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso a respiratory infection that is zzso in zzso As a zzso in soil it is zzso but it becomes a budding zzso as a zzso in susceptible zzso These zzso zzso can be zzso reproduced in zzso by shifting the temperature from 25 degrees C, at which it is zzso to 37 degrees C, when it becomes a budding zzso The process of zzso conversion is of particular interest since it is triggered by an increase in temperature and conversion to zzso zzso zzso fragments and zzso become airborne and enter the pulmonary tract by inhalation after which the fungus rapidly disseminates to other zzso Progressive zzso zzso along with zzso zzso and invasive zzso are opportunistic zzso infections in patients who are zzso or otherwise zzso zzso they are diagnostic hallmarks of acquired zzso disease syndrome zzso The clinical features of these infections and the genetic characteristics of the zzso agents present unique zzso interactions that make them valuable research models to zzso In the infected host, zzso zzso encounters various environmental stresses to which it adapts by regulating the expression of specific zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
