We isolated and characterized two rice zzso zzso and zzso that zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences showed high zzso of these genes to known zzso zzso A transient expression zzso using green fluorescent protein indicated that the zzso proteins were localized to zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated by reverse zzso experiments and zzso analysis that zzso expression occurred at an early stage of leaf development, prior to the transcript zzso of the genes that were transcribed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso rice zzso zzso showed a zzso between zzso protein zzso and the level of transcripts of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is regulated by a process after transcription, and is affected by the zzso state of zzso zzso
