zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity were identified by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strongly involved in both zzso and zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were moderately involved in both zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mainly affected zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso had weak effects on zzso The decrease in the activities of the zzso was reflected by an increase in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso mainly affected zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the recognition of the zzso group of zzso These results indicate that zzso acid zzso involved in both zzso and zzso or solely in zzso are located in the zzso zzso and the zzso side of zzso zzso whereas zzso involved in zzso were located in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso group of zzso seemed to be important for zzso and zzso because both were inhibited by the existence of zzso zzso or zzso together with zzso The relative zzso of 12 zzso segments was determined by inserting zzso zzso at various sites and measuring the degree of zzso of transport through zzso with zzso The results suggest that a zzso cavity is formed by the zzso segments II, III, IV, zzso zzso X, zzso and zzso
