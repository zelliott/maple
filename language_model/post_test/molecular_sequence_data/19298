zzso virus zzso is a promising vehicle for gene therapy, which will rely on the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, numerous zzso protocols can involve challenging zzso or zzso issues, and most zzso zzso do not bind zzso or zzso acid, used for zzso or zzso zzso requiring the development of new zzso zzso zzso metal affinity zzso zzso allows for robust protein zzso via affinity tags such as the zzso zzso zzso Through the combination of a diverse zzso library and rational zzso zzso we have located an optimal zzso tag zzso site within the viral zzso This zzso and a related zzso zzso can be zzso from clarified cell zzso in a single gravity column step at infectious particle yields exceeding zzso Furthermore, injection of zzso zzso into the brain demonstrates that it mediates zzso gene delivery in zzso equivalent to that of zzso zzso with minimal immune cell zzso This affinity zzso method may offer advantages in ease of zzso final zzso zzso and process zzso Moreover, a combined rational design and zzso library selection approach can aid in the design of enhanced viral gene delivery zzso
