A system has been established allowing the rescue of replicating zzso viruses zzso from cloned zzso On one hand, plasmids were constructed from which zzso zzso zzso with the correct zzso are transcribed by zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, helper cells derived from the human embryonic kidney zzso cell line were generated zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso of the helper cells with the zzso zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso the zzso zzso under direction of a zzso promoter led to formation of zzso from which zzso were easily zzso A genetic tag zzso three zzso changes was present in the progeny zzso As a first application of reverse zzso a segment of 504 zzso from the zzso zzso region of the fusion gene was deleted, leading to an zzso zzso whose replication zzso in zzso cells was indistinguishable from that of the laboratory zzso B zzso Since no helper virus is involved, this system, in principle, should be zzso to the rescue of any member of the large virus order zzso zzso viruses with a zzso zzso zzso zzso
