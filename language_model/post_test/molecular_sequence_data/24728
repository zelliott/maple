zzso is a steroid hormone playing critical roles in zzso processes such as sexual differentiation and development, female and male zzso zzso and bone zzso Numerous natural and synthetic environmental compounds have been shown capable of zzso zzso This area has been the focus of significant fundamental and applied research due both to the potential zzso effects of these compounds upon normal zzso processes and to the potential beneficial effects of zzso zzso zzso for the prevention and treatment of numerous zzso zzso effects of the active form of estrogen, zzso are zzso through at least two members of the steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta zzso At the time of this work, the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso had been zzso however, coordinates of the zzso were not publicly zzso Based upon the significant structural conservation across members of the steroid hormone zzso family, and the high sequence zzso between zzso and zzso zzso we have developed a zzso model of the zzso zzso Using the crystal structure of zzso and the zzso model of zzso we demonstrate a strong correlation between zzso values of the zzso and published values of the observed relative binding affinity zzso for a variety of compounds for both zzso as well as the ability to identify zzso zzso selective zzso Furthermore, using the recently available crystal structure of zzso for comparison purposes, we show that not only is the predicted zzso model structurally accurate, but that it can be used to assess zzso binding zzso
