To identify the zzso target of zzso in serum samples from patients with zzso progressive, bilateral zzso hearing zzso 

To purify target protein from zzso extracts using gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso and to transfer to zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso with zzso and zzso fragments were separated by zzso liquid zzso 

One fraction obtained by zzso liquid zzso contained a zzso of zzso molecular zzso The sequence of a stretch of 22 zzso acids within this zzso was identical to that of zzso acids zzso through zzso of heat shock protein 70 zzso On Western zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso (but capable of recognizing both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reacted with the zzso zzso zzso We compared the zzso of serum samples from six patients with zzso progressive, bilateral zzso hearing loss, as well as zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso with zzso zzso The pattern obtained suggested that patient zzso are zzso directed at zzso 

The target of zzso in serum samples from patients with zzso progressive, bilateral zzso hearing loss is zzso
