Earlier, we discovered that the global regulator, zzso is related to cell death in zzso and regulates cryptic zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by inducing zzso genes and by reducing zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that is important for rescuing stalled zzso contains an attachment site for zzso and is shown here to be required for zzso zzso These zzso impact zzso development, as the deletion of 35 genes individually of zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso formation up to zzso and five genes decrease zzso formation up to zzso In addition, zzso zzso during early zzso development but not in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso was detected at all the zzso stages for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to a zzso region devoid of zzso and to the formation of a zzso circle (which is zzso These results were zzso by a zzso analysis that showed that complete loss of zzso activated the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of key zzso in the zzso acid cycle and of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso also results in the expression of cell zzso genes that reduce cell viability (for example, zzso zzso and zzso zzso defective zzso are involved in host physiology through zzso and in zzso formation by generating a diversified population with specialized functions in terms of zzso and zzso zzso
