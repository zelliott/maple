The zzso zzso zzso zzso has distinctive sequence features that suggest it is a novel zzso Among known human zzso zzso and zzso are the two most closely related to zzso We have recently cloned the human zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso coding region is more distant from both human zzso and zzso than is zzso zzso the zzso with greatest sequence similarity to zzso Human zzso and zzso have very high zzso similarity in zzso as well as coding zzso which suggests that these genes are the result of an zzso recent gene zzso zzso If this zzso occurred during zzso evolution, then zzso species may have only a single zzso corresponding to this pair of human zzso This example shows that a zzso genetic correspondence does not necessarily exist between all the zzso genes in two different zzso These observations may have important implications for other zzso that belong to clusters of closely related zzso
