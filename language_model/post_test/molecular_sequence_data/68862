Among the techniques available for the detection of protein structure zzso such as single point zzso zzso zzso mapping plays a key role zzso to the high zzso of zzso retention times, determined as identity zzso Because of the possible zzso of some zzso fragments, an improvement of the array of information given by the technique can be achieved by setting up a series of experiments under zzso conditions with different zzso followed by appropriate zzso zzso zzso Such an experimental approach appears to be particularly useful in the examination of proteins with a high molecular weight, where the resulting zzso maps are zzso Therefore different zzso zzso mapping methods have been studied for zzso human zzso zzso a zzso agent of apparent molecular weight of 46 zzso The zzso maps indicate that the methods developed are not only suitable for the qualitative control of the zzso acid sequence and arrangement of zzso bonds but also represent the first demonstration of the identity of the primary structure of the zzso and of the native species, within the limits of the zzso
