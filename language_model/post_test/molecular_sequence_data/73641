The gene zzso zzso zzso is necessary for normal zzso bundling and zzso within zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein and two human zzso identified as expressed sequence tags are not similar to previously characterized proteins and thus represent a new protein zzso At least one of these human zzso can function in zzso zzso suggesting that it, like zzso acts in zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso which is found in cell bodies and processes of all zzso throughout development, either has a structural role in the formation and maintenance of zzso zzso or zzso signals to the zzso machinery that regulates zzso extension and zzso
