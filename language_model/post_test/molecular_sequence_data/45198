zzso analyses have previously revealed that a gene zzso the putative zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is one of the major targets of the zzso regulator zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso was further investigated with respect to both transport activity as well as zzso zzso zzso is required for optimal growth in media containing free zzso acids as the only zzso acid zzso zzso acid transport studies showed that zzso encodes a secondary zzso acid transport system that is specific for zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso which is in disagreement with its previously proposed function (a zzso zzso acid zzso which was assigned based on zzso We propose to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is a member of a group of zzso transport systems, as zzso are widely distributed among zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the loss of most of the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso indicating that zzso is the major zzso carrier of this zzso zzso of zzso together with a second zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso further reduced the viability of the zzso DNA zzso analysis showed that deletion of zzso predominantly affects genes belonging to the zzso of the zzso regulator zzso which is involved in global nitrogen metabolism and needs zzso for its zzso and of zzso which is involved in sulfur zzso acid zzso
