The blast fungus zzso zzso one of the most devastating rice pathogens in the world, shows zzso zzso We have developed a strategy for creating disease resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso 1, a zzso protein from zzso zzso occurs in transgenic rice zzso The gene that encodes zzso 1, fused to the sequence for a zzso signal zzso derived from rice zzso zzso was connected to the zzso mosaic virus zzso promoter, and the zzso construct was introduced into zzso The zzso 1 was accumulated at levels of zzso of total soluble leaf proteins in the transgenic rice and it was localized in the zzso space of rice zzso The zzso 1 zzso from the transgenic rice was active, it bound to zzso and inhibited in zzso growth of zzso zzso by causing zzso zzso The transgenic rice plants showed a significant resistance to zzso zzso This study shows the possibility of a new strategy to engineer disease resistance in higher plants by taking advantage of a zzso zzso
