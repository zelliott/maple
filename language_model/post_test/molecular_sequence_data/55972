zzso contains a zzso protein complex consisting of 186 zzso fiber protein that mediates high affinity virus attachment to cells and a 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains five zzso zzso zzso a role for zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 promote viral infection in a novel way since zzso against these receptors or soluble zzso base block virus zzso without affecting zzso Moreover, zzso binds to cultured cells lacking alpha v zzso but fail to become zzso thus restricting infection of these zzso zzso of alpha zzso cells with a zzso zzso alpha v results in the expression of zzso alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 and allows virus zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso attachment and zzso into cells are separate but cooperative events that result from the interaction of distinct viral coat proteins with a zzso for attachment and alpha v zzso receptors for zzso
