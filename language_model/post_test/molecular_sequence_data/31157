zzso coli strains producing a hybrid zzso containing zzso hormone zzso and protein A of zzso zzso was zzso The sequence coding for zzso was obtained from the bovine zzso zzso and, after the modification of the zzso and zzso parts, was linked with the protein A gene and its derivatives due to synthetic zzso Three forms of zzso zzso coding this hormone with differing zzso zzso acid were used to construct the fusion zzso The hybrid proteins contain zzso or zzso sequences for obtaining zzso by acid or zzso treatment, zzso It is shown that each of the constructed plasmids direct the synthesis of hybrid protein in zzso zzso This protein was zzso by the use of zzso The level of the expression of the hybrid protein is 4 zzso of the bacterial zzso Most of the zzso protein is zzso into the zzso zzso
