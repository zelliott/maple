Nearly half of zzso individuals in African populations have a zzso of zzso other than the zzso zzso We have isolated the common African zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso B cell lines and have established stable class I reduced zzso expressing these zzso We have studied the zzso binding and presentation properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by a combination of zzso zzso direct binding of labeled synthetic zzso studying the ability of zzso zzso T zzso to recognize zzso cells, and sequencing zzso pools and individual zzso zzso from zzso We find that zzso peptides can also bind to zzso but do not bind strongly to the other zzso in this zzso We show that some zzso T zzso can recognize all zzso capable of binding an zzso zzso whereas others are zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides reveals that zzso has a similar zzso motif to zzso but that zzso zzso and zzso have different zzso These data strongly support a model in which zzso 9 zzso or zzso of the zzso molecules is a critical factor in determining the specificity of the B pocket of the major zzso complex and the position 2 anchor zzso of associated zzso We conclude that a zzso acid difference in the major zzso complex can be sufficient to cause a dramatic change in the nature of bound zzso zzso that individuals with closely related zzso zzso may present very different zzso of zzso peptides to T cells in an immune zzso It is likely to be a general phenomenon that very similar class I zzso will behave as functionally distinct zzso zzso
