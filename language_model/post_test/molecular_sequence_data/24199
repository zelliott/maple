The zzso zzso zzso system in zzso has been proposed to be controlled by two genes located in the S zzso zzso and a recently described zzso expressed S zzso specific zzso gene zzso However, in apricot zzso zzso zzso these genes had not been identified zzso We have zzso 21 zzso in total of the S zzso region in 3 different apricot S zzso These fragments contain genes zzso to the zzso and zzso genes found in other zzso species, preserving their basic gene structure features and defined zzso acid zzso The physical distance between the zzso and the zzso genes was determined exactly in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso approximately in the S zzso zzso 49 zzso confirming that these genes are zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso regions indicates the presence of a zzso region upstream of the putative zzso box in the zzso zzso The three identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had a high zzso sequence diversity zzso zzso acid zzso and the apricot zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also highly zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was also zzso revealing that zzso and zzso are expressed in style zzso but not in zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso are only expressed in zzso but not in styles or zzso Taken together, these results support these genes as candidates for the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
