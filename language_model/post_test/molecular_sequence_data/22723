zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso is usually diagnosed by specific zzso testing and/or identification of zzso However, zzso zzso and at least six other zzso can produce canine zzso with negative zzso zzso zzso zzso these can be of clinical zzso To resolve zzso diagnoses by two diagnostic laboratories in an zzso zzso dog recently imported into the US from Europe we developed a simple molecular method of identifying different zzso and subsequently validated our method against six different zzso known to zzso dogs by amplifying zzso DNA zzso sequences by zzso chain reaction using common and zzso zzso and sequencing the products to confirm the zzso of the zzso We identified the zzso in this dog as zzso zzso This is the first case of zzso zzso infection in the United zzso Additionally, we examined zzso from five additional zzso zzso dogs and successfully identified the infecting zzso in each zzso Our diagnoses differed from the initial zzso diagnosis in three of these cases, demonstrating the inaccuracy of zzso zzso In each case, zzso identified zzso as zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso by molecular zzso Finally, we demonstrated that our zzso method should amplify DNA from at least two additional zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that this method may be suitable for zzso all members of the family zzso
