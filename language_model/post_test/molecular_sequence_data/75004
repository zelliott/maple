zzso cell contacts in the immune system are strengthened by zzso zzso zzso in part by zzso associated zzso zzso The zzso zzso is widely expressed on cells of zzso origin and is a major zzso of T cells, B cells and zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso reactions underlying zzso zzso formation, helper zzso zzso and zzso killing by natural killer cells and zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been defined as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso block T zzso zzso to zzso and zzso cells and disrupt the interaction between zzso T cells and target zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso into artificial zzso binds zzso zzso zzso is found on zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells and its expression is regulated by inflammatory zzso zzso has been placed in the zzso family of cell surface receptors by virtue of the high sequence similarity between the zzso and zzso beta zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso family are zzso bearing the zzso zzso sequence zzso for example, zzso zzso zzso and von zzso zzso Here we show that a complementary DNA clone zzso contains no zzso zzso but instead is zzso to the neural cell zzso zzso zzso
