zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso previously designated zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using nomenclature of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gonzalez, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso Levin, zzso zzso Phillips, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso Using zzso directed against zzso zzso its zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso we cloned the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Similar information about the zzso zzso protein confirmed that a gene cloned by zzso to the zzso gene was the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes were expressed in zzso coli, DNA for both genes was zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences were compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso contain several regions of strong similarity with the zzso acid sequence of zzso primarily in regions of the protein responsible for attachment and coordination of the zzso prosthetic zzso
