zzso virus zzso expresses at least 3 proteins from the zzso zzso zzso Alternative translation initiation directs synthesis of the C protein from the zzso reading frame, while so-called zzso editing generates a second population of zzso which express the V protein from the zzso reading frame which lies within and zzso the larger P reading zzso While the P protein has been demonstrated to be an essential zzso for the L protein in the formation of active zzso complexes, the functions of the V and C proteins remain zzso In order to investigate these functions, we have expressed the zzso zzso V and C proteins as zzso zzso in zzso coli for affinity zzso and use in an in zzso binding zzso with other viral and cellular zzso The P protein was found to interact with zzso zzso and with zzso These interactions were mapped to the zzso half of the protein which is absent in the V zzso In contrast, both the V and C proteins failed to interact with any other viral zzso but were each found to interact specifically with one or more cellular zzso zzso aspects of these results were confirmed in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that the V and C proteins may be involved in zzso of the host cellular environment within zzso zzso Such activity would be distinct from their previously proposed role in the possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
