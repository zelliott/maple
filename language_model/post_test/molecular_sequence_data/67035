zzso sequences have been identified in many zzso zzso and in environmental samples, and they constitute a family of proteins that are structural zzso of the zzso core zzso Most zzso zzso conform to the single zzso structural models that have been zzso but a few zzso zzso exhibit short zzso additional zzso or zzso zzso of these structural variations offers clues to the steps that might have occurred during the evolution and specialization of zzso core zzso
