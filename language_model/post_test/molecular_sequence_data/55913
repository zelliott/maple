zzso is the principle regulator of zzso and other blood zzso zzso It is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso locus has been completed, revealing a gene spanning zzso base pairs from the zzso start site to the zzso addition zzso Nine complete and one partial zzso repeat elements were identified within the zzso of the zzso with all but one zzso in the reverse zzso zzso zzso of zzso is associated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso genes in an individual with type I zzso zzso identified an zzso deletion in one zzso zzso of the deletion zzso involved restriction analysis and direct sequencing of amplified DNA spanning the deletion zzso The deletion removed zzso base pairs, affecting zzso 5 and zzso zzso with the deletion ends contained within the left components of two zzso zzso It is zzso therefore, that the deletion arose by zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso
