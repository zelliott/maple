We have cloned a novel unconventional zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso analysis of the motor domain indicated that zzso does not belong to any known zzso of the zzso zzso Following the motor domain, two zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso region, and a zzso zzso and zzso domain, lies a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These are zzso in zzso zzso exchange factors zzso We have identified for the first time the zzso domain in the zzso zzso The growth and terminal zzso zzso of zzso cells were not affected by the zzso zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso however, accumulated at zzso projections and zzso of phase zzso zzso in growing cells, suggesting its possible roles in zzso
