Many zzso from wild type mice express zzso zzso zzso activity and contain two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that zzso a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice lack zzso zzso zzso activity but express zzso and zzso zzso that zzso with wild type zzso zzso zzso and are induced in liver by a zzso zzso zzso To investigate the basis of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso library was constructed using zzso from the zzso of induced zzso zzso mice as a zzso A zzso zzso with a zzso insert was isolated by screening with wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso insert exhibited an zzso zzso zzso restriction pattern and was subjected to sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an internal zzso duplicated sequence that zzso to zzso zzso in the coding region of wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Rubin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame is retained throughout the duplicated zzso The discovery of a zzso zzso zzso accounts for the increased size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggests that a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is 19 zzso larger than the wild type zzso might be found in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis disclosed that zzso zzso liver zzso contains an zzso protein that is recognized by zzso zzso zzso Under stringent conditions, an zzso zzso that spans the abnormal junction between the reiterated sequences zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but failed to form stable complexes with wild type zzso zzso zzso Thus, both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain the zzso deduced from zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso might originate from an unequal crossover between zzso regions of two different zzso in the zzso zzso zzso thereby causing the zzso of one or more zzso
