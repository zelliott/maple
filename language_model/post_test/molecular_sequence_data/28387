The zzso zzso of zzso coli is zzso by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are zzso genes in the zzso zzso They are expressed from the zzso promoter, which also expresses the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Strategies have now been devised for the zzso zzso and independent expression of the zzso zzso zzso 2 beta 2 zzso and the individual zzso These involve zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso promoter in zzso and zzso precise zzso of the zzso coding regions with the efficient zzso zzso site and expression from the zzso zzso promoters in the zzso zzso zzso zzso specific activities were amplified zzso within 5 h of zzso of the zzso zzso and the alpha and beta zzso accounted for almost zzso of the protein in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of potential zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso beta and zzso beta are essential zzso in the zzso whereas zzso beta could be replaced by zzso without zzso the zzso No activity was detected after the zzso zzso at the zzso site of the zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso but this zzso seemed to have a deleterious effect on the zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of an unidentified gene zzso that is adjacent to the zzso zzso was defined by extending the sequence of the zzso acid cycle gene cluster by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This gene zzso on the zzso zzso and encodes a product zzso that contains 230 zzso acids (Mr zzso zzso significant similarities were detected between the zzso region of zzso and those of zzso zzso product of another unidentified gene zzso located upstream of the zzso zzso and zzso (a putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso roles for zzso and zzso as zzso regulators of the adjacent zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso complexes are zzso
