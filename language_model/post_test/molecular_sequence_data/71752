Human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are related members of the human zzso gene zzso The genes for zzso and zzso are expressed predominately in the zzso are zzso zzso by zzso and share zzso zzso Previously, one functional zzso response element was identified within the zzso promoter zzso to zzso relative to the cap zzso of the zzso zzso To detect additional upstream regulatory zzso the zzso zzso between the zzso gene and zzso to the zzso gene were amplified by zzso and linked to a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso experiments showed an zzso zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso increased zzso expression zzso in the presence of the testosterone analogue zzso The zzso zzso contains an zzso response element that lost activity when zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated activity in zzso zzso cells whereas the zzso was inactive in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso to drive the zzso genes of zzso type 5 zzso created an attenuated replication competent zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso which replicates similarly to zzso zzso in prostate tumor cells but is attenuated in zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso an zzso zzso containing the previously cloned zzso zzso (to drive the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso (to drive the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso is significantly attenuated and has a high therapeutic index with a cell specificity of zzso for zzso zzso cells, compared to zzso cancer zzso cells and zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso is also highly attenuated in primary human zzso zzso zzso
