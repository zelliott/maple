Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso classified as zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso line exhibit characteristic sequence differences in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso were zzso as zzso or zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso all four zzso viruses induced large zzso 4 to 8 days zzso in a panel of five primary zzso zzso lines (including two zzso generated from the peripheral blood of normal donors by exposure to infectious zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The primary zzso lines yielded neither zzso zzso nor infectious zzso by zzso analysis or exhaustive zzso with zzso blast zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were biologically cloned and retained their zzso or zzso zzso in zzso and primary zzso zzso The biologically cloned zzso DNA was also used to clone and sequence the relevant V2 and zzso regions of the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the V2 and zzso regions were characteristic of patterns already reported for the zzso switch zzso and zzso zzso zzso This evidence zzso the possibility that these results were due to contamination of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso The results unequivocally indicate that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells may actively induce zzso in cloned zzso T cells in zzso and support the view that direct zzso effects may contribute to the steady decline in zzso T cells in zzso zzso patients without zzso zzso zzso
