Using a combination of zzso and zzso chain reaction with zzso primer zzso we have identified in a volunteer bone zzso donor a new zzso class I zzso within the zzso zzso This human zzso zzso zzso zzso was typed as zzso by zzso whereas the zzso zzso was identified by zzso A family study confirmed the zzso segregation of this blank zzso identified on one of the maternal zzso transmitted to her zzso The DNA sequence of zzso now referred to as zzso performed from the promoter region to the 3' untranslated region revealed a single zzso difference zzso compared to zzso at the end of zzso 4 in the zzso zzso This zzso leads to an incorrect zzso characterized by the deletion of zzso 5 that encodes the zzso domain of the zzso zzso Indeed, full-length complementary DNA sequencing revealed a complete absence of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso analysis confirmed the absence of expression of zzso on the cell surface in the zzso compared to the zzso positive zzso The zzso focusing analysis failed to reveal the presence of an zzso zzso in the zzso showing that no normal zzso zzso was zzso The new zzso zzso is a soluble form of zzso without any zzso zzso zzso It can thus be considered as a soluble zzso a form apparently inactive and unfit for zzso zzso
