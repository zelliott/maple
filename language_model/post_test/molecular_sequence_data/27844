We wish to determine whether differences in translation rate are correlated with differences in zzso usage or with differences in zzso secondary zzso We therefore inserted a small DNA zzso in the zzso gene either directly or flanked by a few zzso zzso leaving the reading frame of the zzso gene zzso The zzso was chosen to have zzso zzso in one reading frame and zzso zzso in the zzso The insert in these zzso does not seem to give zzso that are able to form extensive secondary zzso The translation time for these modified zzso zzso was measured with a zzso better than plus or minus one zzso We found that the zzso with zzso zzso inserted has an approximately zzso longer translation time than the one with common zzso In another set of experiments we constructed two almost identical zzso genes in which the zzso zzso have the potential to generate stem structures with zzso of about zzso zzso In this way we could investigate the influence of zzso structure on translation zzso This type of modified gene was generated in two reading frames with either common or zzso zzso similar to our first zzso We find that the yield of protein from these zzso is reduced, probably due to the action in zzso of an zzso Nevertheless, the data do not indicate that there is any effect of zzso secondary structure on translation zzso In contrast, our data persuade us that there is a difference in translation rate between zzso zzso and common zzso that is of the order of zzso
