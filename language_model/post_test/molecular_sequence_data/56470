zzso are a family of cell surface zzso that promote cell zzso The zzso alpha V beta 3, zzso zzso is a major zzso expressed by zzso To further investigate the role of alpha V beta 3 in cell zzso we generated and characterized zzso zzso to alpha V beta 3 by zzso zzso mice with zzso alpha V beta 3 zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a total of more than zzso positive cultures which bound alpha V beta 3, were characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognize the alpha V beta 3 complex whereas zzso zzso zzso with the beta zzso shared between the alpha V beta 3 complex and zzso Further zzso mapping using flow zzso analysis and zzso zzso of various zzso showed that zzso and zzso recognized distinct zzso zzso studies using zzso and zzso alpha V beta 3 demonstrated that all three zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso binding was blocked by zzso zzso and, less zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was without zzso All three zzso recognized zzso from human zzso zzso zzso also stained zzso from a wide range of nonhuman zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to a panel of cultured cell lines and various zzso In contrast, zzso zzso bound only zzso or not at all to zzso expressing alpha V beta 3 with the exception of zzso Thus, zzso zzso showed a very narrow tissue specificity being restricted to high-level expression on human zzso
