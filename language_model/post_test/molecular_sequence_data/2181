The zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was determined by automated zzso degradation and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and by sequence analyses of peptides produced with zzso zzso zzso and with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso consists of 122 zzso acid zzso including the zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is very similar to those of toxic zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from snake zzso The zzso responsible for the toxic activity of the zzso zzso are zzso
