The promoters of zzso and zzso zzso small nuclear zzso genes are structurally zzso although both are recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have exclusively upstream zzso while the zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has internal and downstream promoter elements that match the zzso gene zzso A- and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso A or B block greatly diminished zzso zzso zzso in zzso and a zzso extract competent for zzso zzso III zzso generated nearly identical zzso I protection patterns over the zzso downstream B block and a zzso gene zzso B zzso We conclude that the zzso promoter is functionally similar to zzso gene zzso although the effects of zzso deletion zzso suggest that the downstream location of the zzso B block zzso unique zzso constraints on its zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have an upstream zzso box element not normally found in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso box altered the site of zzso initiation in zzso while substitution of sequences further upstream had no effect on zzso zzso We present a model for the zzso zzso complex that explains these results in terms of their effects on the binding of zzso initiation factor zzso
