The zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso is essential for cellular proliferation and zzso and thus there exists great interest to develop specific and selective zzso of this zzso Whereas small zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been used to study zzso zzso zzso their target selectivity has been questioned zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with other protein zzso prompted us to develop zzso selective zzso zzso of zzso zzso Based on a zzso zzso we developed zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The inclusion of either an zzso zzso or a zzso zzso sequence facilitated the cellular zzso of the zzso inhibitor and prevented zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells or nerve growth zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso peptides inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso activity of zzso The peptides did not have an zzso effect on the activity of two other closely related classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso Thus, these peptides may serve as valuable tools for investigating zzso zzso and for selective investigation of zzso zzso With the knowledge of other zzso interacting zzso it would be possible to design zzso zzso for investigating diverse cellular signaling mechanisms and for possible therapeutic zzso
