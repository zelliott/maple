zzso zzso systems display the ability to transport a variety of structurally unrelated drugs from a cell and consequently are capable of zzso resistance to a diverse range of zzso zzso This review examines zzso zzso systems which use the zzso motive force to drive drug zzso These proteins are likely to operate as zzso zzso and have been identified in both zzso and zzso Such zzso zzso zzso proteins belong to three distinct families or zzso of transport zzso the major zzso zzso zzso the small zzso resistance zzso family, and the zzso zzso division zzso zzso The MFS consists of zzso zzso and zzso with either 12 or 14 zzso segments zzso and we show that within the zzso three separate families include various zzso zzso zzso The zzso family consists of proteins with four zzso and the zzso zzso proteins within this family are the smallest known secondary zzso The zzso family consists of zzso transport proteins and includes a number of zzso zzso proteins with particularly broad zzso zzso In zzso bacteria, some zzso zzso systems require two auxiliary constituents, which might enable drug transport to occur across both zzso of the cell zzso These auxiliary constituents belong to the membrane fusion protein and the outer membrane factor families, zzso This review examines in detail each of the characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular basis of the broad zzso specificity of these zzso is zzso The surprisingly wide distribution of zzso zzso systems and their zzso in single organisms, with zzso coli, for instance, possessing at least nine zzso zzso zzso systems with overlapping zzso is zzso We also discuss whether the normal zzso role of the zzso zzso systems is to protect the cell from toxic compounds or whether they zzso primary functions unrelated to drug resistance and only zzso multiple drugs zzso or zzso
