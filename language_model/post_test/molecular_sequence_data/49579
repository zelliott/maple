zzso zzso is the major protein involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso which plays an important role on the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso We investigated deletion in zzso and zzso zzso genes with the objective of diagnosis of zzso As a result, zzso deletion of a repeat site in zzso 2 of the zzso zzso gene was zzso The repeat zzso zzso protein was also detected together with zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso patients who were diagnosed as having the zzso deletion of a repeat site in zzso 2 of the zzso zzso zzso However, the deletion was found not only in male zzso patients but also in fertile zzso The deletion frequency was zzso in zzso patients and zzso in fertile zzso The deletion was found to have no effect on zzso volume, zzso hormone concentration and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso the repeat zzso and active zzso zzso proteins were produced in zzso zzso zzso cells and their seminal plasma zzso inhibitor zzso activities were zzso The repeat zzso zzso had similar zzso activity to the zzso zzso while the active zzso zzso had almost lost zzso zzso In conclusion, the deletion of a repeat site in the zzso zzso gene found in zzso patients and fertile men does not affect zzso quality and male zzso
