zzso zzso is known to be of significance as opportunistic pathogen as well as a source of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains have been isolated from zzso soil, clinical material, aquatic zzso but little is known about zzso strains recovered from marine zzso During a survey of the zzso of zzso bacteria associated with zzso zzso six zzso strains were isolated from zzso sea urchin, and zzso specimens collected from differing Pacific areas, including the zzso Sea, the zzso Sea and the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis confirmed an assignment of marine zzso to the zzso zzso as it placed four strains into the zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster and two related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with a number of common characteristics typical of zzso zzso and zzso zzso marine zzso exhibited differences in zzso a zzso zzso a range of temperatures, which supported their growth, zzso zzso pattern, and antibiotics zzso zzso displayed zzso and remarkable zzso activity against a number of zzso cultures and zzso zzso but very weak or none against zzso zzso This is the first report on isolation, zzso characterization and zzso activity of zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso
