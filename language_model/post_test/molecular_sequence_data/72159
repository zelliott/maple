We have identified two closely related human proteins zzso and zzso that are zzso to the small zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses demonstrate that the products of both the zzso and zzso genes are expressed in a wide variety of zzso and cell zzso zzso and zzso are components of a large complex, named zzso that also contains proteins of apparent molecular masses of 47, 140 and 160 zzso In zzso cells, the 47 zzso protein most likely zzso to the medium chain zzso zzso and the 140 zzso protein is a zzso of the zzso protein zzso Like other members of the zzso family, the zzso chain is capable of interacting with the zzso sorting signal zzso from zzso zzso zzso analyses show that the zzso complex is present both in the area of the zzso and in peripheral structures, some of which contain the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso chains are components of a novel, ubiquitous zzso complex involved in the recognition of zzso sorting zzso
