Three novel zzso have been recently zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their role in human pathology is debated while tissue zzso and site of zzso remain zzso 

To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso and zzso zzso can zzso human zzso 

zzso zzso zzso from 91 patients affected by different zzso diseases were screened by zzso chain reaction to detect viral DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and evolutionary analysis of the identified zzso was carried zzso 

Of the 91 tested zzso 11 contained zzso DNA zzso 4 zzso DNA zzso 5 zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso identified in zzso fall into a zzso distinct from that containing zzso isolated from respiratory secretions, respiratory tissue and zzso Moreover, four positively selected sites zzso of zzso zzso were found under strong positive selection zzso with zzso probabilities above zzso All the sites were located in the zzso region of the small zzso zzso 

The results suggest that the novel zzso and zzso zzso can zzso human zzso Future studies are needed to define their role in zzso zzso
