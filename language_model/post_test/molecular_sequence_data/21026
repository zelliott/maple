zzso zzso plays a key role in the formation and degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal zzso on the stability of eight peptides previously identified in fermented milk with zzso zzso Two of these identified peptides with sequences zzso and zzso possess zzso activity in zzso and zzso activity in zzso The results showed that zzso was resistant to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was totally zzso and its activity decreased after incubation with zzso and a pancreatic zzso The zzso zzso was incubated with zzso and was found to be a true inhibitor of the zzso and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor zzso A zzso relationship study of this zzso was carried out by zzso several modified peptides related to the sequence zzso The substitution of zzso acid zzso in the penultimate position by zzso improved the zzso activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at zzso position by zzso increased the activity zzso with an zzso of zzso as low as zzso zzso
