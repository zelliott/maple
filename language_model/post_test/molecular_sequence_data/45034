zzso models of the zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso were constructed by means of a zzso zzso using bovine zzso as a zzso In order to validate the two models, a zzso analysis of selective zzso was carried zzso The study shows that zzso selectivity is mainly influenced by the different ability of the two receptors to give zzso zzso instead of giving different H zzso The binding site cavity of the zzso is smaller than that of the zzso and for this reason, less bulky zzso like zzso are able to give close interactions with the zzso unlike larger zzso such as zzso The different dimensions of the binding site cavity could be due to the presence of three zzso of zzso which cause a different zzso of the zzso thus zzso the side chain disposition inside the zzso zzso
