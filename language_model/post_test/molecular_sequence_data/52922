zzso A1 from zzso zzso zzso comprises an zzso zzso domain, two zzso type zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso In order to study the zzso properties and structure of the zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli using a zzso expression system and zzso by zzso affinity column zzso zzso zzso specifically bound to various forms of zzso zzso but not to other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso with zzso was not detected by means of nuclear magnetic resonance and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the presence of soluble zzso did not interfere with the binding of zzso to zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso recognizes a structure which is present in zzso or zzso zzso but not in zzso or in soluble derivatives of zzso zzso exhibited binding activity over a wide range of zzso and the binding activity was enhanced at zzso near its zzso and by the presence of zzso suggesting that the binding of zzso is zzso mainly by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by intact zzso A1 and by a deletion zzso lacking the zzso suggested that the zzso is not absolutely required for zzso of zzso zzso but greatly enhances the efficiency of zzso
