Recent studies have indicated that zzso Venezuelan zzso encephalitis zzso viruses can evolve from zzso zzso ID strains that circulate continuously in zzso tropical forests zzso zzso Powers, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso Sweeney, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso associated with the zzso changes leading to zzso we zzso the entire zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso virus strains isolated during a zzso Venezuelan outbreak and four zzso zzso ID zzso strains closely related to the predicted zzso zzso Analysis by zzso zzso methods revealed 25 zzso differences which were predicted to have accompanied the 1992 zzso zzso 7 of these zzso zzso acid changes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso envelope zzso and 2 were zzso in the 3' untranslated zzso zzso Comparisons with the zzso sequences of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso virus strains revealed that only one of the seven zzso acid changes associated with the 1992 zzso a zzso change at position 360 of the zzso zzso accompanied another zzso virus emergence zzso Two changes in the zzso envelope zzso region believed to include the major zzso zzso both involving replacement of zzso zzso with zzso are also candidates for zzso zzso
