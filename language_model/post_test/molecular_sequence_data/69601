zzso zzso strain zzso has a zzso zzso zzso that results in zzso sensitivity due to the zzso zzso of zzso This strain also carries the cam zzso which zzso zzso to zzso and, as shown here, to other zzso zzso of rat type IV zzso in these cells caused them to zzso to zzso zzso Treatment of the transformed zzso cells with zzso an zzso in humans and a potent inhibitor of type IV zzso reinstated sensitivity to heat zzso The zzso properties of deletion zzso of this zzso were determined, and an active zzso of minimum length was zzso zzso to zzso resistance was then used to select for zzso zzso zzso to the zzso effects of zzso Four zzso zzso zzso A3, and zzso were zzso Each carries a single point zzso two have zzso in the same zzso Each zzso showed distinct properties, based on analysis of their zzso zzso and zzso values for a variety of zzso zzso A5 had a reduced activity for zzso zzso A1 and A3 showed no change in zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed an increase in zzso For most zzso the drug resistance was confined to the class of drug used in the zzso This study shows that it is possible to recreate in zzso cells the zzso of zzso zzso to pharmacological zzso Our study also demonstrates that such systems can be used to select rare zzso useful in the analysis of zzso zzso
