The molecular zzso study of zzso B virus zzso in Indonesia is still zzso This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and to assess the association of zzso deletion zzso with liver disease progression in zzso zzso zzso were identified by direct zzso Of the 265 subjects, 32 samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of those zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso carrier, chronic zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso groups, zzso zzso analysis showed significant difference among them zzso In zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso were detected respectively in 3 zzso 4 zzso and 9 zzso of 17 zzso On the other hand, in zzso 12 of 15 samples zzso showed a zzso deletion zzso and only 2 samples zzso demonstrated a zzso deletion zzso These results suggest that in zzso deletion zzso tends to occur in zzso or zzso region, while in zzso the deletion zzso usually occurs in the zzso zzso Analysis of complete zzso of four viruses confirmed that 3 zzso were classified into zzso and 1 isolate was zzso However, zzso and zzso analyses showed that isolate zzso was an zzso zzso between zzso and zzso As conclusion, the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso was relatively low in Indonesian patients compared to those from Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian zzso There was a weak association between zzso deletion zzso and progressive liver zzso
