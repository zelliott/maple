Novel tools are necessary to explore proteins related to human zzso virus zzso zzso In this work, zzso and zzso technology were employed to examine plasma samples from zzso zzso Through comparative zzso analysis of normal and zzso plasma samples, 19 zzso expressed protein spots related to 12 zzso proteins were identified by zzso trap zzso Among these, the zzso zzso of zzso was found to be decreased in zzso patients while another zzso with a molecular weight of 40 zzso was zzso zzso reference gel and protein sequence comparisons of the zzso protein showed zzso with zzso minus the zzso and its identity was further confirmed by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso In all, our results showed that zzso and zzso are powerful tools for discovering proteins related to zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso of zzso found in the plasma of zzso individuals may prove to be a potentially useful zzso for zzso research according to zzso zzso
