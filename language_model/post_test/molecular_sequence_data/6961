zzso is a nuclear zzso attachment DNA zzso protein which is predominantly expressed in zzso This protein binds to the minor groove specifically recognizing an unusual DNA context exhibited by a specific zzso region with strong zzso zzso A zzso library displaying zzso random peptides without any built-in structure was used to identify a zzso binding motif of zzso One zzso zzso zzso C1 of zzso selected by a zzso column showed 50% identity with a segment in zzso zzso acids zzso Replacement of the C1 similarity segment in zzso by a random zzso acid sequence or its zzso resulted in more than zzso reduction in zzso zzso In contrast, replacement of the same zzso segment with the C1 zzso restored full zzso binding activity and specificity as the zzso zzso Single zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso to Ala greatly reduced zzso zzso Taken together our data show that a nine zzso acid sequence in zzso represents a key zzso binding zzso zzso display may provide a general tool for rapid identification of DNA binding zzso zzso
