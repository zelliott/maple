The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from laboratory strains of zzso zzso and in natural wild populations collected from the zzso locality zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found in the cells of the head, zzso and abdomen of this zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in the female zzso and are transmitted to the zzso zzso host, zzso zzso at each zzso of the female zzso The presence of the zzso zzso in all zzso zzso cells suggests that it is inherited by vertical zzso zzso is amplified in the host zzso during the zzso development of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Cell zzso due to amplification of the virus does not prevent the development of the zzso zzso zzso amplification appears to be slower in zzso zzso by zzso zzso than in zzso artificially infected with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells due to viral replication seems to be zzso with egg zzso and the development of the zzso zzso The features of zzso and its relationship with the zzso zzso zzso zzso during its development are compared to those of the zzso
