The objective of the work described here was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso zzso supports in high-speed zzso liquid zzso zzso of zzso This was done using a commercial zzso column with an zzso stationary phase and a zzso digest of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were operated at mobile phase zzso ranging from 1 zzso zzso zzso to 10 zzso zzso zzso There was little noticeable change over this flow rate range in either resolution, peak zzso volume, or zzso concentration in collected zzso It was concluded that zzso columns in this zzso zzso format would be particularly valuable in zzso zzso for zzso There was, however, a small, but zzso contamination of zzso at high mobile phase zzso with earlier zzso zzso Based on the fact that peak shape did not change at high mobile phase zzso it is suggested that this phenomena might be due to the presence of zzso zzso in structural equilibrium on the zzso zzso When zzso rate exceeds the rate of zzso zzso zzso could zzso as broadened or even separate zzso
