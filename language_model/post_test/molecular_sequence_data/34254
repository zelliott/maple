zzso zzso between a soluble curved structure and a zzso straight zzso zzso binding to zzso is required for zzso zzso but whether this triggers conversion into a zzso structure is still zzso This is due, at least in part, to the lack of structural data for zzso before zzso Here, we report zzso crystal structures of soluble zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso states in a complex with a zzso zzso The structures differ locally in the neighborhood of the zzso A loop movement in zzso zzso favors its recruitment to the ends of growing zzso and zzso its zzso transition, but this conversion has not proceeded zzso The data therefore argue for the zzso change toward the straight structure occurring as zzso contacts are zzso They also suggest a model for the way the zzso structure is modified in relation to zzso zzso
