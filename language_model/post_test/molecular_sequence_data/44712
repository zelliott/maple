Members of the zzso family of zzso have been shown to participate in many aspects of the signaling of cell growth and zzso Although the zzso properties of these zzso have been extensively zzso very little is known about their gene structure and zzso zzso a member related to zzso and zzso is activated at the zzso level in the zzso phase of zzso zzso As a first step toward the characterization of the regulatory elements involved in zzso zzso we isolated and determined the structure of the corresponding human locus zzso localized in zzso This is the first gene structure of a member of the zzso zzso At zzso with Ras and zzso zzso zzso contains a single zzso larger than 20 zzso that splits a zzso zzso zzso first zzso from the rest of the zzso The sequences upstream of the cap sites exhibit zzso zzso They are zzso and devoid of zzso or zzso boxes, as found for many zzso zzso including Ras zzso
