To further unravel zzso and zzso zzso evolution in Asia and Africa, we zzso zzso 15 new zzso zzso and zzso sequences discovered in eight different Asian and African zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso form a tight, deeply branching zzso cluster between Asian zzso zzso species zzso suggesting natural zzso zzso Novel viruses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cluster with other zzso zzso demonstrating close zzso among the zzso in these insular species and suggesting zzso transmission to a zzso in zzso zzso from Western chimpanzees and a Western zzso gorilla cluster within the zzso zzso the latter close to a human strain, indicative of zzso A new zzso from zzso zzso differs from the published zzso zzso by the existence of five geographically separated zzso zzso zzso not yet described to be zzso carry a relatively recent acquired, typical African zzso giving us no clue on the zzso origin of zzso
