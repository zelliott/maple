zzso zzso are comprised of three groups of zzso extreme zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their membrane zzso and zzso are derived entirely from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or its zzso zzso zzso In extreme zzso the major zzso is the zzso analogue of zzso zzso the zzso are zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso with diverse zzso structure characteristic of zzso on the generic zzso zzso of these zzso polar lipids occurs in a zzso zzso system that is absolutely dependent on high salt concentration (4 zzso The highly complex zzso pathways involve zzso containing zzso zzso zzso groups which are reduced to zzso groups to give the final saturated polar zzso In zzso polar lipids are derived both from zzso and zzso and zzso contain essentially only zzso polar zzso The function of these membrane polar lipids in maintaining the stability, fluidity and zzso properties of the cell membrane of extreme zzso as well as the evolutionary implications of the zzso and zzso structures will be zzso
