We identified zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso from green mud zzso zzso zzso in this zzso It was originally identified from an expressed sequence tag zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso end zzso technique was used to obtain the zzso untranslated region zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso zzso including a zzso zzso of 19 zzso an zzso frame of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of 399 zzso The translated protein is 365 zzso acids in length with a predicted molecular weight of 42 zzso which is the same as other zzso It is the first time that the expression of zzso in different stages of zzso development of zzso was zzso and the result showed that the expression of zzso increased gradually with zzso development, with a peak in the mature zzso In zzso zzso zzso was used to clarify the detail of zzso Positive signals illustrated that zzso zzso is present in zzso cells when the zzso is in early zzso and in both zzso cells and zzso when it is in mature zzso All above suggest that zzso is important for zzso zzso
