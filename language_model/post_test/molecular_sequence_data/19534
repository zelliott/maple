To date, several bacterial species have been described as zzso agents which improve plant nutrition and zzso However, the possible relationships between zzso potential, zzso identity, and zzso ability have not been investigated thus zzso In this study, we characterized a collection of 61 bacterial strains isolated from zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the adjacent bulk soil in an oak zzso The ability of bacteria to weather zzso was assessed with a new zzso zzso that measures the pH and the quantity of iron released from this zzso We showed that zzso bacteria occurred more frequently in the vicinity of zzso zzso than in the bulk zzso Moreover, the zzso efficacy of the zzso bacterial zzso was significantly greater than that of the bulk soil zzso All the bacterial zzso were identified by partial zzso zzso gene sequence analysis as members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their carbon metabolism was characterized by the zzso zzso The most efficient zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis resulted in identification of three zzso groups, one of which contained mainly bacterial zzso associated with zzso zzso and exhibiting high zzso zzso zzso our results support the hypothesis that by its carbon metabolism this fungus selects in the bulk soil zzso a bacterial community with high zzso potential, and they also address the question of functional zzso between zzso zzso and bacteria in the zzso complex for the promotion of tree zzso
