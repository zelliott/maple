The structure of a zzso from the transforming region zzso zzso of the zzso protein has been determined using two-dimensional zzso In the normal zzso this segment contains a zzso zzso at the critical 12 zzso any zzso other than zzso at this position results in a transforming zzso Previously performed energy calculations indicated that this zzso segment is a structured zzso In this study we find that the zzso containing zzso has a surprisingly zzso structure in solution which has more similarity to the zzso loop region in zzso than to that in zzso
