The mechanism of action of microbial zzso in promoting the differentiation of zzso zzso cells remains to be zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can completely substitute for zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso T cells in zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was secondary to their direct ability to induce zzso or to act zzso with zzso zzso to promote zzso differentiation and zzso T cells primed in the absence of zzso with zzso and zzso alone appeared to be in a transitional state and had not undergone differentiation along a conventional zzso zzso Unlike zzso cells, they expressed low levels of the zzso beta 2 zzso and retained the ability to differentiate into zzso zzso when zzso in zzso under zzso zzso These results support the use of zzso zzso as zzso but also suggest that they could potentially trigger zzso disease in a susceptible zzso
