The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso has been cloned by zzso zzso zzso clones containing the zzso zzso gene are able to completely rescue the zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso of the predicted zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to that of zzso zzso Although the zzso donor and zzso sites are zzso the untranslated regions, and the zzso differ zzso For this zzso the average zzso size in zzso zzso is over 600 base pairs zzso in zzso zzso it is only 113 zzso Their upstream control regions share limited sequence zzso however, reporter gene zzso of the two species show strongly similar expression in zzso zzso These results are consistent with the maintenance not only of the function of the zzso gene but also the zzso control of the gene through tens of millions of years of zzso
