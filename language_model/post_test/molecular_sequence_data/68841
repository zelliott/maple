The zzso zzso coat protein binding site consists of an zzso hairpin with a single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso was used to examine binding effects caused by a single break in the zzso zzso This method revealed that breakage of all but one zzso bond within a zzso binding site substantially reduced the binding zzso This is probably due to zzso of the hairpin structure upon breaking the zzso zzso at these zzso One zzso zzso zzso with the zzso and 3' ends at the zzso zzso bound with zzso zzso However, extending the zzso end of this zzso zzso greatly reduces zzso making it unlikely that this zzso zzso binding site will be active when embedded in a larger zzso zzso also locates the zzso and 3' boundaries of protein binding sites on the zzso The zzso boundary of the zzso coat protein site as defined by zzso was two zzso shorter zzso zzso to zzso than the previously determined site zzso to zzso The smaller binding site was verified by terminal zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso and was found to bind tightly to the coat zzso The site size determined by zzso interference was larger at the zzso end zzso to zzso probably due, however, to zzso effects of zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the apparent site size of a protein binding site is dependent upon the method zzso
