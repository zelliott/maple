zzso is a major and ubiquitous zzso in higher zzso zzso has traditionally been viewed as an adjunct with low activity and rare zzso Recent reports of zzso and its derivatives as the zzso zzso components in some plant zzso may call for a different perspective on zzso The existence of a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso an zzso specific to zzso zzso Martin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso lends further support to this zzso zzso described here include the isolation of a second zzso zzso zzso differential expression of zzso and zzso and identification of substantial amounts of zzso in zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso has zzso identity to zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso The upstream regions contain common and unique zzso The zzso zzso have similar properties, zzso values of 46 and 96 zzso respectively, for zzso and a pH optimum of zzso Other zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso was high in zzso roots and zzso whereas zzso expression was high in roots but low in zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso were detected in all zzso zzso with immature kernels containing very high levels of the zzso of zzso zzso The results are a clear indication that zzso of zzso is a natural zzso process in zzso Whether zzso serves as a precursor to the active zzso or has any other unique function remains to be zzso
