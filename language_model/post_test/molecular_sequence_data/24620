zzso D zzso plays a central role in the control of zzso budding and protein zzso We previously showed that in resting zzso zzso cells, zzso is implicated in the control of zzso protein transit, from the zzso network to the plasma zzso and that zzso zzso stimulation of protein transit is correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Raymond, zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper we demonstrate that: 1) zzso is not implicated in the earliest zzso of protein zzso 2) zzso controls zzso but not zzso protein zzso 3) zzso cells express zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 4) the expression of a zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso protein transit whereas expression of a zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso prevented increases in the rate of zzso transit as triggered by zzso zzso 5) zzso appears to be located in a zzso region containing the zzso whereas zzso which is scattered in the zzso in resting cells, is zzso to the plasma membrane after zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that in zzso cells, both zzso regulate protein transit between the zzso network and the zzso plasma zzso but that they do so at different steps in the zzso
