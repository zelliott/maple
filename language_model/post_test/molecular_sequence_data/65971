zzso signaling is an important but poorly understood aspect of light responsiveness in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recently identified zzso signaling component that regulates zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso we defined genetically distinct zzso and zzso pathways that stimulate different sets of genes in mature zzso leaf zzso Both pathways operate at 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and above, but the zzso zzso is able to stimulate zzso genes even in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both pathways function in zzso lacking zzso zzso or zzso Genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are induced at low zzso zzso rates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso reveal that both these factors mediate responses of the zzso pathway, acting with partial or complete zzso to stimulate expression of particular zzso Furthermore, evidence is presented that all zzso zzso genes are likely to be regulated by zzso and that these zzso factors do not mediate zzso responses independent of zzso Finally, we highlight the functions of zzso and zzso in zzso protection and show that zzso plays the more critical zzso This research provides evidence that, in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso act together in a zzso zzso and demonstrates a new role for zzso in zzso zzso
