Earlier studies have shown that of the four genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted to zzso the zzso zzso family zzso in zzso zzso the zzso gene (at the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all cell types of the zzso and is essential from early embryonic zzso while the zzso gene (at zzso zzso is expressed only in zzso being essential for zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized the zzso gene (at zzso zzso which shows high sequence zzso with the other three zzso genes of zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso shows that expression of this gene begins in late embryonic stages zzso 14 zzso particularly in the developing zzso system and zzso zzso during zzso and adult zzso it is widely expressed in many cell types but much more strongly in zzso and in developing and zzso germ zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso with the P zzso inserted at zzso position of the zzso gene promoter was zzso This early zzso zzso lethal zzso significantly reduces levels of zzso transcripts in developing zzso and this is associated with a variety of defects in the zzso system, including lack of liquid zzso About zzso of the zzso survive as weak, zzso and completely sterile zzso zzso of the surviving zzso males are significantly smaller, with fewer zzso most of which do not develop beyond the round zzso zzso In zzso and Northern zzso show significantly reduced levels of the zzso transcripts in zzso zzso adult zzso The absence of early zzso stages in the zzso zzso zzso contrasts with the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso affects zzso of zzso zzso later in zzso In view of the specific effects in zzso development and in early stages of zzso it is likely that, besides its functions as a zzso zzso may have zzso functions and may also be involved in zzso transport across the developing zzso zzso zzso
