The zzso sequence of an 852 base pair zzso DNA zzso containing the entire gene coding for zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso gene comprises an open reading frame zzso of 711 zzso zzso zzso starting with zzso at position 93 and extending to the zzso stop zzso zzso at position zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature protein shows zzso zzso to published sequences of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence coding for mature zzso is preceded by a putative signal zzso of 25 zzso acid zzso and a sequence resembling a zzso site zzso before the initiation zzso By contrast with the processed zzso the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso the putative leader zzso bears no or only weak zzso to signal peptides of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal zzso appears to be functional in exporting the zzso to the zzso in zzso zzso More than 50% of the whole zzso activity was localized in the zzso space and in the zzso Whereas zzso to zzso is completely zzso a weak zzso acid zzso between the sequence surrounding the active site of zzso T4 zzso and a sequence spanning zzso 126 through 161 of zzso zzso zzso could be zzso
