zzso infection by zzso virus zzso requires both replication and maintenance of the viral zzso zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso is a zzso protein that is critical for the replication and maintenance of the zzso during zzso in zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso recruits the cellular origin recognition complex zzso through an zzso interaction with zzso linking region 1 zzso and zzso We now show that zzso and LR2 bind to zzso zzso that is predicted to form zzso zzso Several chemically distinct zzso drugs disrupted the interaction between zzso and zzso The zzso compound zzso inhibited zzso stimulation of viral DNA replication and zzso blocked proliferation of zzso cells relative to zzso cell zzso zzso treatment also disrupted the ability of zzso to zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that maintenance function is also zzso through zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso replication and maintenance function uses a common zzso binding capacity of zzso and zzso which may be zzso by zzso zzso
