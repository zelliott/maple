The zzso of a novel classical zzso fever virus zzso zzso isolated from a hog pen in zzso Province, central China, is zzso zzso zzso in zzso It is composed of a zzso zzso terminal zzso region zzso a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso and a zzso zzso Genome comparison of the zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso with other known zzso zzso was performed and zzso zzso segments from zzso and other reported strains shared zzso identity at the zzso level and zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso From an evolutionary point of view, isolate zzso is closely related to the highly virulent isolate zzso with a zzso distance of zzso and zzso related to the moderately virulent isolate zzso with zzso distance zzso The zzso trees of the full-length zzso and the following region zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso method were constructed and approximately divided into different genetic groups according to zzso moderate zzso and high zzso while other zzso NJ trees demonstrated sequence conservation between these zzso The four zzso regions may constitute important criteria for genetic typing of diverse zzso zzso Based on these zzso isolate zzso was deduced to belong to the highly virulent isolate zzso However, zzso also contains a zzso deletion in the zzso that is characteristic of zzso zzso These analyses constitute a comprehensive study of the zzso of zzso based on distinct regions of the zzso and may provide the basis for future molecular epidemiology research to identify virulent strain outbreaks and trigger zzso of appropriate control zzso
