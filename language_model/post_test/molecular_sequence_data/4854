The gene for a novel, high molecular weight protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso coli zzso has been zzso zzso and characterized with respect to its zzso This zzso designated zzso is localized on the large zzso that also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of a region zzso zzso revealed that the sequences zzso the zzso gene are composed of several remnants of different zzso zzso The zzso protein is produced as a zzso precursor zzso that, after zzso and zzso processing, is released into the culture zzso as a mature zzso of approximately zzso The primary sequence of zzso is highly related to a family of autonomously transported putative zzso factors from different zzso zzso which includes the zzso protein of an zzso zzso coli strain, the zzso protein from zzso zzso and the zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso A common motif present in all four proteins is reminiscent of the zzso zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso indeed shows zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso and is zzso zzso for zzso zzso This activity of zzso and probably of other proteins of the zzso family may be of functional importance during infection of the zzso cell layer by the bacterial zzso
