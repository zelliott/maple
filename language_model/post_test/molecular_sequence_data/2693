We have characterized three mouse zzso zzso Together with previous analyses of mouse functional genes and of rat genes and zzso these data provide some insights into the processes of zzso zzso formation during the evolution of zzso All the mouse zzso zzso to a full-length zzso sequence with a zzso tail and are precisely flanked by a pair of direct repeats, in agreement with formation through an zzso intermediate followed by zzso at staggered nicks in the zzso All the zzso zzso zzso identified so far are produced from a zzso form, with two of them (one for each zzso formed from a zzso zzso zzso pointing to the particular zzso of zzso precursors forms to serve as templates for zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso are not inserted randomly in the zzso but are systematically found in a context of simple zzso prone to zzso zzso and likely to zzso the appearance of zzso zzso zzso their zzso repeats share not only the same size (15 zzso but also common sequence features (which extend to zzso upstream zzso suggesting that common mechanisms, specific to this class of zzso have been involved in their zzso For the first time, a model accounting for the generation of full-length zzso copies from zzso zzso templates is zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to be of rather recent origin zzso to the zzso zzso and some of them could have undergone subsequent genetic exchanges with the functional zzso
