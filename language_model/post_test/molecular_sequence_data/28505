The zzso protein directly zzso the zzso zzso which mediates degradation of the zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso expression is frequently zzso by zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso was involved in zzso colitis zzso zzso the frequency and timing of zzso zzso was investigated in four different zzso stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing were used to determine the prevalence of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was observed in 19 of 38 zzso zzso 4 of 12 zzso zzso and 3 of the 5 zzso zzso UC zzso In contrast, 3 of 40 zzso normal zzso showed zzso zzso zzso test: P zzso zzso zzso sequencing was used to analyze 28 zzso of zzso gene in 20 zzso The number of zzso zzso ranged from 0 to 4, 0 to 20, and 0 to 28 in the normal, zzso and zzso samples, respectively zzso test: P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected only in zzso by zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that zzso of zzso is a relatively common early event in zzso zzso zzso offers potential as a zzso for the early detection of cancer or zzso in zzso Finally, analyses of zzso zzso in other zzso should explore not only frank zzso but other zzso zzso
