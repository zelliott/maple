zzso is a new and unique member of the zzso family with zzso zzso activity, and its expression is restricted mostly to zzso cells in zzso We cloned the zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso shows a high similarity to that of mouse zzso with zzso identity as a zzso The zzso zzso at the zzso and the zzso regions at the zzso are particularly zzso showing zzso and zzso identity, zzso Western zzso analysis with mouse zzso zzso detected 130 zzso Mr zzso proteins in human and rat zzso cell lines and zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso gene was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso in human, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso By virtue of zzso CA repeats found in the 3' untranslated region of the mouse zzso zzso the zzso locus was further zzso to zzso 11 between zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso mapping zzso These results established zzso as a new marker of human zzso 5 to define the zzso boundary of human zzso 5 and 16 on mouse zzso zzso
