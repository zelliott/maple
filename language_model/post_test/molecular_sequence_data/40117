Despite the recent completion of the zzso zzso project, few functionally significant sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees have thus far been zzso zzso in zzso regulatory mechanisms represents an important platform for evolutionary change, suggesting that a significant proportion of functional zzso sequence differences may affect regulatory zzso 

To explore this hypothesis, we performed zzso identification of zzso candidate zzso binding sites that have evolved since the divergence of humans and zzso Analysis of candidate zzso binding sites zzso between mouse and zzso yet absent in human indicated that loss of candidate zzso binding sites in the human lineage was not random but instead correlated with the zzso functions of associated zzso 

Our data support the notion that changes in zzso regulation have contributed to the recent evolution of zzso Moreover, genes associated with zzso candidate zzso binding sites highlight potential pathways underlying zzso zzso
