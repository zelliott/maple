zzso is one of the zzso factors involved in regulating cell differentiation but its zzso properties and structural characteristics are still zzso In the present study, we cloned zzso from zzso which produces large numbers of transparent zzso and has zzso zzso zzso By zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso which contains a putative zzso zzso shares very high zzso to that of other species with an zzso zzso zzso zzso was also targeted to the nucleus of zzso cells when zzso by transient zzso In order to characterize the structural and zzso properties of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed and zzso in zzso zzso By circular zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso zzso The size distribution zzso by zzso zzso indicated that it existed as a zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso zzso has a well-organized and functional zzso Finally, zzso zzso was distributed mainly in the zzso cells of zzso by zzso analysis using zzso raised against zzso zzso The present study not only helps us to comparatively analyze zzso genes across species, but it also provides valuable structural information for further studies of zzso biological function in the zzso
