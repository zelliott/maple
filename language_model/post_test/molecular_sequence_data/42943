The gene zzso zzso protein zzso a primary zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that multiple copies of the gene are present per zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso protein from zzso zzso is zzso similar to zzso protein from zzso zzso proteins from zzso species, and zzso proteins from zzso zzso and zzso A zzso analysis of zzso proteins and the putative binding sites on their respective zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a rare opportunity to study molecular zzso between an zzso zzso and the protein that binds to zzso
