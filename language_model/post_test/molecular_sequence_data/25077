The effects of the zzso repeat on zzso replication in zzso coli cells were analyzed using zzso analysis of replication zzso This repeat appeared to stall the replication fork progression in zzso coli strains carrying zzso zzso The potency of replication zzso increased with the zzso length but did not depend on its orientation relative to the replication origin, or zzso through the zzso Treatment of zzso coli cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso abolished replication zzso indicating that protein binding might be responsible for the zzso replication zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso revealed zzso protection of all zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso with crude cell extracts confirmed the presence of a zzso zzso activity in zzso but not zzso zzso Further, strains cured from the zzso zzso lost this activity, while zzso strains that acquired the zzso factor via zzso acquired zzso activity as zzso Thus, this zzso protein is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of this protein by affinity zzso revealed a single zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of its two zzso peptides revealed two perfect matches with the zzso zzso which is zzso by the F zzso zzso of an individual zzso protein in the zzso zzso coli strain conveyed zzso activity in zzso and replication zzso at zzso repeats in zzso We conclude that zzso binding to a zzso repeat is responsible for zzso DNA zzso Biological applications of this phenomenon are zzso
