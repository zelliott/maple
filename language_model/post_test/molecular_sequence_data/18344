The zzso cell cycle control genes of zzso and man zzso 34 zzso protein zzso Using the human zzso gene as a DNA probe we have isolated zzso clones corresponding to the mouse zzso zzso zzso of the mouse clones show zzso identity at the zzso acid level to the human zzso gene and detects a 2 zzso zzso product indistinguishable to that seen in human zzso The mouse gene should be useful in studying the functional control of the cell cycle in mouse zzso
