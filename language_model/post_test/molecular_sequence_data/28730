zzso is one of the zzso zzso that has been isolated from the sea cucumber, zzso zzso This protein is composed of two identical zzso held by a single zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined by sequencing the peptides produced by zzso fragmentation of zzso zzso A zzso of zzso is composed of 140 zzso acid zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso bonds were also identified from an analysis of the zzso peptides obtained from the intact zzso The similarity between the sequence of zzso and that of other zzso zzso was low, while the zzso region, including the putative zzso and zzso sites, was relatively well zzso When the zzso activity was examined by a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed much higher affinity for zzso than for other zzso zzso The association constant of zzso for zzso zzso zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and the maximum number of bound zzso was estimated to be zzso by an equilibrium dialysis zzso
