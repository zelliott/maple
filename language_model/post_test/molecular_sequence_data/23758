zzso zzso regulates gene expression through zzso degradation, translation repression and zzso zzso The fundamental engines of zzso zzso are zzso and zzso complexes, whose common components are 21-25 zzso zzso and an zzso protein containing a zzso domain of unknown zzso The crystal structure of an zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso into two zzso one resembling the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and another with similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and a coordinated metal zzso lie in a pocket that surrounds the zzso zzso of the zzso defining a key functional region in the zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso zzso zzso in the majority of zzso zzso align zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sites, suggesting that in zzso zzso proteins the zzso zzso domain may possess zzso zzso The zzso region around the zzso of the zzso domain, which is required for small interfering zzso zzso binding to zzso may function as the zzso site for the obligatory zzso zzso of zzso thereby specifying the zzso position of the target zzso
