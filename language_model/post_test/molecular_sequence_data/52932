A zzso zzso of zzso zzso partially restores the expression of zzso and zzso activities to zzso a genetically defined zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso resistance and a zzso and zzso zzso are transferred at high frequency from zzso strains to zzso strains of zzso zzso Southern analysis of zzso DNA and sequence analysis of DNA zzso the zzso zzso site in zzso strains revealed that the zzso interrupted a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso searches using a conceptual translation of the zzso identified a region of zzso to the known zzso global regulators zzso and zzso To verify that the zzso zzso zzso the observed zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso gene was introduced into the zzso of a zzso strain by zzso zzso The resulting zzso had a restored zzso zzso zzso factor gene expression in zzso restored zzso and zzso strains was zzso by measuring zzso activity in culture zzso zzso and by Northern analysis of the zzso zzso We named this zzso rot (for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso because of the activity associated with zzso zzso zzso
