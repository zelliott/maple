zzso interrupting the mixed lineage leukemia gene zzso occur in zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso occurs rarely in both ALL and zzso The gene on zzso 15, zzso was cloned recently in a patient with zzso We have identified the same gene in a de zzso zzso zzso However, both the zzso and zzso zzso in these patients zzso in the previously reported zzso both gene breaks were within zzso while in our ALL case the zzso break is zzso and the zzso break is zzso The zzso fusion described previously shares no zzso zzso in common with the zzso reported zzso The fusion proteins also differ with respect to zzso previously described fusion contains 55 extra zzso acids as its zzso break is in zzso 11, while the zzso we report breaks in zzso zzso zzso to the originally described normal zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso we identify a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso appears identical to an zzso previously found to be expressed in melanoma rendered zzso by zzso introduction of normal zzso 6, suggesting the gene may function normally to suppress cell growth and/or enhance zzso
