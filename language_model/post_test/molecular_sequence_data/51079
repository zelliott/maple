The structure of the B2 zzso domain of zzso protein G has been determined at zzso resolution using a combination of single zzso replacement zzso phasing and manual fitting of the coordinates of the zzso structure of B1 domain of zzso protein G zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) Science zzso zzso The final R value was zzso for data between zzso and zzso zzso The structure described here has 13 zzso preceding the zzso zzso domain and 13 additional zzso following it, for a total of 83 zzso The zzso binding domain is zzso in the structure, having an average B factor of zzso Only zzso zzso could be located in the electron density zzso with the ends of the structure fading into zzso Like the B1 domain, the B2 domain consists of four zzso and a single zzso lying diagonally across the zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This small structure is extensively zzso and has a relatively large zzso zzso These structural observations may account for the exceptional stability of protein zzso A comparison of the B2 domain X-ray structure and the B1 domain zzso structure showed minor differences in the turn between strands and two and a slight displacement of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso bonds between zzso related molecules account for most of these zzso
