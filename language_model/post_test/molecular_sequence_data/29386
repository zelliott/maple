We previously isolated and characterized a Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso that is defective in import of proteins carrying a zzso signal type 2 zzso zzso zzso we have cloned Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso shorter than human zzso by 5 zzso showing 91 and zzso identity with zzso from humans and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rescued the impaired zzso import in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was determined by reverse zzso zzso a zzso transition caused a zzso acid zzso zzso We investigated the molecular dysfunction of zzso zzso in zzso including zzso and zzso with one site zzso at zzso zzso or zzso which frequently occurs in the human fatal genetic zzso disease zzso zzso zzso showing a cell zzso of zzso import zzso All types of the zzso affected zzso in binding to both zzso cargo protein and the longer zzso of zzso zzso zzso that is responsible for transport of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection studies demonstrated zzso distribution of zzso between the zzso and zzso in zzso and human zzso Moreover, expression of zzso but not of the shorter zzso zzso enhanced zzso of zzso proteins into zzso thereby zzso that both zzso receptors shuttle between zzso and the zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso with a deletion of 7 zzso acids from the N zzso retained zzso activity, whereas an zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso maintained the activity, whereas a zzso acid shorter form lacking several zzso acids of the sixth zzso motif lost the zzso zzso nearly the full length of zzso including all zzso zzso is required for its zzso
