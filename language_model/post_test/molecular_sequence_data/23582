The recognition specificity of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso transgenic plants expressing zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to have the same recognition specificity as that of zzso zzso zzso In a set of three S zzso whose sequence identities of zzso and zzso are fairly high, zzso zzso zzso showed the same recognition specificity as zzso zzso zzso and a slightly different specificity from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, showed a different specificity from zzso zzso zzso Using these similar S zzso zzso zzso proteins were produced by domain zzso zzso using the zzso zzso proteins revealed that the zzso response induction activity was altered by the replacement of Region III and Region zzso zzso grains of zzso transgenic plants expressing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequence with Region III and Region V from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were partially incompatible with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and those expressing the zzso zzso zzso sequence with Region III and Region V from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were completely incompatible with the zzso having zzso zzso zzso However, the transgenic plant expressing zzso zzso also showed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso III and Region V of zzso are important for determining the recognition zzso but not the sole zzso A possible process of the generation of a new S zzso is zzso zzso
