The zzso zzso gene zzso which consists of zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso and incorporation of the five zzso acid constituents of zzso has been identified zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso By sequencing an additional 34 zzso of DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified the residual zzso zzso gene zzso which consists of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the opposite orientation to the zzso zzso zzso consisted of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained a zzso zzso module at the zzso and a zzso zzso module at the zzso zzso was found to exhibit similarity to zzso acid zzso zzso consisted of a zzso zzso module at the zzso and a zzso zzso at the zzso The zzso zzso gene cluster was zzso in another zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is presumed to be responsible for zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and the incorporation of zzso and zzso acid into the zzso zzso
