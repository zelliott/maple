zzso of an active zzso complement and a dynamic cell surface complement are two major zzso of cellular zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functions during successive stages in zzso zzso specifically zzso processing, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport and zzso maturation of zzso Here, we report that a zzso screen identified zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso as zzso proteins physically interacting with both zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso expressed cell wall protein which is proposed to be first zzso zzso to the plasma membrane as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso form and to be then transferred to the zzso layer of the cell zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso both the zzso growth zzso and the translation zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we report that zzso associates with translating zzso suggesting a novel, zzso role for zzso zzso encodes one of the two zzso zzso zzso and represents a key zzso in one of several zzso routes to produce zzso which in turn is indispensable for zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso which is active in the breakdown of membrane zzso Our results support the view that zzso links zzso function to membrane turnover and cell surface zzso
