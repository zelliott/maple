A variety of results point to the zzso factor zzso as a critical zzso of the zzso transition during the cell cycle in zzso cells, serving to activate the zzso of a group of genes that zzso proteins necessary for DNA zzso In addition, zzso activity appears to be directly regulated by the action of zzso protein zzso and zzso proteins and indirectly regulated through the action of zzso zzso and associated zzso We now show that the zzso of zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso binding sites are found in both the zzso E and zzso D1 zzso both promoters are activated by zzso gene products, and at least for zzso zzso the zzso sites contribute to cell zzso zzso Most important, the zzso zzso E gene is activated following expression of the zzso product zzso by a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the involvement of zzso and zzso E in an zzso loop that zzso the zzso of critical activities affecting the progression of cells through zzso
