zzso identification of four clam species, zzso zzso zzso carpet zzso zzso zzso zzso carpet zzso zzso zzso zzso carpet zzso and zzso zzso zzso carpet zzso was achieved by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso analysis of a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA isolated from the foot muscle produced fragments of zzso zzso for zzso zzso 523 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and 502 zzso for zzso zzso The restriction profiles obtained by zzso gel zzso when zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso allowed unequivocal identification of the four clam zzso This approach would be less costly, zzso and quicker than conventional sequencing of zzso chain reaction products followed by detailed comparison of individual zzso especially when large numbers of samples need to be zzso
