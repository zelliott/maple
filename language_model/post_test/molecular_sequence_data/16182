A zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso gene was zzso via calcium zzso zzso into zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso The zzso gene was efficiently zzso as the zzso cells grew perfectly well in selective zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso region became linked to a zzso element on integration into the recipient zzso To investigate the structure of the surrogate promoter, we first isolated the integrated gene from a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the DNA adjacent to the zzso zzso sequence was then zzso We found, first, that the integration of the zzso DNA apparently occurred by a blunt end zzso mechanism involving no obvious sequence similarities between integrated and recipient DNA and, second, that the zzso region included a zzso box, two zzso boxes, and a zzso box zzso However, the zzso box motif and the most zzso zzso box appeared to be sufficient for full promoter activity, as determined by the zzso efficiencies of appropriate zzso zzso Except for these zzso promoter zzso the surrogate promoter had no obvious similarities to known zzso zzso gene zzso
