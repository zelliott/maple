Certain zzso tumors demonstrate a loss of zzso at the zzso imprinted region of zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that this implicates a tumor zzso gene at this zzso The human zzso gene maps to zzso is expressed in fetal zzso including the zzso and is zzso zzso Here we show that the abundance of zzso transcripts in cells of two zzso derived cell lines zzso and zzso differs zzso While zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso the expression of zzso in zzso cells is much lower than that of normal zzso zzso of these two cell lines were zzso injected into nude mice with subsequent tumor zzso A fivefold increase in the zzso zzso level was measured in tumors derived from zzso cell lines as compared to these cells before zzso However this increase in zzso zzso did not alter the zzso in soft zzso nor the growth rate of the cells derived from these tumors as compared to the original zzso zzso Nevertheless, the cells retaining the elevated level of zzso transcripts were more zzso than the original zzso We propose that there is a selection of cells expressing high levels of zzso from the total zzso cell population during the zzso of tumor zzso These zzso together with our previous publications on zzso expression in human zzso do not support the notion of a tumor zzso role for the zzso zzso
