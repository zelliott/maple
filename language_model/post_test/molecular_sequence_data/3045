The structural zzso of zzso formed by the in zzso reaction of zzso zzso with zzso oxide zzso the most zzso zzso of the industrial zzso zzso was obtained by liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis of modified zzso peptides of human zzso zzso The zzso sites of human zzso towards SO were identified through zzso of zzso zzso peptides by zzso laser zzso with tandem mass zzso zzso A procedure was set up based on this zzso allowing zzso modification to be assessed by monitoring zzso zzso using zzso with selected zzso recording zzso mass zzso By this methodology it was also possible to compare advantages and disadvantages of presently available strategies for the measurement of zzso zzso with zzso The results obtained could most zzso lead to the zzso of molecular zzso of SO zzso and the zzso procedure described zzso could be applied to the biological monitoring of zzso exposure in the zzso
