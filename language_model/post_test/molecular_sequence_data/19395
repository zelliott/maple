An zzso zzso strain, zzso was isolated from a zzso monkey in Nepal and characterized zzso The strain was initially identified as zzso zzso using zzso amplification of zzso zzso However, sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene showed a zzso difference when compared to the reference zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso were also observed in the zzso zzso gene and the internal transcribed zzso zzso regions 1 and 2, and analysis of the zzso protein gene from the monkey strain showed unique zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso isolated from zzso The zzso acid sequences of two zzso and two zzso zzso zzso also differed from those of zzso zzso zzso analyses of these zzso in the monkey strain showed different zzso mobility patterns compared with zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso genes indicated the presence of at least seven different types of zzso none of which were identical to proteins in zzso zzso When the zzso from the monkey strain were zzso into the zzso of zzso formation of zzso zzso was observed 7 days after the zzso These results demonstrate that the strain is genetically different from zzso zzso and is zzso Revival of the name zzso zzso is proposed for the zzso
