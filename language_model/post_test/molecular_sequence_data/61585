zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso members of the zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso agents of worldwide diseases affecting cattle and small zzso zzso Here we report the zzso sequences and comparative analysis of zzso strain zzso and zzso strains zzso isolated from a zzso and zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso range in size from zzso to 139 zzso with an average zzso composition of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain 131 and 130 putative zzso respectively, and share zzso over zzso zzso 88 of which are zzso in all characterized zzso zzso and zzso contain 15 and 16 open reading frames zzso respectively, which lack similarity to other zzso or cellular zzso All genes with putative roles in zzso including a vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso are present in both zzso however, zzso contains two extra zzso repeat genes absent in zzso zzso sequence zzso is observed in all functional classes of genes but is highest in putative zzso range zzso including genes unique to zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso is zzso identical to zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 116 genes zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso and a novel zzso zzso show an unusual degree of zzso zzso These zzso differences are consistent with the zzso of zzso and zzso as two zzso zzso Compared to other zzso zzso zzso shares unique zzso features with zzso zzso virus, including a zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso and a paucity of zzso metabolism zzso Together, these data provide a comparative view of zzso zzso
