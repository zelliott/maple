The A3 zzso zzso is widely expressed in human zzso with the most abundant expression in the lung and liver, but the zzso cellular zzso and functions of this zzso in humans are zzso Since zzso influences the zzso of circulating and resident inflammatory cells within the lung and leads to exaggerated airway narrowing in individuals with inflammatory airway disorders, we hypothesized that A3 zzso gene expression is localized to inflammatory cells and that gene expression is zzso in airway zzso Lung and airway tissue were obtained at zzso from zzso subjects and subjects with inflammatory airway disorders associated with tobacco smoke or zzso In zzso zzso identified A3 receptors in zzso cells and zzso within the zzso zzso of the airways and the zzso of blood vessels, but not in mast zzso A3 zzso transcripts were highly expressed in peripheral blood zzso zzso from zzso donors zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean A3 zzso transcript abundance was greater in lung tissue from subjects with airway inflammation zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso than in normal lung zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso P zzso zzso The A3 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a maximum of zzso This zzso effect was completely abolished by addition of the A3 zzso selective zzso zzso We conclude that A3 receptors are primarily expressed on zzso in human zzso where they mediate zzso of zzso zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso may be useful agents in the treatment of zzso diseases such as asthma and zzso
