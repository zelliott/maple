We have zzso zzso zzso zzso IV from human lung zzso to apparent zzso in a form which is zzso active and stable to zzso It has an apparent molecular mass of 35 zzso is insensitive to zzso and seems to contain no zzso or zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso linkages led to altered migration on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and loss of zzso zzso CA IV resembles CA II in being a zzso zzso zzso relatively resistant to zzso by zzso zzso and sensitive to zzso by zzso Application of this zzso to human kidney zzso produced homogeneous zzso with nearly identical zzso zzso acid compositions of both lung and kidney CA IV were similar, as were zzso zzso patterns resolved on high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso sequences of native zzso from lung and kidney were zzso as were zzso sequences of the three major zzso peptides resolved on reverse phase zzso zzso focusing revealed zzso in zzso from both zzso zzso raised to human lung CA IV reacted equally strongly with CA IV from zzso but very zzso or not at all with other zzso Treatment of lung zzso and kidney zzso with zzso zzso C released over half of the zzso CA IV, suggesting that at least half of the CA IV in both zzso is anchored to zzso by zzso zzso
