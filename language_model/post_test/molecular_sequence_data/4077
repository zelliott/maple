The zzso are a group of zzso bacteria and are important plant and animal zzso Progress toward analyzing their zzso mechanisms has been hampered by the few available genetic zzso Of the two zzso shown to function in zzso only zzso is readily amenable to modification and zzso One disadvantage of using zzso in zzso has been independent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso probably as a result of inadequate control of the zzso expression in zzso In this study, we describe the construction of a zzso containing the zzso zzso resistance gene from zzso The zzso gene was placed outside the zzso repeats to lower the frequency of independent zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso occurred at a frequency of zzso zzso zzso a frequency similar to that of the parent zzso zzso of zzso were random and only single insertions were zzso Several unique restriction sites between the zzso repeat sequences provide for further development of zzso
