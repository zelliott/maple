The zzso are reported to zzso second zzso tract zzso in patients with prior lung or head and neck zzso Since those zzso already examined in clinical trials do not induce major clinical responses in lung zzso it is hypothesized that the beneficial zzso activity in lung zzso occurs within zzso of zzso zzso zzso To begin to investigate this zzso action during lung zzso the zzso zzso transformed human zzso zzso cell line that grows in an zzso independent manner was zzso This study reports, as compared to controls, that zzso acid zzso suppresses zzso proliferation in zzso cultures and in zzso independent and cloning efficiency growth zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso gamma 1 in zzso cells but expression at the total cellular zzso level of zzso alpha and zzso alpha is not zzso by zzso zzso beta zzso expression is zzso before and after zzso and is only detected using a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso To determine directly which of these expressed zzso receptors signals growth suppression, each zzso was individually zzso into zzso cells using zzso zzso in colony efficiency zzso zzso gamma zzso in the presence or absence of zzso did not suppress zzso growth more than zzso In contrast, zzso of the other examined zzso receptors inhibited zzso cellular cloning efficiency prior to zzso and in this decreasing order after zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso The findings reported here reveal that zzso suppresses proliferation and cloning efficiency in this transformed human zzso zzso cell through specific zzso zzso Further work is needed to evaluate the role of zzso or its nuclear receptors in zzso even earlier steps in lung zzso
