We have performed zzso in zzso zzso studies and northern zzso analysis in the mouse and human, respectively, to determine the normal gene expression patterns of zzso zzso in the adult mouse was localized to several regions of the brain and the zzso of the zzso which are two of the major zzso affected in fragile X zzso Universal and very strong expression was observed in early mouse zzso with zzso decreasing expression during subsequent stages of embryonic zzso The early embryonic onset and tissue specificity of zzso gene expression is consistent with involvement in the fragile X zzso and also suggests additional organ systems in which clinical manifestations of reduced zzso gene expression may zzso
