The zzso acid sequence of the winged bean zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by chemical means and by zzso zzso From the zzso and zzso zzso obtained zzso zzso were designed for zzso amplification of the zzso zzso The zzso product was cloned and zzso to get the complete primary structure of zzso zzso zzso fragments for sequencing were also obtained by zzso zzso of the native zzso The zzso II sequence showed a high degree of zzso with that of zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in the regions involved in zzso association, where there is a very high conservation of zzso This perhaps implies the importance of this particular region in zzso interactions in this zzso In addition, many of the zzso involved in zzso binding in zzso zzso appear to be zzso in zzso zzso The distinct differences in zzso specificity observed amongst zzso I, zzso II, zzso and peanut zzso zzso may be explained by subtle differences in zzso of their zzso zzso II binds zzso quite zzso a putative zzso binding sequence has been zzso
