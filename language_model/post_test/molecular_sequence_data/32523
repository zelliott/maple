zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso stimulate the intrinsic zzso zzso activity of zzso family zzso Here we isolated a zzso zzso protein gene with the same reading frame with zzso zzso which has an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso pattern analysis shows that it contains a zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso besides the zzso domain, and it is consistent with the result of zzso zzso zzso is located in zzso zzso and consists of 12 zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in adult zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the 16 adult zzso zzso while it had a more abundant expression pattern in eight important human fetal zzso The expression pattern of zzso shows it may have functions related to fetus development and gives us some clues on its probable functions in adult zzso
