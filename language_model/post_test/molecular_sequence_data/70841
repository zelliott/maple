The plant zzso zzso zzso does not only serve basic zzso functions but is also involved in zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso To address the question whether the same zzso zzso zzso functions are equally involved in the response to high zzso we have isolated zzso clones for zzso A and zzso as representing the peripheral zzso complex and the zzso zzso complex, respectively, from the zzso sugar beet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso revealed a coordinate expression of the cloned zzso A and c zzso during plant development and in response to high zzso Also, in rapidly dividing zzso cells with zzso increased transcript amounts as compared to young leaf zzso the ratio of transcripts for both genes was similar to the ratio found for transcripts in leaves of different zzso We have then isolated partial zzso clones zzso for zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso including the promoter zzso zzso start mapping revealed long zzso leader sequences zzso and zzso zzso zzso for both zzso Both promoters contain putative zzso motifs in similar distance to the zzso zzso For a quantitative comparison of relative promoter strength, the zzso and zzso promoters linked to the zzso reporter gene zzso were delivered to sugar beet zzso cells by particle zzso The zzso promoter showed a zzso higher activity as compared with the zzso zzso Salt treatment induced an increase of zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter activities, zzso with increased transcript zzso The following sequences have been deposited at the zzso database zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso 1, partial zzso zzso
