A set of aligned zzso protein sequences is divided into two groups consisting of m and zzso zzso Each group contains sequences from the most related zzso Value of the position zzso of proteins from different groups of m and zzso sequences is defined as a number of zzso in comparison of all possible m X zzso pairs of zzso acid zzso in the position (each from different zzso divided by m X zzso Ten position average of zzso values is plotted zzso the first position zzso Area of the figure between the profile of zzso values and its mean value line characterizes the overall zzso of zzso acid zzso along the protein zzso If the area is greater than the average area for 1000 random profiles by more than two standard zzso units, the profile zzso containing the zzso of area are cut zzso The zzso stretches are likely to be variable and constant zzso If necessary, each of stretches may be separately tested and statistically estimated using a standard size sample of artificial protein zzso zzso comparison of protein sequences reveals high overall zzso of zzso acid zzso and identifies variable and conservative regions for all considered families of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso bacteria zzso zzso human zzso
