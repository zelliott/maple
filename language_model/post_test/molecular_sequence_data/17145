The zzso assembly of a designed zzso zzso model is zzso The zzso zzso has the sequence zzso in which the presence of the zzso metal binding domain of zzso was used to place zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso positions upon formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso exists as a random zzso and assembles into a zzso in the presence of zzso Metal binding is monitored by the appearance of a new zzso band at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments are used to show that this designed zzso exists as a zzso zzso zzso
