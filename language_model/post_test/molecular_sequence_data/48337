zzso cataract zzso is a complex zzso disorder, including genetic and environmental zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein family, plays a crucial role in the development of the lens as a plasma zzso zzso We conducted this study to investigate the role of genetic variations of zzso and the relationship between single zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso to ARC in a Chinese zzso 

A total of 205 sporadic age-related cataract patients and 218 unrelated random healthy controls participated in our zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood zzso All zzso of zzso were zzso after being amplified with zzso chain zzso The functional consequences of the zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso statistical analysis was performed using zzso 

We found three novel variations in 205 zzso None presented in the 218 controls, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicted that the zzso zzso probably had zzso Compared with the healthy controls, the zzso zzso zzso and - zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), zzso zzso zzso and C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), and zzso zzso zzso and G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher in the patients with age-related zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2 was also predicted to be probably damaging by zzso zzso association including the - zzso of zzso C zzso of zzso and A zzso of zzso exhibited significantly higher distribution in the patients with ARC zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study suggests that the genetic variations and zzso in the gene zzso possibly contribute to the development of age-related zzso in the Chinese zzso
