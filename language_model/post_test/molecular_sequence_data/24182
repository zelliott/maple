In the transformation of plants by zzso zzso the zzso protein has been shown to pilot zzso during its transfer to the plant cell zzso Other studies have shown that the zzso protein of zzso zzso is capable of zzso its transfer from zzso cells to plant cells by a similar zzso We have demonstrated previously that zzso zzso which has some similarity to zzso is also able to transfer DNA zzso In this study, we performed a zzso analysis of the roles played by A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in DNA zzso by zzso zzso carrying zzso We show that zzso and zzso strains were equally zzso in their ability to transfer a zzso zzso DNA to plants and to transform zzso However, the zzso strain showed a DNA transfer efficiency of zzso compared with that of the other two zzso This sharply contrasts with our results that zzso can rather efficiently cleave the zzso sequence of zzso in zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso plays a major zzso role in plant transformation by zzso
