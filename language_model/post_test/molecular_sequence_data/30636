The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso is required for pattern formation in the zzso and for viability of the zzso cells in the zzso zzso The zzso protein product predicted from the DNA sequence is similar to members of a family of growth factors that includes transforming growth factor beta zzso We have produced zzso zzso to a zzso zzso protein made in bacteria and used a zzso promoter to express a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similar to other proteins in the zzso family, the zzso protein produced by the zzso cells was zzso zzso and both portions of the protein were zzso from the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the medium and in the proteins adhering to the plastic zzso zzso The zzso zzso the region with sequence similarity to the active zzso portion of zzso was found zzso as a zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso was in the zzso cell protein zzso onto the surface of the plastic zzso The zzso protein could be released into solution by increased salt concentration and zzso zzso Under these conditions, the zzso and zzso portions of zzso were not associated in a stable zzso
