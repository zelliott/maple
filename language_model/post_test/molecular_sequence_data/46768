We developed three zzso zzso zzso for the rapid and sensitive detection of zzso zzso zzso 1 (plus zzso zzso 2 (plus zzso and zzso 9 strains in zzso specimens from zzso The zzso zzso were based on the sequences of zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 9 zzso We recently characterized a major part of the zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we extended these studies and characterized major parts of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso genes were identified by zzso experiments between the individual zzso genes and zzso zzso from the 35 different zzso Four genes of zzso zzso zzso 1 specifically zzso with zzso 1 and 14 strains zzso Five genes of zzso zzso zzso 2 specifically zzso with zzso 2 and 1/2 strains only, and two genes of zzso zzso zzso 9 specifically zzso with zzso 9 zzso Until now rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests were available only for zzso strains of zzso 2 and highly zzso strains of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso can therefore be useful tools for the identification of zzso 1, 14, 2, 1/2, and 9 strains both for diagnostic purposes and in zzso and transmission zzso zzso these tests may facilitate control and zzso zzso
