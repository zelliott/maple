zzso pregnancy is associated with a two- to zzso increase in plasma zzso levels, particularly in the third zzso due both to the overproduction of zzso and to the possible suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso Numerous zzso in the human zzso gene causing complete zzso zzso have been zzso but naturally occurring zzso that result in defective zzso with partial activity have not yet been zzso Here we describe a zzso woman who was first diagnosed with zzso zzso during pregnancy after she developed zzso Her plasma zzso levels remained mildly elevated at approximately 300 zzso zzso zzso after the first pregnancy but rose significantly after she became pregnant again zzso to 2000 zzso zzso to zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene showed that the patient is zzso for a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso protein that had residual activity higher than that seen in all eight other zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso identified in our zzso We propose that some zzso in the zzso gene produce a defective zzso with partial activity, which usually leads to mild zzso
