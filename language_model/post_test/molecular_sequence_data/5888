zzso of four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to provide an estimate of zzso diversity at nuclear genes within the house mouse and to test the neutral prediction that the ratio of zzso zzso to zzso divergence is the same for different zzso zzso and zzso lie in a region of the X zzso that experiences relatively low zzso rates, while zzso and zzso lie near the zzso of the X zzso a region that experiences higher zzso zzso A total of zzso bases were zzso in each of 10 zzso zzso and one zzso zzso Average zzso diversity zzso for zzso within zzso zzso was quite low zzso zzso zzso However, there was substantial variation in the level of zzso among zzso The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso had higher ratios of zzso to divergence than the two zzso experiencing lower zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is reduced in regions with lower rates of zzso although sampling of additional genes is needed to establish whether there is a general correlation between zzso and zzso rate as in zzso zzso
