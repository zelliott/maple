The zzso of zzso clusters and their maintenance in a lineage has a prominent but little understood role in zzso zzso Here we examined how zzso cluster zzso may influence changes in cluster architecture and patterns of zzso sequence zzso We zzso the entire duplicated zzso and zzso clusters of zzso zzso zzso and extended the zzso zzso part of the zzso zzso cluster of horn shark zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso The duplicated zzso clusters in zzso each house considerably fewer genes and are dramatically shorter than the single zzso clusters of human and horn zzso We compared the zzso sequences of the zzso clusters of human, horn zzso zzso zzso zzso and striped bass and found extensive conservation of zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso between the human and horn zzso representing two of the three zzso zzso These are putative zzso elements that may play a role in the regulation of the ancestral zzso zzso In contrast, zzso regions of the duplicated zzso and zzso clusters of zzso and the zzso cluster of striped bass revealed a striking loss of conservation of these putative zzso sequences in the 3' zzso segment of the zzso where zzso only retains single representatives of group 1, 3, 4, and 5 zzso and group 2 zzso genes and in the zzso part of the zzso where zzso retains two copies of the group 13, 11, and 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso In analyzing patterns of zzso evolution in the zzso part of the zzso we explicitly looked for evidence of complementary loss of zzso zzso zzso as predicted by the zzso model in which genetic zzso after gene zzso is resolved because of the fixation of complementary degenerative zzso Our data did not yield evidence supporting this zzso We conclude that changes in the pattern of zzso conservation after zzso cluster zzso are more consistent with being the outcome of zzso modification rather than passive mechanisms that zzso zzso created by the zzso zzso These results support the view that zzso zzso may provide a mechanism zzso master control genes undergo radical modifications conducive to major zzso in body zzso Such zzso revolutions may contribute significantly to the evolutionary zzso
