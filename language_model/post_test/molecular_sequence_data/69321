A new DNA zzso activity was identified and zzso to near zzso from extracts of zzso and zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso This activity increased at least zzso during zzso and it was shown to be associated with a zzso zzso as determined by zzso gel zzso This new DNA zzso did not have any zzso zzso zzso activity and preferred small gapped DNA as a zzso The activity was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso of zzso which completely inhibit either DNA zzso I zzso II zzso or III zzso Since no zzso in the extensively zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso with zzso raised against zzso DNA zzso I, II, and III, we called this zzso DNA zzso zzso The DNA zzso IV activity increased at least zzso in a zzso strain zzso the gene product predicted from the zzso zzso frame zzso on zzso zzso zzso III and zzso called zzso while no activity was detected in a strain where zzso was zzso These results strongly suggest that DNA zzso IV is zzso by the zzso gene and is a probable zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso
