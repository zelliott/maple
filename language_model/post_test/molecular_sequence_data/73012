To investigate potential structures of zzso that might relate to their biological function and association with zzso repeat expansion diseases zzso the structure of a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso was examined by studies of the pH and temperature dependence of zzso mobility, zzso zzso circular zzso chemical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had an unusually high zzso zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso zzso formed a relatively unstable zzso zzso 30 degrees C in 1 zzso zzso hairpin containing zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso the hairpin contained zzso zzso but no zzso C zzso zzso base pairs, increased zzso stability zzso zzso 37 degrees zzso increased stacking of the zzso zzso steps, and a single zzso that was flipped away from the central portion of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which were designed to adopt zzso containing alternative zzso zzso steps, revealed zzso containing zzso zzso steps, zzso of approximately zzso and approximately zzso respectively, and distorted zzso The results suggest that DNA sequences containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso adopt hairpin zzso that contain zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso the mismatched zzso are zzso at zzso pH but are not zzso We propose that zzso arises from the stacking of two zzso in the minor groove of a distorted zzso
