The species zzso zzso currently includes three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from milk sources, and zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso In this study, three zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso of brown trout zzso zzso and rainbow trout zzso zzso These strains were closely related to members of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to that of the type strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso % similarity to the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the close relationship between the novel strains and zzso zzso zzso zzso with similarities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The three strains could, however, be differentiated from their closest relatives on the basis of several zzso zzso as was the case for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which were also closely related on the basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence zzso The strains isolated in this study represent a new subspecies, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
