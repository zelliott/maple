We have identified in rabbit zzso cells two alternatively spliced transcripts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso has a novel zzso zzso zzso immediately after the predicted zzso zzso segment, whereas zzso has a zzso deletion between zzso and zzso creating a zzso and a premature termination zzso zzso acid identity between mouse zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Two transcript sizes of zzso and zzso zzso were detected in brain, zzso stomach, zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in zzso thin limbs of zzso loop, zzso and cortical thick ascending limbs of zzso loop, and zzso zzso and inner zzso collecting zzso however, it was rarely detected in zzso convoluted zzso zzso is most abundant in inner zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso generates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells could be activated by zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso transcripts are expressed in multiple zzso segments and that the magnitude of zzso expression varies among different zzso zzso
