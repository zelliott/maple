An 81 zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso island zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso zzso pneumonia in zzso but its specific function in zzso and regulation of zzso zzso genes is zzso Using a zzso selection marker developed for zzso zzso in this study, in combination with an zzso resistance zzso an efficient zzso zzso zzso targeted gene zzso procedure was used to mutate three zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulatory gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso response regulator zzso zzso and a gene zzso of unknown function that is highly expressed by zzso zzso inside zzso as well as the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso testing by liver clearance after intravenous injection in mice showed that the zzso and zzso zzso were fully zzso that the zzso zzso was zzso and that zzso of the zzso zzso remained zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso was used to compare the zzso gene expression profile of each of the four zzso zzso against the parental zzso zzso zzso Changes were limited to zzso genes and gene induction was observed for all zzso suggesting that expression of zzso zzso genes is dominated by a negative regulatory zzso The finding of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso despite enhanced zzso of zzso suggests that factors other than zzso are important for full expression of zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso was strongly and similarly induced in all zzso zzso a common regulatory zzso affecting this gene for all four zzso zzso zzso is apparently the zzso of this common zzso Two distinct highly correlated gene induction patterns were observed, that of the zzso and zzso zzso and that of the zzso and zzso zzso The gene induction pattern distinguishing these two groups paralleled their zzso in zzso
