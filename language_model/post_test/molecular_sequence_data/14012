zzso zzso zzso is an zzso technique which provides zzso high resolution analysis of amplified DNA fragments produced by the zzso chain reaction zzso In this study, two internal standards are used as size markers to zzso und precisely size zzso zzso The technique is applied to typing zzso products from the short tandem repeat locus zzso zzso consists of five to seven major zzso in the size range of zzso zzso with each zzso four zzso zzso Using this genetic marker, a population containing 97 individuals was examined with both zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso were obtained with both techniques demonstrating the reliability of zzso in DNA typing zzso The DNA analysis took place in sets of 10 with a zzso of the zzso being performed between each set of zzso For the 97 samples zzso the pooled standard zzso was zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso determined from the sample set did not zzso significantly from zzso zzso From these zzso results, we conclude that zzso zzso products can be accurately and precisely sized by zzso zzso using the method zzso
