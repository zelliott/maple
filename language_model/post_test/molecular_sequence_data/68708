We have developed a novel coincidence cloning strategy, termed zzso zzso which enables the rapid generation of large numbers of region specific zzso zzso Painting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification of flow sorted zzso zzso zzso The zzso products are zzso in zzso onto specific flow sorted zzso for zzso sequence zzso zzso and zzso material is then cloned using a novel insert end revelation and zzso zzso zzso zzso range in size from zzso zzso of which approximately zzso appear to be single copy zzso The cloning method permits the zzso of zzso free probe for library zzso screening and the small insert size zzso analysis for the generation of sequence zzso sites zzso We have used such clones successfully for zzso screening by zzso and for zzso screening by filter zzso This new methodology should allow the rapid zzso with zzso of regions defined by specific zzso zzso
