Diversity among zzso toxins mirrors the high species diversity in the zzso region, and evolution of both is thought to stem from zzso specialization derived from zzso zzso This study focuses on zzso zzso a zzso zzso endemic to the temperate northeast zzso Essentially free of zzso zzso it zzso on a wider variety of organisms than any other cone zzso Using molecular cloning of zzso and mass zzso we examined peptides isolated from zzso ducts to zzso the sequences and zzso modifications of two zzso toxins zzso and zzso of type 12 zzso that block zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso of leader sequence and mode of action, these toxins are related to the zzso but differ significantly from other members of that zzso Six of the eight zzso zzso constitute the zzso framework of zzso but two additional zzso zzso in the zzso region define an zzso zzso within the zzso Fifteen putative zzso of zzso toxins have been identified by zzso that differ primarily in two short zzso regions and have been grouped into three zzso zzso This unique modular variation has not been described for other zzso toxins and suggests zzso as a zzso zzso We propose that these toxin zzso show specificity for similar molecular targets zzso zzso in the many species zzso on by zzso zzso and that individualistic zzso of specific toxin zzso may involve control of gene zzso
