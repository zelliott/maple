A zzso study was carried out on an zzso strain zzso from marine zzso collected from the East Sea, zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence studies showed that this strain belonged to the zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso The isolate was zzso zzso and slightly zzso and grew in zzso % zzso and at zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso shared some zzso and zzso properties with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was 45 zzso zzso zzso possessed zzso : zzso summed feature 4 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso and summed feature 7 zzso : zzso as the major cellular fatty zzso zzso zzso data indicated that strain zzso represents a distinct species that is separate from zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso evidence, it is proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents the type strain of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
