zzso The zzso is one of a number of G zzso receptors which have been proposed to contain seven zzso zzso The function of this zzso appears to be regulated by zzso by a specific zzso the zzso zzso zzso peptides which comprise each of the proposed zzso and zzso zzso of the beta zzso have been tested as potential zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Two peptides which zzso the middle and terminal portions of the zzso tail of the zzso served as zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso reaction, however, suggest that these peptides are zzso poorer zzso than the zzso occupied zzso zzso A number of synthetic peptides also served as zzso of beta zzso zzso by zzso zzso In particular, a zzso which comprised the first zzso loop of the beta zzso zzso acids zzso inhibited most effectively with an zzso of 40 zzso zzso These results suggest that multiple zzso regions of the zzso may serve as potential sites of interaction with zzso zzso Moreover, these regions may serve as potential targets for the development of specific zzso of zzso zzso which could be used to block zzso zzso
