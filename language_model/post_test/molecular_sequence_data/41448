zzso zzso an important target for zzso therapy, contributes to pancreatic cancer zzso progression and zzso However, zzso compensation regulation can help cells to resist the targeted zzso Gene zzso method such as zzso may help to understand this zzso regulatory system and discover novel therapeutic zzso In this study, two stable zzso cell lines were constructed through zzso zzso targeting zzso of zzso cells, to investigate cell response to the zzso of zzso Human whole zzso zzso was then used to compare the gene expression zzso As a result, zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were dramatically zzso by zzso zzso To identify whether zzso or zzso was critical for zzso cells, zzso against zzso and zzso were designed and zzso in zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso or zzso expression significantly suppressed cell zzso induced cell arrest at zzso phase and enhanced cell zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso or zzso markedly decreased the zzso zzso zzso Our findings imply that zzso interference against zzso and zzso is of potential value for intervention of pancreatic zzso
