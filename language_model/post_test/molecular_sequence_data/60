zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso have important functions in cellular zzso The inventory of these zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is incomplete even in well-studied organisms, and so far, no zzso methods exist to predict such zzso from zzso sequences zzso The zzso of these transcripts that is zzso zzso usually has zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that a zzso comparative zzso approach searching for short zzso zzso is capable of identifying zzso transcripts with a high zzso Our approach requires neither an open reading frame nor substantial sequence or secondary structure conservation in the surrounding zzso Thus it identifies spliced transcripts in an unbiased zzso After applying our approach to insect zzso we predict zzso zzso outside zzso coding zzso of which 131 are confirmed by expressed sequence tags zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Of the remaining zzso novel zzso about half are associated with zzso zzso extending coding or untranslated regions or likely belonging to zzso coding zzso The remaining 129 zzso belong to novel zzso that are largely zzso Using zzso we verified seven of 12 tested zzso in novel zzso and 11 of 17 zzso in novel coding zzso The expression level of all verified zzso transcripts is low but varies during development, which suggests zzso As zzso zzso indicate both zzso selection on the zzso structure and zzso expression of the transcript in related species, the novel zzso are good candidates for functional zzso
