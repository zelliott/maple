The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso originated from zzso of the East China seas and underwent zzso freshwater radiation from the zzso to the early zzso The distribution of its genetic diversity presents a random pattern inconsistent with contemporary zzso zzso In the present study, zzso simulations were used to analyze its zzso zzso zzso zzso history simulation supported the hypothesis of long-distance zzso during the zzso based on multiple unrelated founding zzso This analogous genetic pattern has been described for other zzso freshwater fish, and may represent a general history zzso model for the zzso of these zzso From network analysis, three zzso zzso zzso grouped consistently with three probable ancestral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis also revealed that the ancestral zzso group zzso 1) dispersed into freshwater during an zzso age about zzso while zzso 2 and 3 dispersed about zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso population remained relatively small for a considerable amount of time during the zzso ages, with population expansion events mainly occurring after the last glacial maximum zzso
