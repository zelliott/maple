This report describes the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso from mouse that we have named mouse zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso is approximately zzso zzso and when used as a probe on a Northern zzso of mouse zzso from zzso and cultured cells, several bands were zzso The open reading frame is zzso zzso acids and has zzso identity over its length with zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso protein converted specific zzso to zzso in a number of zzso zzso The positions modified in zzso amounts in zzso were zzso in the zzso stem and also positions 34 and 36 in the zzso of an zzso containing zzso A human zzso was also cloned and the smaller open reading frame zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical over its length with zzso but is shorter by 45 zzso acids at the zzso zzso The expressed zzso human protein has no activity on any of the zzso zzso most probably the result of the truncated open reading zzso
