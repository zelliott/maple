zzso zzso is a zzso polarity regulator that organizes molecular networks in a wide range of cell zzso In zzso it functions as a plasma membrane landmark to organize the zzso zzso zzso is a scaffold protein that interacts with proteins through its three zzso zzso density 95, discs large, zzso zzso zzso and other zzso In addition, zzso has been shown to interact with zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso interact with the zzso charged zzso zzso acid immobilized on solid zzso or in zzso The interaction requires multiple zzso zzso and zzso patches of positively charged zzso acid zzso appear to mediate the zzso zzso or decreasing levels of zzso zzso or zzso zzso that produce zzso zzso a role for zzso acid in zzso embryonic zzso activity but not its zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso acid binding revealed a possible role in zzso zzso and zzso These data zzso a closer connection between zzso and membrane lipids than previously zzso zzso polarity landmarks may be conglomerates of proteins and plasma membrane lipids that modify each other's activities for an integrated effect on cell zzso
