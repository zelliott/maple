We report here the results of a systematic high-resolution X-ray zzso analysis of complexes of the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso metal zzso An unexpected observation revealed by this study is the existence of a specific zzso binding site in a shallow pocket at the molecular surface of the zzso 30 A away from the zzso zzso This previously unidentified zzso pocket, which lies at the interface between fingers and zzso may be an zzso regulatory site and could play a role in allowing alternative interactions between the two zzso during a possible zzso change of the zzso required for efficient zzso The electron density map at zzso resolution clearly shows the mode of binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso In the zzso site, density corresponding to the zzso of zzso bound to the zzso metals was apparent in each complex with zzso Moreover, a network of zzso zzso was zzso these zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso of the zzso observed in the initiation complex reported for the zzso of zzso zzso strengthening the proposal that the two zzso initiate replication de zzso by similar zzso No equivalent of the protein stacking platform observed for the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso however, again suggesting that a change in zzso of the thumb domain takes place upon template binding to allow for efficient de zzso initiation of zzso zzso
