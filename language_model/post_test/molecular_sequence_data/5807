zzso and zzso are related peptides that activate common zzso zzso signaling molecules in the zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from urine and zzso but was not detected in extracts from the colon of zzso zzso was identified in extracts from small and large zzso but was not detected in zzso zzso and zzso have distinct zzso and zzso properties that facilitated the zzso zzso and identification of these zzso Northern zzso revealed that zzso transcripts for zzso were more abundant in small zzso compared with large zzso whereas zzso zzso levels were greater in large zzso relative to small zzso zzso rat zzso and zzso had similar zzso in the zzso of receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso is consistent with the zzso that both peptides influence the activity of an zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso that regulates the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso
