Members of the zzso family of protein zzso zzso zzso proteins are required for the transmission of signals from a variety of cell surface zzso particularly those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso function has been implicated in zzso and regulation of the immune system, and recent data suggest that the zzso zzso gene may play a role in zzso We have isolated and characterized zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso possesses 2 zzso genes that occupy zzso zzso segments in the zzso zzso and these segments conserve zzso relationships with zzso genes in zzso zzso suggesting an ancient zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed at high levels in zzso precursors of primitive and definitive waves and at a lower level in early central nervous system and developing fin zzso zzso is expressed in the developing lens and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso The expression of zzso was examined in zzso zzso and found to be disrupted in zzso and zzso suggesting an early role in zzso Taken together with recent gene knockout data in the zzso we suggest that zzso may be functionally equivalent to zzso zzso with a role in early zzso
