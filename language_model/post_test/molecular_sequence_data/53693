To zzso the structural zzso governing specificity in zzso growth factor zzso zzso we have determined the crystal structures of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (between zzso zzso define a general binding site for all zzso zzso zzso is achieved through interactions between the zzso and central regions of zzso and two loop regions in D3 that are subject to alternative zzso These structures provide a molecular basis for zzso as a universal zzso zzso and for zzso of zzso specificity through primary sequence variations and alternative zzso
