The mechanisms responsible for efficient zzso of zzso by cells of the zzso cell zzso lineage remain incompletely zzso One pathway, zzso of zzso complexes via zzso (the type II zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso enhances zzso presentation zzso over zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso express two additional zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso which may also participate in zzso functions such as zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso release of oxygen zzso and enhancement of zzso zzso A zzso active form of zzso was recently demonstrated on human blood DC, but complete functional potential of zzso on the DC lineage remains zzso zzso highly zzso human blood DC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after overnight zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared for zzso zzso and zzso functions of zzso Both DC and zzso zzso expression was increased by zzso and zzso but while zzso zzso was decreased by zzso DC zzso remained zzso zzso functional differences were also evident between the DC and the zzso zzso generated robust zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso release and zzso activity, while DC failed to release zzso oxygen zzso and demonstrated minimal zzso activity, despite apparently normal expression of the zzso zzso and the signaling zzso zzso In contrast, DC were more efficient than zzso with respect to T cell zzso when zzso was targeted specifically to zzso These new findings suggest a previously unappreciated potential for zzso to shape the immune response by dramatically increasing the efficiency with which DC zzso zzso prior to achieving full T cell zzso zzso
