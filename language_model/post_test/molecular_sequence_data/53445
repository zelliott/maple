zzso zzso have a characteristic zzso structure and are composed of multiple copies of a zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso The assembly of zzso virus zzso is unique among zzso in that the process occurs late in virus assembly and in association with zzso zzso The goal of this study was to identify host cell proteins which may be involved in regulating zzso virus zzso assembly through their interactions with the zzso zzso zzso was used as bait to screen a zzso zzso library using the zzso zzso zzso One protein that zzso strongly with zzso was zzso a cellular protein which is known to interact with other viral zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was confirmed using a number of different in zzso and in zzso methods, and the site of interaction between these two proteins was shown to be at the zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso virus structural proteins resulted in zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso site in zzso is a potentially zzso region that zzso the viral zzso domain of zzso Our results are consistent with the possibility that the interaction of zzso with zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso assembly and/or zzso zzso
