Multiple zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso known to zzso the abundant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that the chick zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso designated zzso has a role in growth plate zzso zzso The relationship of these zzso to zzso signaling is obscure, and as part of our investigation we have examined the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated expression of zzso in a variety of mouse zzso comparable to the expression of other zzso zzso but less restricted than the expression of zzso in zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso When the zzso active site zzso was altered to zzso by zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso confirming the zzso of zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso and human zzso proteins share zzso identity with the rat zzso and zzso identity with zzso with conservation of the zzso consensus sequence that retains proteins in the zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso zzso and zzso genes is also zzso compared to the chick zzso zzso zzso analysis of plant and fruit fly zzso zzso supports the hypothesis that the zzso zzso constitute a distinct evolutionary group within the zzso zzso zzso We have mapped zzso to human zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and radiation hybrid zzso This assignment places zzso in a region of zzso 10 that is frequently zzso in human zzso and places zzso zzso to the tumor zzso zzso which maps to zzso Using a radiation hybrid panel, we localized zzso to a region of mouse zzso 19 that includes the zzso zzso of zzso The evolutionary conservation of this novel zzso within the zzso zzso zzso suggests a significant role for multiple zzso zzso zzso throughout higher zzso
