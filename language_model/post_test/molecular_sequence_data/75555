zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that exhibits a complex cycle of zzso differentiation involving the formation of an aerial zzso of zzso zzso which undergo zzso to form long chains of zzso We report the identification of two proteins of 13 and 3 zzso designated zzso and zzso respectively, that are produced during formation of the aerial zzso and are found in zzso with zzso mature zzso We cloned the structural gene zzso for one of these zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis suggests that the zzso zzso is derived from a larger zzso or zzso containing a leader sequence of 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and experiments using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a gene tag demonstrated that expression of zzso is controlled from a promoter contained within a region of less than 110 base pairs in zzso whose zzso start site is located approximately 50 base pairs upstream from the initiation zzso for the zzso open reading zzso zzso of zzso was induced at the time of appearance of the aerial zzso and the level of zzso transcripts was significantly reduced in certain zzso blocked in aerial zzso zzso and or spore zzso zzso As further evidence of the association of zzso zzso with zzso zzso experiments in which we monitored zzso zzso zzso by use of a zzso zzso fusion demonstrated a close spatial correlation between colony regions undergoing aerial zzso formation and zones of zzso light zzso
