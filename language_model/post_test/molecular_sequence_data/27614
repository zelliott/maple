The results of zzso zzso of zzso Jones zzso zzso and their zzso fragments are zzso The zzso zzso of constant region zzso fragments, which were derived from zzso zzso Jones proteins with three different zzso gave zzso originating from two zzso and one zzso zzso From comparisons of the results obtained by using zzso zzso Jones proteins that possess the known zzso acid sequences with those for the zzso fragments, it was concluded that the zzso signals observed in the case of zzso Jones proteins are all due to the zzso zzso On the basis of the results obtained by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso myeloma proteins along with their zzso zzso and zzso fragments, it was concluded that zzso signals for the zzso region all originate from the variable zzso The zzso region gives two zzso zzso one of which has been assigned to zzso We have also shown that the second zzso signal is due to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein A has also been examined by the zzso zzso
