zzso zzso presents an enormous challenge with up to 100 zzso protein targets in the human zzso zzso At current rates of structure zzso judicious selection of targets is zzso Here, a zzso approach to target selection is described which makes use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database of zzso of zzso Groups zzso The strategy is designed so that each new protein structure is likely to provide novel zzso zzso To demonstrate this approach, the zzso solution structure of zzso zzso a putative translation initiation factor from zzso coli, has been determined and its fold zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso an integral component of the translation initiation complex in zzso The structure consists of two zzso zzso packed against the same side of a zzso zzso The first 31 zzso of the zzso zzso protein are zzso in zzso Comparative analysis indicates that the folded portion of zzso resembles a number of structures with the zzso zzso zzso though its sequence is not zzso to any of zzso Thus, the zzso approach to target selection described here was used successfully to identify a new zzso zzso within this zzso
