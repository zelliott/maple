zzso zzso natural killer T cells zzso zzso have been well characterized in humans and mice, but it is unknown whether they are present in other zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso alpha chain and the full length zzso transcript of pig and zzso zzso modeling predicts that zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso form complexes that are highly zzso to the human zzso Since a prerequisite for the presence of zzso cells is the expression of zzso zzso we performed searches for zzso genes and zzso transcripts in multiple zzso Previously, cattle and guinea pig have been suggested to lack zzso zzso The zzso genes of European zzso cattle zzso zzso are known to be zzso because of zzso zzso in the start zzso and in the donor zzso site of the first zzso Here we show that the same zzso are found in six other zzso African zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, intact zzso transcripts were found in guinea zzso African zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the discovery of a highly zzso zzso system in pig and zzso our data suggest that functional zzso and zzso zzso cells are not universally present in zzso
