zzso off resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a commonly used method of zzso zzso zzso for fragmentation in zzso transform mass zzso zzso To achieve the degree of fragmentation zzso both the zzso frequency and zzso must be zzso This is a time-consuming zzso particularly when the zzso values of the precursor zzso vary over a broad zzso We present an approach that zzso this zzso by zzso the zzso frequency of the zzso to be fragmented as a constant percentage of the reduced zzso zzso Using this approach, the optimal zzso was found to be significantly less dependent on the zzso value of the precursor zzso and therefore required little or no zzso This method considerably simplified zzso of zzso for analysis of zzso zzso and peptides over the mass range zzso zzso requiring zzso of only a single experimental zzso the zzso zzso and only for the first zzso zzso
