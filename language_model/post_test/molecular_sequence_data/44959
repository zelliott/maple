Several zzso and zzso that occur as major components in extracts of the yellow zzso zzso strain of the marine zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized with respect to their mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso properties, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The investigated proteins were as zzso yellow zzso protein zzso with bound zzso zzso or zzso a blue zzso protein zzso with bound zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso as zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We present evidence that the zzso zzso has an zzso sequence corresponding to that published for the zzso zzso We show that an equilibrium replacement of the zzso can be made with excess zzso zzso and that zzso zzso has different zzso properties to those of the zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso is a different protein again, and in the bacterial zzso it occurs in multiple forms, zzso to either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso The zzso sequence for zzso shows similarities to those of the zzso proteins and to zzso protein and zzso zzso from zzso zzso in any form has no zzso or zzso zzso A zzso fluorescent zzso with zzso as zzso has an zzso sequence highly similar to those of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in previous preparations of zzso have been removed and are identified as the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both inhibit the zzso zzso in the zzso system with the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The spectral properties of zzso are similar to those of other zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso have zzso zzso similar to those of the respective zzso from the zzso bacteria zzso and zzso
