zzso modern breeding and artificial selection have shaped dramatically the zzso zzso of domestic zzso In zzso the so-called zzso quantitative trait locus zzso in zzso zzso 4 was the first zzso uncovered although, to date, its precise molecular nature has remained zzso Here, we characterize the zzso zzso of 13 fragments of zzso equally spaced in a zzso region in the vicinity of the zzso region in a zzso panel of 32 zzso Asian and European animals, including local Mediterranean and international pig breeds, were zzso zzso of genetic zzso were very complex and varied largely across zzso and zzso they did not reveal overall a clear signal of a selective sweep in any zzso although zzso zzso showed a significantly higher zzso We used an approximate zzso zzso approach to zzso the evolutionary history of this zzso zzso zzso we found that European pig populations have a much lower effective size than their Asian zzso in the order of hundreds vs hundreds of zzso We show also an important part of extant European zzso is actually due to zzso of Asian zzso into zzso This study shows how a potential loss in diversity caused by bottlenecks and possible selective sweeps associated with zzso and artificial selection can be zzso by migration, making it much more difficult the identification of selection zzso based on zzso demographic zzso Given the small zzso analyzed here, it remains to be studied how these conclusions apply to the rest of the zzso
