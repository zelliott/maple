The zzso interacting protein zzso 1 zzso is essential for the zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso by tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso at zzso and that this zzso is required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A point zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso its zzso as well as its ability to restore zzso zzso in a zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso also prevents the recruitment of zzso and zzso complexes to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso recruits zzso through the binding between the zzso chains and zzso a regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that disrupt its zzso binding also abolish zzso zzso These results reveal the zzso mechanism underlying the essential signaling function of zzso and provide direct evidence that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is required for zzso zzso
