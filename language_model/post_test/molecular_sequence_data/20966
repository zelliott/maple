The interaction with the host zzso system represents a novel component in the molecular zzso between zzso and human zzso Here, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share the key zzso zzso zzso as a surface zzso for human zzso zzso was zzso on the cell surface of the model strain zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein showed a high affinity for human zzso with an equilibrium zzso constant in the zzso zzso By zzso zzso we demonstrated that the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso involves an internal zzso site zzso to that of zzso zzso According to our data, the positively charged zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso charged zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are crucial for zzso zzso Acting as a human zzso zzso the zzso surface zzso is suggested to play an important role in the interaction process with the zzso
