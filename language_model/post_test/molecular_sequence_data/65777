Using a combination of bacterial and zzso zzso we analyzed two geographically remote sludge zzso enriched in a single bacterial species zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso unrestricted global movement of this species and identified aquatic zzso as the primary environmental reservoirs zzso zzso zzso related and geographically remote zzso strains differed principally in zzso regions zzso zzso defense zzso We found that zzso populations were high density, zzso and zzso providing natural targets for zzso zzso zzso Community expression analysis demonstrated that zzso were consistently active in the zzso zzso zzso signatures linking zzso to past zzso zzso were observed mostly between local zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso strains disperse globally but must adapt to zzso zzso pressure zzso
