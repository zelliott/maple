Factor zzso (Mr zzso is a blood zzso factor that zzso and strengthens the zzso zzso It zzso in blood as a zzso composed of two a zzso (Mr 75,000 each) and two b zzso (Mr zzso zzso The b zzso consists of zzso zzso acids and includes 10 tandem repeats of 60 zzso acids known as zzso structures, short consensus repeats zzso or sushi zzso In the present study, the human gene for the b zzso has been isolated from three different zzso libraries prepared in zzso zzso Fifteen independent zzso with zzso coding for the entire gene were isolated and characterized by restriction zzso Southern zzso and DNA zzso The gene was found to be 28 zzso in length and consisted of 12 zzso zzso separated by 11 intervening zzso The leader sequence was zzso by zzso I, while the zzso region of the protein was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso each coded for a single sushi domain, suggesting that the gene evolved through zzso zzso and zzso The 12 zzso in the gene ranged in size from 64 to 222 base pairs, while the zzso ranged in size from 87 to zzso zzso and made up zzso of the zzso The zzso contained four zzso repetitive zzso one each in zzso A, zzso I, and zzso A fifth zzso repeat was present in the zzso 3' end of the zzso Two partial zzso repeats were also found in the zzso including one in zzso I and one in zzso zzso The zzso repeat in zzso J was zzso zzso to a sequence of approximately zzso zzso zzso the gene coding for human beta zzso and approximately zzso zzso from the zzso zzso present in the gene for human factor zzso zzso H also contained an zzso family zzso while two potential regions for zzso were identified within zzso G and zzso One zzso change was found in the coding region of the gene when its sequence was compared to that of the zzso This difference, however, did not result in a change in the zzso acid sequence of the zzso
