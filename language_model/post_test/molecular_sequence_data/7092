A repetitive DNA from a zzso zzso zzso isolate was cloned and zzso The repeated segment was present in zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis but was absent from the six other zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that this repetitive element belonged to the zzso zzso repeat sequence type, a family of zzso repeated zzso This fragment, when used as a probe in restriction zzso length zzso zzso was able to detect zzso in zzso zzso zzso that went zzso when the established zzso was used as a zzso This repetitive element should be useful in zzso studies of bovine zzso
