zzso Yang 1 zzso is a zzso zzso factor that zzso zzso or zzso zzso of a diverse assortment of zzso Previous studies suggest a role for zzso in cellular growth and zzso but its biological function during development of the zzso zzso or zzso remains to be zzso We recently showed that zzso is abundantly expressed throughout zzso and early embryonic stages of zzso but it is zzso in the zzso and does not function directly in zzso zzso In the present study we used a series of zzso analyses to explore the potential function of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by zzso zzso suggesting that it associates with zzso expressed zzso in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to labeled zzso zzso zzso exclusion zzso of zzso zzso revealed that zzso exists in high molecular mass complexes in the range of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso treatment of zzso abolished the binding of zzso to zzso and resulted in zzso from zzso complexes to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso directly into the zzso released zzso from zzso complexes and unmasked its zzso activity, but did not promote zzso to the zzso These results provide evidence that zzso is a component of zzso zzso complexes in the zzso zzso indicating a novel function for zzso in the storage or metabolism of maternal zzso
