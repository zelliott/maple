The zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso that zzso signals from receptors to zzso are composed of zzso zzso and gamma zzso Whereas the role of alpha zzso in directly regulating zzso activity is widely accepted, it has recently been demonstrated that beta gamma zzso may also directly regulate zzso zzso This has made clear the importance of identifying and characterizing beta and gamma zzso We have isolated a zzso clone zzso a new gamma zzso referred to here as the gamma 7 zzso using zzso based on zzso sequences of a gamma zzso previously zzso from bovine zzso The clone contains a zzso zzso zzso which includes an open reading frame of 204 base pairs that predicts a zzso acid zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso The predicted protein shares zzso acid identities with the other known gamma zzso ranging from 38 to zzso Also characteristic of gamma zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The expression of the gamma 7 zzso as well as the gamma 2, gamma 3, and gamma 5 zzso was examined in several bovine zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso Whereas the gamma 2 and gamma 3 zzso were selectively expressed in brain, the gamma 5 and gamma 7 zzso were expressed in a variety of zzso Thus, the gamma 5 and gamma 7 zzso are the first G protein gamma zzso known that could participate in the regulation of widely distributed signal zzso zzso
