The zzso zzso a model for the primitive mode of zzso development, rapidly forms a zzso nervous system which consists of a small number of zzso Here, we have characterized the zzso regulation of an zzso zzso zzso gene to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying development of synaptic zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed in all zzso described in previous studies and zzso in the embryonic zzso zzso expression of zzso requires induction from the vegetal side of the zzso whereas zzso expression occurs autonomously in isolated zzso zzso Introduction of green fluorescent protein reporter gene zzso into the zzso zzso indicates that a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso upstream region contains promoter elements of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter suggests that zzso expression in zzso and in the embryonic zzso depends on distinct zzso zzso
