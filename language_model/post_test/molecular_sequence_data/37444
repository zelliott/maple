Through rapid serial transfer in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso evolved from a virus that is zzso and poorly zzso across the zzso zzso to a zzso that still maintains zzso usage but which is now zzso and establishes zzso infection zzso To determine whether envelope zzso zzso is responsible for increased zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso we cloned and zzso the dominant envelope gene zzso zzso zzso and characterized its functions in zzso zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso designated zzso was also constructed and assessed for its zzso and zzso zzso in zzso We found that, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resistance and increased entry efficiency of the virus but was compromised in its zzso zzso In zzso zzso infected two of two and two of three zzso zzso by the intravenous and zzso routes, zzso Nevertheless, although peak zzso reached zzso to zzso zzso copies per zzso of plasma in some infected animals and was associated with depletion of zzso zzso zzso none of the animals maintained a viral set point that would be zzso of progression to zzso Together, the data from this study suggest a lack of correlation between entry efficiency and zzso properties of envelope zzso with viral zzso Furthermore, whereas zzso zzso contains the zzso for enhanced zzso zzso of zzso the zzso of its increased zzso may require additional sequence changes in zzso zzso and/or maps to other viral zzso
