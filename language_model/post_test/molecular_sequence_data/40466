zzso N zzso proteins located at the zzso zzso of some zzso species have been implicated as receptors for zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso rapid amplification of zzso end zzso zzso The characteristic zzso sequence features were derived from deduced zzso acid sequences of the cloned zzso zzso sequences of the three zzso genes were identical between the zzso and zzso zzso However, total zzso zzso activity and gene expression of the three zzso from zzso larvae were significantly lower than those of the zzso zzso zzso interference zzso was employed using an oral zzso feeding technique for the three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressions of the three zzso genes by zzso were corresponding to the reductions in the specific zzso zzso In addition, zzso of all three zzso in zzso zzso in zzso by zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso Our results showed that reduction in expression of the three zzso is functionally associated with the zzso resistance in zzso zzso
