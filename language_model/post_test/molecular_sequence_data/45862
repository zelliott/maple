Recent evidence indicates a specific role for vascular zzso growth factor a zzso during artery development in both zzso and mouse zzso whereas less is known about signals that govern vein zzso In zzso loss of zzso blocks zzso artery formation and reduces zzso gene zzso whereas veins are largely zzso Here, we describe a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which eliminates its zzso activity and leads to specific defects in artery zzso We further find that zzso a zzso for zzso zzso with zzso during artery zzso but not zzso We also identify an additional zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso which can partially compensate for loss of zzso but is zzso for vascular development in zzso zzso Interestingly, we find that these zzso receptors are also required for formation of veins but in distinct genetic interactions that differ from those required for artery zzso Taken together, our results indicate that formation of arteries and veins in the zzso is governed in part by different zzso zzso combinations and suggest a genetic mechanism for generating blood vessel diversity during zzso zzso
