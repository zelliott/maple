A cluster of zzso genes of zzso zzso was identified and zzso This cluster comprises an zzso designated the zzso zzso which is initiated by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and maps at 185 zzso on the zzso In other bacteria, the zzso proteins zzso and zzso connect the zzso filament to the hook and are required for the last stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso through to zzso are transcribed as a single zzso and primer extension analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso is initiated by a zzso zzso promoter upstream of zzso zzso the zzso promoter element into a promoter probe cat zzso revealed that the zzso promoter element had strong activity in both zzso coli and zzso zzso In addition, when this construct was transformed into a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which lacked a functional zzso zzso 28 factor, the zzso promoter was still zzso Based on these results, the promoter element of the zzso gene zzso zzso referred to as zzso was zzso zzso encodes the zzso filament zzso and a zzso zzso promoter has been reported to be involved in the zzso of this zzso A zzso start point was found 1 zzso downstream of the reported start zzso The sequence around zzso and zzso are consistent with the presence of a zzso zzso promoter in addition to the putative zzso zzso promoter for zzso In contrast to the zzso promoter element, no activity was detected after zzso a zzso promoter element into the promoter probe cat zzso Because a zzso zzso promoter rather than a unique zzso zzso factor is involved in the later stage of zzso zzso the regulation of zzso zzso zzso genes is evidently different from that of other zzso
