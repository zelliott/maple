The relationship of function to structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso has been examined by means of sequence alignment and zzso zzso zzso has been made between the sequence of zzso and the two soluble bacterial zzso zzso zzso whose three-dimensional structure has been determined zzso and zzso From this comparison, it appears that although there is a similarity of overall structure in zzso zzso there is enough significant difference in the regions involved in zzso recognition and zzso binding that zzso believed to be involved, even in the known structures, must be zzso With this in mind, we have generated a detailed alignment of zzso including the definition of putative zzso and zzso based on comparison of the alignments of zzso and zzso generated from their three-dimensional structure, and have made zzso in regions we believe to be involved in zzso recognition at the zzso surface and orientation in the zzso zzso We have zzso zzso and zzso to determine if they are present in the zzso pocket, and zzso and zzso to determine if they are a part of the zzso recognition zzso Although zzso is essentially inactive and may be a folding zzso or may inhibit zzso zzso zzso is more active than the wild type and may be located in the zzso pocket zzso the hydrogen abstraction from C2 of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso also result in the anticipated changes in the apparent zzso and maximum zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
