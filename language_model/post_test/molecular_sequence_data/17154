The zzso zzso is the main zzso for protein degradation in zzso zzso The attachment of zzso to a zzso protein is zzso by three types of zzso namely a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Here, the structure of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been solved by a combination of zzso zzso zzso relaxation data and automated zzso zzso zzso to zzso structures solved previously by X-ray zzso or zzso shows in all cases the same compact fold, but differences are observed in the orientation of both N and zzso zzso The zzso zzso that is involved in binding to zzso zzso zzso displays a different position, which could have consequences for precise zzso zzso In addition, multiple zzso of the zzso of zzso are found in solution, which contrasts the single zzso zzso in the crystal structures of zzso zzso The possible implication of this zzso freedom of zzso for its zzso function is zzso
