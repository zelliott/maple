The switch zzso zzso zzso controls sexual development and dosage zzso It must be active in females and inactive in males throughout zzso Analysis of zzso zzso shows that this zzso regulation may be explained by differential zzso zzso only female transcripts appear to zzso functional products, whereas all male transcripts contain an zzso that zzso the open reading zzso The functional female product shows sequence similarities with zzso suggesting that it is an zzso binding zzso Thus, we propose that zzso encodes a factor that interacts with both its own zzso zzso for positive zzso and that of downstream genes to zzso zzso zzso In this way, a single, simple mechanism could account for both the maintenance and expression of the sexually determined zzso
