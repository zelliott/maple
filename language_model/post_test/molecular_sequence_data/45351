An aquatic zzso strain zzso was isolated on nutritionally poor medium zzso zzso soy broth diluted 100 times and solidified with zzso % zzso and characterized using a zzso zzso The isolate was unable to grow on commonly used nutritionally rich media such as zzso soy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the isolate was affiliated with the family zzso in the zzso zzso zzso it showed closest similarity zzso zzso with an zzso bacterial zzso zzso detected in a sludge microbial zzso Among the zzso bacteria, the isolate had highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities with other members of the zzso zzso were less than 85 zzso The fatty acid profile of the isolate grown on zzso indicated that the major fatty acid was zzso which is also present in many members of the family zzso zzso of strain zzso are zzso strictly zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of the isolate is zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso analyses clearly indicate that strain zzso represents a new zzso within the family zzso the name zzso zzso zzso is proposed for the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
