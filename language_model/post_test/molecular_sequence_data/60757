A zzso DNA zzso containing five zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was cloned and zzso Among these zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso acids long with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso This protein contains two zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso which activate zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso extension, using zzso isolated from the zzso cells, identified a zzso start site located 86 zzso upstream from the initiation zzso of zzso zzso that a promoter is located upstream from the start zzso zzso extension using total zzso isolated from zzso cells also identified a zzso start site located 61 zzso upstream from the initiation zzso of zzso Gene fusion studies demonstrated that in zzso zzso the cells transcribe the zzso zzso genes at two different stages of cell zzso The promoter is active during the log phase, and the activity reaches the highest level during the late log zzso The activity decreases sharply but is maintained at a low level for approximately 24 h after cells enter the early stationary zzso The results of this investigation also suggest that the zzso of zzso is positively regulated during the late log zzso zzso presented zzso provide further insight into zzso synthesis by zzso zzso zzso
