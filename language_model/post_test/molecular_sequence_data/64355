We isolated active zzso in zzso zzso DNA zzso alpha that were associated with a zzso in error zzso Among them, zzso DNA zzso alpha has a spontaneous error frequency of 3 in 100 zzso and zzso lower replication zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso a zzso zzso and are synergistic with zzso or zzso suggesting that DNA zzso zzso replication errors are recognized and repaired by mismatch zzso In zzso zzso DNA zzso alpha zzso efficient bypass of a zzso zzso zzso zzso extending the 3' T zzso more efficiently than the zzso zzso is equivalent to zzso zzso in zzso DNA zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso has reduced zzso DNA synthesis activity in zzso These data suggest that zzso DNA synthesis by DNA zzso alpha is required for zzso stability in zzso The data also suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso DNA zzso respectively, might have played a role in the functional evolution of these zzso zzso
