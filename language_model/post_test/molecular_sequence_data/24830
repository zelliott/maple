The zzso r locus encodes a zzso factor that regulates the zzso expression of the plant zzso zzso In an unusual example of gene regulatory diversity, the zzso zzso strong seed zzso and the zzso zzso plant zzso zzso of r have zzso tissue specificity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso P and zzso zzso with zzso zzso element zzso zzso or zzso produce colored seed derivatives zzso during zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso in 3' regions of r produce crossover zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso elements inserted in zzso regions produce rare zzso derivatives borne on zzso zzso Among 52 such zzso zzso zzso 18 are indistinguishable from the zzso zzso in zzso and DNA sequence zzso zzso The remaining 34 derivatives have strong zzso zzso including darkly pigmented zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso are unique from either zzso but are similar to those of some naturally occurring r zzso Both classes of zzso derivatives are explained by gene conversion between the promoter region of zzso and a zzso region located zzso to zzso The zzso intermediate formed between zzso zzso and P results in deletion of the zzso element alone or both zzso and a nearby unrelated zzso zzso zzso
