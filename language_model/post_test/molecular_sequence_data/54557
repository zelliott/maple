In zzso including zzso zzso immune molecules are known to be zzso or produced de zzso upon exposure to zzso or zzso These molecules are regulatory in nature acting against zzso or pathogen infection and zzso Similarly, there are molecules that are zzso to facilitate zzso development in the zzso zzso zzso a major zzso transporting zzso in the zzso of insects, is implicated as a helper zzso in the zzso mechanism and zzso of zzso and pathogen development in zzso In the present study, zzso of a 240 zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso infected with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It was identified as a zzso through zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene also was identified through zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso and it allows successful development of the zzso The role of zzso zzso and zzso of its zzso gene in this zzso could be implicated as a zzso for the zzso zzso
