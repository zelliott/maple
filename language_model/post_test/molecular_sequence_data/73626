A novel experimental system to study zzso in starving bacteria was zzso relying on the zzso of a zzso zzso degradation zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the starving culture of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso but not in the absence of zzso We ruled out the possibility that the absence of zzso eliminates zzso zzso from the starving zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that base zzso zzso and zzso of zzso can result in creation of a sequence similar to the zzso promoter zzso One particular C zzso A zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso that arose in the starving population under selection for zzso zzso In contrast, various deletions were the most frequent zzso zzso occurring in a culture growing without zzso The zzso rate of the zzso zzso on selective plates was found to be higher for bacteria zzso from zzso culture than that from zzso growing zzso This suggests that some specific zzso occurring predominantly in zzso cells, facilitate generation and/or fixation of such zzso
