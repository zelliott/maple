zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso species endemic to the zzso Islands zzso zzso of the southern part of zzso To place them within a zzso framework of Asian zzso species, we examined the molecular relationships among these species and zzso zzso zzso and zzso using an analysis of zzso zzso b gene zzso zzso and nuclear zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the four main zzso zzso and zzso zzso at similar evolutionary times, namely at the time of the radiation of zzso 14 to 40 million years ago, depending on different concepts for the divergence times of zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso separated from the zzso group more zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso and the zzso group zzso at zzso of the divergence time of zzso and zzso under the assumption of the molecular clock, suggesting that zzso zzso established its lineage at least by the beginning of the zzso zzso It is thus evident that the Okinawa area preserves rare indigenous species with various levels of genetic zzso
