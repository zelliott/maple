Many zzso proteins have been found from snake zzso Recently, zzso acid zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was reported to inhibit zzso factor zzso however, the mechanism of its zzso activity is still zzso Here, we re-evaluated the zzso activity of zzso We first zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and examined the effect of zzso zzso and the hydrogen zzso scavenger, zzso on the zzso activity of zzso We found that the isolated zzso fraction zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso time and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not inhibit these zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso fraction contained a small amount of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso time and degradation of zzso were inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso we concluded that the zzso activity of the zzso fraction was caused by the zzso zzso
