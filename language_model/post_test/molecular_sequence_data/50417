Many plants zzso and accumulate zzso in response to zzso zzso Despite the importance of this pathway, however, the exact zzso route and zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso in plants have not been unequivocally zzso We report here the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities that zzso the first two steps in zzso zzso The two zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso coli and contain a zzso zzso in each domain, which may facilitate zzso or zzso interaction of this zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity is feedback regulated by zzso but is less sensitive to zzso zzso than is the zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed at high levels in zzso leaves and is zzso in roots subjected to salt stress, suggesting that zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso leading to zzso in zzso
