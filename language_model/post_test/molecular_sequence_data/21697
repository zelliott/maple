zzso zzso muscle disease zzso is an zzso zzso disease associated with zzso zzso zzso Past studies in our laboratory recognized a very high molecular weight skeletal muscle protein zzso identified by zzso patient zzso as the zzso zzso These past studies used zzso from zzso and zzso patients as zzso to screen a human skeletal muscle zzso library and several zzso clones revealed supporting expression of zzso zzso This study characterizes the products of zzso the zzso zzso domain into zzso and the subsequent fusion zzso zzso analysis of the fusion gene indicates the cloned zzso domain zzso zzso zzso is in frame and is derived from a sequence of zzso spanning the zzso zzso an area that encodes the zzso III zzso zzso and zzso restriction mapping studies have demonstrated that the inserted zzso is of a size that is predicted by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the fusion protein result in the isolation of a zzso of 52 zzso consistent with the predicted zzso zzso acid zzso zzso experiments of the fusion zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that only the zzso domain is zzso
