An isolate of the zzso fungus zzso zzso was collected from cultures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that had been maintained on tomato roots in greenhouse pots in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were placed on colonies of zzso zzso grown in zzso dishes to study ability of the isolate to trap various zzso zzso None of the zzso placed near adhesive knobs were zzso within 1 zzso To determine where zzso zzso fits within the existing zzso of zzso zzso the zzso regions of zzso and the nuclear gene zzso were zzso for the new isolate of zzso zzso for the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for an isolate of zzso zzso distinct from the one listed in zzso zzso trees were constructed showing the closest molecular relative of zzso zzso to be the newly zzso isolate of zzso zzso the latter had a highly divergent sequence from the sequence recorded in zzso for a different isolate of zzso zzso zzso consistent and discrete zzso characters are absent in these related zzso so an independent molecular character should be considered essential for their accurate zzso
