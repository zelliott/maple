A zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso containing a zzso zzso gene with an amber zzso at the 8th position counted from the first zzso zzso was isolated from a child with acute zzso The virus was predicted to express a zzso viral translated from the 2nd zzso zzso at the 46th zzso acid position and consisting of 331 zzso zzso The virus was as sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed the same level of zzso activity as the zzso zzso at reaction temperatures of 34 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 39 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the replication of the zzso and drug-resistant zzso and zzso in zzso cells in which the zzso zzso was expressed to the same extent as in cells in which intact zzso was zzso whereas zzso and zzso inhibited the replication of these viruses less strongly in cells in which zzso was zzso It can be concluded that the zzso zzso exists in nature as a zzso and possesses the necessary zzso activities to form zzso from zzso to form zzso through zzso from zzso and to form zzso through zzso from zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso with a deletion of the first 45 zzso acid zzso is zzso the same as that of zzso zzso in terms of the zzso activity of zzso zzso virus zzso
