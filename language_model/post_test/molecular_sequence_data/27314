zzso zzso is a zzso plant pathogen that causes a range of diseases in several and important zzso Through comparative zzso sequence analysis many genes were identified and, among them, several potentially involved in zzso zzso The experimental determination of the primary sequence of some markedly expressed proteins for zzso zzso and the comparison with the zzso acids sequence of zzso identified one of them as being zzso zzso gene zzso The comparative analysis of this protein against zzso database, in special, resulted in similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso causing interest for being one of the most abundant proteins both in the whole cell extract as well as in the zzso protein zzso It is known that zzso zzso are involved in a process termed zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso when plant tissue is zzso Although the complete zzso sequences of zzso zzso are available and the zzso process is well known, the biological role of this protein in this zzso is not yet functionally zzso In this study we presented the zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and its probable function in the cellular zzso The successful cloning and zzso expression in zzso coli resulted in a satisfactory amount of the zzso zzso expressed in a zzso and active form giving convenient access to pure zzso for zzso and structural zzso Finally, our results confirmed that the product of the gene zzso can be positively assigned as zzso zzso
