The zzso side chains of the major plasma zzso of the horse and zzso have been characterized by zzso analyses of protein blots from two-dimensional gels using the major human plasma zzso alpha zzso zzso as a zzso Eight zzso were used in the characterization in conjunction with zzso zzso of complex and high zzso side zzso chemical zzso and zzso and one round of zzso zzso all being performed on the zzso zzso Assuming a standard complex side chain structure, the results of the 21 zzso combinations were interpreted as indicating that the zzso proteins consist of partially zzso zzso side chains except for the most zzso proteins which have zzso side zzso The zzso proteins have zzso and zzso side chains with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
