In recent years it has become clear that small zzso zzso function as regulatory elements in bacterial zzso and bacterial stress zzso We tested for the presence of the small zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso as possible regulators of gene expression in this zzso 

In this study, we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene encodes two small zzso zzso of zzso is activated by the zzso protein and zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso are required for repression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein component of the zzso transport system, showing that the zzso zzso have regulatory zzso A deletion of the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a decrease in the generation time of the zzso as well as a change in colony zzso 

The results of this study indicate that the zzso zzso zzso gene encodes two small zzso regulatory zzso that repress zzso zzso A zzso deletion is zzso suggesting that the zzso are likely involved in controlling genes in addition to zzso
