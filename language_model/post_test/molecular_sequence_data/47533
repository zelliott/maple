zzso zzso mice are defective in that they are highly resistant to zzso shock as compared with normal zzso zzso Their B cells and zzso do not respond significantly when exposed to zzso zzso whereas cells from the zzso mice zzso Using a functional zzso we previously isolated a zzso which encodes for zzso zzso We now show that this gene is zzso in zzso mice, which accounts for their resistance to zzso zzso zzso analysis of independent zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso B cells of zzso mice reveals a consistent single base substitution at position zzso where a zzso is replaced with a zzso In zzso zzso maps the zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso By zzso gene transfer, the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso can restore zzso responsiveness of zzso zzso zzso gene transfer in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice from septic zzso Thus zzso is an important target for zzso signal zzso and the zzso gene may be useful as a therapeutic sequence in gene therapy for zzso and septic zzso
