Fifteen of the 21 zzso zzso genes zzso found in the zzso of the medicinal zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso et zzso zzso Two are expressed zzso while the others are restricted in their expression to small numbers of cells, in some cases reflecting the membership of known networks of zzso coupled and zzso zzso or zzso zzso We report here that when zzso genes characteristic of discrete coupled networks were expressed zzso in zzso known not to express them, the experimental cells were found to become dye coupled with the other cells in that zzso zzso is normally expressed by only three zzso in each zzso which form strongly zzso electrical connections with each other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Scott, zzso zzso and zzso zzso But when zzso was zzso expressed in a variety of central embryonic zzso those cells became dye coupled with the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso is normally uniquely expressed by the zzso large zzso cells, but when it was zzso expressed in different central zzso they became dye coupled to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso did not yield any novel instances of dye zzso to zzso zzso zzso These results reveal that expression of certain zzso is sufficient to couple individual zzso to pre-existing networks in the zzso We propose that a primary zzso of selective zzso connectivity and circuit formation in the zzso is the surface expression of unique zzso of gap zzso zzso
