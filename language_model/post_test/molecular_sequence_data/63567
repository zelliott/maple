zzso zzso defense in zzso zzso relies on the zzso of the Toll zzso and the release of zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso Ten human zzso of Toll have been zzso with central roles in zzso of the innate host zzso In the present study, we report a putative human zzso of the zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a broad spectrum of activity against zzso zzso and other clinically relevant zzso zzso These effects are specific for zzso zzso no activity has been found against zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso also displays zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show the expression of zzso zzso in several human zzso particularly in the skin, consistent with its putative role as a zzso against invading zzso This is the first indication of an zzso human zzso with specific zzso activity, which is probably central in the defense against infections with zzso
