To examine the relationship between plant species composition and microbial community diversity and structure, we carried out a molecular analysis of microbial community structure and diversity in two field zzso In the first experiment, we examined bacterial community structure in bulk and zzso zzso in fields exposed to different plant diversity treatments, via a zzso zzso gene clone library zzso Clear differences were observed between bacterial communities of the bulk soil and the zzso with the latter containing lower bacterial zzso The second experiment focused on the influence of 12 different native zzso plant species on bacterial community size and structure in the zzso as well as the structure of zzso and zzso community zzso In general, bacterial and zzso quantitative zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso revealed only weak influences of plant species on zzso zzso Thus, although plants did exert an influence on microbial species composition and diversity, these interactions were not specific and selective enough to lead to major impacts of vegetation composition and plant species on zzso microbial zzso
