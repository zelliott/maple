A zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso has a novel and essential role in zzso DNA zzso Six zzso zzso zzso were bound to the zzso symmetrical portal zzso of zzso during the DNA zzso process and left the zzso after the zzso reaction was completed, suggesting that the zzso participated in the zzso of zzso DNA into zzso To further investigate the mechanism of DNA packaging, it is crucial to determine whether these six zzso molecules work as an integrated entity or each zzso acts as a functional zzso If zzso work individually, then do they work in sequence with communication or in random order without zzso zzso from compensation and zzso analysis did not support the integrated zzso zzso of the probability of combination between zzso and zzso zzso and experimental data of competitive zzso excluded the random model while favoring the proposal that the six zzso functioned zzso zzso action of the zzso also explains why the zzso is so sensitive to zzso since the effect of a zzso zzso will be amplified by 6 orders of magnitude after six consecutive steps, resulting in the observed complete loss of zzso activity caused by small zzso When any one of the six zzso was replaced with an inactive one, complete zzso of DNA packaging resulted, strongly supporting the speculation that individual zzso presumably together with other components such as the packaging zzso zzso take turns zzso successive steps of zzso Although the data provided here could not exclude the integrated model completely, there is no evidence so far to argue against the model of sequential zzso
