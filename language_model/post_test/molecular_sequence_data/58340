In the present study, we replaced the third zzso loop of the human zzso zzso with that of the human zzso zzso A modified zzso chain reaction overlap extension method was used to achieve the exact zzso in the zzso to show the importance of the zzso loop in zzso binding without interference from zzso zzso The replacement of the third zzso loop did not alter the affinity of zzso but caused a dramatic decrease in the affinity of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II and the zzso zzso zzso zzso 121 and zzso zzso The affinities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso zzso studies show that the mechanism of zzso recognition might be different for each structural class of zzso zzso
