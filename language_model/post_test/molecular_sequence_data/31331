The major coat protein of the zzso zzso zzso is inserted as an integral protein in the inner membrane of the zzso coli host upon zzso zzso coat protein is an ideal model membrane protein and has been the target of many zzso zzso An overview is presented here of the application of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to the study of the structure and dynamics of zzso coat protein in several zzso zzso The coat protein may be zzso enriched with zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowing the resolution and assignment of individual zzso zzso fluctuations at selected sites have been monitored using zzso relaxation and zzso zzso hydrogen exchange zzso A model is proposed for the structure of a coat protein zzso in zzso zzso
