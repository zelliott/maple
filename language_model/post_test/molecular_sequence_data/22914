zzso sequences were analyzed in 29 zzso unrelated zzso type 3 zzso zzso from the 7 zzso types to understand the molecular basis of the zzso diversity of zzso associated with childhood pneumonia in Korea during the period zzso Nine zzso zzso were observed among the 29 zzso zzso Five of the 9 involved zzso acid changes in zzso 1 zzso to Val at zzso 205 and zzso to zzso at zzso and loop 2 (His to zzso at zzso zzso to Ala at zzso and Ala to zzso at zzso The predicted zzso characteristics of this region have been affected by these zzso acid zzso The region surrounding zzso from zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso greater zzso than the region of other zzso types zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In particular, three zzso acid changes in loop 2 were associated with two new zzso types, zzso zzso and zzso which were recognized during later zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed that these two zzso types clustered into distinct lineages in the zzso zzso This result suggests that the genetic zzso of zzso zzso could play a potential role in the appearance of new zzso types and that it could affect the zzso characteristics of zzso
