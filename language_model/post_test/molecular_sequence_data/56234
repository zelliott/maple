zzso spot disease of tomato and pepper caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso is prevented by resistance genes in the plant that match genes for zzso in the zzso Based on DNA zzso to the zzso gene zzso which zzso the resistance response on pepper, we have isolated another zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso designated zzso This gene differs in specificity from zzso in inducing the hypersensitive response on tomato but not on zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed a high degree of zzso the zzso zzso open reading frame contains an internal region of zzso nearly identical 102 zzso repeat units that differ in their order from those present in the zzso zzso The coding region is zzso identical to zzso and expresses zzso a 122 zzso zzso thus representing a natural zzso of this zzso The previously isolated zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to the corresponding zzso zzso indicating that these genes might be zzso Interestingly, derivatives of zzso lacking the zzso region and part of the repetitive region are still able to zzso zzso in zzso The zzso gene is compared with the sequence of zzso derivatives generated by deletion of repeat units that also have zzso activity on zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso are flanked by a 62 zzso long zzso zzso which zzso speculations about the origin of the members of the zzso gene zzso
