We have isolated and zzso the complete coding sequences of the human genes for the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes code for proteins of zzso and 331 zzso zzso respectively, showing 91 and zzso zzso acid identity to their rat zzso We employed zzso in zzso zzso to map the zzso gene to human zzso zzso The zzso gene could be assigned to zzso less than 2 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the gene for zzso 1 zzso The two genes are arranged in tandem in a zzso zzso The short zzso sequence between the two zzso contains several promoter elements that are involved in the induction of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso factors for zzso zzso of one gene are located within the transcribed region of a functionally unrelated zzso
