zzso zzso zzso genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Both genes zzso zzso proteins with activity zzso for zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence in both zzso Consensus zzso acid zzso signatures were identified for zzso and zzso but in the latter zzso signature, one zzso did not fit the previously defined zzso zzso architecture and zzso analysis with analogous proteins indicate domain zzso zzso was as for other zzso zzso The data do not support earlier suggestions that the three activity zzso are detached in zzso zzso
