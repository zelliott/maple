zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso which is zzso by the gene zzso is one of a family of proteins that target zzso to zzso and regulate its activity on zzso of zzso zzso zzso is primarily expressed in the liver where it promotes zzso zzso synthesis in response to zzso Here, we show that zzso is highly expressed in embryonic mouse zzso zzso zzso two alternative promoters and zzso zzso zzso which produce at least three alternatively spliced transcripts that zzso identical zzso zzso of zzso in the lung is zzso as early as embryonic day zzso zzso and increases by zzso however, it declines before zzso In zzso zzso of mouse embryonic lung revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and spatial expression of zzso in the lung suggests that it has a potential role in zzso metabolism during lung zzso
