zzso zzso expressed gene 3) is the first imprinted gene detected in the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso Because zzso is a trait that is generally zzso among zzso and imprinted zzso generally zzso several adjacent zzso expression patterns and zzso environment of the human counterpart of zzso are of special zzso In this study we have localized human zzso approximately 2 zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso within a region known to carry large numbers of zzso clustered zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso also encodes a zzso zzso protein but one that is distinguished from other zzso gene products by the fact that it carries two novel zzso zzso zzso between mouse zzso and partial human zzso gene sequences revealed a high level of conservation between the two species, despite the fact that one of the two zzso repeats is absent from the human zzso Our data demonstrate that the human gene is expressed at highest levels in zzso and zzso mouse zzso by contrast, is transcribed at highest levels in the adult zzso These comparative zzso sequencing, and expression data provide the first clues to the potential activities of zzso and generate new tools to aid in the analysis of structure and function of a potentially new imprinted domain located in human zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso
