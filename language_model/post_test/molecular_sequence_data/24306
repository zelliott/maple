The single zzso zzso K in the zzso WW domain increased the stability of the complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the refined solution structure of this complex by zzso zzso and further derived zzso relationships by using zzso zzso libraries with truncated sequences and a substitution analysis that yielded zzso as the smallest zzso binding zzso zzso zzso The structures of two new complexes with weaker binding zzso chosen based on these results zzso and zzso zzso the zzso WW domain of zzso were zzso zzso of the structures of the three complexes were useful for identifying the molecular basis of zzso zzso and specific interactions between the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, and hydrogen bonds between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso stabilize the zzso structure of the complex zzso K zzso WW zzso is compared to the published crystal structure of the zzso WW domain bound to a segment of the zzso protein and to the solution structure of the first zzso WW domain and its zzso zzso suggesting that WW sequences bind zzso peptides in an evolutionary zzso zzso The position equivalent to zzso in the zzso WW domain sequence is seen as responsible for differentiation in the binding mode among the WW zzso of group zzso
