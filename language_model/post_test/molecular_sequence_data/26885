zzso is modulated by viruses to establish a host cellular environment advantageous for their zzso The zzso virus zzso zzso program zzso zzso of zzso which prevents interaction with zzso Here, we show that induction of zzso zzso program leads to degradation of zzso via an zzso zzso independent of zzso The zzso protein directly functions as an zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex targeting zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulting from activated DNA damage response by viral zzso replication enhances its binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be shown to catalyze zzso of zzso zzso more efficiently than the zzso in zzso The compensation of zzso at middle and late stages of the zzso infection zzso viral DNA replication and production during zzso infection, suggesting that the degradation of zzso is required for efficient viral zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate a role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex in regulation of zzso zzso by activated DNA damage signaling during viral zzso zzso
