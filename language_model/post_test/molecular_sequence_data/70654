The tumor zzso gene zzso and several zzso including zzso zzso map to zzso zzso However, molecular and zzso analysis suggests the presence of a second tumor zzso locus at this zzso zzso We have identified a novel gene from zzso zzso which encodes a protein of 126 zzso acids sharing an overall 57% identity with the zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso putative tumor zzso zzso zzso in oral zzso We therefore designated the novel gene as zzso for zzso The zzso location was confirmed by zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that it was expressed in all the zzso zzso zzso protein showed zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis failed to detect deleterious zzso of the zzso transcript in four zzso oral zzso lines and 20 different cancer cell lines from tumor types which frequently harbor zzso at zzso zzso
