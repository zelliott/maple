The human breast is a highly zzso complex tissue comprised of a zzso population of cells with varying zzso zzso between the different cell types, changes in their relative zzso state of differentiation and function in response to zzso as well as the zzso that lead to the zzso growth associated with zzso are poorly zzso zzso gel zzso is being used to compare the proteins found in different breast cells in order to identify the gene products that are common or specific to particular cell types so as to provide markers that will be useful in studies of normal breast cell differentiation and the zzso or blocked differentiation characteristic of zzso zzso patterns have been obtained from cells prepared for zzso immediately after isolation from human milk, from cells cultured for fewer than ten passages after isolation from healthy breast tissue removed during reduction zzso and from cells maintained in long-term tissue culture after isolation from the zzso zzso of patients with breast zzso zzso expression of zzso 8, 18, and 19, shown previously to be predominantly expressed by zzso cells in the zzso layer of breast zzso was observed among the cells zzso Other zzso proteins were also found to be zzso expressed in zzso of both the normal and tumor zzso A composite human breast cell protein pattern was created which includes all the commonly and specifically expressed proteins found in this zzso This pattern will be the basis for continuing studies of proteins in the human zzso
