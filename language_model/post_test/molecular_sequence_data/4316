The zzso is a highly selective barrier against the zzso dissemination of infectious zzso Despite the presence of seemingly intact physical and zzso zzso infections nonetheless zzso These observations prompted the examination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for previously zzso protective zzso 

zzso zzso from term zzso zzso and zzso were reverse transcribed using a 3' zzso zzso 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso chain reaction zzso was conducted on zzso from these zzso to detect the presence of human zzso Southern analysis and partial sequence analysis were subsequently performed to confirm zzso 

zzso amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded a zzso product and a zzso zzso band of 300 zzso Southern analysis demonstrated two corresponding zzso bands in the zzso zzso and zzso but not from a negative zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso product from zzso confirmed the presence of either zzso 1 or 3 in human zzso 

The human zzso zzso and zzso express zzso at the level of zzso These findings suggest that a novel and previously zzso mechanism of protecting the fetus against infection may be present within these zzso
