The zzso cluster region in the zzso gene defines a region of approximately zzso zzso in which the vast majority of its zzso zzso are zzso These zzso disrupt the zzso chain, typically eliminating five of the seven repeated sequences of 20 zzso acids zzso each in the central region of the zzso zzso To examine the relationship between loss of this structure and loss of function, we constructed zzso deletion zzso that progressively truncated the protein across the zzso cluster zzso The zzso were tested for their association with zzso and their ability to zzso it in zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso fragments required the inclusion of only a single zzso repeat zzso whereas zzso required the presence of at least three of these repeat zzso and those including the second repeat exhibited the highest zzso The zzso of three zzso zzso zzso in the second repeat greatly reduced the activity of an otherwise highly active zzso zzso Thus, the repeated zzso sequence is directly implicated in zzso zzso The elimination of at least five of these seven repeats due to zzso zzso suggests that loss of zzso regulation by zzso is selected for during tumor zzso
