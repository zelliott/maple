zzso zzso kidney disease zzso is caused by zzso to a large zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso We have identified, through analysis of human zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso region zzso The zzso transcript of zzso zzso was amplified as 16 fragments and zzso the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso was also zzso zzso contains 78 zzso covers a zzso region of approximately zzso zzso and encodes a large zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients with no zzso zzso revealed several sequence zzso but no clear zzso making it unlikely that it is zzso Human zzso is predicted to be a large zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso with a signal zzso single zzso domain and short zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso throughout most of the zzso region with overall identity of zzso and similarity of zzso zzso has zzso zzso similar to zzso with 14 copies of the zzso domain and two regions of significant zzso to the protein zzso zzso sequence analysis identified no other full-length zzso zzso in humans, mice or other zzso zzso The zzso fish has a zzso zzso but no zzso suggesting that the newly identified protein may be the ancestral zzso zzso and zzso are widely expressed at a low level in most zzso but only detected in zzso zzso Low level expression was detected in many primary immune cell zzso but zzso specifically in T zzso following zzso signals, suggesting a role in cellular zzso
