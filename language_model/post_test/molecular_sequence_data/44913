zzso human zzso zzso zzso have a limited life span, undergo zzso and rarely, if ever, spontaneously zzso in zzso Introduction of the gene for T zzso zzso by the DNA virus zzso extends the life span of zzso and increases the frequency of zzso however, zzso requires both zzso and zzso zzso We previously generated independent zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines from which we then obtained zzso zzso as part of a multifaceted approach to identify functions responsible for zzso In this study we undertook a search for cellular zzso which are zzso expressed upon zzso A zzso zzso library was prepared from a zzso zzso zzso zzso We screened the library with a zzso probe enriched for sequences present in zzso and reduced in zzso zzso zzso A more limited screen was also employed for sequences zzso in zzso using a different zzso zzso in the level of zzso in zzso zzso functions relevant to signal zzso pathways were zzso however, most zzso zzso novel zzso In an effort to clarify which of the altered zzso are most relevant to zzso we performed Northern analysis with zzso prepared from three paired sets of independent zzso and zzso (4 cell zzso zzso using eight cloned zzso which show reduced expression in zzso Three of these were reduced in additional zzso cell lines as well; one, zzso zzso zzso is reduced in all the zzso cell lines zzso a second, zzso zzso zzso type zzso is reduced in 2 of the 3 matched zzso and a third, zzso zzso zzso is reduced in 2 unrelated zzso cell zzso Although the roles of these genes are as yet zzso their further analysis should extend our understanding of the molecular bases for zzso In particular, the patterns of expression of zzso and zzso strongly suggest that they are involved in the process of zzso and/or can serve as target genes for assessing regulators of gene expression in this zzso
