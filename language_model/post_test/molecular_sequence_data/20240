The zzso zzso zzso belong to a ubiquitous family of proteins that are found in a wide range of zzso zzso These proteins participate in a variety of zzso including protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso the 12 zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso was been isolated from both zzso cultured cells and zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso zzso shotgun database, we were able to identify the zzso zzso as well as the positions of its zzso zzso 

zzso zzso sizes and zzso positions are highly zzso among zzso zzso in 24 diverse zzso zzso of 41 zzso genes revealed several zzso zzso and deletion events throughout zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso were identified in all 12 zzso zzso Both structural and zzso analyses suggest that the zzso may be evolving zzso possibly due to the distinct functional roles played by each zzso
