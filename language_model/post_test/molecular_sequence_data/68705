The infrared zzso of three different zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso We have used zzso containing either exclusively zzso zzso zzso base pairs or substitution with four zzso zzso zzso base pairs and have them compared with their zzso zzso reference duplexes in a conventional zzso zzso zzso differences have been found in the region of the zzso C zzso O stretching zzso The zzso duplexes showed characteristic marker bands for the C2 zzso zzso and C4 zzso zzso zzso stretching zzso of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, as compared to values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso reference zzso The results confirm previous studies indicating that the secondary structure in zzso DNA is established by reversed zzso base pairing of zzso zzso zzso with hydrogen bonds between zzso and zzso The duplex structure of the zzso is much more sensitive to zzso than that of the zzso zzso with three drugs known to bind in the minor groove of zzso zzso A and zzso zzso shifts of the C zzso O stretching zzso of zzso even at low ratio of drug per DNA base zzso These results suggest a zzso change of the zzso to zzso the zzso zzso As demonstrated by zzso zzso of strands labeled with zzso at the zzso the drugs induce zzso of the zzso duplex with subsequent formation of zzso matched zzso to allow the more favorable drug binding to zzso Similarly, attempts to form a triple zzso of the type zzso with zzso failed and resulted in the zzso of the zzso duplex and zzso of a triple zzso based upon an zzso duplex core zzso
