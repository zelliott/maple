In search for new valuable zzso zzso using the zzso technique, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were considered zzso for the zzso gene zzso We show that the zzso gene encodes two distinct zzso both zzso in head and neck zzso and required for correct cell zzso Both products differ within the N zzso are generated upon distinct zzso initiation sites, and have been termed zzso and zzso Both zzso are early targets of zzso and are located in zzso A previous report suggested zzso properties of the zzso zzso of zzso Here, we did not observe any zzso effects in human cell lines, zzso zzso or zzso By contrast, the specific zzso of both zzso resulted in zzso cells and decreased zzso along with dysfunctional cell division followed by increased zzso Thus, the present data suggest a role for zzso in tumor zzso
