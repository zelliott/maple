The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso interaction zzso The zzso zzso zzso but not highly zzso zzso in a random zzso zzso mechanism that led to the formation of a wide range of zzso zzso As shown by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso were further zzso by the zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso as final zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular weight of 31,000 determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and a molecular mass of 30,000 Da determined by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso The zzso point of the protein was zzso zzso activity occurred at pH zzso zzso was essential for activity, and zzso zzso the zzso under standard zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso did not inhibit the ability of the zzso to cleave the native zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value with sodium zzso as the zzso was zzso g zzso The zzso zzso lost its activity after a zzso incubation at 50 degrees C but was stabilized by calcium or zzso The zzso sequence showed high similarity within a stretch of 13 zzso acids to the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not produce additional zzso of zzso zzso but produced further activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso when grown in a medium with zzso zzso fibers from zzso as the sole carbon zzso
