Five genes of the zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso were zzso One of these is a zzso zzso the other four are located on two zzso clones representing two different zzso zzso containing one zzso 1) and three genes zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of the three genes in locus 2 is highly zzso with respect to size and zzso These genes contain two zzso whereas the gene from locus 1 contains three zzso Although in most cases the zzso acid sequences in the transit zzso part of different zzso genes from the same species varied considerably more than the corresponding mature zzso acid zzso one exception found in tomato and potato indicates that the transit zzso of zzso could have a special zzso A comparison of the zzso genes of higher plants with those of zzso offers suggestive evidence that zzso first served as zzso material in the process of zzso zzso and then were removed zzso during the evolution of higher zzso
