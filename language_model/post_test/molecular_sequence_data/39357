zzso protein 2 zzso belongs to a family of zzso of the zzso inner zzso In zzso low expression of zzso contrasts with a high zzso zzso level, and induction of zzso expression occurs without change in zzso level, demonstrating a zzso zzso The zzso zzso is characterized by a long zzso untranslated region zzso in which an upstream open reading frame zzso codes for a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso have an zzso role in the translation of zzso The present study demonstrates that the 3' region of the zzso is a major zzso for this zzso zzso In this 3' region, a zzso substitution that kept the zzso sense unchanged significantly modified zzso translation, whereas some important zzso acid changes had no zzso We discuss our results within the framework of the existing models explaining initiation of translation downstream of a zzso
