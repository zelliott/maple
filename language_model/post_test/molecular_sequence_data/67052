zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the principal zzso zzso zzso play a critical role in its ability to bind the zzso envelope zzso zzso and mediate zzso zzso Human zzso that recognize the zzso region of zzso are also modified by zzso zzso which is necessary for their ability to neutralize zzso Here we demonstrate that a zzso zzso derived from the zzso region of one of these zzso zzso can efficiently bind zzso Association of this zzso zzso with zzso requires zzso zzso and is enhanced by, but not dependent on, zzso zzso of any of four zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso critical for association with zzso prevents zzso association with zzso zzso zzso zzso more effectively than peptides based on the zzso zzso zzso and may be useful as a fusion partner with other protein zzso of zzso zzso Our data provide further insight into the association of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso show that a zzso zzso region of zzso is accessible to zzso in the absence of zzso and suggest that soluble zzso of zzso can be more effective than previously zzso
