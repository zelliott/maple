The identification of a zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso and zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso is zzso The zzso has been isolated by differential screening of a zzso zzso root zzso We have found two zzso genes in a tandem arrangement in the zzso zzso separated by approximately zzso zzso One of the genes zzso I) contains an identical zzso sequence which zzso to the zzso zzso The two deduced proteins from DNA sequences are very similar zzso two conservative replacements in zzso zzso zzso and they share a high zzso as compared with the published zzso sequences from other systems and in particular with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences zzso The structure of both genes is also very zzso it includes two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in each gene and only one zzso placed at a zzso position in relation to zzso zzso zzso By using specific 3' zzso it appears that both genes are zzso expressed in the zzso system of the zzso The zzso gene family of zzso zzso seems to be represented by at least 3 or 4 zzso
