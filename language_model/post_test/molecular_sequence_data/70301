zzso is a small, zzso zzso zzso protein capable of engineering DNA zzso required for the formation of higher order zzso zzso One such complex is the zzso Type 1 zzso where the ends of zzso are zzso zzso by a zzso of zzso A and zzso at their 3' zzso zzso is believed to play a critical role in zzso zzso which requires the communication of the two zzso ends and the zzso zzso Although zzso studies have clearly defined the DNA regions bound by zzso A, no protection could be ascribed to the zzso protein by zzso I, zzso or zzso radical methods zzso et zzso zzso To directly probe zzso interactions with the zzso DNA, we have coupled zzso to a DNA zzso zzso zzso and report here the first zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso at specific sites within an zzso zzso DNA separating the zzso zzso site from its neighboring zzso zzso This zzso binding was specific since it could not be zzso with zzso excess zzso zzso We zzso that zzso promotes the formation of a tight DNA bend or loop in this region which zzso the communication of zzso A zzso during complex zzso This method may prove generally useful for the zzso of zzso zzso proteins on DNA and within higher zzso zzso zzso
