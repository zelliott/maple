In order to perform comparative studies of the cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso zzso we determined the sequence of the Syrian zzso zzso gene and its zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso sequence contains zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region as well as zzso zzso of the complete zzso zzso with its 3' end overlapping with the zzso zzso All the zzso boundaries were determined and relative to the human zzso zzso an extra zzso untranslated zzso was zzso The isolation and sequencing of the Syrian zzso zzso gene may further the understanding about the regulation and the evolution of the cardiac zzso zzso
