zzso zzso zzso activate protein zzso C zzso zzso by binding to the zzso like zzso zzso in the zzso regulatory zzso Our recent studies have revealed that only zzso has two high affinity zzso zzso zzso providing a structural blueprint for the rational design of zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso To extend this approach, the zzso zzso containing the double zzso motifs of zzso zzso has been zzso for the first time using an zzso phase strategy with a zzso chain zzso This zzso was zzso by the reversed phase zzso to give satisfactory mass data zzso and zzso The zzso was successfully folded by zinc treatment and the folded zzso was analyzed intact under neutral conditions by zzso The multiple charge mass envelopes shifted to those of the lower mass charge state by addition of 4 zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso preserves some higher order structure by the zinc zzso Moreover, the mass spectrum of the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso clearly showed that zzso coordinates exactly four atoms of zzso This zinc zzso is identical to that of native zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed two binding sites of distinctly different affinities zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso comparable to those reported by Quest and Bell for the zzso fusion protein of zzso prepared by DNA zzso These results indicate that zzso serves as an effective surrogate for native zzso for the study of the structural characteristics of the binding recognition event and the design, discovery, and development of new zzso zzso
