The type 1 domain of zzso is a protein module zzso that occurs in a variety of zzso and membrane zzso Several examples of zzso zzso have been previously identified as zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein from zzso and a zzso of zzso with a pair of such zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso is now characterized as a potent inhibitor of three zzso zzso as zzso zzso human zzso B, and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso reveals that both zzso zzso of zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 72 zzso but only one of these zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso 67 zzso and zzso L zzso zzso zzso zzso Physical association of zzso and zzso blocked from turnover at the zzso zzso zzso can be detected by zzso with zzso The rate of association of zzso and zzso B is strongly zzso with an optimum at pH zzso reflecting control by at least two zzso zzso These results further demonstrate that various zzso zzso are selective zzso of zzso zzso with utility in the study of protein interactions and zzso
