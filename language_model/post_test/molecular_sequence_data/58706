We have identified a novel zzso zzso based on the analysis of zzso derived from the zzso of the zzso ground zzso zzso zzso zzso has an unmodified molecular mass of zzso Da and contains multiple functional zzso including a zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso We show that distinct regions of the zzso sequence are identical to a set of peptides prepared from a recently identified bovine zzso referred to as zzso which is found in the zzso regulatory complex of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso We also show that zzso is the functional zzso of the newly characterized zzso protein from the budding zzso zzso zzso (Russell et zzso zzso zzso with its role as a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in all ground zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships based on sequence analysis show that both zzso and zzso zzso are distinct from the other five zzso zzso found in the zzso and together comprise the sixth and newest zzso zzso of the regulatory complex of the zzso zzso
