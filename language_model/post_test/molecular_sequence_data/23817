zzso of zzso human zzso zzso for therapeutic purposes relies on its expression in selected clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso can be produced by targeted zzso into the body fluid of transgenic zzso Here, we report on the generation of a transgenic rabbits producing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals are viable, fertile and transmit the zzso gene to the zzso Northern zzso data indicated that the expression of the zzso in the zzso zzso is controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory sequences during the period of zzso While the zzso with total zzso revealed the expression only in the zzso zzso zzso the highly sensitive zzso approach using zzso technique detected a minor zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso in the founder female, measured in the period of zzso varied in the range of zzso and zzso zzso in the milk and blood zzso zzso Biological activity of the milk zzso was confirmed by a standard zzso incorporation zzso Thus, we describe the model of a zzso zzso valuable for studies of zzso zzso and function, which can be useful for the development of transgenic approaches designed for the preparation of zzso proteins by alternative zzso zzso
