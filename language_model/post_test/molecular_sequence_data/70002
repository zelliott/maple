This study represents the specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso of intact cells by zzso zzso zzso which zzso the linkage between zzso and zzso of various zzso After a zzso incubation of horse intact zzso with 20 zzso zzso II in the presence of zzso at 37 degrees C, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were found to be zzso without zzso accompanied by a corresponding increase in zzso but not zzso or zzso No zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso cholesterol or membrane zzso The decrease in zzso with zzso zzso specific to zzso alpha zzso of zzso corresponded to that of zzso zzso by the zzso and almost no zzso was found when zzso of the zzso was zzso Besides the zzso zzso of horse zzso zzso of guinea zzso zzso and zzso of human, and bovine and rabbit zzso zzso zzso were found to be efficiently zzso by zzso II even when present in intact cells, while human zzso zzso is quite resistant to zzso by the zzso on the cell surface as well as in zzso zzso zzso incorporation via the zzso zzso in zzso was not affected at all by the specific and exhaustive zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso This result strongly suggested that zzso zzso function was not directly modulated by zzso zzso In zzso this paper demonstrates that, together with the assistance of zzso zzso zzso II will become a powerful tool for selectively removing sugar chains from zzso zzso without damaging other cell membrane zzso and will be useful for describing the biological functions of zzso zzso
