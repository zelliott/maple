A zzso isolated from zzso grouper zzso zzso larvae in China has been subjected to zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequences of zzso and zzso were determined, and the zzso region zzso and zzso sequences were determined by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in length and contains a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso protein A with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso is zzso long and contains a zzso major zzso zzso coat protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso Multiple alignment and zzso analysis clearly supported including this virus in the species zzso grouper nervous necrosis virus, zzso zzso family zzso
