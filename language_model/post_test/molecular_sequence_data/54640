zzso was originally identified as a protein that regulates zzso by binding to zzso regulators, zzso and zzso Recently was found that zzso protein is a potent zzso of zzso critical for its DNA zzso zzso An zzso zzso clone was isolated from chicken zzso zzso after screening of a zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso is zzso zzso in size, zzso for a zzso of 352 zzso acid zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the chicken zzso is 69, 46, 45 and 37% identical to those of zebra zzso human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that the chicken zzso gene is expressed in the adult brain, heart, zzso zzso zzso stomach and zzso as well as in the whole zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso proteins from various organisms clusters the chicken zzso in the same group with other bird zzso
