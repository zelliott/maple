The zzso zzso zzso associate with zzso proteins zzso by zzso bonds to form large zzso In zzso zzso C, the zzso locus consists of six genes which are organized in three zzso zzso 1 encompasses the genes of zzso and zzso which could be involved in the resistance of the zzso to the zzso pH and zzso zzso The second cluster consists of three genes which zzso zzso zzso The last gene encodes a DNA binding protein zzso which might regulate the zzso complex gene zzso zzso and zzso toxin zzso display similar structure and mechanism of action at the molecular zzso Their identity at the zzso acid level range from 34 to zzso indicating that the zzso zzso genes probably derive from a common zzso The fact that zzso other than zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso can produce a zzso suggests that the zzso genes can be transferred between zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso strains seem to derive from originally zzso strains by zzso gene transfer from zzso zzso zzso probably including a mobile DNA zzso In zzso zzso C and D the gene zzso the zzso zzso has been localized in a zzso element of zzso zzso zzso could be involved in zzso gene transfer in zzso zzso
