The base sequence of a specific DNA region identified as the promoter is investigated by means of the quantity zzso corresponding to zzso of oxygen zzso of each zzso for the ten DNA zzso units zzso and zzso + zzso A mechanism is proposed of how zzso zzso can recognize its zzso site zzso and is applied to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The result explains fairly well the character of the promoters zzso zzso
