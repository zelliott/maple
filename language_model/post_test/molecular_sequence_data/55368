zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from hot springs of North West Himalayas, India, produced an zzso zzso which exhibited significant zzso disruption property on the zzso zzso disruption model with a single species of zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso with molecular mass of zzso also exhibited significant zzso disruption zzso The zzso was zzso active at zzso pH zzso and retained zzso of its original activity after zzso incubation at zzso zzso structure of zzso developed by zzso modeling showed a typical zzso zzso fold, a characteristic feature of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso at the sequence and structure level showed distinct variations in the structural features, with the presence of a high content of zzso zzso aromatic zzso acids and salt zzso These features along with the presence of zzso site observed in zzso structure could have a potential role in zzso stability of the zzso
