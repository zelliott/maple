zzso expression of therapeutic genes is a prerequisite in many approaches to zzso cancer gene zzso However, tissue specificity is often associated with a reduction in viral zzso To overcome this problem, we constructed a series of zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso promoter conversion zzso zzso carrying either the zzso virus 40 zzso signal zzso zzso inserted in the 3' long terminal repeat zzso of these zzso or the human zzso zzso region zzso inserted zzso and 3' of the zzso zzso Furthermore, an extended AT zzso site zzso of zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso In the zzso cells, zzso of the zzso and/or the zzso resulted in a three- to zzso marker gene expression compared to the parental zzso whereas zzso of the zzso gave a slight decrease in zzso The combination of all three modifications had no additional zzso In contrast, however, zzso selection of infected cells revealed only a slight increase in virus zzso with zzso carrying the zzso zzso the zzso was increased by 1 with zzso containing the extended zzso although the viral DNA copy numbers in infected cells were similar with both types of zzso Thus, insufficient integration rather than insufficient reverse zzso and/or production of virus zzso is the major cause for the low zzso obtained with the zzso zzso The combination of all three modifications resulted in a zzso to zzso increase in the virus zzso These modifications result in expression targeted zzso zzso with zzso similar to those of zzso zzso zzso
