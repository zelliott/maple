The generation of zzso polarity during zzso zzso is regulated by the action of 12 zzso expressed gene products, the zzso zzso These products act together to form a zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso factor zzso At least three of the zzso group genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which probably function during early development in the zzso compartment of the zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso is zzso in its light chain sequence to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the Japanese zzso crab zzso zzso zzso is the terminal member of a zzso cascade activated in response to microbial zzso and acts to cleave zzso an zzso equivalent of zzso On the basis of this zzso we are able to predict with confidence the overall primary structure of the zzso zzso its mode of zzso and its zzso zzso The result also suggests that zzso functions zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso response analogous to that found in zzso We also show here that the Toll zzso protein is absent in early zzso zzso but accumulates rapidly at the zzso zzso stage, the zzso stage at which its function is zzso This finding suggests that translation of Toll zzso is regulated in response to zzso and egg zzso These two observations are consistent with a model of zzso pattern formation in which a zzso cascade is activated zzso in the zzso compartment of the zzso and causes the release of zzso zzso zzso of the Toll zzso A possible alternative model in which a zzso cascade is activated in response to a zzso restricted signal is also zzso
