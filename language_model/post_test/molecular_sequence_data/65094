zzso growth factors zzso regulate a wide range of important cellular zzso The biological activities of zzso are zzso by cell surface receptors zzso In the present study for the first time we report the zzso zzso and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso domain of human zzso zzso domain is expressed in zzso coli in high yields (10 zzso as inclusion zzso The protein is recovered by zzso the inclusion bodies in 8 M zzso and subsequently zzso on zzso affinity zzso The protein is zzso (to approximately zzso zzso to zzso using zzso affinity zzso zzso circular zzso data and chemical shift index plot based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso group chemical shifts suggest that zzso domain is an all zzso protein consisting of 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso and equilibrium zzso unfolding experiments show that zzso zzso domain is in a biologically active zzso and binds strongly to its zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a variety of triple resonance zzso experiments, complete assignment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso domain has been zzso The findings of the present study not only pave way for an in-depth investigation of the molecular zzso underlying the zzso of zzso signaling but also provide avenues for the rational design of potent zzso against zzso zzso
