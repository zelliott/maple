zzso is required for the successful completion of the zzso virus zzso life cycle and was previously shown to interact with zzso large zzso zzso Here, we further characterized zzso involvement in viral DNA zzso zzso enhances the DNA binding activity of zzso to the viral origin zzso without directly interacting with zzso The predicted zzso zzso of zzso plays a major role in this zzso All three zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to this zzso and zzso zzso in general are known to play critical roles in zzso interaction, protein folding and zzso The functional relevance of all zzso zzso was investigated by zzso When all were zzso to zzso zzso the zzso virus zzso zzso significantly less efficiently than each individual zzso zzso virus alone, indicating the importance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso these studies indicate a close involvement of zzso in viral DNA zzso
