zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso locus protein from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso family may serve as critical zzso and zzso molecules within the innate immune zzso In the present paper, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein originally demonstrated to bind and activate zzso 1, is also capable of influencing the functions of other members of the zzso zzso Through zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to associate with zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso when zzso in zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso of either full-length zzso or the zzso domain of zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso or the zzso domain of zzso with zzso or zzso inhibited the ability of these proteins to generate active zzso zzso zzso through their association with zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso was demonstrated by zzso experiments to bind all zzso zzso that were tested, including the zzso zzso from zzso itself, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein containing a zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso was found to associate with zzso following exposure to bacterial zzso zzso a regulatory role for interaction of these zzso proteins in the innate immune zzso These studies suggest that by zzso zzso zzso zzso provide a means by which various zzso proteins may zzso creating zzso networks that potentially zzso immune responses to invading zzso
