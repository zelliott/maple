The zzso zzso technique was used to map the molecular environment of a membrane protein in zzso zzso the zzso half of zzso was attached to zzso and zzso the zzso half of zzso was attached to a selection of differently localized proteins of the zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of the zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso reflects the proximity between zzso and the zzso zzso By using a modified zzso as the reporter that is released from zzso the local concentration between zzso and the different zzso could be translated into the growth rate of zzso cells on media lacking zzso We show that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is more distant to zzso than its close sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso versions of zzso an zzso of the protein zzso pathway, we conclude that zzso is a membrane protein of the zzso Using zzso as a reference, a zzso of local zzso of different zzso and zzso could be zzso in the living zzso The zzso reporter should further allow the selection of new binding partners of zzso and the selection of molecules or cellular conditions that interfere with the binding between zzso and one of its known zzso
