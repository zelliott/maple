A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and characterized in zzso zzso one of the animal species used in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso showed high sequence identities zzso with zzso monkey zzso and zzso and human zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were most closely clustered with human zzso unlike zzso of dog, zzso and mouse zzso species also used in drug zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that zzso zzso along with zzso and zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in the liver, where zzso proteins were also detected by zzso zzso zzso using the zzso protein zzso expressed in zzso coli indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso with its apparent zzso lower than that of zzso but similar to those of zzso and zzso These results suggest an evolutionary closeness and functional similarity of zzso monkey zzso zzso with zzso and zzso to human zzso and its functional role as a zzso zzso in the zzso
