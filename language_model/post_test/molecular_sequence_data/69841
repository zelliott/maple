The first three zzso and the promoter of rat zzso zzso also called zzso zzso zzso have been identified through analysis of rat zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 105 base pairs of the first zzso and zzso sequences was zzso The zzso sequence and the first zzso were found to be zzso indicating that the zzso region of the rat zzso gene resides within a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso but no zzso box, was zzso The rat zzso promoter contains five zzso consensus sites, four consensus sites for the zzso zzso factor, and one binding site for the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso The presence of these consensus sequences is consistent with the known expression pattern of zzso zzso extension and zzso protection zzso identified one zzso start zzso The zzso zzso promoter zzso cloned in a reporter zzso was found to induce zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso A positive regulatory element is localized in the region zzso to zzso In zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso from the zzso promoter in rat zzso cells but not in zzso rat zzso zzso
