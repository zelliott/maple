The protein C zzso plays a critical role in the negative regulation of blood zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso protein C zzso zzso gene was determined for zzso zzso pairs of the zzso structure and zzso zzso pairs of the zzso zzso zzso protection zzso revealed six major zzso start sites clustered at zzso to zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso A series of zzso deletion fragments were fused to a zzso reporter gene and zzso zzso into bovine zzso zzso zzso of the sequence from zzso to zzso dramatically reduced zzso expression in bovine zzso zzso zzso This region of the zzso zzso protein C zzso gene contains one zzso site and one zzso zzso zzso in the core sequence of the zzso and zzso sites impaired both nuclear protein binding and zzso zzso These results suggest important roles for zzso and zzso in the zzso expression of zzso A zzso response element zzso was found to mediate the induction of zzso by zzso in cell zzso zzso mice were developed expressing green fluorescent protein driven by the zzso to zzso or zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso in zzso
