The Sex comb on zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are members of the zzso group zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins maintain differential patterns of zzso gene expression during development in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins share a zzso domain with 38% identity over a length of 65 zzso zzso termed the zzso domain, that is located at their respective C zzso Using the zzso zzso system and in zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso domain mediates direct interaction between zzso and zzso zzso studies with isolated zzso zzso from zzso and zzso show that the domain is sufficient for these protein zzso These studies also show that the zzso and zzso domain interactions are much stronger than the zzso domain interaction, indicating that the isolated domain has intrinsic binding specificity zzso Analysis of zzso point zzso identifies zzso that are important for zzso domain zzso These binding properties, predicted zzso secondary structure, and conservation of zzso zzso prompt comparisons of the zzso domain to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso used for zzso and zzso protein interactions in other zzso zzso In addition to in zzso studies, we show zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins at zzso zzso sites in zzso We discuss the possible roles of the zzso domain in the assembly or function of molecular complexes of zzso zzso
