zzso are often processed in complex patterns in zzso manners to produce a variety of protein zzso from single zzso However, mechanisms orchestrating the processing of the entire transcript are not well zzso zzso alternative zzso processing of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso of zzso with distinct zzso properties in regulating zzso organization, provides an excellent in zzso model of complex and zzso zzso zzso it consists of a single first zzso and two separate series of downstream zzso Here we zzso the complex zzso processing pattern of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso reporter zzso By zzso juxtaposed zzso repeats and zzso stretch in zzso zzso we demonstrate that these elements are required for retaining zzso zzso as well as for switching the processing patterns of the entire zzso from zzso to zzso zzso in genes zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso turned the zzso of the zzso reporter zzso zzso and zzso proteins specifically and zzso bind to zzso repeats and zzso stretch in zzso zzso respectively, to form a zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso and zzso are also required for switching the processing patterns of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso in zzso Furthermore, systematic analyses of partially spliced zzso reveal the actual orders of zzso removal for distinct zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso promote zzso processing of the zzso zzso and provide insight into the mechanisms of complex zzso zzso zzso regulation of a single zzso site by two zzso zzso regulators determines the zzso fate of the entire zzso
