zzso strains of zzso growing zzso soybean zzso isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso and zzso max growing in five provinces zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the People's Republic of China were compared with 48 reference strains belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by performing a zzso analysis of 191 zzso zzso Our results showed that all of the zzso strains examined clustered closely in the zzso zzso but were separated from zzso zzso at the species level and that they could be differentiated from zzso and zzso species at the zzso zzso On the basis of the results of our zzso zzso analysis, a zzso DNA G & C content analysis, zzso zzso experiments, a partial zzso zzso sequence analysis, a zzso analysis, an N and C content analysis, and an zzso ratio analysis of members of the three groups of soybean zzso we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso the type strain of this species is strain zzso
