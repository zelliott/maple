The zzso gene is the first gene found to be responsible for the zzso zzso disorder zzso syndrome zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso a zzso storage pool zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene has been mapped to zzso zzso and encodes a zzso protein of unknown function with no zzso to any known zzso A sequence database search has revealed that a portion of clone HS zzso shows high sequence similarity to zzso zzso By performing sequence alignments and zzso amplification of zzso from several human zzso we have shown that part of this clone consists of an zzso partial zzso zzso located on zzso zzso The zzso contains several intact zzso zzso and shows zzso sequence zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 6 of the zzso has zzso sequence zzso to zzso 6 of zzso zzso In the zzso this zzso is surrounded by portions of both its normal zzso zzso These data provide the first characterization of an zzso zzso called zzso During amplification of zzso 6 of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso might also be zzso leading to a false positive for zzso In addition, amplification of specific parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso detection might lead to false zzso for zzso if the zzso is contaminated with zzso This calls for caution when employing these screening zzso
