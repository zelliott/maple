The zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso are commonly used zzso in zzso One causes metal zzso and zzso zzso damage to DNA, while the other acts at the level of DNA via zzso of its zzso zzso and probable zzso of zzso Both drugs bind and/or cleave DNA primarily at zzso zzso which could lead to mutual zzso Using three different restriction fragments we show that binding of zzso to DNA causes major zzso in the sequence specificity of zzso zzso including the appearance of new zzso sites and the suppression of zzso The subtle zzso of the interference is illustrated by the different effects of zzso on DNA zzso by the zzso zzso zzso sharply decreases the extent of zzso at zzso sites by both zzso and zzso whereas zzso at zzso sites is much less affected, while novel zzso sites are generated at zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso A dramatic increase in zzso cutting at zzso is barely zzso with zzso confirming that the zzso zzso of zzso is important for DNA zzso The results contribute to a better understanding of how two individually zzso small molecules interact zzso with specific sequences in DNA and as such assist clarification of the principles governing zzso zzso
