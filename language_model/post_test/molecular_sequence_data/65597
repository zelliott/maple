zzso virus zzso zzso infection, and its associated zzso potential, is dependent on zzso maintenance functions of zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso one of six zzso expressed from a common promoter zzso and then zzso upon infection of zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso the expression of zzso from the zzso promoter zzso to ensure against zzso loss during cell division, including zzso zzso Here we addressed the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso through binding downstream of the zzso start site and the role of this zzso function in zzso zzso Our results revealed that zzso does not inhibit zzso from zzso as previously predicted, but acts zzso or zzso to block the processing of primary zzso This does not, however, require the zzso motifs responsible for strong but zzso zzso binding by zzso Within zzso zzso lines using either zzso or zzso zzso occupancy of zzso is zzso suggesting that zzso occurs, albeit to different degrees, during full and restricted zzso zzso zzso Finally, in cell lines using zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso transcripts from zzso are zzso in the absence of corresponding zzso providing further evidence that this novel mechanism of zzso action functions during zzso This zzso mechanism of regulation would provide an efficient means to monitor and regulate zzso expression from zzso ensuring levels adequate for zzso maintenance but, perhaps more importantly, below an zzso threshold above which zzso infected cells may be at risk for elimination by zzso zzso T zzso
