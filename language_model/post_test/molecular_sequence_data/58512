zzso protein 7 zzso the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso was shown to strongly zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This process involves the interaction of two zzso zzso zzso zzso near their zzso A region located upstream from the zzso donor site was recently identified as being responsible for the formation of zzso zzso zzso This region appeared to be confined within a zzso structure, with an zzso sequence in the zzso In an in zzso study of spontaneous zzso formation, we reported that the zzso zzso transcript forms two distinct zzso differing in their zzso zzso and zzso We identified zzso as a zzso complex structure, formed via a zzso interaction between the two zzso and zzso as a double stranded structure involving all zzso of the zzso via zzso base zzso In this report, we have characterized the role of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso process by using in zzso zzso zzso with zzso transcripts of different lengths and zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso protein zzso activates zzso zzso very likely through interaction with the kissing complex and converts it into a stable zzso Furthermore, this zzso conversion only occurs if the zzso zzso structure is present in zzso zzso molecules and contains the zzso zzso zzso This study suggests that, under zzso conditions, an zzso zzso zzso change is involved in the maturation of the zzso zzso zzso
