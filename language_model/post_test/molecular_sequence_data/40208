The ability of zzso insects to zzso the relatively low nitrogen content of plant zzso is typically the limiting factor in their nutritional zzso In the zzso stage, the zzso zzso feeds predominantly on root zzso of zzso The root tissue as a whole has low levels of free zzso zzso and thus effective zzso of dietary proteins is essential for zzso In contrast to previous reports the present study demonstrates through both molecular and zzso studies the presence of zzso zzso from two zzso classes, zzso and zzso zzso in the gut of zzso zzso zzso with the latter being the zzso zzso zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were isolated from a gut specific zzso zzso the zzso zzso clone has the zzso zzso zzso However, the sequence showed the replacement of the zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso region of the zzso with zzso This may result in a change to the zzso zzso Two zzso precursors contained evidence of a signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other structural features included typical zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso indicative of zzso zzso characteristic zzso in the zzso pocket, and four pairs of zzso zzso for zzso zzso The apparent abundance of the zzso zzso clones compared to the zzso B clones suggests that zzso zzso are the zzso form, thus supporting data from the zzso zzso
