By screening a human fetal brain zzso expression library using a zzso zzso zzso we have isolated a zzso clone zzso a zzso type zzso zzso belonging to the zzso family, zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso in zzso sequence and zzso zzso in the deduced zzso acid sequence to rat zzso suggesting that zzso is the human zzso of zzso The zzso gene is mapped to human zzso zzso by zzso screening of a zzso zzso cell hybrid panel and by zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in several human zzso has shown that the zzso gene is expressed zzso in brain as a zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso in human brain are greater in the midterm fetus than in the zzso Lower levels of zzso zzso are found in fetal kidney and adult skeletal zzso The expression pattern of zzso zzso thus differs from that of zzso suggesting that these two gene products may perform distinct roles in human and zzso zzso transcripts are detected in human zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso zzso Several human tumor cell lines derived from zzso including primitive zzso zzso small cell lung zzso and zzso also express zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso expression in human brain is zzso regulated and is induced during zzso zzso zzso potentially plays important roles in human zzso
