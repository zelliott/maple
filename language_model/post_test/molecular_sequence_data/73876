A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso created by a zzso zzso was found to be reduced in plant zzso and deficient in zzso zzso and zzso activity, although it produced normal levels of zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA library that zzso restored zzso and zzso and zzso activities of zzso to zzso levels when present in zzso The genetic locus that was disrupted in zzso by zzso of zzso has been designated zzso for regulator of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region identified an open reading frame of zzso zzso and the predicted zzso acid zzso shared high identity with several zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus described in this study encodes a putative sensor zzso protein that is involved in both zzso zzso and zzso production and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on potato zzso
