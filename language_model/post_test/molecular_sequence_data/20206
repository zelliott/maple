zzso regulate a complex signal zzso network to direct plant zzso zzso genes fit into three major zzso the so-called zzso acid zzso the zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family has been subdivided into three zzso In zzso studies have shown that most Group II members function as zzso zzso to zzso zzso acids to the plant hormone zzso Here we report the role of a previously zzso zzso gene family member, zzso in root zzso Unlike most other Group II family members, zzso expression was zzso by low zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso plants harboring a zzso zzso gene construct indicate that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso leaves and the shoot zzso zzso of young zzso in mature zzso and in the root vascular zzso zzso was also observed in lateral root tips when zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2 near the zzso region of zzso zzso Plants zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso had reduced zzso zzso no obvious effects on zzso dominance or leaf zzso greater primary root zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso acid zzso root growth zzso Additional zzso zzso zzso and transgenic plants with reduced zzso transcript levels due to zzso zzso also showed these same zzso Our results provide new information on the function of zzso in roots where it is likely to control zzso activity through zzso acid zzso
