Ran is a nuclear zzso zzso that is required for the zzso transport of proteins and zzso across the nuclear pore complex zzso A key regulator of the Ran zzso cycle is the zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we report the identification and zzso of a novel form of zzso Using zzso sequence analysis and specific zzso zzso was found to be modified by zzso to a zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso by light and zzso demonstrated that the zzso unmodified from of zzso is exclusively zzso whereas the zzso modified form of zzso is associated with the zzso fibers of the zzso The modified form of zzso also appeared to associated with the zzso zzso apparatus during zzso These findings have specific implications for Ran function and broad implications for protein regulation by zzso zzso Moreover, the variety and function of zzso protein modifications in the cell may be more diverse than previously zzso
