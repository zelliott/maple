zzso zzso zzso disease zzso may be caused by zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, using zzso sequencing, we identified zzso zzso zzso in zzso in 47 patients from 20 zzso with zzso zzso Previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and cause zzso predisposition to zzso disease caused by impaired zzso cellular responses to zzso Other zzso zzso zzso cause zzso predisposition to zzso bacterial and viral diseases, caused by impaired zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso described here are zzso and increase zzso cellular responses to these zzso and to zzso that predominantly activate zzso such as zzso and zzso All of these zzso affect the zzso domain and impair the nuclear zzso of activated zzso accounting for their zzso and zzso zzso cellular responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and stronger zzso zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hinder the development of T cells producing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore cause zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso
