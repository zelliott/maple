To further zzso the functions of zzso in budding zzso and to relate zzso structure to specific roles and interactions in zzso we determined the zzso caused by 13 zzso zzso isolated previously in the single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso organization, zzso budding pattern, zzso deposition, zzso nuclear zzso and zzso organization were zzso In zzso cells, zzso were found to be aligned along zzso zzso Many of the zzso acid zzso that had the most severe effects on zzso organization are located under the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interactions might zzso zzso organization in zzso In addition, one zzso zzso zzso zzso produced an zzso that assembled into cables and patches that could be zzso by zzso zzso in zzso and that assembled into zzso of normal appearance in zzso as judged by electron zzso but which could not be labeled by zzso in zzso or in zzso zzso could label zzso filaments assembled from all of the other zzso zzso including one zzso zzso zzso zzso that is altered at a zzso zzso that can be chemically zzso to zzso The implication of zzso zzso and/or zzso in zzso binding is in close agreement with a recently reported molecular model in which the zzso site is proposed to be at the junction of two or three zzso zzso in the zzso
