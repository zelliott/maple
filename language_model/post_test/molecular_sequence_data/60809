The shaking B locus zzso or zzso codes for structural molecules of gap junctions in zzso This report describes the complex set of transcripts from the zzso zzso A zzso set of five transcripts is zzso The transcripts share 3' zzso but each has its own zzso zzso The transcripts are arrayed as a series in the zzso DNA stretching over 60 zzso The zzso end of each successive transcript lies further zzso on the zzso Each new transcript shares all the 3' zzso with the one preceding it, but adds one or two more zzso zzso The different transcripts are expressed in a wide variety of locations in the nervous system and in zzso zzso Some zzso express more than one transcript, and the expression pattern of each is zzso zzso Within the adult central nervous system zzso these transcripts have an expression pattern that is restricted to the giant fiber system zzso The zzso is a small set of zzso which mediates the visually induced escape zzso zzso is required for function of the zzso electrical zzso The transcript previously defined as active in the giant fiber is not, in fact, expressed in that zzso Instead, we find that another transcript, zzso and perhaps zzso as well, is expressed in the zzso this transcript is not expressed elsewhere in the adult zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso but not elsewhere in the zzso This expression pattern explains the zzso and behavioral defects in escape exhibited in zzso of zzso
