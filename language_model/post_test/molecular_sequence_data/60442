zzso are zzso zzso algae that use a zzso located zzso system, which is distinct from the zzso structure found in zzso and red zzso One of the key components of this system is zzso zzso zzso zzso whose expression is enhanced by low light zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the marine zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso Although the zzso structure is similar to the alpha and beta chains of other known zzso the overall structure of zzso zzso is novel with the alpha chains forming a simple extended fold with an zzso zzso followed by an zzso The two doubly linked zzso zzso (one on each beta zzso are in van der zzso zzso suggesting that zzso mechanisms may alter their spectral zzso Each alpha zzso carries a zzso linked zzso zzso that is likely to be the final energy zzso The architecture of the zzso suggests that zzso zzso may dock to an zzso protein via a deep zzso and that energy may be transferred via this zzso protein to the reaction zzso
