Recently, zzso patterns of zzso zzso coli from pigs with zzso disease and from humans were compared and strains from diseased pigs were reported to be unlikely human pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso coli zzso from humans and pigs differ in their zzso profiles and interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 71, zzso In the present study, 31 zzso zzso zzso coli zzso strains harboring zzso which were previously isolated out of zzso samples from healthy pigs at slaughter zzso zzso zzso zzso Blanco, zzso Blanco, zzso Blanco, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso coli in zzso samples of finished pigs at slaughter in zzso zzso Food zzso 69, zzso were characterized by zzso and zzso zzso Nine of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from healthy pigs belonged to zzso found in zzso isolated from humans, including two zzso zzso zzso reported in association with zzso zzso Otherwise, the zzso were different from those isolated from cases of zzso disease in zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is strongly correlated with severe human disease, was not zzso Moreover, all strains were lacking the genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso associated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine strains tested positive for zzso zzso one zzso strain for zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso strain for zzso zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso coli isolated from humans, which are mainly lacking further zzso factors, genes of an iron zzso system on the zzso island zzso zzso were detected in three zzso and zzso strains from healthy zzso zzso although the isolated strains are unlikely to be associated with severe human diseases, healthy pigs cannot be excluded as a potential source of human infection with zzso zzso
