zzso of zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso decreased zzso binding to zzso initiation factor zzso The decrease in binding lagged behind the zzso of zzso in zzso the preferred site of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was abolished by zzso zzso indicating that zzso of sites other than zzso control zzso To identify such sites, zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and then zzso zzso before the resulting zzso were isolated by reverse phase zzso and directly identified by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were located by determining the cycles in which zzso was released when zzso were subjected to sequential zzso zzso With an extended incubation in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In rat zzso the zzso of all five sites was increased by insulin and decreased by zzso although there were differences in the magnitude of the zzso A form of zzso zzso exclusively in zzso remained bound to zzso indicating that zzso of zzso is insufficient for zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso our results indicate that multiple zzso sites are involved in the control of zzso All five sites identified fit a zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso in cells is zzso by a zzso protein zzso
