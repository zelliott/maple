zzso against zzso disease virus zzso has dramatically reduced the number of disease zzso Nevertheless, there are still many outbreaks in different regions around the zzso In an effort to find new ways to control the disease, zzso able to cleave zzso were designed and zzso In this work we tested the ability of zzso a zzso targeted to the viral zzso zzso to cleave zzso sequences of several zzso zzso analysis was used to choose target sequences which consist of two zzso zzso which lie 15 bases apart and, their zzso zzso These were the basis for the zzso zzso gene sequence that contains two zzso zzso We show that zzso sequences from A, Asia 1, C and two different zzso Israeli zzso could be specifically zzso by zzso It is suggested that zzso can cleave zzso gene sequences from any zzso zzso
