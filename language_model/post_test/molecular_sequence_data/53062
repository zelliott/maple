zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 are thought to mediate the zzso zzso of many zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso have now been zzso the zzso protein is a zzso inhibitor of zzso while the novel protein zzso was recently reported to be a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso We here report evidence that zzso and zzso exhibit several elements of structural and functional zzso zzso 26 zzso human, mouse and rat zzso like all zzso zzso contain a zzso sequence within the first half of the zzso and also contain a zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso CT zzso separated from the remainder of the protein by a zzso consensus zzso The zzso CT zzso contains the precise sequence of a zzso previously identified by zzso zzso library screening as a potent inhibitor of zzso and the vast majority of the zzso potency of zzso can be attributed to this zzso Further, like the zzso CT zzso zzso zzso peptides represent zzso competitive zzso zzso with zzso zzso Lastly, zzso zzso is able to cleave the zzso CT zzso to a product with a mass consistent with zzso following the zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso may comprise two members of a functionally zzso family of zzso inhibitor zzso
