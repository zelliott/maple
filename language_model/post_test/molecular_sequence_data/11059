The zzso zzso gene has been isolated and shown to be expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso is a member of the zzso gene family and comprises the genes for zzso and zzso which differ in the sequence in the region located on the zzso side of the zzso The complete zzso acid sequences of the open reading frame of zzso and zzso were determined and each was found to be similar to that of zzso the mouse zzso of the zzso syndrome associated human zzso gene zzso to the extent that the sequence of zzso has been zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the zzso area as well as in the zzso of the mouse embryonic zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were isolated in chick in which the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso was well zzso The expression of zzso along with that of Sonic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was examined at the time of the formation of zzso in mouse zzso The expression of zzso was initially noted in the zzso zone of the zzso zzso and was then replaced by that of zzso at the time of zzso migration of the zzso zzso zzso was widely expressed in the zzso zone of zzso zzso and also as a narrow band in the mantle zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso extended as far as zzso and overlapped with that of zzso The zzso and zzso cells in zzso which extended towards the lateral zzso surface of the zzso wall, differed from those expressing zzso and zzso The embryonic zzso lateral zzso nucleus present in the visual zzso was eventually formed from these zzso Each zzso gene was also expressed regionally in the nucleus, suggesting that the nucleus is comprised of zzso
