In zzso four factors zzso I, zzso II, zzso I, and zzso are required for accurate zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso I can be separated further into zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso made in zzso coli provides full zzso zzso function in both zzso and zzso addition zzso zzso with the presence of two zzso zzso zzso can be zzso zzso to zzso and this specific interaction requires the zzso zzso efficiency zzso Furthermore, the zzso II factor enhances the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso A zzso zzso in zzso yields zzso with shorter zzso tails when grown at the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso two components of zzso zzso The zzso gene was originally isolated as a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso a gene zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso between the nucleus and zzso providing a potential link between zzso processing and zzso export from the zzso
