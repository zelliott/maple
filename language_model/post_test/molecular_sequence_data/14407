Our understanding of the molecular control of many disease zzso requires the identification of direct zzso targeted by specific protein zzso Here we describe an integrated zzso strategy, termed zzso zzso linked with zzso which combines a sensitive zzso reaction with zzso zzso zzso to identify direct zzso of protein zzso The unique in zzso zzso reaction is carried out in a highly efficient manner using a pool of peptides derived directly from cellular zzso zzso and then zzso as zzso zzso The resulting newly zzso peptides are then isolated and identified by mass zzso A further comparison of these in zzso zzso peptides with zzso derived from zzso proteins isolated from cells in which the zzso is either active or inhibited reveals new candidate protein zzso The zzso zzso linked with zzso strategy was applied to identify unique zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with duel properties of an zzso and a tumor zzso in distinctive cell zzso We identified 64 and 23 direct zzso of zzso specific to B cells and breast cancer cells, zzso Both known and unique zzso including multiple zzso zzso for zzso were identified, supporting a unique mechanism that zzso zzso affects cell division through its zzso zzso zzso
