zzso C virus zzso zzso the zzso tumor zzso protein zzso a central cell cycle regulator which is also targeted by zzso expressed by DNA tumor zzso zzso zzso replication is also enhanced in zzso zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso interactions with host cell cycle regulators, such as zzso have evolved to modify the zzso environment to promote viral zzso To test this hypothesis and to determine the impact of viral regulation of zzso on zzso zzso we constructed infectious viral zzso containing zzso in the zzso motif of zzso which zzso the ability of zzso to regulate zzso These zzso underwent replication in zzso cells but produced zzso reduced virus zzso One zzso zzso was severely compromised for replication and rapidly zzso to zzso thereby restoring both zzso regulation and replication zzso Another zzso zzso also failed to zzso zzso abundance and produced virus yields that were about one-third that of virus with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite this loss of replication zzso zzso zzso protein was two- to zzso more active than zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although small interfering zzso zzso of zzso did not rescue the replication fitness of these zzso we conclude that the zzso in replication fitness is not due to defective zzso or zzso function and is more likely to result from the inability of the zzso zzso to zzso regulate zzso abundance and thereby zzso host gene zzso
