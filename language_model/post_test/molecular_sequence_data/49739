zzso (also called protein zzso zzso is one of the major downstream targets of the zzso zzso zzso This protein zzso has been implicated in insulin zzso stimulation of cellular growth, and zzso of zzso as well as transformation of zzso Although a number of cellular proteins have been identified as putative targets of the zzso additional zzso may play a role in the varied responses zzso by this zzso We have used a combination of zzso binding and recognition by an zzso to the zzso consensus of the zzso to identify and isolate one of the major zzso of zzso which is also a zzso binding zzso This zzso zzso designated zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that it is a zzso of zzso was accomplished by showing that 1) zzso was zzso in zzso by zzso zzso on the same site that was zzso in zzso zzso 2) zzso of an zzso zzso was alone sufficient to stimulate the zzso of zzso and 3) cells lacking zzso and zzso exhibit a diminished ability to zzso this zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso of zzso the zzso of which leads to the binding of this protein to zzso
