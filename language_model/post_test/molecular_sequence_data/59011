A Chinese zzso zzso zzso was modified to zzso an zzso acid zzso extension containing the zzso zzso from influenza zzso zzso (to create zzso alpha zzso and was cloned into a zzso for expression in zzso zzso 12 stable zzso cell lines expressing this zzso alpha zzso were isolated and zzso zzso alpha zzso incorporated into all classes of zzso assembled to the same extent as the zzso zzso and did not zzso the growth of the cells in which it was zzso However, zzso of zzso alpha zzso strongly zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso while having little or no effect on the synthesis of zzso Treatment of zzso cells with sodium zzso to induce even greater expression of zzso alpha zzso led to a further decrease in synthesis of zzso zzso that was fully zzso upon removal of the zzso zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso cells did not result from decreased levels of zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso protection zzso On the other hand, zzso a drug previously shown to destabilize the zzso message, caused a clear reduction in both protein synthesis and zzso levels for zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso thus indicating that the decreased zzso synthesis observed as a result of zzso alpha zzso zzso is distinct from the previously described zzso of zzso The results are consistent with a mechanism in which free zzso zzso the translation of its own message as a way of ensuring zzso synthesis of zzso and zzso
