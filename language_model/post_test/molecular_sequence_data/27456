zzso B3 zzso is a common pathogen of zzso We previously zzso a zzso targeting the zzso zzso 2A zzso gene and achieved reduction of zzso replication by zzso in zzso However, like other drugs under development, zzso zzso faces a major challenge of targeted zzso In this study, we investigated a novel approach to deliver zzso zzso to a specific cell population zzso zzso cells containing folate zzso using zzso zzso zzso packaging zzso zzso from bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso can spontaneously form zzso and zzso under optimal conditions by zzso between their stem zzso By zzso linking a zzso to zzso we delivered the zzso specifically to zzso cells without the need of zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso to zzso achieved an equivalent zzso effect to that of the zzso zzso Finally, the drug targeted delivery was further evaluated by using zzso zzso or zzso which carried both the zzso and folate zzso and demonstrated that both of them strongly inhibited zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso as a zzso carrier can specifically deliver the drug to target cells via its zzso and specific zzso interaction and inhibit virus replication zzso
