The mechanism of zzso of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins characteristic of basement zzso and the zzso has been investigated and compared with the zzso of a mouse zzso cell line, zzso and a mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso All three cell types bound specifically to zzso and zzso to different degrees under different cellular zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso zzso and this binding increased upon cellular zzso with zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso Only zzso showed significant binding to zzso By contrast, zzso zzso and zzso bound only zzso and zzso this binding was weak and was altered only marginally upon zzso with zzso In the case of zzso zzso a slight increase in zzso both to zzso and to zzso was observed after cellular zzso with zzso while zzso zzso to both zzso was slightly zzso The mechanism of binding to zzso and zzso was similar in the three cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating for the first time the existence of a functionally active zzso zzso on mouse zzso zzso binding was zzso by zzso zzso as demonstrated by the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to inhibit cell zzso zzso zzso to zzso was via the zzso zzso zzso None of the three cell types tested bound to the basement membrane proteins collagen type IV and zzso or to the zzso zzso constituents zzso collagen types I, V and zzso Interestingly, zzso and collagen type IV were found to repel all three cell zzso The relative inability of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to bind to zzso zzso proteins characteristic of basement zzso and their ability to bind inflammatory markers of the zzso is discussed with respect to zzso zzso zzso
