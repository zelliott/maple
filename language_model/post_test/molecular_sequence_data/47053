In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required for triggering of the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, zzso is essential for the establishment of zzso repression, whereas either zzso or zzso can sustain zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that the extent of zzso repression is zzso correlated with zzso zzso activity and hence with an adequate zzso of zzso sugar zzso zzso However, several lines of evidence indicate that zzso zzso is not the trigger of zzso repression in zzso In the present study we employed zzso zzso of zzso acids important for the binding of sugar and zzso for efficient zzso transfer and for the closure of the zzso zzso to obtain an insight into the structural requirements of zzso for zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso is not essential for zzso in zzso or for signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso caused loss of zzso activity, but zzso sugar binding was zzso However, this was not sufficient to cause zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Moreover, zzso sustained repression despite an extremely low zzso zzso We conclude that the establishment of zzso repression is dependent on the onset of the zzso transfer reaction on zzso and is probably related to the stable formation of a transition intermediate and zzso zzso changes within the zzso In contrast, the role of zzso in zzso zzso seems to be directly connected to its zzso zzso The implications of this model are zzso
