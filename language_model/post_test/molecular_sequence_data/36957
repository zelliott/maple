We have isolated and characterized zzso DNA clones for the human and chicken zzso of the mouse zzso and zzso genes and determined the zzso structure and predicted protein sequences of both zzso genes in all three zzso zzso of these zzso zzso sequences with the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes showed that the two previously identified highly zzso regions within the zzso protein zzso in zzso and Hanks, zzso can be divided into five distinct zzso designated zzso to zzso zzso zzso and 3' to the predicted coding regions of the zzso zzso genes were also analyzed in an attempt to identify zzso DNA sequences important for the regulation of zzso gene zzso zzso sequence similarity was found between the mouse and human zzso both within the putative zzso and 3' untranslated as well as zzso zzso zzso Between the mouse and zzso zzso zzso shorter stretches of sequence similarity were found within the 3' untranslated zzso The zzso untranslated regions of the zzso chicken and zzso zzso zzso however, showed no similarly zzso zzso In a preliminary analysis of the expression pattern of the human zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso were detected in the embryonic and adult zzso respectively and not in other zzso zzso These patterns are analogous to those seen in other zzso Taken together these results further strengthen the suggestion that zzso gene function and regulation has been zzso throughout zzso evolution and, along with the five highly zzso regions within the zzso zzso raise an interesting question about the presence of zzso genetic zzso
