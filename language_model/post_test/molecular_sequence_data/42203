It has been suggested that the induction of zzso a zzso zzso zzso may mediate the zzso action of zzso We assessed the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B4 and the expression of zzso in different populations of blood zzso and in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso from patients with inflammatory lung diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung disease, zzso zzso 6) undergoing zzso treatment at clinically effective zzso No zzso of zzso production was observed in either whole blood or single populations of blood zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso production from zzso zzso zzso in 9 zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso After zzso zzso zzso production was as follows (in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso before and after treatment, respectively zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not in blood zzso by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso at zzso from blood zzso are the most likely cell target for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that cell responsiveness to zzso is acquired during differentiation from zzso to tissue zzso
