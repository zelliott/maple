The zzso initiation factor zzso is a zzso protein complex composed of zzso zzso protein zzso and many zzso factors zzso zzso are important zzso that mediate activated zzso by providing interaction sites for distinct zzso Here, we present evidence that human zzso and its zzso in zzso and zzso have zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso activity maps to the central, most zzso portion of zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso resembles that of zzso and human zzso in that it is specific for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Our findings suggest that targeted zzso zzso at specific promoters by zzso may be involved in mechanisms by which zzso gains access to zzso zzso zzso
