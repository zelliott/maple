A small number of zzso called zzso have high connectivity and are essential for zzso functionality and zzso zzso is a crucial hub in the zzso stress response and zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso binds to zzso regions of its partners, which share similar binding zzso but have a wide range of binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations were used to determine the factors that govern the affinity of all currently known zzso binding partners to zzso Our results show that the affinities to this hub are largely determined by the extent of zzso bound zzso zzso in the free state structures of these zzso zzso Based on our findings, we have designed a zzso zzso that can specifically disrupt the zzso interaction and has the potential for therapeutic zzso
