zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been used to construct a list of 34 hydrogen bonds, 27 zzso angle constraints, and 151 distance constraints, derived from nuclear zzso effect zzso These constraints were used in restrained molecular dynamics calculations on zzso zzso of zzso starting from a folded structure modeled on the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso structures have been zzso which fall into three similar families with few violations of the imposed zzso zzso in the most populated family have a zzso zzso from the average structure of zzso A for the C alpha zzso with good definition of the internal zzso There is good agreement between the calculated structures and other nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The structure is very similar to that recently reported for human zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso Some biological implications of these structures are zzso
