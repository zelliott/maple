zzso zzso of zzso zzso from Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were zzso for genetic zzso A total of 14 zzso were tested for their ability to produce amplification using three zzso zzso one targeting the common zzso zzso region and 2 amplifying novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso While the zzso fragments could be amplified from all zzso only six zzso were capable of amplifying the fragments from the novel zzso The zzso products were further investigated for genetic diversity using restriction zzso length zzso zzso and single strand zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso pattern was evident only at the zzso zzso zzso two of the Argentinean zzso from the zzso zzso shifts on zzso gels revealed that the two Argentinean zzso were not only different from the other four zzso but also differed from each other, both at the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso fragments of all zzso were identical by zzso However, two distinct mobility patterns resulted when the products were zzso on zzso zzso Based on the sequence data from the zzso and the two random zzso the zzso could be broadly classified into two distinct groups, within which minor zzso were zzso In contrast, very little zzso occurred in the sequences of corresponding zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is concluded that there is a considerable degree of zzso among zzso of zzso zzso This diversity should be taken into consideration while attempting to zzso the zzso zzso and biology of zzso zzso in relation to zzso zzso
