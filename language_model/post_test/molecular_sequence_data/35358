zzso of higher zzso contain many zzso zzso which often zzso within the transcribed regions of active zzso Although zzso zzso elements can be silenced to form zzso the impact of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso processing remains largely zzso Here we show using a flowering plant, zzso that full-length transcript formation over zzso zzso depends on a protein named zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which has a zzso zzso domain and an zzso recognition zzso zzso of zzso triggers premature termination of transcripts with 3' zzso processing around zzso zzso at zzso including the zzso zzso gene zzso The need for zzso is zzso in zzso zzso that lack the zzso zzso Our results reveal a mechanism that masks deleterious effects of zzso zzso providing evolutionary sources for genetic and zzso zzso
