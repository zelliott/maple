Low zzso zzso zzso limits hydrocarbon zzso in zzso zzso produced zzso compounds, such as zzso zzso and the PA zzso protein produced by zzso zzso can improve zzso and zzso in liquid culture, but their production and roles in zzso are zzso In this study, we asked if the genes for zzso compounds are expressed in zzso porous media contaminated with zzso Furthermore, if expression does occur, is zzso zzso To detect expression of genes for zzso compounds, we fused the zzso reporter gene either to the promoter region of zzso which encodes for the zzso PA zzso or to the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso We assessed green fluorescent protein zzso production zzso by these gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced in sand culture, indicating that the zzso and zzso genes are both transcribed in zzso porous zzso zzso laser scanning zzso of liquid drops revealed that zzso expression was localized at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso that are deficient in either PA zzso zzso zzso or both were studied to determine if the genetic potential to make zzso compounds zzso an advantage to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso depletion rates and carbon zzso efficiency in sand culture were the same for zzso and zzso zzso zzso whether zzso was zzso or deficient in zzso or zzso zzso Environmental scanning electron zzso revealed that colonization of sand grains was zzso with cells in small zzso clusters instead of multilayered zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso likely produces zzso compounds in sand zzso However, the ability to produce zzso compounds did not enhance zzso in sand culture because zzso cells and zzso zzso favored direct contact to zzso for most zzso In contrast, zzso compounds enable bacteria in liquid culture to adhere to the zzso interface when they otherwise would not, and thus production of zzso compounds is an advantage for zzso zzso in zzso liquid zzso
