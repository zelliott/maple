The possibility of zzso processing of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells using zzso zzso from mouse zzso cells was determined to be 74 zzso by zzso In contrast to the native zzso from zzso cells, the zzso 74 zzso zzso was essentially inactive and zzso in zzso zzso On the other hand, deletion zzso of the zzso zzso lacking a zzso region equivalent to 10 zzso zzso or 20 zzso (54 zzso in size were present as active forms in the soluble fraction of zzso zzso To examine the zzso deletion of the 74 zzso species yielding the 53 zzso species by means of the zzso analysis, two peptides zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso 74 zzso zzso zzso were zzso and rabbit zzso specific for each zzso was zzso On zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso recognized both the zzso 74 zzso and native zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso recognized only the zzso 74 zzso zzso zzso not the native zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activity in the crude extract from zzso cells was not zzso with zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the 53 zzso zzso zzso of native zzso zzso is derived from the unidentified inactive 74 zzso zzso zzso probably by zzso processing of zzso in its zzso zzso
