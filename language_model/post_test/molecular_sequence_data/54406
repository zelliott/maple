In this work, we engineered the zzso fold of zzso zzso based on its molecular structure analysis to obtain more stable zzso By introducing 31 zzso zzso in the zzso fold and zzso them, the incorporation of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed a good balance between high activity and stability at higher temperature and broader zzso This quartet zzso was characterized by an almost zzso increased activity and a zzso increased stability compared to native zzso zzso Our results suggest that such work is safe to increase our target protein stability with no loss of zzso
