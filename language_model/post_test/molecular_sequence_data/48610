A novel zzso named zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso flowers by a combination of zzso acid extraction and different types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined by automated zzso zzso The zzso is zzso consists of 41 zzso zzso and incorporates three zzso zzso Due to the unusual zzso spacing pattern, zzso does not belong to any known plant zzso family, but zzso together with two other zzso peptides zzso and zzso previously isolated from the dandelion zzso To study the biological activity of zzso it was successfully produced in a zzso expression system as a fusion protein with zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be identical to the native zzso by zzso behavior, molecular mass, and zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso displays zzso zzso activity against important zzso Two zzso zzso strategies depending on the fungus were zzso The results obtained add to our knowledge on the structural and functional diversity of zzso in zzso
