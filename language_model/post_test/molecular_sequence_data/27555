zzso C gamma zzso zzso gamma 1 and zzso gamma 2) have a crucial role in the regulation of a variety of cellular zzso Both zzso have also been implicated in signaling events underlying zzso cellular zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have recently identified single point zzso in zzso zzso gamma 2 that lead to spontaneous inflammation and zzso Here we describe further, zzso characterization of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso designated as zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso gamma 1 and zzso gamma 2 with point zzso of this zzso showed that removal of the negative charge enhanced zzso activity in response to zzso stimulation or zzso by zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso and analysis of membrane binding have suggested that zzso zzso facilitate membrane interactions without compromising zzso binding and zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso is within the zzso zzso Replacement of this zzso had no effect on folding of the domain and enhanced zzso zzso of zzso gamma 2 without increasing zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso gamma 2 and corresponding zzso gamma 1 zzso was enhanced in response to zzso stimulation and zzso the requirement for zzso of critical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso affected zzso activity only zzso however, their combination resulted in a zzso active zzso Based on these data, we suggest that each zzso could compromise zzso in the inactive zzso zzso the zzso process; in addition, zzso zzso could enhance membrane interaction in the activated zzso
