zzso a zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso which zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been studied by zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the complex between the zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso spanning zzso 36 to 46 of the zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution, and that of the zzso in the free state has been determined at zzso A zzso The refined model of the complex reveals ten zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso bound in a zzso cavity at the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso adopts a beta zzso structure in which zzso zzso to zzso form a type II zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso is formed between the zzso and the zzso loop of the zzso additional polar interactions occur between zzso atoms of the zzso and zzso groups from zzso zzso protruding from zzso and zzso Three water zzso located at the zzso zzso mediate polar interactions between the zzso and the most buried zzso zzso zzso and zzso A comparison between the free and zzso zzso fragments shows that significant zzso changes occur in the long zzso regions, zzso and zzso upon binding the zzso The zzso of the bound zzso which shows no overall structural similarity to the corresponding segment in zzso zzso suggests that zzso might inhibit zzso by zzso the native structure of the zzso
