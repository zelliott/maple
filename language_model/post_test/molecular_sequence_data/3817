zzso is a small zzso protein of unknown function from zzso tuberculosis that is of fundamental importance in zzso and protective zzso A zzso search has identified distant zzso of zzso in more zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes for zzso proteins often cluster with genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso I speculate that the zzso and zzso proteins form a novel zzso zzso system potentially driven by the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The way is now open to investigate this hypothesis in organisms that are easier to manipulate than zzso zzso
