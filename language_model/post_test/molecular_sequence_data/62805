zzso alpha zzso is an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso that can stimulate insulin zzso by pancreatic beta zzso zzso an zzso gene coding for this protein was assigned to zzso zzso but more recent information available in public databases indicated the position of zzso on zzso We show here that the zzso locus represents the expressed gene consisting of 6 zzso whereas the locus on zzso zzso is apparently a zzso The zzso gene on zzso produces several alternatively spliced zzso and is located within a region linked with zzso in diverse populations including the zzso zzso We analyzed zzso in this Native American population and identified seven zzso which fall into three linkage zzso zzso Analysis of representative markers in over 1200 zzso Indians did not reveal any significant association with zzso or with differences in insulin action and insulin zzso in a subset of approximately zzso zzso zzso In addition, we did not detect any significant correlation of skeletal muscle zzso transcript levels with differences in insulin action in 49 zzso zzso We conclude that sequence zzso in zzso are an unlikely cause for the linkage of zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso
