The zzso cues that govern the fate of cells along the zzso axis of the developing zzso limb are established in the zzso before outgrowth of limb zzso In zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressed in the zzso compartment of the wing disc, specifies zzso cell zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso containing zzso Chick zzso zzso zzso for zzso are detected in the zzso zzso limb zzso and are restricted thereafter to the zzso zzso of the developing chick zzso zzso expression is regulated by the zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso required for normal development of the zzso axis in mouse zzso can induce zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso during limb outgrowth causes zzso to zzso transformations of limb zzso We propose that zzso specifies zzso cell fate during chick limb zzso
