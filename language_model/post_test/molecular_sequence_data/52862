zzso is a zzso protein known to be involved in the processing of zzso zzso zzso We isolated zzso a zzso zzso a zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in size and encodes a zzso of 310 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of 33 zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in the flower and root tissue and at a slightly lower level in leaf zzso whereas it was nearly zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was compared with that of the zzso zzso zzso gene identified by the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid treatment resulted in the zzso of the expression of both zzso and zzso genes in zzso although the degree of suppression was higher for zzso than for zzso In addition, the expression level of zzso decreased with the age of the zzso whereas zzso did not exhibit any zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was studied with an in zzso targeting approach using a fusion zzso and was found to be correctly targeted to the zzso in zzso when expressed as a green fluorescent fusion protein zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso and zzso region is necessary and sufficient to target zzso to the zzso
