The zzso factor zzso regulates expression of numerous genes involved in many cellular zzso Different zzso modifications can influence the zzso control activity and stability of zzso In addition to these zzso alternative zzso zzso may also be the basis of its distinct functional zzso In this study, we identified a novel alternative zzso zzso of zzso named zzso This zzso is generated by exclusion of a short domain, which we designate zzso through alternative zzso zzso site usage in the zzso zzso The existence of this new zzso was confirmed in zzso by Western zzso zzso Although at very low levels, zzso is zzso zzso as seen in its full-length zzso A preliminary characterization of zzso shows that: zzso zzso works as stronger zzso of zzso than full-length zzso zzso percentage of zzso zzso cells is higher in zzso phase and lower in S phase than percentage of zzso zzso zzso
