Genes of the early growth response zzso family zzso zzso factors with a highly zzso DNA binding zinc finger domain, which regulate a variety of zzso zzso late zzso zzso Here, the zzso zzso structure and expression of the bovine zzso of the zzso gene are zzso The gene consists of two zzso and encodes a zzso zzso acid protein with a zzso zinc finger zzso The predicted protein shares between 80 and zzso identity to zzso rat and human zzso proteins and all four species share almost complete identity in the zzso zzso The bovine transcript is alternatively spliced by retaining zzso zzso giving rise to two different zzso differing in three zzso and resulting in an extra zzso zzso in the longer zzso of the predicted zzso The gene was mapped by radiation hybrid zzso mapping to markers on bovine zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in the frontal zzso and zzso and a low expression level was also detected in the zzso The zzso gene was evaluated as a candidate gene for bovine spinal zzso zzso zzso of the gene from a zzso affected animal and a zzso carrier revealed a single base zzso that leads to an zzso acid substitution at zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of this zzso in a pedigree segregating for zzso as well as in a panel of different cattle breeds, and sequence analysis of the entire coding region suggested that the zzso is not the gene responsible for zzso Furthermore, 87 animals of different cattle breeds were screened for zzso zzso zzso resulting in the identification of two zzso in zzso
