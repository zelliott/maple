The complete zzso sequence of an avian zzso the egg drop syndrome zzso virus, was zzso The total zzso length is zzso zzso resulting in a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso The zzso content is only zzso Between map units zzso and zzso the distribution of open reading frames with zzso to known genes is similar to that reported for other zzso and avian zzso However, no zzso to zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso Outside this region, several open reading frames were identified without any obvious zzso to known zzso zzso In the region organized similarly as other zzso zzso most zzso were found to an zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The highest level of zzso acid identity was found for the zzso proteins of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified thanks to the zzso with the VA zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso with zzso were also found in the fiber zzso Our results demonstrate that the avian zzso virus represents an intermediate between zzso and avian zzso The zzso sequence and zzso organization of the zzso virus reflect the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
