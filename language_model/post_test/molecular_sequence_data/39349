In the present work, we report expression in zzso coli, zzso and characterization of zzso full-length zzso zzso from outer zzso zzso zzso of expression conditions for zzso zzso from outer zzso membrane allowed reaching expression level up to zzso zzso of the zzso per liter of zzso zzso zzso zzso from outer zzso membrane was zzso from cell zzso by using zzso zzso It has zzso zzso and zzso properties similar to those of zzso zzso from rat liver outer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as affinity zzso to study its interaction with electron transfer zzso By using this approach, it is shown that in interaction of zzso zzso zzso with both forms of zzso zzso an important role is played by zzso interactions between zzso although the contribution of these interactions in complex formation with zzso zzso zzso is different for zzso of zzso zzso
