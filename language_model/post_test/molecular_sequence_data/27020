A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a marine zzso sample collected from zzso city, located on the shore of the Sea of zzso A zzso zzso gene sequence comparison indicated that the isolate represents a novel zzso that clusters with members of the families zzso and zzso zzso zzso shared maximum zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso value between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The following zzso characteristics of strain zzso were markedly different from those of strains in the zzso zzso The cell wall contained zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso other zzso detected were zzso and zzso The only polar zzso was zzso and the zzso content of the DNA was 70 zzso zzso in zzso characteristics and large zzso distances between strain zzso and all members of the zzso zzso supported the zzso of zzso within a new zzso and species, for which the name zzso marina zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso marina is zzso zzso zzso zzso
