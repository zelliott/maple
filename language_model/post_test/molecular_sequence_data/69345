The principal role of zzso is to prevent bacterial invasion at body zzso We are interested in how zzso is regulated at the surface of the respiratory zzso where the zzso zzso cell is regarded as the primary cellular source of this zzso Since the cow zzso contains at least 10 zzso zzso our objective was to determine which of them are expressed in the cow zzso zzso zzso zzso By screening zzso zzso libraries with a probe constructed from the zzso zzso stomach zzso 2, we obtained 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso base pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a previously reported gene zzso sequence identity to the stomach 2 zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso genes not previously zzso Northern zzso analysis of cow zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of three distinct zzso Based on zzso with zzso specific for each zzso we determined that the longest transcript corresponded to zzso zzso the shortest to zzso and the zzso transcript to zzso zzso cow zzso zzso zzso cell zzso reverse transcribed and amplified by the zzso chain reaction with zzso common to all three zzso yielded a product that zzso to zzso zzso specific for all three zzso but most strongly to that for zzso These results indicate that multiple zzso zzso are expressed in the cow trachea and that the zzso zzso by zzso zzso is the major form expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso cell zzso is predicted to differ zzso in structure from both zzso and zzso zzso with an zzso ratio almost zzso zzso The sequence differences may zzso functional differences, including variable resistance to zzso and variable affinity for large zzso zzso zzso found in the respiratory tract zzso
