A novel cloned zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was described and functionally zzso This zzso consists of a zzso transition leading to the substitution of zzso zzso by an zzso zzso in the core of zzso domain zzso The resulting zzso protein has the same selectivity and affinity for natural zzso and zzso drugs as zzso but much lower zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso into a polarized membrane seems unaffected in the zzso In a preliminary survey of a typical Spanish population, this zzso showed an zzso frequency of zzso The functional impairment of the zzso zzso is attributable to the presence of an zzso rather than the loss of a zzso at position zzso because an engineered zzso protein with a zzso zzso at this position zzso and zzso have similar kinetic zzso The sodium zzso kinetic analysis of both zzso revealed a variation in the affinity for sodium and a shift in the Hill zzso that could be consistent with a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the presence of an zzso zzso in the core of zzso domain 13 is responsible for the different sodium affinity showed by the zzso zzso compared with the reference zzso zzso with the zzso zzso might show a lower zzso and zzso analog zzso capacity, which could be clinically zzso
