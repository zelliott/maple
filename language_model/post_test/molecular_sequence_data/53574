zzso growth factor zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso are recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso and cloned from human stomach cancer cell line zzso as specific zzso against zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso was identical with the protein originally reported as zzso zzso Both proteins contain two zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of which the first domain zzso is mainly responsible for the zzso activity against zzso and are expressed zzso in various zzso In this study, we cloned the genes coding for these two structurally similar proteins by screening of human zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso library and their zzso structures were zzso zzso and zzso genes consist of 11 and 8 zzso spanning 12 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three zzso were inserted between zzso and zzso of each zzso of which the middle one was the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and the zzso specific zzso zzso Apparently zzso regions between zzso and zzso were not found in zzso region and neither zzso nor zzso box was zzso The genes were mapped to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggested that although zzso and zzso genes might be derived from same zzso zzso they acquired distinctive in zzso roles during their zzso
