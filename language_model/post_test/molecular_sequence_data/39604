zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso is a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism and plays a pivotal role in the zzso regulation of different zzso genes zzso zzso zzso In previous studies, the regulation of zzso zzso levels by zzso hormone has remained zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso regulates the mouse zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso regulates the mouse zzso gene expression in the liver, as shown by zzso protection zzso and real-time quantitative zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso using zzso and zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso regulates the mouse zzso gene promoter zzso to zzso and that zzso zzso located around the zzso start site is responsible for the negative regulation by zzso zzso shift zzso showed that zzso X zzso hormone zzso zzso bound to zzso but zzso X zzso X zzso zzso could not bind to the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso induced zzso hormone zzso recruitment to zzso Thus, we demonstrated that mouse zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso and that zzso zzso regulates mouse zzso gene zzso via a novel negative zzso hormone response zzso zzso
