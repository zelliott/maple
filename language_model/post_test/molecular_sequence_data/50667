Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of zzso in the zzso The characteristic zzso findings in this disease are zzso zzso senile zzso and often zzso zzso of cerebrovascular zzso These zzso are commonly found in the zzso and zzso and their clinical significance has been highlighted by quantitative studies showing a significant correlation between the numbers of zzso zzso and senile plaques and the clinical severity of zzso In 1984, zzso and zzso isolated a novel protein zzso zzso from cerebrovascular zzso of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and adult zzso zzso In the following year, Masters et zzso using zzso acid sequence data, demonstrated that zzso is also a component of senile plaque zzso zzso zzso this chemical data was supported by light microscopic and electron microscopic zzso studies showing that cerebrovascular and senile plaque zzso deposits are zzso to synthetic zzso zzso zzso In addition, some recent zzso and zzso studies have revealed important new information on the zzso of the senile zzso senile plaques may undergo sequential structural zzso On the basis of the investigation on a series of zzso syndrome cases, an extensive appearance of zzso deposits is an early zzso change in Alzheimer's disease, and the formation of zzso changes, including zzso develops at an advanced zzso The availability of zzso zzso acid sequence data led to the identification of a full-length zzso clone coding a possible precursor of zzso zzso However, the origin or function of this zzso precursor still remains zzso Further studies are required to know the exact zzso of Alzheimer's zzso
