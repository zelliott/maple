A variety of reasons related to the zzso class I system has complicated the application of molecular approaches to zzso class I zzso Here we present a zzso zzso typing strategy considering the sequence variations of the two most zzso zzso which allows complete zzso of the zzso zzso The method is based on a zzso amplification identifying the zzso defined zzso zzso The zzso products generated by these zzso zzso bear the sequence information necessary for a zzso specificity zzso The primer pairs are located within one zzso either zzso 2 or zzso 3, which avoids amplification of zzso zzso sequences allowing subsequent zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso direct zzso Using this method we investigated 48 cell lines and 153 clinical zzso 23 zzso reactions are performed per individual for the assignment of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in all cell lines and 85 clinical samples typed on two separate zzso With the exception of 13 out of 231 possible zzso combinations all zzso and zzso combinations of zzso can be distinguished by specific amplification zzso Comparing the zzso based typing results with those of zzso in zzso a zzso was zzso zzso sequencing or zzso analysis of the zzso zzso fragments allowed complete zzso of the zzso zzso This strategy can identify all 48 zzso zzso based on the sequence variations of the 2nd and 3rd zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso combinations are possible for the zzso zzso Only 4 out of these zzso zzso combinations remained zzso
