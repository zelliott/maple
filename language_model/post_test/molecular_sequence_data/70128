The crystal structure of the complexes of zzso and zzso with human zzso have been solved and refined to zzso of zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to a family of zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso mimicking the zzso zzso zzso is an analog of zzso zzso has the same zzso zzso connected to a shortened zzso zzso part by a short, zzso zzso The zzso zzso is well defined in the electron density with the exception of the zzso zzso The zzso follows near the bottom of the canyon connecting the active site with the zzso forms a short zzso zzso arrangement with zzso and makes van der zzso contacts with zzso of zzso In the zzso complex, the zzso and zzso parts of the inhibitor are well ordered (except the zzso zzso while the central portion of the zzso is partially zzso The zzso analog in the zzso position of zzso assumes a zzso similar to that of the zzso form zzso and zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso and supports the identification of the zzso site as restricted by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso oxygen of the zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso hole formed by the zzso groups of zzso and zzso while the zzso carbon is positioned within a short distance, zzso A, from the O gamma of zzso This resembles the zzso of the zzso zzso bound to other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso common to both zzso binds to zzso in a fashion very similar to that of other zzso having this zzso The binding of the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso is similar to that observed in zzso and zzso zzso
