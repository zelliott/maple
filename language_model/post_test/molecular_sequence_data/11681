The zzso gene of zzso coli encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso a regulatory locus controlling multiple zzso resistance in this zzso zzso of zzso results in increased expression of zzso which acts at several target genes in the cell leading to reduced zzso zzso Exposure of zzso coli to sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso 

zzso zzso libraries were introduced into a reporter strain designed to identify cloned genes zzso zzso zzso zzso Computer analysis of sequence databases was also used to search for proteins related to zzso 

A second zzso coli zzso zzso that exhibits zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso database searching revealed a family of 10 proteins from a variety of bacteria that share significant zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso and zzso At least four of these proteins are zzso zzso whose activity is antagonized by zzso or by zzso agents structurally related to zzso 

The zzso family is identified as a group of regulatory factors whose activity is modulated in response to environmental signals in the form of zzso zzso Many of these agents are plant zzso Some of the zzso zzso appear more likely to control systems expressed in animal zzso suggesting that zzso sensing by bacteria is important in a variety of environments and in the regulation of numerous zzso
