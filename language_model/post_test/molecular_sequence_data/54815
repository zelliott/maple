The group zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the group zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli have zzso proteins zzso with a zzso domain zzso and an zzso domain zzso Both have been successfully zzso to invade target zzso other than their zzso target zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso lacking D and zzso zzso is highly active in zzso in its host, zzso zzso We found that zzso was also mobile in zzso coli and that zzso in this zzso host depended on temperature, being more efficient at zzso than at zzso Furthermore, we programmed zzso to recognize target sites other than its zzso zzso These zzso zzso efficiently and specifically zzso into a recipient zzso target site or a target site present as a single copy in the zzso generating a zzso in the targeted zzso Our results extend the range of group II zzso available for gene zzso
