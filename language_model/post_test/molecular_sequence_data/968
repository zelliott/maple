The accessory zzso protein allows human zzso virus type 1 zzso to persist at high levels and to cause AIDS in infected zzso The function of zzso group M zzso B zzso zzso has been extensively zzso and a variety of in zzso activities believed to be important for viral zzso have been zzso However, the function of zzso zzso derived from naturally zzso zzso virus zzso zzso the original host of zzso or from the zzso N and O groups resulting from independent zzso transmissions remains to be zzso In the present study we demonstrate that zzso and zzso group N or O zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and class I or II zzso molecules and zzso surface expression of the zzso chain zzso associated with immature major zzso complex zzso class zzso Furthermore, the ability of zzso to interact with the zzso zzso 2 was generally zzso The functional activity of zzso group N and O zzso genes did not differ significantly from group M zzso zzso However, zzso zzso genes as a group showed a zzso and zzso activity in modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso respectively, but were zzso less active in zzso zzso class II molecules zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso M zzso zzso Our finding that primary zzso zzso zzso derived from naturally infected chimpanzees zzso the surface expression of various human cellular receptors involved in zzso zzso and zzso presentation suggests that functional zzso genes helped the zzso virus to persist efficiently in infected humans immediately after zzso zzso
