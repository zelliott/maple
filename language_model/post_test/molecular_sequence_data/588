zzso brown spot disease is caused by the zzso fungus zzso zzso Its zzso capability has been thought to depend exclusively on the production of zzso ACT zzso However, zzso of plant defenses is also likely to be important for the disease zzso To investigate the zzso response to zzso zzso oxygen species zzso we cloned and characterized the zzso gene of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso resembling zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in cellular responses to zzso zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso strain was primarily induced by zzso or zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso we demonstrated an essential requirement for zzso tolerance during the host invasion zzso zzso lacking zzso showed increased sensitivity to zzso and loss of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not cause any visible zzso zzso on wounded or zzso leaves of citrus zzso zzso Compared with the wild type, the zzso zzso displayed lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were restored to the wild type in zzso strains expressing a functional copy of zzso Upon exposure to zzso the zzso zzso green fluorescent zzso fusion protein became localized in the zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso partially restored zzso zzso Our results highlight the global regulatory role of a zzso zzso in response to zzso stress in zzso zzso and provide insights into the critical role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
