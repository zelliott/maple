We examined functional contributions of zzso contacts within the zzso zzso zzso binding site using single channel kinetic zzso zzso zzso and a zzso model of the major zzso zzso At the principal face of the binding site, the zzso zzso forms a highly zzso zzso contact near zzso zzso and zzso zzso recordings show that the zzso zzso markedly slows zzso zzso binding to receptors in the resting closed state, but does not affect rates of channel opening and zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso at both positions substantially affects the zzso of zzso zzso showing that zzso side chains at these positions are not hydrogen bond donors for the strong zzso zzso However substituting a negative charge at zzso but not at zzso zzso the effect of zzso demonstrating that a negative charge in the region of zzso contact zzso rapid association of zzso zzso within the structural framework of zzso binding protein and a zzso model of the zzso zzso binding site, these results zzso main chain zzso groups in the domain harboring zzso as principal hydrogen bond donors for zzso The specific effect of zzso on zzso association suggests that zzso hydrogen bonding positions zzso for optimal interaction with zzso
