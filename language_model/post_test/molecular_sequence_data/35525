The zzso in pea zzso zzso zzso and lentil zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in the present zzso For that purpose, the zzso were zzso as native proteins from their natural zzso An zzso zzso of pea zzso zzso zzso by zzso H under zzso conditions combined with its zzso zzso by zzso was carried out in order to analyze both zzso and zzso zzso with a residual zzso attached at the originally occupied zzso zzso The released zzso were subjected to a manual zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were also performed directly on peptides and zzso generated by zzso zzso of the studied zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso after their separation on a zzso using a zzso zzso device clearly demonstrated binding of zzso and hybrid zzso structures at zzso Such carbohydrates have been reported to exist in many plant zzso zzso in zzso Although zzso zzso structures were identified after the zzso zzso they could not be assigned to a particular zzso zzso The presence of unoccupied zzso sites in several peptides was also confirmed from zzso zzso
