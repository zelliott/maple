zzso of human DNA sequences in 16 zzso zzso cell hybrids containing different human zzso were performed by the zzso chain reaction zzso using primer directed at zzso regions of zzso or zzso the two major classes of zzso repetitive sequences zzso A zzso pattern of amplification products was observed on zzso gels run with zzso zzso producing a zzso This simple gel analysis provides a rapid method for identifying and monitoring the human zzso content of zzso zzso cell hybrids without conventional zzso zzso zzso containing multiple human zzso produce complex gel patterns, but identification of zzso content can be achieved by zzso of zzso products against a reference panel of zzso or highly reduced hybrids representing each human zzso This zzso method also enables identification of human marker zzso or zzso pieces in hybrids that are not identifiable by zzso zzso These zzso methods should greatly reduce the need for more zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso
