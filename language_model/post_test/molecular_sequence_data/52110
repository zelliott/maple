zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso trees native to Central America and zzso Research zzso have been initiated to define the native distribution of zzso and sample the spectrum of genetic zzso To date, there has been little systematic assessment of genetic zzso in zzso tree zzso zzso estimates of diversity zzso and zzso are considered a prerequisite for the zzso of sampling and breeding zzso We have used a zzso zzso zzso procedure zzso to monitor genetic zzso in zzso zzso genetic zzso was detected between species and the zzso was zzso into zzso and zzso zzso On average, most zzso per zzso of the variation occurs between zzso zzso populations but zzso zzso differed in their capacity to detect zzso between and within zzso zzso genetic markers were zzso zzso provide a cost-effective method for the precise and routine evaluation of zzso and may be used to identify areas of maximum zzso The approaches outlined have general zzso to a range of organisms and are discussed in relation to the exploitation of zzso tree species of the zzso
