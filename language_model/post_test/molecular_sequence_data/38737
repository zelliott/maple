A computerized database was generated with the zzso data of more than 600 zzso virus strains and zzso kept in the zzso zzso Laboratory for Classical zzso zzso in zzso In addition, as sequence data from defined regions of the zzso are increasingly being used for genetic typing of new zzso and are thus being published, it was decided to integrate them into the zzso In order to make the zzso and the sequence data available to other laboratories through the World Wide Web, a zzso web interface was zzso which can be zzso using an Internet browser like zzso or Internet zzso The possibility to exchange data via the web has the potential to increase our knowledge concerning genetic and zzso links between outbreaks zzso
