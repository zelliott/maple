Broad been zzso virus zzso is the only member of the zzso that is known to accumulate zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso De zzso generation of zzso zzso was demonstrated during serial passages of zzso in broad bean using either zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations or transcribed zzso zzso zzso As for previously described zzso zzso all but one of the characterized de zzso generated zzso zzso were derived by a single zzso deletion from the zzso zzso The sole exception was derived by two shorter zzso deletions from zzso The maintenance of an open reading frame by all zzso zzso suggests the importance of coding capacity and/or the shortened zzso protein in the zzso of these zzso during zzso The deletion junction sites were between zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the retained regions are essential for the efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Short regions of sequence similarity and/or zzso were revealed at the zzso and 3' junction zzso We speculate that these regions can facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso the full-length zzso sequences of zzso components of the Type and Morocco strains of zzso are zzso
