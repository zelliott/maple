zzso zzso in zzso requires coordinated folding and assembly of a zzso into sequential zzso complexes in which chemical modifications and zzso zzso zzso These processes require many small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is one such protein that is built from multiple zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso with five zzso is present in all branches of the zzso zzso tree, except in animals and zzso that instead have a version with six zzso and zzso which have a minimal zzso protein with four zzso zzso therefore evolved as a zzso protein very early in zzso The zzso between the zzso have zzso zzso they are zzso except for zzso 3, and position the zzso at zzso relative distances from each zzso All but one of the zzso have zzso properties for zzso and each zzso has a specific consensus sequence and a zzso position in the zzso suggesting a functionally important modular zzso The patterns of evolutionary conservation provide information for experimental analyses of the function of zzso In zzso zzso analysis confirmed that a highly zzso loop zzso in zzso is essential for zzso
