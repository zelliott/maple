We present a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species zzso based on sequences of approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and propose a zzso zzso The zzso includes all described zzso and two unnamed zzso All analyses indicate that zzso is zzso and contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso includes zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso includes all species distributed in W Ecuador and zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso species is strongly supported within zzso zzso of zzso zzso fall into two zzso zzso each of which occupies two zzso portions of the species zzso Overall, our zzso is zzso with most previous zzso This study is among the few published zzso zzso of zzso zzso derived from molecular zzso A review of the proportion of new species detected by similar studies suggests that the increasing use of molecular techniques will lead to the discovery of a vast number of species of zzso zzso
