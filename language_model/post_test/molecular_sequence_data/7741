zzso of an zzso marker genetic linkage map of human zzso 9 using the zzso reference zzso has been achieved through the addition of 11 markers to the previous map of 26 zzso Five of the 11 markers added to the map are new markers of the zzso repeat type, 1 is a complex zzso and the remaining 5 as well as the original 26 markers are all zzso zzso Twelve zzso and five probable zzso were detected in this analysis and were more common for the zzso repeats than the zzso zzso Strong evidence for positive interference was seen over the length of the zzso but there were significantly more double zzso events in the zzso region than elsewhere, suggesting that interference is less strong in that zzso
