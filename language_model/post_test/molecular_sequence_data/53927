zzso zzso and zzso P are both zzso zzso performing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at a specific site in the zzso transcript to initiate processing of the zzso zzso zzso P zzso precursor zzso to create the zzso end of the mature zzso In spite of their different zzso the two zzso have significant structural zzso For example, the two zzso in zzso zzso share eight protein zzso only one protein is unique to each zzso The zzso components of the two zzso also show striking zzso zzso To begin to characterize the role of the zzso zzso in zzso function and zzso zzso we swapped two hairpin structures zzso and zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso of zzso zzso The zzso in the two zzso could be exchanged without loss of function or zzso On the other hand, when the zzso hairpin in zzso zzso of zzso zzso was replaced with the corresponding hairpin from the zzso of zzso zzso or human zzso zzso no functional zzso was zzso We propose that the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso perform similar functions and have zzso to maintain common features that are different from those of zzso and zzso zzso in other zzso
