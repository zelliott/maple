Two strictly zzso bacterial strains zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso in a zzso reactor treating waste from cattle farms in zzso They had identical zzso zzso gene sequences and showed almost the same zzso zzso The cells of both strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso extraordinarily long rods often zzso zzso stimulation of growth occurred with the addition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso The supplementary zzso and zzso could be replaced if zzso and clarified sludge fluid obtained from the reactor was zzso Both strains zzso a range of growth zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both strains produced zzso and zzso with a small amount of zzso from these zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso Both strains were slightly zzso having a pH optimum at about zzso The temperature range for growth was zzso degrees C, the optimum being 30 degrees zzso The zzso concentration range for growth was zzso % zzso zzso activity was not detected in cells cultivated without zzso whereas cells cultivated with zzso usually had the zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were not zzso zzso was zzso but gelatin was not zzso Both strains were sensitive to zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids of both strains were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the major respiratory zzso and the zzso DNA zzso contents were zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences placed both strains in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso storage zzso was the species most closely related to both strains zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to the type zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
