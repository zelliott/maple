zzso have been identified based on highly zzso two zzso zzso boxes that are important for the formation of a zzso zzso Some zzso zzso however, have less zzso zzso zzso Although they have lower zzso with conventional zzso they should be included in zzso family based on their zzso six zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso They are widely distributed in zzso zzso Only zzso from plants and zzso from zzso were examined previously and found to be localized inside the zzso zzso zzso will be a common feature of these zzso proteins since most of them have positively charged zzso acid clusters at the zzso similar to zzso motif zzso for an zzso zzso retention zzso zzso they are tentatively named zzso in this zzso Currently, studies on their functions and biological roles are zzso zzso were shown to function as water channels and the disruption of zzso produced zzso fatal zzso zzso Further works on zzso will reveal new insights into the roles of zzso
