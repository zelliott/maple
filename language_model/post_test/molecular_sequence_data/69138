The initial adhesive interactions between circulating zzso and zzso are zzso in part, by zzso We now report the expression cloning of a functional zzso for zzso from an zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence reveals a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso cells to zzso requires zzso of both the protein zzso and a zzso This binding is calcium dependent and can be inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells express the zzso as a zzso of 220 zzso A soluble zzso zzso when zzso with zzso in zzso cells, also mediates zzso binding and is zzso with the major zzso zzso that specifically binds zzso
