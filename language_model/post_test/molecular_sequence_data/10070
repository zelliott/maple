To provide material suitable for structural studies of the zzso zzso zzso we have expressed and zzso the zzso zzso domain of the mouse muscle alpha zzso Several zzso were initially investigated using zzso zzso as a convenient small scale expression zzso A fusion protein zzso consisting of the 210 zzso zzso acids of the alpha zzso and a zzso zzso sequence zzso surface zzso binding in zzso zzso of zzso with an analogous construct made from the delta zzso showed no evidence of zzso zzso The zzso protein was chosen for large scale expression in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso from these cells and zzso on an zzso zzso zzso and column zzso show that the zzso protein is processed as expected and exists as a zzso The zzso protein also retains the two zzso zzso binding sites expected for the correctly folded alpha zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso suggest that this region of the zzso includes considerable zzso secondary structure, with a small proportion of zzso
