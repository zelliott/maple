zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso is zzso active during zzso infection in human peripheral sensory zzso This zzso has been linked to the ability of the virus to zzso but its potential gene products and mechanisms of action are zzso To analyze the viral zzso transcripts in zzso and zzso cell lines in an isolated cellular system, a zzso zzso DNA fragment, which covers the entire viral zzso active zzso region, was cloned under control of the zzso zzso promoter zzso During transient zzso of a human embryonic kidney zzso cell line, zzso expressed high levels of the zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso that was not zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as the minor zzso zzso could not be identified by Northern zzso zzso zzso expression was further analyzed following zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso at high levels in these cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso which in zzso can be identified only during zzso zzso infection in zzso which facilitate zzso was present at very low amounts in zzso and zzso cells using reverse zzso zzso zzso Higher amounts of the zzso zzso zzso were produced in zzso cells, a zzso cell line shown to possess zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso cells in lesser amounts than produced during zzso infection in peripheral sensory zzso This novel cellular system provides now a tool for future studies of the role of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
