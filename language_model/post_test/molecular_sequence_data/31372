We have characterized the binding zzso of human zzso growth factor I zzso I) for a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which was obtained from the National zzso and zzso Program, recognizes zzso surrounding zzso 15 and 16 in the zzso and zzso zzso 55 and 56 in the zzso These zzso are predicted to be within zzso segments which are accessible for surface zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively recognizes the region surrounding zzso 15 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both zzso zzso as judged by their ability to inhibit binding of zzso I to type 1 receptors on human zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso I and zzso zzso for which it has high affinity to stimulate DNA synthesis in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso at zzso 15 and 16, which have poor affinity for zzso zzso stimulate DNA synthesis with equal potency in the presence and absence of zzso zzso These zzso bind normally to zzso which we have previously shown have drastically reduced binding to type 1 zzso zzso indicating that the zzso and the receptors recognize distinct zzso of zzso zzso
