Two small cryptic zzso zzso and zzso identified in zzso zzso strain zzso were detected and zzso Complete sequencing of zzso and zzso revealed these plasmids to be zzso and zzso in length with a zzso content of zzso and zzso zzso Both plasmids zzso four open reading frames zzso 2, 3 and zzso Only the predicted zzso gene product of both plasmids zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso proteins previously identified on plasmids zzso using a zzso replication zzso A zzso origin zzso of zzso highly zzso in the group III zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and located immediately upstream of this putative zzso zzso In addition, both plasmids contained a putative zzso origin of replication zzso exhibiting similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA by Southern analysis and zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the cryptic zzso zzso via an zzso zzso A potential shuttle zzso zzso was constructed by zzso of zzso to the cloning zzso zzso II zzso along with the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso It was successfully used for the transformation of zzso zzso and zzso
