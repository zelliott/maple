An unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso originating from zzso was characterized using zzso molecular chemical and molecular zzso zzso Chemical studies revealed the presence of a zzso zzso based on zzso acid zzso zzso a complex mixture of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso cellular fatty acids and zzso zzso with eight zzso units zzso as the major respiratory zzso This combination of characteristics somewhat resembled members of the zzso zzso but did not zzso to any currently described zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing confirmed that the unidentified zzso zzso is a member of the zzso and represents a zzso zzso related to, albeit different from, a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso and zzso considerations, it is proposed that the unknown zzso originating from lake zzso be classified as a new zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
