zzso and zzso functionally distinct heat shock protein zzso molecular zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso cells, zzso zzso is necessary for propagation of the zzso zzso prion zzso zzso is zzso The ability to function in zzso maintenance has been zzso because zzso can function to maintain zzso in an zzso form in place of zzso but zzso zzso An extended zzso region of zzso composed of a region rich in zzso zzso zzso and another rich in zzso zzso zzso is critical for prion zzso Single zzso acid zzso in a short stretch of zzso acids of the zzso region of zzso that are absent in the otherwise highly zzso zzso region of zzso cause defects in prion zzso However, there is some functional zzso within the zzso regions of zzso because a deletion of the adjacent zzso zzso region was somewhat defective in propagation of zzso as zzso These results are consistent with a model in which the zzso regions of zzso contain specific zzso of function zzso through interaction with zzso
