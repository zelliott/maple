Certain sequences within proteins have the ability to undergo an abrupt cooperative zzso switch from zzso to zzso in response to decreasing polarity of the zzso This behavior was first observed at the zzso binding site of the envelope zzso zzso of zzso but evidence has accumulated that zzso beta zzso alpha switches may be zzso serving both to facilitate binding on zzso or zzso contact and to signal that zzso has zzso The characteristics identified so far that distinguish switch sequences (a reverse turn at the zzso that acts as a zzso initiation site, a zzso zzso zzso zzso and high potential for both the zzso and zzso appear to be necessary but not zzso as some otherwise promising sequences found in data bank searches proved not to be capable of cooperative zzso Analysis of existing switches has led to the development of the side chain interaction index zzso as a further zzso characterizing the beta zzso alpha zzso zzso Data bank searches using this additional zzso have successfully identified a series of new potential switch zzso All of them have in common the zzso acid zzso zzso at the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Those with a high zzso as well, when zzso and tested, exhibited strongly cooperative zzso zzso Control zzso containing all other parameters but with a low zzso did zzso Using this new information, an artificial sequence was designed that had a high zzso as well as the initiation site, zzso zzso and high zzso and zzso When zzso and tested, this sequence did in fact behave as a zzso switch, zzso zzso from zzso to zzso at a threshold value of zzso zzso The successful design of a zzso zzso switch opens the possibility of using this motif as a tool in protein zzso
