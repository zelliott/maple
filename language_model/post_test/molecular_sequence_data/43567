zzso zzso zzso crystal structures have been determined for bovine pancreatic zzso A zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as for a native structure refined to zzso zzso These zzso zzso are the two most potent zzso of zzso A reported so far, with Ki values of 240 and 520 zzso zzso The binding modes and zzso of zzso and zzso were found to differ markedly from those anticipated on the basis of earlier structures of zzso A zzso The key difference is that the zzso rather than the zzso of each inhibitor occupies the zzso zzso binding zzso As a consequence, the zzso zzso of the two zzso are shifted by approximately 2 A compared to the positions of their counterparts in earlier complexes, and the zzso rings are rotated into unusual zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso rings of both zzso are reversed with respect to the others but nonetheless engage in extensive interactions with the zzso that form the B2 zzso binding site of zzso zzso Despite the close structural similarity of the two zzso the zzso of their zzso rings are different: zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, their zzso and zzso interact with largely different sets of zzso zzso The results of this zzso study emphasize the difficulties inherent in qualitative modeling of zzso interactions and the compelling reasons for high-resolution structural studies in which quantitative design of improved zzso was zzso The structures presented here provide a promising starting point for the rational design of zzso zzso zzso which may be used as therapeutic agents in restraining the zzso activities of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
