The unique zzso zzso of cardiac zzso is determined by the expression of a set of zzso zzso By zzso to other zzso zzso systems, it is likely that the coordinate expression of cardiac genes is controlled by zzso zzso factors that interact with promoter and zzso elements in the zzso regulatory regions of these zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso C zzso zzso contains a specific binding site for the zzso zinc finger zzso factor, zzso and that zzso zzso and protein is expressed in cardiac zzso In addition, zzso binding sites were identified in several previously characterized zzso zzso regulatory zzso The zzso zzso binding site is required for zzso zzso activity in primary cardiac zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso of zzso in zzso muscle cells such as zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which zzso functions to direct zzso gene expression during zzso cardiac zzso
