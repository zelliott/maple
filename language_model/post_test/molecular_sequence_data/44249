Cellular zzso serves as the primer for reverse zzso of human zzso virus, type 1 zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso reverse zzso is packaged into viral particles and zzso to the zzso site (PBS) of the zzso zzso to initiate reverse zzso zzso the zzso step of reverse zzso is a potential target for zzso zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso region such that zzso specificity was zzso to the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso retains zzso binding to zzso reverse zzso viral zzso and is able to prime at both the targeted zzso sequence and at the viral zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso results in marked zzso of zzso zzso as determined by zzso of viral zzso zzso formation, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso replication through interference with the normal process of zzso constitutes a new zzso approach and also provides a novel tool for zzso molecular aspects of zzso
