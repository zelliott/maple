The purpose of this study was to develop a satisfactory technique to detect zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The strains zzso coli HB 101 zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso were submitted to zzso with zzso zzso and zzso which amplify the genetic region susceptible of zzso zzso Then, we developed Southern zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso 37 y zzso zzso corresponding to first and last zzso 

A region of zzso zzso was amplified using the zzso previously zzso zzso experiments with the zzso 261 probe gave positive signal with both strains (both carry the zzso zzso 37 only zzso with zzso and zzso 37 only with zzso 

The use of zzso which amplify all the region susceptible of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso allows the specific detection of point modifications in the original genes by the use of zzso zzso zzso
