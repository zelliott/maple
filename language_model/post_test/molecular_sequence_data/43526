An zzso zzso study by zzso and DNA sequencing was carried out in the Spanish zzso As a result, a new zzso zzso zzso initially assigned by zzso chain reaction zzso as zzso was zzso This zzso presents a synonymous change at zzso 77 zzso zzso when compared with the zzso zzso This position is located in the zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the zzso binding region of the hypothetical zzso zzso Among 60 Spanish individuals, zzso presents the highest zzso frequency, followed in decreasing order by zzso zzso (new zzso and zzso Also, new partial zzso 1 and complete zzso 2 sequences from zzso zzso and zzso are zzso the sequences are identical among the three zzso However, the zzso 2 sequence of the zzso zzso bears a zzso deletion not found in zzso
