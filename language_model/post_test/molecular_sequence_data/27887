The cloning of genes zzso zzso DNA binding zzso factors for zzso zzso II has provided the opportunity to analyze the structure and function of these zzso This review summarizes recent studies that define structural zzso for DNA binding and zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms by which these factors may activate zzso initiation and by which they may be regulated to achieve differential gene expression are also zzso
