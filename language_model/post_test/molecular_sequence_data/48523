zzso zzso an opportunistic pathogen causing various infections, expresses various zzso factors under the control of zzso sensing zzso a cell zzso zzso Because the major signal molecules of zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that act upon zzso group transfer could affect the zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso of zzso and screened them for the activity influencing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among seven zzso tested in this study, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly affected both growth of zzso and the activity of zzso a major zzso regulator, when zzso These zzso also reduced zzso and swarming zzso of zzso The other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso activity, swarming zzso zzso production and zzso without any influence on zzso These effects by zzso zzso were caused by less production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso formation and swarming zzso with no effect on the growth and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an important factor regulating the cellular activity about zzso zzso
