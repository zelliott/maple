zzso zzso can be induced by highly transcribed zzso through a zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso and may function as a zzso protection mechanism against excessively expressed zzso Whether all transcripts or just zzso transcripts activate this protection mechanism is zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by a zzso with three direct repeats of the zzso zzso open reading frame zzso is associated with high levels of zzso zzso zzso probably from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts from triple zzso zzso repeats were zzso in the wild type but accumulated in an zzso zzso suggesting targeting for degradation by zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso without a 3' zzso zzso produced zzso zzso zzso and consistent zzso zzso zzso Both zzso triple repeats and zzso zzso zzso silenced an expressed zzso zzso in trans in the wild type but not in the zzso zzso zzso two 3' zzso in the zzso zzso 3' reduced zzso 3' zzso decreased zzso small interfering zzso zzso and enhanced zzso gene zzso Moreover, zzso was localized in the zzso We propose that improperly zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is subject to zzso zzso zzso probably by acting as templates for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
