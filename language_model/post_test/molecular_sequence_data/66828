zzso zzso are critical structural elements in zzso defining turns, zzso secondary structure zzso and zzso zzso Control of zzso zzso therefore may be used to define protein structure and zzso zzso zzso derivatives may be used to control zzso ring zzso which zzso with protein main chain zzso To examine the use of zzso zzso restriction to tune zzso protein stability, a series of peptides derived from the zzso cage zzso was zzso zzso at zzso 12 of the zzso cage zzso which adopts a zzso ring zzso in the zzso structure, was replaced with zzso zzso zzso including zzso derivatives favoring a zzso ring zzso and zzso derivatives favoring a zzso ring zzso Eight zzso cage peptides were zzso five of which included zzso that are not commercially available, without requiring any solution phase zzso Analysis of the zzso cage peptides by circular zzso and zzso indicated that the structure and stability of the zzso cage zzso was zzso based on the zzso bias of the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso zzso derivatives that favor the zzso ring zzso zzso the zzso cage, while replacement of zzso with zzso zzso derivatives that favor a zzso ring zzso resulted in increased zzso and zzso stability of the zzso zzso The most stable zzso cage derivatives contained zzso of zzso which also exhibited the most pronounced zzso effects in zzso model zzso Overall, the stability of the zzso cage was zzso by over 50 degrees C depending on the identity of the zzso side chain at zzso zzso
