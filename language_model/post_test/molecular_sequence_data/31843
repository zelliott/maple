In zzso a single zzso zzso in zzso of small zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In mice, zzso zzso is highly active in zzso but not in zzso cells, which we ascribe here to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso zzso zzso domain and has higher zzso activity than the full-length zzso in zzso cells zzso Unlike zzso zzso efficiently produces small zzso from long zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is driven by an zzso zzso zzso promoter, deletion of which causes loss of zzso and female zzso zzso from females lacking the zzso element show zzso zzso defects and increased levels of zzso small interfering zzso zzso targets, zzso the maternal zzso zzso zzso The alternative zzso zzso whose zzso origin demonstrates evolutionary plasticity of zzso zzso is the main zzso of zzso zzso activity in the mouse female zzso
