We use the zzso transform zzso zzso method to investigate the zzso properties of zzso DNA walk profiles in the human zzso This study reveals the zzso nature of these profiles, which involve two competing zzso (up to zzso distances less, or similar 40 zzso components characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The former zzso to the zzso homogeneous fluctuations previously observed in DNA walks generated with structural zzso The latter is associated with the presence of jumps in the original zzso noisy signal zzso We show that a majority of upward zzso jumps zzso with gene zzso start zzso zzso Here zzso human gene zzso start sites from the zzso database are found within 2 zzso from an upward jump of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso which suggests that about zzso of zzso human genes present significant zzso strand asymmetry and very likely high expression zzso
