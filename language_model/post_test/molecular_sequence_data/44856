The zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso and zzso to cultured zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso requires the products of the zzso genes in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso and zzso caused defective zzso In contrast, we showed that the zzso genes were sufficient for zzso if they were expressed by a zzso zzso Environmental regulation of zzso zzso by temperature and pH occurs via regulation of the major zzso protein zzso at the zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses indicate that the zzso transcript was absent in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analyses indicate that, in zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso and zzso genes is zzso zzso zzso fusion studies confirm the zzso prediction that zzso and zzso are both zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain, containing sequence similarity to zzso regulators found in zzso systems as well as to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso domain that is zzso zzso zzso is predicted to be oriented with most of the protein in the zzso the zzso zzso being either integrated in the inner membrane or zzso as a signal zzso
