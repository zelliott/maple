Current zzso chain zzso strategies for zzso prediction often fail when sporadic zzso zzso are zzso The population frequency of such zzso was not known for any gene under low selection pressure and may be best examined in blood groups systems lacking prevalent zzso zzso The frequency of the very rare Bombay blood group zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently determined in a systematic survey of more than 600,000 white zzso 

With this survey used in conjunction with additional blood samples, the population frequency of zzso zzso of the gene zzso the alpha zzso zzso or zzso was zzso 

Seven different h zzso were found in five unrelated individuals, three of whom were zzso for unique zzso There was no prevalent h zzso Five zzso and one zzso zzso were observed, that were the zzso causes of the zzso zzso the coding sequence of one h zzso was identical to the H zzso The average zzso factor alpha was zzso The frequency of zzso zzso at the H gene locus was calculated as 1 in 347 in a large white population zzso zzso zzso 

The Bombay blood group zzso in white is due to diverse, zzso zzso zzso without any prevalent zzso Assuming similar rates of zzso zzso in zzso genes like zzso current zzso strategies may fail as often as once in about 300 individuals of blood group zzso zzso neutral zzso may also pose a serious obstacle for zzso screening of many zzso zzso
