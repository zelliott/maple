The zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso contamination, bacterial community, and zzso bacteria were monitored in aged zzso soil zzso zzso zzso with a mean of zzso zzso of 16 zzso of soil dry zzso and in the same soil previously treated by zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean of 106 zzso of 16 zzso of soil dry zzso This study was conducted in zzso for 2 years using experimental plots of the two zzso zzso soil was zzso by spontaneous vegetation zzso planted with zzso zzso zzso or left as bare soil zzso and the TD soil was planted with zzso zzso zzso The bacterial community density, structure, and diversity were estimated by real-time zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene copy number, zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and band sequencing, zzso The density of the bacterial community increased the first year during stabilization of the system and stayed constant in the zzso soil, while it continued to increase in the TD soil during the second zzso The bacterial community structure zzso among all the plot types after 2 years on zzso In the zzso zzso the bacterial community was represented mainly by zzso and zzso The presence of vegetation zzso and zzso in the zzso soil favored the development of a wider range of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that, for the most part, were not closely related to known bacterial zzso Moreover, under the influence of the same plant, the bacterial community that developed in the zzso was represented by different bacterial species zzso zzso zzso and zzso than that in the zzso During the 2 years of monitoring, the zzso concentration did not evolve zzso The abundance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bacteria was estimated by real-time zzso zzso of specific functional genes zzso the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The percentage of the zzso zzso bacterial genes relative to zzso zzso gene density decreased with time in all the zzso The zzso zzso bacterial gene proportion decreased in the zzso plots but stayed constant or increased under vegetation influence zzso zzso and zzso
