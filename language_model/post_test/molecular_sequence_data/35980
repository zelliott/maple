The nearly complete zzso zzso resonance assignment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein from bovine heart zzso by zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso is zzso Regular secondary structure elements were identified from zzso zzso and the sequence locations of slowly exchanging backbone zzso zzso The molecular structure of the protein was found to consist mainly of ten zzso zzso and two short zzso The data presented here for the first time for a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein type is the basis for a complete zzso structure determination currently in zzso
