This paper describes the results of a systematic investigation designed to assess the utility of zzso zzso in the structural analysis of small peptides zzso A number of different zzso ranging in mass and zzso acid zzso are fragmented by collision with a surface in a tandem mass zzso and the zzso are compared with data obtained by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso provide ample sequence information for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of type zzso which are generally detected upon zzso zzso with gaseous targets but not upon zzso zzso with gaseous targets, are detected in the zzso collision zzso A theoretical approach based on zzso bond order calculations is suggested for the description of zzso zzso This model, supplemented by zzso zzso calculations, serves as a complement to the experimental work described in the paper and explains zzso the easy zzso of the zzso bond, zzso zzso backbone and zzso zzso and zzso the influence of zzso zzso
