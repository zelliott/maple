Here we report the finding of zzso activity in zzso zzso to remove zzso zzso from zzso To detect this activity, a synthetic duplex DNA containing an zzso zzso was used as the zzso and before the product was analyzed by zzso detection zzso zzso released by the zzso action was specifically collected from reactions using zzso columns of zzso specific zzso zzso With the application of zzso column zzso a single peak of zzso free from many interfering zzso of unknown origin was clearly demonstrated in zzso even with crude tissue extracts used as zzso zzso All the zzso of the rats examined showed the activity, suggesting its presence is zzso The present coupled technique of zzso column zzso and zzso will be very useful to many future studies of zzso zzso such as its activity zzso characterization and zzso zzso
