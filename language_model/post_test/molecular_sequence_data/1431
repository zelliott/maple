The zzso zzso zzso sequence was exploited as a tool for carrying out comparative analyses of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a set of random, short zzso zzso sequences with the corresponding sequences in zzso revealed that aligned zzso zzso sequences differ from aligned zzso or zzso sequences in respect to the degree of sequence identity and the frequency of small zzso zzso markers and expressed sequence tags derived from zzso were used for genetic mapping in a population derived from an zzso cross between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The resulting eight zzso linkage groups were compared to the sequence maps of the five zzso zzso Fourteen zzso segments spanning approximately zzso of the zzso zzso sequence maps and zzso of the zzso genetic linkage map were zzso Several zzso and zzso of zzso segments as well as large zzso account for the observed arrangement of the 14 zzso blocks in the analyzed zzso In addition, evidence for small-scale zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso is more pronounced than has been previously reported for comparisons between zzso and different zzso zzso
