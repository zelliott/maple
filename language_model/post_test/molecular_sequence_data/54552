The zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso promote viral zzso export by utilizing the cellular zzso export zzso This function is triggered by binding to proteins of the zzso zzso complex, in particular to zzso which directs viral zzso to the zzso zzso and, zzso to the nuclear pore for export to the zzso Here we have determined the structure of the zzso interaction interface at zzso and provided a detailed comparison of the binding zzso between zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso Despite the absence of any obvious sequence zzso both viral proteins bind on the same site of the folded zzso domain of zzso via short but specific recognition zzso The regions of zzso and zzso involved in binding by zzso have been mapped as zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have identified the pattern of zzso critical for zzso recognition, common to both zzso and zzso The importance of the key zzso acid zzso within these binding sites was confirmed by zzso zzso The functional significance of the zzso interaction was also zzso using an ex zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso and this revealed that zzso that reduce the zzso interaction dramatically decrease the ability of zzso to mediate the nuclear export of zzso viral zzso Together these data precisely map zzso acid zzso responsible for the direct interactions between viral zzso and cellular zzso and provide the first molecular details of how zzso viruses access the cellular zzso export zzso
