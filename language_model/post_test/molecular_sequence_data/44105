The zzso zzso zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso factor, zzso 32, has been cloned and shown to functionally complement zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the gene has been determined and the deduced zzso sequence is more than zzso zzso to the zzso coli zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso gene zzso is present on the opposite strand facing zzso The predicted secondary structure of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso is apparently different from the zzso secondary structures of the zzso zzso reported for several bacterial zzso The zzso zzso a stretch of 9 zzso zzso unique to zzso 32 factors, and the zzso zzso sequence complementary to a part of the zzso zzso have been zzso
