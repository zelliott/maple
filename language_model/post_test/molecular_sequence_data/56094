We zzso the zzso zzso probe p alpha zzso zzso aligned it to three published consensus zzso and developed a zzso site zzso zzso based upon zzso zzso having two 3' zzso with these consensus zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using zzso DNA from a zzso cell hybrid panel representing all human zzso demonstrated amplification from only those cell lines containing zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso of the amplified product demonstrated intense and specific zzso of the zzso product to zzso A human zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso library was screened using the zzso zzso zzso and five clones were zzso zzso analysis of one zzso clone zzso of DNA segments derived from zzso zzso and zzso confirmed specificity of the zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso provides a convenient zzso marker for zzso 10, which will also be useful for physical mapping of the zzso region of zzso 10, a region that harbors the zzso for three forms of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and familial zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso number for the p alpha zzso sequence is zzso
