A full-length zzso named zzso zzso from the corn stalk zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene is zzso The size of the zzso zzso was found to be approximately zzso zzso The deduced zzso comprised zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso It contained all the highly zzso zzso acid motifs that characterize the zzso members of the zzso zzso We investigated the expression of zzso gene in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso larvae and is induced zzso by zzso zzso displays a similar pattern to zzso under zzso conditions, when extra zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso gene could be involved in the zzso process that occurs between two zzso
