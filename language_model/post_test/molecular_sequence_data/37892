zzso and association studies in Caucasian patients with Type II zzso diabetes zzso suggest that one or more diabetes zzso zzso reside within human zzso zzso This region of zzso 20 contains the zzso diabetes of the young type 1 zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the possible involvement of zzso alpha in Type II zzso 

zzso analysis was done on the 12 zzso and promoter regions of the zzso alpha gene in 182 Caucasian diabetic zzso patients and 100 Caucasian control zzso The functional consequences of a novel promoter zzso were examined using a reporter system in the zzso liver cell line and zzso mobility shift zzso 

We identified two novel zzso in the zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso 8, and a 7 zzso deletion zzso 7) in the zzso promoter region resulting in deletion of a single putative zzso binding zzso Using a reporter zzso system, the delta 7 sequence was found to exhibit a zzso zzso error zzso zzso reduction in promoter activity relative to the normal zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso using specific and zzso zzso the delta 7 sequence had a zzso zzso zzso reduction in binding compared with the normal zzso The delta 7 zzso occurs in a family with multiple cases of Type II diabetes in a pattern consistent with zzso of the delta 7 zzso and zzso 

Analysis of the zzso alpha gene revealed two possible zzso in 182 diabetic patients which suggests that the zzso alpha gene does not make a large contribution to diabetes zzso in the general population of Caucasian diabetic zzso zzso zzso analysis of the delta 7 promoter deletion suggests, however, that promoter zzso in otherwise normal genes could contribute to diabetes zzso
