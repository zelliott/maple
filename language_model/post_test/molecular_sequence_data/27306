Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso target cells by binding to zzso and a zzso zzso most commonly zzso zzso is a frequent alternative zzso zzso in zzso B and D zzso infection, but the importance of many other alternative zzso remains zzso We have analyzed zzso envelope zzso proteins from 66 individuals infected with the major zzso of zzso to determine if virus entry into highly zzso zzso cell lines expressing most known alternative zzso differed by zzso zzso We also performed linear zzso analysis to determine if virus entry via the major zzso zzso correlated with use of any alternative zzso and if this correlation differed by zzso zzso zzso with zzso B zzso showed robust entry via zzso that was highly correlated with zzso entry zzso By contrast, viruses zzso with zzso A and C zzso proteins were able to use the recently described alternative zzso zzso more efficiently than zzso and use of zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso D zzso was unable to use either zzso or zzso zzso a unique pattern of alternative zzso zzso These results suggest that each zzso of circulating zzso may be subject to somewhat different selective pressures for zzso entry into target cells and suggest that zzso may be used as a surrogate zzso by zzso B while zzso may be used as a surrogate zzso by zzso A and zzso These data may provide insight into development of resistance to zzso entry zzso and alternative entry pathways for each zzso zzso
