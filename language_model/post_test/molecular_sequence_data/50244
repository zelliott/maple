The rates of the zzso reactions of zzso zzso by zzso zzso from various organisms suggest the occurrence of two types of zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso recognized by zzso or zzso coli zzso zzso which are representative members of the two types, have been zzso Like its zzso counterpart, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso as main recognition zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso species is not recognized by the bacterial zzso and both the zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso behave as poor zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso including the zzso one from zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso recognized by a zzso of a given type can be converted into a zzso of an zzso of the other type by introducing zzso zzso in the zzso loop or zzso In particular, a reduction of the size of the zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso zzso from 9 to 7 zzso through the creation of an additional zzso pair at the bottom of the zzso zzso makes it a zzso of the zzso zzso and decreases its ability to be zzso by the zzso zzso Moreover, enlarging the size of the zzso loop of zzso coli zzso from 7 to 9 zzso by zzso the base pair at the bottom of the zzso zzso renders the resulting zzso a good zzso of the zzso zzso while strongly altering its reaction with the zzso zzso Finally, zzso coli zzso can be rendered a better zzso of the zzso zzso by changing its zzso into a zzso This modification makes the sequence of the zzso loop of zzso identical to that of zzso zzso zzso
