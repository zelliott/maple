The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 carries out a set of zzso transfer reactions that result in the zzso attachment of the zzso zzso to host zzso We have analyzed the activities of a set of deletion derivatives of the zzso zzso The analysis reveals that a central domain of only 137 zzso acids is sufficient in zzso to catalyze a subset of the reactions carried out by the complete zzso This zzso contains an zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso where X and the zzso indicate the intervening zzso acids between the zzso zzso zzso that is found in the zzso of zzso and zzso and also the zzso proteins of some bacterial zzso zzso We also find that the zzso protein can bind zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of another zzso motif zzso are required for efficient zzso zzso The activities displayed by deletion zzso suggest to us possible functions for the various parts of zzso
