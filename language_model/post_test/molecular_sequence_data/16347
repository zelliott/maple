The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression of the rat zzso gene have been examined in rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso gene containing zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso DNA fused to the bacterial reporter gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso positively regulate the expression of this zzso gene in zzso cells, inducing zzso zzso activity more than zzso The DNA sequence required for this response to zzso has been localized to a 59 base pair region located between zzso and 180 base pairs zzso to the putative zzso zzso cap zzso This sequence can zzso zzso on a zzso promoter in an orientation independent fashion and has zzso to zzso regulatory regions from a number of other zzso zzso
