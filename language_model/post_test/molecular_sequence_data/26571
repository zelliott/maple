zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is referred as a promising zzso target for zzso zzso zzso represents the major class of detoxifying zzso of the tissue dwelling zzso zzso Though many zzso studies were carried out for zzso understanding its genetic distribution in zzso population is necessary to develop ideal zzso Our genetic zzso studies exposed the existence of three zzso zzso zzso in the four endemic regions of zzso Moreover, it also revealed the zzso in the distribution of zzso zzso in the studied zzso Therefore we zzso expressed and zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins to study the zzso impact on its structure and hence on its zzso Among the studied zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso domain and loop region connecting the two zzso of zzso lowered the affinity for zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Moreover, molecular modeling and zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso affected the proximity of zzso and zzso in zzso binding site resulting in weaker interaction with zzso zzso Besides, the zzso also had lower affinity zzso and higher zzso values for well-known zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso proteins showed enhanced zzso efficiency for zzso zzso products which are produced due to zzso zzso Thus, our study provides evidence for the functional impact of zzso on zzso protein and also spotlights the mechanisms of zzso survival against the host zzso stress zzso
