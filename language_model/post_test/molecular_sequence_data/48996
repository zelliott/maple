zzso with zzso outer surface protein A zzso from zzso zzso provides excellent zzso protection against challenge with the pathogen in animal models and in zzso However, the zzso zzso are ineffective in the zzso host, since zzso is expressed by zzso only in the zzso but rarely, if at all, in zzso Using an artificially generated immune serum zzso zzso with high protective potential for zzso and therapeutic treatment, we have now isolated from an expression library of zzso zzso zzso zzso three novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso All three genes are located, together with zzso on the linear zzso zzso and are expressed in zzso and in zzso At least temporarily two of them, zzso and zzso are also expressed during zzso The respective natural zzso are poorly zzso zzso normal mice but zzso zzso in zzso disease zzso We show that zzso preparations of zzso zzso and zzso induce functional zzso in rabbits capable of protecting zzso mice against subsequent experimental zzso These findings suggest that all three zzso zzso represent potential candidates for a zzso zzso vaccine to prevent and/or cure zzso zzso
