zzso DNA zzso gamma zzso zzso is active in base zzso repair of zzso zzso sites in zzso Usually zzso site repair involves zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso Previous experiments suggested that DNA pol gamma acts to catalyze the removal of a zzso zzso zzso group in addition to playing the conventional role of a DNA zzso We confirm that DNA pol gamma is an active zzso zzso and show that other members of the family A of DNA zzso including zzso coli DNA pol I also possess this zzso The zzso zzso reaction proceeds by formation of a zzso zzso intermediate that is converted to an zzso intermediate following elimination of the zzso Both zzso can be zzso with zzso For both DNA pol gamma and the zzso zzso of pol I, the zzso intermediate is extremely zzso This limits the overall zzso rate of the zzso zzso so that family A DNA zzso unlike pol zzso may only be able to act as zzso zzso in repair of zzso sites when they occur at low frequency in zzso
