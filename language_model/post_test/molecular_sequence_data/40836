The direct observation of binding and release of zzso silent metal zzso such as zzso and zzso by proteins has been challenging before the advent of native zzso zzso mass zzso This report highlights the powerful capability of zzso to provide insight into zzso zzso that is independent of any zzso zzso Using the zzso plant zzso zzso from wheat as a study case, we show that zzso is unique amongst other techniques in capturing zzso zzso that evolve during the course of metal transfer to the zzso zzso as a model reaction to mimic the biological function of the protein as a zinc zzso zzso release from the zzso protein zzso appears to be extremely rapid and zzso and zzso with loss of one zinc zzso from the fully loaded zzso species, and a transient zzso of zzso and zzso species, which further react to give species with 0-3 zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso data has provided further insights into the different zzso of the two zzso upon metal zzso
