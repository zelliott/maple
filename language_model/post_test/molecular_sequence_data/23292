zzso is a critical compound in plants and zzso zzso are unable to zzso zzso and their main source of this essential vitamin are zzso However, the zzso of synthesis in plants is yet to be established, and several unknown zzso are only zzso to zzso We describe a specific zzso zzso zzso that we partially zzso from young zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso had a native molecular mass of approximately 65 zzso was completely dependent on zzso for activity and was very specific in its ability to zzso zzso The activity had a pH optimum of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso The activity was inhibited by zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso shoots showed similar properties to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso preparation was zzso with zzso and proteins present were identified by using liquid zzso One of 24 proteins present in our preparation was an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso that matched the characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso We then expressed a zzso zzso of this gene in zzso coli and found that it showed zzso higher maximum zzso for zzso than zzso The expressed zzso showed very similar properties to the zzso zzso from zzso and zzso except that its zzso and zzso were higher in the expressed zzso The data are discussed in terms of the zzso to zzso zzso in zzso
