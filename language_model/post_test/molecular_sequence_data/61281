The double zzso DNA hybrid contains four DNA strands following zzso of two zzso protein coated complementary zzso DNA zzso with a zzso region of a zzso DNA zzso A remarkable feature of the double zzso DNA hybrids is their kinetic zzso at internal sites within linear DNA targets after removal of zzso protein from zzso We report here that zzso DNA zzso in one or both probe strands affect the kinetic stability of zzso double zzso zzso DNA zzso normally distort zzso hybrids and consequently accelerate hybrid zzso In contrast, zzso DNA zzso impede zzso of double zzso especially when the insert sequences interact with each other by DNA base zzso We propose a mechanism for this kinetic stabilization by zzso DNA zzso based on the hypothesis that the main zzso of zzso of double zzso DNA hybrids is a DNA branch migration process involving the rotation of both zzso duplexes in the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso rotation of zzso duplexes and consequently impede hybrid zzso Potential applications of the stabilized double zzso for gene targeting are zzso
