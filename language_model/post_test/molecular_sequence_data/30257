The gene zzso zzso the zzso carrier for zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso zzso was cloned on zzso zzso The zzso clones carrying the zzso gene were identified as those that restored growth at low zzso concentration and zzso zzso transport activity to zzso zzso zzso defective in the transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the DNA zzso shows that the zzso gene comprises zzso zzso and encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated Mr of zzso The zzso profile suggests that there exist in the carrier protein 12 zzso segments long enough to traverse the zzso The zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of zzso with the zzso product, a zzso zzso acid carrier of zzso zzso while no zzso in the zzso sequences is found in the zzso and zzso zzso
