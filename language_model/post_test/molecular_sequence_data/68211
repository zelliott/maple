We have used zzso labeling and X-ray zzso to zzso a single zzso acid in the integral membrane protein zzso zzso To provide a labeling site, we used the zzso zzso zzso which contains a unique zzso zzso in the short loop between zzso zzso C and zzso The zzso protein was expressed in and zzso from zzso zzso where it forms a two-dimensional zzso zzso In the lattice form, the protein reacted with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso to yield the zzso zzso zzso The functional properties of zzso and zzso including the visible zzso spectrum, zzso adaptation, zzso and zzso release zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso X-ray zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso have the same zzso protein lattice as zzso purple zzso Thus, neither the zzso substitution nor mercury labeling zzso affected zzso structure or zzso By using zzso difference methods, the zzso position of the zzso label was calculated from intensity differences in the X-ray zzso patterns of zzso and zzso This analysis revealed a zzso mercury peak located between zzso C and zzso The approach reported here offers promise for refining the zzso structural model, for monitoring zzso changes in zzso zzso and for studying the structure of other proteins in two-dimensional zzso
