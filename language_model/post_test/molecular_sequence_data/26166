We report here on the molecular characterization of heavy and light chain zzso of zzso isolated from the highly connected zzso network of the newborn zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of eight zzso confirmed their zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast to most zzso and zzso derived from adult mice, the majority of these clones were found to lack zzso zzso These data show that zzso processes amplifying zzso diversity are relatively inactive early in zzso and that zzso gene expression alone ensures zzso zzso in the developing immune zzso
