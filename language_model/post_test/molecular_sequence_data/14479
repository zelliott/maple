Two zzso A zzso zzso zzso recently collected from submerged zzso zzso leaves in Italy, were found to have a similar zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso section zzso However, marked differences emerged between these two novel zzso and zzso zzso as the former displayed different colony features and had larger zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as a distinct zzso form and zzso In order to determine the zzso status and to zzso the evolutionary relationships of these two zzso identical zzso a molecular zzso analysis was performed on all the officially recognized lineages in the section zzso The DNA sequences and the deduced zzso acid zzso from the nuclear zzso were zzso Both zzso and protein coding genes were zzso which are widely used to differentiate zzso belonging to zzso zzso at various evolutionary zzso The zzso zzso gene and internal transcribed zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a region of the zzso beta chain gene zzso and part of the zzso gene zzso were amplified by zzso and then zzso The analysis of the zzso regions and of the zzso and zzso sequence data indicated that the two zzso zzso belonged to a genetically distinct zzso species of the zzso zzso The zzso are proposed as representing a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to be very closely related to zzso zzso from which it could be distinguished by means of a zzso trait zzso
