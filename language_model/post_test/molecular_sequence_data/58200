zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso a reorganization of the zzso system in zzso infected zzso zzso At 24 h zzso the zzso network began to zzso into prominent zzso zzso By 36 h zzso host cell zzso occurred, accompanied by the formation of zzso zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso zzso detected zzso and zzso fragments of zzso 18 and reduced levels of zzso 7 at 24 and 36 h zzso zzso proteins isolated from zzso cells at 36 h zzso were deficient in filament zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and its zzso sequence was determined to be zzso These zzso zzso to zzso acids 74 through 83 of zzso 18, identifying a zzso site at the junction of the zzso head domain and the zzso rod zzso Moreover, this zzso event occurs at a consensus zzso site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso in the zzso neither induced zzso of zzso 18 nor zzso the formation of zzso zzso during zzso infection at the zzso zzso The active zzso is therefore required for zzso of zzso 18 and zzso zzso of the zzso We suggest that disruptions in the zzso system weaken the mechanical integrity of the cell, thus promoting host cell zzso and release of progeny zzso
