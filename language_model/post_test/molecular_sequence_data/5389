zzso and zzso are two zzso genes that were cloned originally from an adult goldfish retinal zzso They are members of the zzso gene family, which is characterized by the presence of a paired zzso and an additional zzso region, termed the zzso zzso To analyze the possible roles for zzso and zzso in eye development, we used in zzso zzso to examine their expression patterns in zzso and goldfish zzso zzso is initially expressed by zzso zzso cells of the zzso neural zzso then it is zzso as differentiation begins, and it is finally zzso at later stages of differentiation in a subset of cells, presumed to be bipolar cells, in the inner nuclear zzso In contrast, zzso is expressed only zzso in zzso zzso neural zzso and is then zzso selectively in zzso bipolar cells at early stages of differentiation (when zzso is turned zzso before decreasing to an intermediate level, which is maintained in the differentiated (adult) zzso The restricted expression patterns of zzso zzso to the observed zzso in mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso further supporting the notion that zzso and zzso are zzso The sequential complimentary and then corresponding expression patterns of zzso and zzso suggest that these similar zzso factors may be recruited for partially zzso but zzso functions during the development of the zzso
