We have studied the relationship between zzso class II zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso response to a highly zzso zzso Ole e I, in allergic zzso Ole e I, is the major zzso from the zzso of olive tree that grows mainly in the zzso zzso DNA typing was performed in 40 unrelated patients with seasonal allergic zzso who had specific zzso zzso against Ole e I, detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared with those of 179 healthy unrelated zzso zzso increases in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso in the control population, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso were found, indicating an association between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso response to Ole e zzso This is the first time that the zzso gene has been associated with a positive allergic zzso
