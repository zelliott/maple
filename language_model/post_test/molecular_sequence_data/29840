Plasma membrane proteins of the zzso carrier family 5 zzso are responsible for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and nutrients in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso genes are the cause of several inherited human zzso We have recently reported the cloning and transport properties of zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso relationship of zzso with other members of the zzso family and characterize its expression during zzso zzso and in organ zzso zzso comparisons and zzso analyses of all known zzso zzso sequences indicated that zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso member, which shares highest zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and spatial expression of zzso during zzso zzso was examined by whole mount in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression occurred in the late zzso zzso zzso expression was restricted to the developing zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso but completely absent from the zzso of the zzso Analysis of growth zzso animal caps indicated that expression of zzso could also be induced in organ zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that the expression of zzso zzso zzso genes in early segments of the zzso system appears to be zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we establish zzso as a novel, highly specific molecular marker for zzso zzso zzso undergoing maturation and terminal differentiation in zzso
