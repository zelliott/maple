zzso is one of the major modifications of zzso acids that significantly alters biological properties of the parent zzso These zzso forms are components of the cellular membrane and can affect zzso and pathological zzso zzso the role of zzso in physiology is of increasing relevance to cellular biologists in various disciplines who study zzso yet lack information regarding the function of the attached zzso It is well known that stress may decrease immune function in zzso however, there are only few suitable zzso available to monitor the zzso responses under the stress zzso This study is the first report on the effect of stress on the profile of zzso of zzso acids in fish zzso In order to preserve the relevant structural characteristics as much as possible, native zzso were directly analyzed using zzso We have characterized the zzso in serum of salmon zzso zzso exposed to long-term handling stress (15 s out of the water, daily for 4 zzso and compared with the results obtained from zzso of control zzso The results indicated that major zzso in salmon serum contained zzso zzso acids zzso and that the zzso pattern of zzso acids could be altered by long-term zzso
