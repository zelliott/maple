Previous studies from our laboratories demonstrated that a zzso from the zzso domain of the zzso chain of basement membrane collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and melanoma cell proliferation independently of its ability to promote cell zzso these properties require the presence of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994; zzso Han et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso More recently, we demonstrated that native zzso IV and zzso synthetic peptides (10 zzso added to culture medium inhibit the proliferation of not only melanoma cells but also breast, zzso and stomach tumor cells up to zzso and prostate tumor cells by zzso This zzso was shown to be dependent on a zzso zzso or zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Attempts to identify the putative zzso on tumor cells led to the isolation of five proteins (Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from melanoma and prostate cells by affinity zzso with the zzso zzso The Mr zzso zzso and 250,000 proteins were shown to be zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex, zzso The Mr zzso and 72,000 proteins have not yet been zzso To confirm the specificity of zzso binding to the zzso cell zzso from either melanoma or prostate tumor cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso These treatments inhibited the zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex from tumor zzso Furthermore, cells treated with zzso or the zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso from zzso cell proliferation and the subsequent rise in zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso also inhibited their zzso to the zzso zzso zzso whereas the inactive zzso zzso from the same region of the zzso chain as the zzso zzso had no zzso zzso of cells with either zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso inhibited their zzso to the zzso zzso whereas zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were without zzso These data suggest that zzso IV, through its zzso chain, zzso tumor cell proliferation using the receptors zzso and the zzso zzso
