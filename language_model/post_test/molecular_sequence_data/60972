zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is an abundant seed constituent and a potentially hazardous zzso that causes asthma in persons allergic to soybean zzso By analyzing surface extracts of soybean seeds with sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso we determined that large amounts of zzso are deposited on the seed zzso The quantity of zzso present varies among soybean zzso and is more prevalent on zzso zzso We have also isolated zzso clones zzso zzso and determined that the zzso is translated with a zzso signal sequence and a short zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that multiple copies of the zzso gene are present in the soybean zzso and that the zzso gene structure is zzso among zzso that differ in seed coat zzso The pattern of zzso gene zzso determined by in zzso zzso and zzso analysis, shows that zzso is zzso in the zzso of the inner zzso wall and is deposited on the seed surface during zzso This study demonstrates that a seed dust zzso is associated with the seed luster zzso in soybean and that compositional properties of the seed surface may be altered by manipulating gene expression in the zzso zzso
