Pig kidney zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso with complete loss of its zzso zzso The original zzso of zzso molecular weight of about 52,000 yields fragments of Mr 38,000 and zzso as seen on sodium zzso zzso zzso Though zzso the zzso protein retains its native molecular weight and its capacity to bind zzso zzso is recognized by an zzso raised against the native zzso and forms zzso base zzso with aromatic zzso acids in L and D zzso Thus, the zzso protein appears to be in a zzso resembling that of the original zzso consists of a tight association of the two zzso zzso zzso and separation of the two fragments can be achieved under zzso conditions on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding site is located on the larger zzso No zzso zzso is detected in either the intact zzso or the larger fragment, whereas analysis of the smaller zzso yields a sequence of the first 50 zzso acid zzso These data indicate that the smaller zzso is located at about one-third from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso while the larger zzso constitutes the zzso portion of the zzso The site of zzso zzso seems to be in a region of the zzso particularly susceptible to zzso The results of these studies contribute to a better understanding of the structural properties of pig kidney zzso zzso and may constitute an important step toward the zzso of the zzso primary zzso
