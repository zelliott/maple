zzso is a zzso membrane zzso zzso by the insulin zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of zzso in insulin zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso of zzso expression and was associated with a zzso decrease in the rate of insulin zzso Furthermore, insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with insulin receptors and zzso was increased zzso compared with cells expressing insulin receptors zzso In contrast, no effect on zzso was observed in cells zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso of zzso that lacks the zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also unaffected in cells expressing three zzso zzso of zzso in which the sites of zzso by the insulin zzso zzso had been removed zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest that zzso is part of a complex of proteins required for zzso zzso of zzso It is possible that this function is regulated by zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso
