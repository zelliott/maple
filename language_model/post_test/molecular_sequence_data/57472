zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene recently identified on zzso band zzso Loss of one zzso zzso or decreased zzso expression occurs in more than zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso constitutes a critical event in the development of these zzso Using zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso we have studied zzso expression in bone zzso from 4 patients with leukemia (1 chronic zzso zzso crisis, case 1; 1 acute zzso zzso case 2; 1 zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso case 3; 1 zzso zzso case 4) showing loss of one zzso zzso due to zzso zzso We also studied zzso expression in multiple control samples, including normal zzso normal zzso zzso and zzso without zzso zzso Four primer pairs consistently amplified the predicted zzso sequences from zzso prepared from all control zzso However, in samples with zzso 18, zzso transcripts were either not detected zzso 1) or detected at a very low level zzso 2, 3, and zzso Southern analysis showed no structural zzso of the remaining zzso locus in all leukemia zzso Thus, loss of zzso expression was demonstrated in association with loss of one zzso zzso in all cases zzso These results suggest that, as for zzso tumors, the zzso of zzso can have a role in the development of zzso zzso
