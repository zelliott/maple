We report the cloning and initial characterization of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso a novel zzso gene that encodes a protein related to the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is located approximately 5 zzso upstream of zzso on mouse zzso 19 and consists of six zzso spanning 2 zzso The first five zzso code for an zzso protein of zzso zzso that contains a potential nuclear zzso signal and potential zzso sites for several zzso zzso was expressed in all mouse zzso zzso On the basis of the similarity of zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso acid zzso protein features, and zzso structure, we propose that zzso is a new member of, and may share basic functions with, the zzso zzso family of molecular zzso zzso
