The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in human zzso To do this, differential gene expression was assessed in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso technique of zzso difference zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was isolated by virtue of its zzso in the zzso zzso sample zzso It was designated zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso primer sequences a second zzso zzso was subsequently isolated from zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso and found to be identical to zzso apart from 80 additional and consecutive base pairs in the zzso coding zzso In zzso a stop zzso within the unique 80 zzso sequence was predicted to terminate translation immediately before the consensus active site zzso While Southern zzso was used to show that there are two zzso with zzso to zzso in the human zzso it is zzso that alternative zzso zzso of the 80 zzso zzso is involved in the regulated expression of active zzso and inactive zzso forms of this novel zzso a mechanism similar to that involved in the regulated expression of zzso a zzso involved in zzso In other systems the regulation of alternative zzso is indicated by tissue specificity and zzso stage specificity of the various spliced zzso In this context it was demonstrated that whereas zzso was the major transcript expressed in zzso the pattern was reversed in the adjacent zzso zzso It is proposed that tissue and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso are important for the normal development and function of the zzso zzso and that zzso of the control of zzso gene zzso may play a role in abnormal zzso like that seen in zzso
