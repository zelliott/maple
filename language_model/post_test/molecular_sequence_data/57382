Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso in rat liver was zzso but zzso zzso was inhibited and zzso by zzso zzso zzso a compound derived from zzso Such a selective effect on zzso zzso is of considerable interest toward the understanding of dietary effects on zzso zzso In the present study, the mechanism of zzso zzso induction by zzso was zzso Following a single dose of zzso zzso zzso body weight, zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, a representative activity of zzso zzso was induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after the treatment, zzso A corresponding increase in the level of zzso zzso protein was observed by zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso in rat liver also increased zzso reaching a maximum at 12 h after the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso levels of both zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In contrast, the level of zzso zzso zzso in the liver of zzso rats was not zzso The results of nuclear zzso zzso revealed that the zzso rate of zzso zzso genes in the rat liver increased zzso at 6 h after zzso administration and returned to the control value at 24 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso genes was blocked completely by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the induction of zzso zzso in rat liver by zzso is mainly due to zzso zzso In the zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso was also markedly induced in the stomach and zzso The zzso induction was found at 12 h after the treatment while the levels of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso treatment, however, did not change the levels of zzso zzso zzso in the lung and zzso zzso
