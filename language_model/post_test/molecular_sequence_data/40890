In rice, the class I small heat shock protein zzso genes were found to be selectively induced by zzso acid zzso on zzso 3 but not zzso zzso Here it is shown that a novel zzso element contributed to the differential zzso By serial deletion and zzso analysis, a 9 zzso putative zzso element zzso zzso located between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso initiation site of zzso was zzso zzso of this putative zzso from the promoter abolished its ability to be induced by zzso Moreover, zzso mobility shift zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso specifically with nuclear proteins from zzso rice zzso Two zzso complexes were detected by zzso one of which could be zzso out by a zzso heat shock element zzso zzso of the zzso also affected the HS zzso Furthermore, transient zzso of the heat shock factor zzso with the zzso in the promoter of zzso was zzso The requirement for the putative zzso for zzso and HS responses in transgenic zzso was also zzso Thus, zzso represents an alternative form of heat zzso and its interaction with zzso zzso through heat shock factors may be required to respond to HS and zzso
