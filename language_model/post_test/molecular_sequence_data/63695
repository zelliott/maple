The primary method for determining the function of a gene in zzso has been to make a knockout mouse through zzso zzso in embryonic stem zzso However, with the advent of zzso interference zzso technology, new methods for studying gene function are now possible in a wide array of zzso We describe a protocol for knocking down a gene of interest in zzso in rats by zzso expressing a short hairpin zzso zzso zzso rats are produced using a simple and efficient procedure for zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso described is designed to result in ubiquitous expression of zzso Thus, it is well suited to study genes expressed specifically in male germ cells in which the predicted zzso would be male zzso This system has been used to generate a transgenic line with stable and zzso zzso of the gene zzso in zzso zzso resulting in male zzso and zzso transmission of the zzso through zzso
