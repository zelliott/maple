zzso sequencing technologies provide unprecedented power to explore the repertoire of genes and their alternative zzso zzso collectively defining the zzso of a species in great zzso However, assembling the short reads into full-length gene and transcript models presents significant zzso zzso We review current zzso for assembling transcripts and genes from next-generation sequencing reads aligned to a reference zzso and lay out areas for future zzso
