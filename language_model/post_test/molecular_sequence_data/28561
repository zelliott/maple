zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso in a zzso or cell zzso zzso zzso 9 of zzso zzso is specifically excluded in heart and skeletal muscle zzso and in zzso human zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, and mouse zzso zzso zzso Recently, we found a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso element on zzso 9 via transgenic mice bearing zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated that this zzso functions zzso with exception of muscle tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified an zzso negative regulatory element responsible for zzso exclusion of zzso 9 using both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso A supplementation zzso with nuclear extracts from zzso cells and zzso zzso cells was performed for an in zzso reaction of zzso alternative zzso of zzso zzso and revealed that the zzso reaction between zzso 8 and 9 was the key step for regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso tract in zzso 8 requires zzso on zzso 9 for zzso zzso site zzso zzso analyses on the zzso zzso using a supplementation zzso demonstrated that the zzso negative regulatory element is positioned in the middle region of zzso 9, immediately downstream from zzso zzso zzso analyses identified seven zzso zzso as a negative regulatory element responsible for zzso zzso zzso This element was shown to cause zzso skipping in in zzso zzso systems using zzso zzso cells after transient zzso of several zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso immediately downstream from zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for exclusion of zzso 9 in zzso and in zzso
