zzso can have zzso effects by targeting multiple genes belonging to diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso can enhance the potency of their cellular effects by targeting multiple genes within the same genetic zzso Previously, we and others have demonstrated that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso cell migration, invasion and zzso in part by targeting several genes involved in these cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that direct targeting of multiple members of the zzso family of zzso zzso contributes to the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso regulates the expression of at least five zzso family members and validate three family members, zzso zzso and zzso as direct targets of zzso The contribution of the zzso family genes to cancer progression and zzso has recently begun to emerge and here we demonstrate for the first time the ability of zzso and zzso to regulate zzso cell migration and invasion, using zzso zzso of each of these zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso in particular zzso are responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso structures that contribute to the enhanced migratory and invasive potential associated with reduced expression of zzso Thus, direct targeting of the zzso family contributes to the zzso suppressing abilities of zzso by providing a direct regulatory link to the zzso assembly machinery of the zzso We conclude that zzso is a master regulator of zzso cell migration and invasion by directly targeting a plethora of genes that effectively control cell migratory zzso
