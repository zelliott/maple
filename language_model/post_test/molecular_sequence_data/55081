zzso pneumonia remains an important complication of immune zzso The cell wall of zzso has been demonstrated to zzso stimulate host inflammatory responses, with most studies focusing on zzso components of the zzso cell zzso In the current study, we have elaborated the potential role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrated differential host zzso zzso expression during zzso zzso We further characterized a zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso termed zzso a gene with considerable zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We also observed the impact of zzso zzso on zzso host inflammatory responses by measuring zzso release and zzso zzso expression by cultured lung zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso cell wall zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso zzso These findings provide evidence supporting a zzso zzso zzso in zzso organisms and that zzso zzso inflammatory responses in lung zzso We further demonstrate lung expression of zzso molecules during zzso zzso
