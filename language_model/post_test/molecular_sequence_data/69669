zzso diabetes zzso zzso is a rare zzso disorder exhibiting zzso resistance to the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso Recent zzso of the zzso V2 zzso zzso zzso gene structure has enabled us to test the hypothesis that the genetic zzso in the V2 zzso is the likely molecular basis of zzso By using the zzso chain reaction zzso sequencing, we identified novel V2 zzso gene zzso in two unrelated Japanese zzso with zzso In the male patients of zzso A, a single zzso deletion in one of two consecutive zzso triplets zzso 832 to zzso was zzso This base change resulted in the loss of a zzso zzso in the 6th zzso zzso In the affected males of zzso B, a G to C substitution was found at zzso zzso altering zzso 143 from zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso zzso strand zzso zzso zzso analysis of family members demonstrated that the zzso zzso with clinically affected individuals and were absent in normal zzso Our results suggest that different V2 zzso defects could be responsible for zzso resistance in individual zzso zzso
