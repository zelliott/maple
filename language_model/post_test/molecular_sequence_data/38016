To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat zzso derived from six zzso individuals enrolled in the Mexico City zzso we cloned and zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from their peripheral blood zzso cells zzso All patients zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the B zzso Three patients with high zzso T cell counts zzso presented zzso sequences with point zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence from a patient classified as a long-term zzso zzso presented the most frequent naturally occurring length zzso zzso and two zzso in the zzso region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso was identified in the overlapping zzso sequence derived from a patient progressing to zzso This deletion zzso with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in zzso zzso load zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso virus zzso On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the zzso deletion was no longer evident and zzso sequences with intact zzso sites were zzso zzso of zzso mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential zzso T cell depletion patterns 15 days zzso which agree with the in zzso zzso T cell count data from each zzso
