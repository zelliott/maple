We describe 12 new zzso zzso reactions which are zzso zzso of the well-known zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso derived from the native zzso zzso which possess the T zzso can function as zzso for the zzso zzso at zzso of D zzso zzso An initial report described the zzso zzso of an unmodified zzso transcript corresponding to the zzso half of zzso by a 3' zzso derived from the native zzso zzso zzso zzso Sullivan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Cold Spring Harbor zzso zzso zzso 52, zzso We have investigated the trans reaction further by creating a family of zzso and catalyst zzso molecules by dissection of the native zzso using a combination of chemical and zzso zzso A search for zzso activity in trans was conducted using a zzso approach with the available T and D zzso zzso Twelve combinations were found to be zzso and initial rates, zzso and zzso are reported for zzso The zzso for the reactions differ by approximately zzso whereas zzso vary by only approximately zzso zzso in some of the zzso rates argue that zzso interactions present in the intact zzso can be zzso in the zzso zzso Secondary structural features remote from the zzso site can also affect the apparent zzso zzso A minimum zzso complex consisting of a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the native zzso and a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso is zzso This complex is of interest since the transition state for zzso involves only three zzso with no elements of the zzso required for zzso This is reminiscent of the proposed secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
