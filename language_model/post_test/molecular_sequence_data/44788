Association of zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors with a set of molecular zzso including the zzso heat shock protein zzso is a dynamic process required for proper folding and maintaining these nuclear receptors under a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the chicken zzso complementary DNA suggested that three regions of this protein zzso B, and zzso interact with the zzso domain of zzso whereas region A is zzso for zzso binding to zzso We found that this zzso acid region can be narrowed down to a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is by itself able to inhibit zzso association to zzso translated in zzso The zzso zzso did not bind zzso but was devoid of any specific zzso activity, and higher zzso zzso specifically inhibited the binding of activated zzso to zzso When zzso in cultured cells, this zzso acted as an zzso and inhibited the zzso zzso activity and the zzso nuclear transfer of zzso None of these effects, either in zzso and in zzso was observed for zzso The region from zzso 232 to zzso 265 of zzso is, therefore, a domain critical for its association to zzso an association that is a prerequisite for zzso zzso zzso More importantly, these results demonstrate that targeting specific zzso interaction zzso is a powerful means to specifically zzso nuclear zzso signaling pathways in a zzso zzso
