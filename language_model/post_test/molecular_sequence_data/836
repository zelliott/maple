The zzso C1 Like 1 zzso is a predicted zzso membrane protein that is critical for cholesterol zzso zzso takes up free cholesterol into cells through zzso zzso zzso a clinically used cholesterol zzso zzso blocks the zzso of zzso thereby zzso cholesterol zzso Human zzso is a zzso acid protein with a putative zzso domain zzso that shows sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso C1 zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we use zzso protection and zzso in selectively zzso cells to study the zzso of human zzso Our data indicate that zzso contains 13 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is in the zzso while the zzso projects to the zzso human zzso contains seven small zzso zzso small and three large zzso zzso of which has been reported to bind zzso zzso the major zzso of zzso in zzso can block the zzso of zzso and zzso The membrane zzso of zzso is similar to that of zzso and the putative zzso of zzso is oriented in the same manner as those of zzso zzso and zzso The defined zzso of zzso provides necessary information for further zzso the functions of the different zzso of zzso
