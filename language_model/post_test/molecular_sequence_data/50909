The transition from egg laying to incubation activity in birds is associated with a dramatic rise in serum zzso zzso To further our understanding of the regulation of zzso gene expression in birds, a zzso clone zzso turkey zzso was zzso The turkey zzso designated zzso was zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso showed zzso zzso acid identity with the corresponding rat zzso zzso At its zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso comparable to that found in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso Two other insertions of 38 and 7 zzso acids were present and were not found in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso tissue were examined at different zzso of the turkey zzso cycle by Northern zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso transcript, whose abundance remained relatively constant throughout the zzso zzso Thus, the dramatic rise in zzso zzso observed during hyperprolactinemia in zzso turkey zzso was not associated with a zzso increase in zzso gene zzso
