A zzso library was generated from zzso zzso of zzso leaf zzso virus zzso zzso zzso Two overlapping clones totaling zzso zzso at the 3' zzso of the virus were identified by zzso with coat protein zzso The sequence analyses of the clones indicated an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which zzso part of the zzso and the coat zzso a zzso zzso region zzso and 23 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso status of zzso was determined by comparisons of the sequence of the cloned coat protein gene and zzso with zzso sequences obtained from zzso The zzso sequence identities of zzso compared with 17 other zzso ranged from zzso to zzso for the coat zzso and from zzso to zzso for the zzso zzso analyses of the coat protein region and the zzso indicated that zzso did not cluster with other zzso in a zzso with high zzso zzso The coat protein gene was expressed in zzso coli and a zzso zzso was prepared to the expressed coat zzso In zzso tests, zzso was found to be zzso distinct from zzso zzso virus type W, zzso mosaic virus 2, zzso yellow mosaic virus, and Moroccan zzso mosaic zzso In Western blots and zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso was zzso zzso and sequence comparisons indicated that zzso leaf zzso virus is a distinct member of the zzso zzso
