The single zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso and wild zzso zzso silk zzso has a length of approximately 1000 zzso It is located only 57 zzso from the zzso core promoter and harbors multiple zzso regulatory elements that have been found to enhance the zzso level of zzso in zzso In this work, the zzso zzso zzso among members of both zzso species is zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso specimens from Japan and Korea, were zzso This information was compared with the previously reported sequences of zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso as well as an additional zzso zzso zzso collected in zzso We found a total of 26 zzso positions, including zzso shared by members of both species and zzso zzso The potential functional role of these zzso was investigated by using the program zzso to search for putative binding sites of zzso factors within the zzso We detected a multitude of putative binding elements distributed along the entire zzso zzso Among them, 22 zzso to protein binding zzso that are known to regulate zzso zzso The mapping of multiple zzso positions within these putative binding sequences as well as in known regulatory elements of the zzso argue for functional significance on the regulation of zzso
