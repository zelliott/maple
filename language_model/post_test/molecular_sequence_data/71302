Using sensitive methods of sequence analysis including zzso cluster analysis, we report here a zzso zzso family of zzso the zzso zzso zzso family, which includes proteins such as zzso DNA zzso zzso the origin recognition complex 1 zzso zzso as well as several proteins involved in zzso zzso The zzso domain appears to act as a zzso interaction module specialized in gene zzso as suggested for example by its interaction within zzso zzso with the silent information regulator zzso The zzso module might therefore play an important role by linking DNA zzso replication and zzso zzso
