zzso zzso are about 75 zzso acids long and probably bind zzso zzso during cell zzso We zzso 33 zzso acids with zzso side chains in the zzso domain from an zzso coli cell division protein named zzso The zzso zzso zzso were fused to zzso green fluorescent protein zzso and tested for zzso zzso in live zzso coli zzso zzso at the following 5 zzso reduced zzso zzso by a factor of 3 or more: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All of these zzso map to a zzso in the published solution structure of zzso Three of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and found to be defective in binding to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These results match closely with results from a previous study of the zzso domain from zzso even though these two zzso zzso share zzso zzso acid zzso Taken together, these findings support the proposal that zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso zzso and imply that the binding site is associated with the zzso We also show that zzso contains a zzso bond between zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso bond contributes to protein stability, cell division, and zzso zzso
