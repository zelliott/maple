zzso II is the principal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Its effects are zzso by cell surface proteins termed AT zzso On the basis of zzso binding studies, these have been zzso subdivided into two classes, termed zzso receptors and zzso binding sites zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso zzso zzso receptors appear to mediate the major cardiovascular effects of zzso II, whereas no known zzso properties appear to be coupled to zzso binding sites zzso PC, et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain further insight into the function of zzso receptors we have isolated rat zzso and genes zzso two distinct but highly similar zzso of zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso the vascular zzso zzso were isolated by an expression cloning strategy from a zzso library prepared from vascular smooth muscle zzso The properties of the clones isolated by this approach are consistent with known zzso zzso zzso and tissue distribution properties of zzso zzso Using this zzso as a probe, a second zzso of rat zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso This zzso termed the zzso zzso is zzso identical in zzso acid sequence and is zzso indistinguishable from the zzso zzso However, the zzso expression pattern of the zzso gene differs significantly from that for the zzso zzso
