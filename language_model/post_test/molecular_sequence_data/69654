A putative zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of African zzso fever virus was identified by using a zzso zzso probe derived from the zzso zzso binding zzso which is highly zzso among viral and cellular zzso The probe zzso with fragments zzso E and zzso zzso which is entirely contained in the former zzso zzso of this region revealed an open reading frame, designated zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this open reading frame has significant similarity with the putative zzso zzso by the killer zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as with the zzso I of zzso virus and zzso and a zzso of the early zzso factor of zzso and zzso zzso The protein zzso by this open reading frame contains the sequence features characteristic of zzso of the zzso zzso According to this, we propose the inclusion of the product of this zzso virus gene in this zzso
