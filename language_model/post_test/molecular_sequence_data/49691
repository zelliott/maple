The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a unique zzso expression pattern in zzso zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is confined to the zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly on the zzso membrane but with significant expression on the zzso membrane as zzso zzso surface expression indicates that zzso likely has different sorting and trafficking mechanisms from zzso Because zzso has been reported to be essential for zzso targeting of other zzso and zzso contains three unique zzso sites, we examined the importance of zzso in sorting of zzso zzso studies suggested that zzso affects surface expression of zzso but not zzso 

All three unique zzso sites were zzso alone and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with green zzso zzso were zzso zzso into zzso Positive clones were zzso for polarized surface expression by zzso and functional zzso 

zzso at all three sites alone or in tandem resulted in functional zzso zzso of sites zzso and zzso resulted in proteins of reduced molecular zzso None of the zzso zzso localized differently than zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is not essential for polarized zzso
