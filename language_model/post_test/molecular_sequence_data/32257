zzso L zzso is one of the critical proteins involved in transmission of zzso We applied the methodology of protein structure prediction to shed a light on the so far unknown molecular mechanism of its zzso Here we show that zzso forms a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso functional zzso zzso create a novel zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso adopt a regular zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may interact with specific cellular zzso receptors during the invasion of zzso The proposed mechanism has a potential impact on future development of novel therapeutic and zzso zzso
