We previously demonstrated that zzso alone or in combination with zzso activated the zzso zzso acute regulatory protein gene promoter in a concerted manner in primary cultures of zzso zzso Studies were undertaken to further delineate zzso and zzso elements of the zzso promoter and mechanisms zzso zzso stimulation and its zzso by zzso zzso of several putative regulatory elements localized zzso activity to the highly zzso zzso site and identified novel zzso downstream as a functional zzso binding protein zzso zzso In zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso formed a zzso complex with an zzso spanning zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The intensity of this zzso complex was increased in zzso cell nuclear extracts by treatment with zzso alone and was enhanced with the combination of zzso and zzso at 2-3 h of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso expressed with all treatments at time points associated with increased DNA zzso Treatment (2 zzso with zzso alone or zzso + zzso increased zzso of zzso on a protein zzso A consensus zzso The zzso zzso of zzso exhibited greater zzso with zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear extracts also demonstrated zzso and zzso binding to the zzso to zzso zzso region of the promoter providing evidence for their cooperation in zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso are both required for zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso acute regulatory protein gene promoter in zzso zzso cell zzso
