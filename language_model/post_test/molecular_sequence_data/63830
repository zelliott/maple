Human zzso virus types 1 and 3 zzso and zzso respectively), members of the virus family zzso are common causes of lower respiratory tract infections in zzso young children, the zzso the chronically ill, and the zzso In order to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the coding sequences were cloned into the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso under control of zzso zzso A high level of zzso virus zzso proteins expression zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the assembly of typical zzso structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristic for other zzso These structures contained host zzso which was resistant to zzso zzso The zzso proteins were stable in zzso and were easily zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this system proved to be simple, efficient and zzso suitable for high-level production of zzso virus zzso as zzso zzso When used as coating zzso in an indirect zzso the zzso N proteins reacted with zzso of patients infected with zzso or zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso could be designed on this zzso
