The zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso II complex from human liver were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso full-length zzso for the zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso a 107 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for the zzso encodes a approximately 60 zzso protein in a continuous zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso each contain two potential zzso zzso sites, with only one site in the zzso zzso being zzso Additional zzso were isolated for each zzso containing zzso zzso within the coding region, indicating alternative zzso Analysis of different human zzso revealed approximately zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso transcripts for zzso and zzso respectively, consistent with their full-length zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso increase of zzso II zzso An inactive protein was zzso however, after zzso with the zzso alone, showing that both zzso are essential for expression of active zzso zzso The observation that the zzso previously zzso from pig liver and lacking the zzso was zzso active indicates that the zzso is involved in zzso maturation rather than being required for zzso activity once the zzso has acquired its mature zzso The zzso is expressed in zzso cells as an zzso zzso whether inactive or part of a zzso active zzso This suggests that zzso of the zzso when associated with the zzso zzso complex, is zzso by the zzso zzso in the zzso whereas the apparently incompletely folded form of the inactive zzso could be retained in the zzso by the putative zzso quality control zzso zzso
