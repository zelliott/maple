G zzso inwardly zzso zzso channels zzso zzso provide an important mechanism for neurotransmitter regulation of membrane zzso zzso channels are zzso containing various combinations of zzso zzso zzso We find that different combinations of zzso zzso exhibit a surprisingly complex spectrum of trafficking zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso contain zzso export signals that are important for plasma membrane expression of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso channels found in the brain and the heart, zzso Additional motifs in zzso and zzso control the trafficking between zzso and plasma zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma membrane expression by diverting the zzso channels to zzso Such rich trafficking behaviors provide a mechanism for dynamic regulation of zzso channel density in the plasma zzso
