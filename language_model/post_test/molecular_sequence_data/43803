The coordinate expression from induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso immunity transcription, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has remained zzso The initial assigned sequence for zzso bore no relationship to zzso We have identified two promoter sites for independent zzso transcription, zzso here zzso and zzso which are separated by about 330 zzso The upstream zzso site shares with zzso a common 9 zzso sequence between the zzso and zzso regions, with strong zzso to aspects of the zzso box or zzso operator zzso This sequence is also found within zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso or another regulatory factor recognizing the common zzso was involved in the regulation of zzso expression and hence Rex zzso We measured the influence of zzso synthesis from plasmids on the Rex zzso finding that plasmids producing zzso can suppress Rex exclusion by a zzso zzso The possibility was suggested that low level zzso zzso zzso occurs from zzso Potential binding sites were identified for zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for zzso O protein in the 80 zzso DNA zzso upstream from and including zzso suggesting a complex regulatory pattern for zzso expression from this zzso
