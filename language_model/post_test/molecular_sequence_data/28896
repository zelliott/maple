We report in this study the use of zzso chain reaction zzso for the amplification of the zzso DNA, isolated from zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and the sequence method to analyze the zzso pol sequence of 27 Italian patients with zzso zzso These molecular methods showed that zzso of patients tested positive for tax gene and zzso for pol zzso zzso samples were positive for both the tax gene of zzso and the pol gene of zzso zzso investigation of the zzso showed that 15 samples had zzso zzso zzso tested positive for the tax zzso and zzso tested positive for both the tax and pol genes of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso samples were positive for tax gene zzso and zzso positive for both zzso tax and pol type zzso The sequence analysis of zzso product for tax and pol genes confirmed that these amplified products were zzso with minimal zzso Our date suggested that either zzso or part of the virus zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
