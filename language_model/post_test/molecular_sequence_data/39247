The zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on mouse zzso 16 has been reported as a zzso region undergoing zzso DNA zzso producing circular DNA and zzso deletion in brain during late zzso The present study shows that the zzso circular DNA production had already started on the 13th day of embryonic age, earlier than the previous observation that the circular DNA production started on the 15th through 17th embryonic zzso The zzso deletion was also observed in the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis indicated that a zzso region in the zzso sequence was expressed in the lens at a zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso DNA zzso in the zzso region is not restricted to brain zzso and that the zzso DNA zzso relates to lens zzso
