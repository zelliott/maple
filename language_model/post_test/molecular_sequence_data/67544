zzso zzso and their regulatory functions have been extensively characterized in model species but whether apple has evolved similar or unique regulatory features remains zzso 

We performed deep small zzso and identified 23 zzso 10 zzso and 42 zzso zzso or families with distinct expression zzso The identified zzso target 118 genes representing a wide range of zzso and regulatory zzso Apple also zzso two zzso gene families with similar but unique zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso profiles and target zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso and zzso can collectively target up to 81 zzso genes potentially involved in diverse aspects of plant growth and zzso These zzso target sites are zzso zzso among zzso which is largely influenced by the location and conservation of the zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we found that 10 of the 19 zzso zzso undergo small interfering zzso zzso zzso at the 3' zzso highly divergent transcript regions, generating over 100 zzso zzso that potentially target over 70 diverse genes as confirmed by zzso zzso 

Our work identified and characterized apple zzso their expression patterns, targets and regulatory zzso We also discovered that three zzso and the ensuing zzso exploit both zzso and divergent sequence features of zzso genes to initiate distinct regulatory networks targeting a multitude of genes inside and outside the zzso zzso
