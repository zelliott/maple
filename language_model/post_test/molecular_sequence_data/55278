For the development of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapeutic protein candidates, which can be either zzso zzso zzso or zzso active zzso fused to the zzso region of human zzso G zzso reliable zzso of these proteins in animal zzso study plasma samples is zzso zzso has emerged as a promising zzso platform for this zzso zzso zzso used for zzso of human zzso zzso zzso therapeutic protein candidates frequently rely upon zzso of a zzso surrogate zzso whose sequence is unique to the protein zzso of zzso One drawback of the signature zzso approach is that a new zzso zzso must be developed for each new human zzso zzso therapeutic zzso To address this issue, we propose an alternative zzso surrogate zzso approach for the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso therapeutic protein candidates in plasma samples from all nonclinical zzso A single surrogate zzso zzso was identified in the zzso region of most human zzso zzso therapeutic protein zzso An zzso method based upon this zzso was shown to be capable of supporting zzso of a diversity of human zzso zzso therapeutic protein candidates in plasma samples of all commonly used animal zzso
