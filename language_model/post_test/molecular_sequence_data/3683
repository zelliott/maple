The protein zzso is a key regulator in a cell signaling zzso zzso by protein zzso To identify the cellular targets of this protein zzso we have employed a zzso approach: protein components pulled down from zzso cells zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by means of zzso and mass zzso This procedure allowed us to identify more than 30 proteins that include various known and unknown targets of the zzso zzso Among them are several proteins in the membrane traffic pathway, such as the heavy and light chains zzso and zzso of conventional zzso a zzso zzso motor involved in the zzso movement of zzso and zzso along zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso directly binds to zzso zzso through interaction with zzso and that this interaction is dependent on the zzso of zzso Studies on the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso expressed in cultured cells coupled with mass zzso analysis proved that zzso is the site of zzso in zzso that is responsible for the in zzso interaction with the zzso zzso These data add zzso to the growing list of zzso targets, and suggest a role of zzso in the zzso cellular transport of zzso and zzso
