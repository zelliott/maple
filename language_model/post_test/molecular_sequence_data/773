zzso of zzso zzso are currently under intense investigation in order to identify novel zzso factors, drug targets, and vaccine candidates, except in zzso zzso zzso in zzso such as zzso and zzso have been identified to be involved in free zzso acid zzso We report here the molecular and zzso zzso as well as the zzso of a zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, from zzso zzso zzso A functional zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli efficiently zzso synthetic zzso for zzso a zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso was found to be optimum at pH zzso and at 37 degrees zzso The zzso profile was slightly different from its zzso in zzso zzso The activity was also strongly dependent on metal zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso which is a specific inhibitor for zzso These results indicated that zzso played an important role in free zzso acid zzso
