zzso genes zzso zzso factors involved in the signal zzso of members of the zzso zzso We report here the zzso characterization and zzso mapping of zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso has been shown to interfere with zzso and zzso cell fate zzso However, full-length zzso zzso although functionally active in zzso zzso has no effect when zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso zzso zzso active version of zzso protein causes severe zzso or partial secondary axis formation, pointing to a role of zzso during zzso and axis zzso The zzso and spatial expression patterns of zzso zzso 3 and 4 were investigated by zzso zzso and whole mount zzso zzso All three genes show strong and ubiquitous maternal zzso zzso expression is weak and ubiquitous in the case of zzso and strong and zzso in the case of zzso while zzso shows a zzso restricted zzso expression zzso It is expressed in zzso neural crest cells of the trunk and a subset of cells in the zzso in close proximity to the expression domain of the zzso protein zzso a potential signal upstream of zzso required for zzso separation and floor plate zzso zzso of truncated zzso in zzso zzso zzso leads to a rescue of the eye and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso acts as a zzso of zzso signals during zzso zzso zzso while zzso might be involved in later steps of eye field zzso
