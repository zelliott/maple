This report describes the organization of the mouse zzso protein zzso gene zzso which is highly analogous to that of the corresponding human zzso zzso comprises three zzso the first of which consists entirely of zzso zzso zzso separated by an zzso of zzso zzso from the two zzso zzso The promoter region of the gene shows strong similarity to that in humans, with six stretches of high zzso noted within zzso zzso of the zzso cap zzso However, many of the sequences of the human gene with similarity to previously described zzso elements are poorly zzso in the zzso suggesting that these motifs may be of no functional significance, and that control mechanisms for expression of zzso may be highly specific to killer zzso
