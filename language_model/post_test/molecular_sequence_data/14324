zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are ubiquitous organisms that benefit zzso through the establishment of an association with the roots of most zzso the zzso zzso Despite their ecological importance, however, these zzso have been poorly studied at the zzso zzso zzso In this study, total DNA from the zzso zzso margarita was subjected to a combination of zzso and zzso sequencing, and the resulting reads were used to assemble its zzso zzso de zzso This zzso was zzso and compared with those of other relatives to better comprehend the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso margarita is unique in many ways, exhibiting a large size zzso zzso and elevated zzso content zzso This zzso also harbors molecular events that were previously unknown to occur in zzso zzso zzso including zzso of group I zzso from two different genes coding for the first zzso of the zzso zzso and for the small zzso of the zzso zzso This study reports the second published zzso from an zzso zzso resulting in relevant DNA sequence information from this poorly studied zzso group, and providing new insights into the frequency, origin and evolution of zzso group I zzso found across the zzso zzso of zzso related zzso
