zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso Variations of the zzso gene are implicated in the zzso of diabetic zzso Previous studies have shown that Brown Norway zzso rats have higher retinal zzso levels and more severe retinal vascular leakage than zzso zzso rats in response to zzso and zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism of vascular leakage in this animal model, zzso progeny were generated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Neonatal rats were exposed to zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rats in response to zzso have shown a linear distribution of retinal zzso levels, which is significantly and positively correlated to retinal vascular zzso We identified a single zzso zzso zzso at upstream stimulating zzso site in the zzso promoter region between zzso and zzso zzso No differences were found in retinal vascular zzso or zzso levels between zzso rats with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The increased retinal zzso levels are correlated to zzso retinal vascular leakage in the zzso rat zzso The zzso zzso and promoter are not responsible for increased retinal zzso level and vascular zzso The zzso of zzso expression activated by a yet to be identified upstream factor or zzso affecting zzso stability may be associated with a high zzso to retinal vascular leakage in zzso zzso
