The zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel, zzso has been suggested to be the zzso zzso zzso channel identified in zzso zzso of zzso zzso thick ascending limb zzso and cortical collecting duct zzso zzso in the human zzso gene zzso zzso have been identified in zzso with zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we generated zzso zzso raised against both a zzso zzso acids zzso zzso binding protein zzso fusion protein and an zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected the zzso zzso protein in kidney zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso The zzso also recognized zzso to zzso proteins in kidney zzso these higher molecular weight proteins were abolished by zzso with zzso fusion protein and were also detected on Western blots using zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso showed intense zzso zzso along the loop of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso serum was zzso When zzso with zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso type zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein was found primarily at the zzso border of cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso convoluted zzso and connecting zzso Within the zzso the zzso protein was expressed in principal cells and was absent from zzso zzso The zzso zzso and polarity of zzso zzso are consistent with the distribution of zzso zzso and provide more support for zzso being the zzso zzso zzso channel in the rat zzso zzso
