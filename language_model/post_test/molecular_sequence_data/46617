The discrimination of recent zzso derivatives from ancestral variation is a critical zzso to any effort which aims to identify the factors modulating the rates of origin and persistence of new zzso We propose that newly arisen zzso zzso which we designate as terminal branch zzso zzso can be recognized by joint sequencing and zzso zzso This study examined zzso diversity in natural populations of the brown zzso zzso zzso from four heavily contaminated sites and three relatively pristine zzso While sequence analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed that zzso were prevalent in these zzso contaminant exposure appeared to play a minor role in their zzso Instead, most zzso likely arose due to spontaneous zzso with variation in their zzso among sites reflecting the impact of demographic zzso
