The stimulation of zzso is a critical event in zzso cell zzso Several zzso critically involved in cell proliferation pathways have been shown to be zzso by zzso zzso Thus, the degradation of delta protein zzso C zzso and zzso by zzso generates activated fragments corresponding to their zzso zzso consistent with the observations that both zzso are important for zzso In contrast, other zzso reported to have zzso properties, such as zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso degradation by the zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso have been shown to play critical roles in cell survival, in the study reported here we have addressed the potential degradation of these zzso by the zzso system in zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that although zzso and zzso are both inhibited in zzso cells, only zzso but not zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso This zzso generates a zzso that zzso to its zzso domain that is zzso zzso The sequence where zzso zzso zzso was zzso and a zzso resistant to degradation was shown to protect cells from zzso more efficiently than the zzso zzso
