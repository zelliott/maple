zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the high molecular mass zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso at two sites zzso and zzso during smooth muscle zzso To investigate the role of zzso at these sites, zzso were generated against zzso analogous to the sequences around zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The major site of zzso in zzso in zzso carotid zzso muscle strips was at zzso however, the amount of zzso did not vary appreciably with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso of zzso was almost zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso of the low molecular mass zzso of the protein zzso at the site analogous to zzso was greater in zzso cultured smooth muscle cells than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was attenuated by the protein zzso inhibitor zzso These data 1) identify zzso of zzso as the major site of zzso zzso in carotid zzso 2) show that the level of zzso at zzso is relatively constant following carotid zzso muscle zzso despite an increase in total protein zzso zzso and 3) suggest a functional role for zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso
