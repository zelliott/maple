zzso zzso a zzso zzso has a single mating type locus with two alternate forms called zzso and zzso zzso was cloned by zzso a zzso strain using a zzso library from a zzso strain and screening for a zzso zzso The zzso recovered from this zzso was able to zzso a zzso strain to zzso and zzso identity was proven by restriction zzso length zzso and conventional genetic zzso All zzso zzso could mate with either zzso or zzso zzso although the number of zzso produced by self zzso or crosses to zzso strains was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were themselves zzso zzso was cloned by probing a zzso library from a zzso strain with a zzso of insert DNA from a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of either zzso zzso was sufficient to zzso mating function in zzso zzso of the DNA sequence of these zzso revealed that zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, of completely dissimilar DNA flanked by DNA common to both mating zzso zzso zzso were found (one in each zzso zzso which, when spliced out, would yield open reading frames zzso that occupied approximately zzso of the dissimilar DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso translation of the zzso zzso revealed similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These gene products are all proven or proposed DNA binding zzso Those with similarity to zzso are members of the high mobility zzso
