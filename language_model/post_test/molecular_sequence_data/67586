zzso P processes the zzso of zzso An essential zzso zzso has been demonstrated in zzso zzso and the zzso of most zzso an zzso number of proteins complement the zzso Nuclear zzso P from zzso and humans is well understood and contains an zzso similar to the sister zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no protein zzso have yet been identified in the plant zzso and the presence of a zzso acid in zzso P is still zzso We have thus set out to identify and characterize the zzso of these zzso in two plant model zzso zzso of the two known zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso was zzso The first wheat zzso zzso sequences are zzso leading to improved structure models for plant zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso the central zzso zzso protein zzso was identified in zzso suggesting the expression of distinct protein zzso from this gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P activity and zzso zzso from wheat zzso Our results provide evidence that in plants, zzso is associated with zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso either separately or in a single large zzso
