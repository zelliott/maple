Most zzso of New World primates exhibit resistance to vitamin zzso These monkeys harbor high circulating zzso of the zzso zzso D and the active vitamin D hormone 1, zzso zzso Previous work from this laboratory indicated that resistance is associated with the zzso of a zzso zzso protein that binds vitamin D zzso zzso In the current studies zzso D3 zzso was used as a competitive zzso to investigate the ability of a number of small zzso molecules to interact with this zzso vitamin zzso protein zzso in zzso extracts of a zzso zzso cell line from the common zzso a vitamin zzso New World zzso Only those vitamin D zzso with a zzso zzso in the zzso position were bound by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas more zzso zzso in the vitamin D side chain did zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso vitamin D zzso most specifically zzso of zzso diminished but did not abolish zzso zzso Of more than two dozen other small zzso molecules zzso only the zzso zzso zzso and testosterone, and the zzso steroid zzso were found to be capable of binding specifically to zzso Using a combination of physical and serial zzso techniques, we enriched zzso zzso binding activity zzso in extracts of zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of this zzso fraction demonstrated a zzso zzso molecular species with a zzso approximately zzso Seven different zzso fragments were isolated from the zzso zzso each possessing sequence similarity to the zzso family of zzso zzso binding analyses confirmed that human zzso expressed zzso zzso with approximately similar affinity ( approximately zzso zzso as did zzso zzso In zzso these results suggest a novel action for the zzso family of proteins as zzso vitamin zzso and zzso steroid zzso zzso
