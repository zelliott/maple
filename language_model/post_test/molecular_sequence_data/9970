Species differences in the metabolism of zzso can present significant problems for safety and efficacy assessment during the development of new pharmaceutical zzso Identification of animal models for human metabolism and/or zzso of any particular compound would significantly reduce the extent and cost of animal testing of novel candidate zzso zzso is an important zzso for metabolism of zzso and potent zzso compounds and is zzso by members of the zzso zzso zzso We have zzso a zzso zzso from male dog liver zzso which zzso simple zzso compounds such as zzso and zzso On zzso gel zzso the protein had a zzso molecular weight of approximately zzso Da and was zzso Da by zzso mass zzso zzso analysis with an zzso zzso specific for the human zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested the protein was highly zzso to the human zzso zzso This was supported by zzso acid sequence analysis of four peptides derived from the zzso zzso and by comparison with sequences of other zzso zzso which showed the highest identity with human and monkey zzso Our data illustrate the high degree of conservation of zzso zzso across zzso species and suggest that this dog liver zzso is more closely related to the human zzso than equivalent proteins in rats and zzso
