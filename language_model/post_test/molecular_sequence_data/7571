zzso and zzso affect zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on the level of zzso zzso zzso gene expression were examined in rat zzso zzso of zzso zzso stores by 72 h of zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by 24 h of zzso a standard laboratory diet zzso of zzso Upon further zzso zzso concentration gradually returned to control levels after 120 zzso After 72 h of zzso zzso activity and zzso protein in the liver were zzso lower than in control rats with free access to zzso After 72 h of zzso zzso activity and zzso protein returned to control zzso No significant differences in zzso zzso levels were found between zzso starved and zzso rats, as determined by Northern zzso analysis and zzso zzso indicating that the long-term regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso occurs via a zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso associated with zzso was zzso lower in starved than in fed zzso These data indicate that the efficiency of zzso zzso translation, rather than its zzso decreases during zzso
