The effects of light quality on flowering time were investigated in zzso zzso which is a zzso cut zzso and with zzso under zzso conditions with light-emitting zzso zzso zzso zzso plants were grown under natural daylight and flowering was controlled by zzso treatment with a weak LED light of a single color in the zzso zzso was promoted not by blue light, but by zzso light in zzso zzso while flowering was promoted by both light colors in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso expressed under zzso conditions with white light, suggesting that they play roles in flowering at different stages of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression was not induced by zzso light in zzso zzso or zzso Instead, the expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was induced by zzso light in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was promoted by induction of zzso and zzso expression with blue light in zzso whereas zzso and zzso expression was low with blue light induction in zzso zzso The relationship between flowering and the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso was confirmed with ft and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso conditions with zzso light promote flowering through zzso and its zzso while the conditions with blue light do not promote flowering in zzso zzso because of low expression of zzso and zzso in contrast to that in zzso
