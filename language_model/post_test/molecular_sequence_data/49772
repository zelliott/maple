A strong zzso specific zzso drives zzso of the human zzso type 18 zzso zzso Its activity depends on the formation of a zzso zzso complex zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso factor and the zzso architectural zzso Here we show that proteins from zzso cell nuclear extract cover almost all of the zzso zzso sequences and that it contains seven binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso providing evidence for a tight zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso nuclear extract to overlapping sites of the core zzso is zzso The integrity of this specific zzso binding site is as essential as the zzso binding site for the zzso function, indicating the fundamental role played by this architectural zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso is recruited by the zzso zzso and that it is limiting for zzso zzso since it is zzso by the zzso zzso protein and by the zzso positive factor in zzso We show the involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso in the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso sequences in zzso zzso
