A zzso strategy using zzso zzso zzso based upon consensus sequences of the active site of zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso zzso from zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso The sequence presented a continuous open reading frame and the deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso presented zzso with various zzso zzso in particular the highest percentage identity was observed with a zzso plasma zzso The expression of this zzso zzso was studied first at the zzso level and it was only detected by zzso in zzso and in adult zzso At the protein level we were able to detect it by Western zzso and by using zzso extracts from metabolically zzso zzso zzso The absence of any positive signal in Northern zzso and the detection of the protein suggest that the zzso has a very short zzso however the protein may be accumulated in the zzso The significance of identity with zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso with a native zzso pancreatic zzso However, no zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that the zzso zzso described in this paper is a zzso zzso
