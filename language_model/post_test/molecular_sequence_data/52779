The small fourth zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso presents a zzso zzso analysis suggests that the bulk of the fourth, including the portion that appears banded in the zzso zzso is zzso the banded region includes blocks of middle zzso DNA associated with zzso protein 1 zzso However, genetic screens indicate zzso genes in this region, a density similar to that in other zzso portions of the zzso Using a P element containing an zzso gene and a copy of zzso (marked with a zzso of plant DNA designated zzso we have identified zzso that allow for full expression of the white marker (R zzso and others that induce a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the former case, the zzso gene shows an accessibility and zzso activity similar to that seen in zzso whereas in the latter case, accessibility and zzso expression are reduced to levels typical of zzso zzso by in zzso zzso and by zzso of zzso DNA sequences to a collection of zzso and bacterial artificial zzso clones shows that the R zzso zzso and V zzso zzso are zzso zzso of the effect of genetic zzso on the zzso zzso shows some differences among these zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso are zzso and closely associated within this zzso region of the zzso
