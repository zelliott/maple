A human zzso region, zzso was zzso its DNA was amplified with the zzso zzso method, and the zzso products were cloned into a zzso zzso to construct a zzso zzso Of 193 zzso analyzed with Southern zzso zzso on hybrid cell panels, 26 zzso were either zzso zzso or zzso zzso By screening of a zzso library of human zzso DNA using the 26 zzso as zzso 47 positive zzso were obtained and underwent regional mapping with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Sixteen zzso gave FISH signals at zzso 5 at zzso 6 at zzso 3 at other zzso and 17 no zzso These 27 zzso mapped to zzso 15 are useful additions to the inventory of DNA markers of this zzso including the much interested zzso syndrome zzso
