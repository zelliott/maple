A zzso for a structurally zzso zzso carrier protein zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso seed, a tissue enriched in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli that express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso exhibited zzso to zzso greater specificity for zzso zzso and zzso greater specificity for zzso zzso than did known zzso zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso reported to date, the zzso zzso contains fewer zzso acids near its zzso compared to previously characterized zzso zzso Based on the activity of an zzso deletion zzso of a zzso zzso this structural feature likely does not account for differences in zzso zzso
