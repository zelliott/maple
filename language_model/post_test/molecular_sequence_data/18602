The zzso protein zzso zzso adjacent transcript 10) is uniquely expressed in zzso The zzso gene is zzso in the zzso class I locus in the human zzso and is related to some specific zzso such as zzso immune response, and zzso However, biological knowledge of zzso is zzso zzso to the lack of identification of its zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso but only a few zzso of zzso have been reported until now, and no zzso sites have been zzso Here, we report the zzso identification of zzso proteins by liquid zzso coupled with tandem mass zzso zzso We identified 175 proteins with high confidence as zzso zzso A total of 13 modified sites were identified for the first time by a modified search of the raw zzso zzso The modified sites were highly enriched with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso processes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were verified by a zzso zzso We confirmed that most of the zzso were zzso attached to a zzso zzso The functional distribution of the zzso targets suggests that zzso zzso in various biological zzso such as translation, protein zzso zzso processing, and zzso complex zzso These results should be very useful for investigating the biological functions of zzso
