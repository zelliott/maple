We have investigated human zzso that amplify and rearrange the zzso growth factor zzso zzso with generation of an zzso deletion zzso of 802 zzso in the external zzso This zzso deletion zzso generates a local zzso acid sequence at the fusion junction of what normally were distant zzso sequences in the intact zzso growth factor zzso This zzso acid zzso was chemically zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso and used as an zzso in zzso The zzso zzso reacted specifically with the fusion zzso in zzso The zzso junction zzso zzso was zzso by passage of the zzso over a zzso affinity column with zzso zzso The zzso zzso selectively bound the zzso deletion zzso as compared to the intact zzso growth factor zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso with gel zzso and binding experiments using zzso zzso These data indicate that it is feasible to generate zzso zzso zzso that are highly selective for zzso proteins in human zzso The zzso zzso described here, and other zzso zzso zzso should be ideal candidates for tumor zzso and zzso
