To better understand the zzso zzso cycling in an agricultural soil environment, amounts of total, organic and zzso P in 10 agricultural soil samples were zzso Since a large proportion zzso of the total P in the zzso was in organic form, a method was developed to evaluate the zzso rate of organic P in the soil by adding zzso to the soil and analyzing the change in zzso P zzso content after zzso it for 3 zzso Moreover, the relationship between the zzso zzso activity and bacterial biomass in 60 agricultural zzso was also investigated, where the zzso zzso activity ranged from 0 to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso value between zzso zzso activity and indigenous bacterial biomass was zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from the soil environment, and identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the agricultural soils, the zzso zzso activities were increased up to 16 and 27 times, zzso It was concluded that promotion of effective zzso bacterial strains could improve the sustainable P management in the agricultural zzso
