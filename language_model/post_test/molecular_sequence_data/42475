The sequence and zzso organization of zzso genes in zzso zzso were zzso zzso of overlapping zzso clones revealed that seven zzso zzso zzso genes are organized into a zzso locus containing zzso tandem zzso zzso covering a different zzso region indicated that an eighth zzso sequence is located at a distant zzso Southern zzso data suggested the existence of additional zzso genes or zzso One complete zzso zzso repeat unit, including coding and zzso regions, was zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso protein had approximately zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso or zzso major zzso zzso identity with zzso zzso and 68 or zzso identity with human zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso repeat found in other zzso zzso proteins is absent from the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso major differed mainly in the presence of short gaps in the zzso zzso zzso Potential regulatory heat shock elements were identified in the upstream zzso Several zzso clones were also isolated, and two different zzso addition sites 100 zzso apart were zzso
