zzso are zzso that replace zzso in the majority of families of the plant order zzso zzso acid is the common zzso of zzso The key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that opens the zzso ring of zzso zzso between zzso 4 and 5, thus producing an unstable zzso that zzso zzso to zzso zzso A gene for a zzso has already been isolated from the fungus zzso zzso but no zzso was ever found in zzso To identify the plant zzso we constructed zzso libraries between different colored zzso of zzso lines of zzso zzso zzso and between different stages of flower bud zzso Using in zzso analysis of zzso expressed zzso we identified a candidate showing strong zzso at the level of translated protein with the zzso domain present in several bacterial zzso zzso The gene was expressed only in colored flower zzso The function of this gene in the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso genetic zzso in white petals of zzso zzso zzso lacking the gene for color zzso This gene named zzso is the first characterized member of a novel family of plant zzso zzso distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are present not only in zzso plants but also, albeit with some changes near the zzso site, in other zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso These zzso are part of a novel zzso plant gene family probably involved in aromatic compound zzso
