We have previously proposed a model for the fold of the zzso domain of the small, regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The fold is an zzso sandwich with zzso zzso structurally zzso to the zzso regulatory domain of zzso zzso We suggested that the zzso zzso of a pair of zzso interact in the zzso to form two binding sites for the feedback inhibitor zzso in the interface between zzso The model was supported by zzso analysis and other zzso We have now examined the role of the zzso portion of the zzso by construction of truncated zzso zzso 35, 48, 80, 95, or 112 zzso acid zzso from the C zzso and examining the properties of zzso zzso using these zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso all lead to essentially complete zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to the putative zzso domain, has the highest level of affinity for the zzso zzso and leads to a zzso zzso with zzso about twice that of the zzso zzso On the other hand, none of these zzso binds zzso or leads to a zzso zzso on zzso The zzso zzso with the zzso construct does not bind zzso zzso The zzso portion (about 80 zzso acid zzso of the zzso is thus necessary and sufficient for recognition and zzso of the zzso zzso but the zzso half of the zzso is required for zzso binding and zzso We suggest that the zzso region of the zzso contributes to zzso zzso and provide additional experimental evidence for this zzso
