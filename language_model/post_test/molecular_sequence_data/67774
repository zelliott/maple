This study is focused on the zzso of the functional role of the mobile zzso loop in the zzso from zzso zzso and particularly on the roles of loop zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso coupled to characterization methods including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been possible to provide a molecular level view of interactions and the consequences of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was characterized by zzso values zzso and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso that highly resembled that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and determination of the zzso parameters of zzso : zzso binding revealed that this process is driven by zzso zzso which is linked to the movement of the zzso zzso zzso closure zzso the zzso zzso into a buried location, allowing its involvement in zzso binding and in the formation of a functional active zzso Similarly, the data underline the role of zzso in the zzso formation and definition of a zzso operational active site, which may be a specific feature of a subset of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso or zzso revealed that zzso affected zzso and/or zzso zzso dynamics performed on zzso implied that this zzso causes the loss of a hydrogen bond and leads to an alternative binding mode that is zzso for zzso zzso experiments revealed altered binding of the zzso motif in the active site, combined with reduced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
