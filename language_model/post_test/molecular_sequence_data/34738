In this report, we studied zzso expression in human zzso T zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in zzso of zzso No significant changes in the expression of the closely related zzso zzso were zzso zzso treatment alone was sufficient to zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso We cloned zzso zzso promoter and identified a zzso zzso containing two potential binding sites for the zzso factor nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso of core sequence of zzso resulted in reduced zzso activity, with more reduction observed in the second zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso results were consistent with a specific binding of zzso from zzso zzso nuclear extract of zzso cells to zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression is modulated in zzso T cells via a zzso that involves zzso
