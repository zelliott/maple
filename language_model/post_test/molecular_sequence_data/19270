zzso transcripts zzso with zzso can undergo alternative zzso to produce multiple transcripts from a single gene by differential use of zzso sites, thereby increasing the zzso and zzso complexity within and between cells and zzso Alternative zzso in plants is largely an unexplored area of gene zzso as this phenomenon used to be considered zzso However, recent zzso zzso analyses have revealed that alternative zzso in flowering plants is far more prevalent than previously zzso Interestingly, zzso of many zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso are extensively alternatively zzso Furthermore, stresses have a dramatic effect on alternative zzso of zzso including those that zzso many zzso zzso Although the mechanisms that regulate alternative zzso in plants are largely unknown, several reports strongly suggest a key role for zzso proteins in zzso assembly and regulated zzso Recent studies suggest that alternative zzso in plants is an important zzso regulatory mechanism in modulating gene expression and eventually plant form and zzso
