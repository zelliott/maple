We characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso + zzso protein zzso with three zzso motifs from zzso zzso zzso zzso It exhibits significant similarities with the zzso and zzso C proteins from other zzso zzso of zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso falls on the base of the zzso C zzso It may be a novel member of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso is expressed throughout early development except the stages around the zzso From zzso stage zzso transcripts of the zzso are detected in the neural plate, the neural tube, the zzso zzso and the zzso as well as the zzso of the zzso and zzso It is also expressed in the zzso but not the well-developed zzso In adult zzso the transcripts are found in the zzso cells of the gut and zzso zzso the wall of zzso the zzso the neural zzso and zzso
