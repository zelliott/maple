The three-dimensional zzso structure of the zzso protein from zzso coli zzso entry zzso is reported at zzso A zzso zzso is a hypothetical protein that belongs to the zzso zzso The structure reveals that the protein binds a metal zzso in a zzso zzso Three coordination sites are provided by zzso zzso while the fourth might be a water zzso that is not seen in the zzso map because of its relatively low zzso X-ray zzso analysis of the zzso protein suggests that the metal is a zzso zzso The structure of zzso and its sequence similarity to a number of predicted zzso zzso provides a functional assignment for this protein zzso The figures and tables of this paper were prepared using zzso tools, termed the zzso server, developed by the New York zzso zzso Research zzso with the goal of zzso the rapid publication of zzso structures that zzso from worldwide zzso zzso efforts, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso
