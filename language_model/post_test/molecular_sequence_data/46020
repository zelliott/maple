Although the zzso evolution of zzso through primary and secondary associations is well established, the evolutionary timing and stability of the secondary zzso events is less well zzso zzso include both zzso and zzso members and the zzso lineages branch zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso data indicate that zzso zzso evolved via a secondary zzso involving a zzso host cell and a zzso zzso of the red algae and this zzso event may have preceded the divergence of zzso and zzso If photosynthesis evolved early in this zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso groups may contain genes that are not essential to photosynthesis but were derived from the zzso zzso through gene zzso These genes offer the potential to trace the evolutionary history of zzso gains and losses within these zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for ammonium zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso Three zzso gene families zzso zzso and zzso have been identified and are broadly distributed among zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso by members of the zzso and zzso family, zzso Here, we explore the evolutionary history of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso red algae, and other zzso zzso zzso sequences were obtained from two species of zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso Additional zzso sequences from zzso and bacteria were obtained from publicly available databases and zzso zzso zzso zzso and maximum likelihood zzso analyses of zzso provided strong support for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and plants and strong to moderate support for the zzso Although the zzso is reflective of the zzso division of zzso we propose based on the zzso of the zzso analyses that the zzso zzso gene evolved via zzso gene transfer from the nucleus of the zzso zzso to the nucleus of the zzso The lack of zzso sequences in the zzso examined here further suggests that the zzso gene that functions in the zzso of zzso zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso
