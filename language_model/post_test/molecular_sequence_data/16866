The structural zzso of the regulatory and coding regions of the zzso zzso are zzso Two classes of zzso copies of zzso zzso with and without zzso strategy to express zzso and Pol zzso were earlier revealed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso are shown to be evolved from an ancient zzso with zzso and are widespread in the zzso of the zzso complex zzso zzso of a rare zzso responsible for zzso pausing and efficient zzso is zzso Two structural zzso of zzso zzso were detected in the zzso complex zzso the zzso structural zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains duplicated and zzso copies of 28 zzso in the zzso region, whereas A1 zzso lacking this zzso is expanded in the zzso zzso zzso Selective expansion of the zzso zzso was detected in the independently established zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cell culture, and zzso whereas A1 is expressed only in zzso of zzso zzso Relief of expression of the zzso but not A1 zzso in the zzso as a result of zzso in the zzso interference zzso zzso gene is zzso Thus, expansion of the recently evolved zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso possessing a new translation strategy, zzso in the zzso region, and extended profile of expression is zzso
