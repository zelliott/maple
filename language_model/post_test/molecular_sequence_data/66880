zzso is a widely distributed small molecular weight protein in the zzso zzso zzso and today its zzso are known in five zzso and several zzso The structures of these zzso are relatively well zzso among the zzso In the skin, zzso is located mainly on the surface of the collagen zzso It is found in the zzso medium and also in the zzso of cultured zzso Early studies focused on zzso assembly zzso zzso and interactions (with the zzso zzso zzso a targeted disruption of zzso resulted in a zzso similar to zzso zzso In addition, a cell zzso activity of this protein for zzso zzso and several other cells was found, and this activity might suggest this zzso involvement in wound zzso The expression of zzso around an zzso zone of experimental zzso zzso may support this zzso In zzso zzso zzso act mainly as zzso zzso In addition, we found that transforming growth zzso interacts with zzso and the function of this zzso is modified by zzso Recently, the involvement of this protein in cell proliferation has been zzso In this review we describe the reported functions of this protein and speculate on the multiple roles of this largely zzso zzso zzso
