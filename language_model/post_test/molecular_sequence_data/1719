To characterize the zzso of zzso virus zzso isolate present in North Africa, viruses were isolated from zzso cell lines established from the saliva of both Algerian zzso Carcinoma zzso patients and zzso normal individuals, Algerian zzso zzso cell lines, and zzso zzso By zzso sequence analysis, we showed that there were two specific zzso zzso in an 89 zzso region of zzso gene at position zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso at zzso zzso and another zzso at zzso zzso changing their zzso acid zzso The first zzso was found in all B cell lines established from the saliva and 50% of zzso cell lines, as well as the zzso cell line, while the second zzso was found in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cell lines and the zzso zzso A zzso analysis on the zzso DNA zzso H showed that the zzso was specifically associated with zzso zzso while zzso was linked with zzso zzso The latter was not identified in zzso zzso but was found rather in saliva from zzso patients, normal individuals and zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso on the other hand, was found in zzso of zzso zzso and some zzso cell zzso This suggests that zzso with zzso is tightly implicated in zzso development in North Africa rather than zzso with zzso
