zzso zzso is an essential component of comparative zzso zzso In this regard, zzso lags behind zzso Although various zzso and direct zzso methods have recently enhanced comparative zzso analysis, a cell culture labeling strategy, that could provide for zzso the advantages that zzso provides for zzso has not been zzso Here, we report the development of zzso zzso zzso of zzso With zzso for the incorporation of differential mass tags into the zzso of cultured zzso In this method, culture media containing zzso is used to metabolically label cellular zzso with heavy zzso Because the zzso side chain of zzso is the sole source of nitrogen for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid, we demonstrate that zzso mouse embryonic stems cells for 72 h in the presence of zzso media results in nearly complete incorporation of zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The zzso heavy zzso zzso provide additional information for interpreting zzso fragmentation and also allow zzso in both full zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a simple to zzso yet powerful quantitative tool for the zzso zzso
