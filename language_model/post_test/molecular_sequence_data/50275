The in zzso interaction of zzso zzso A1 with zzso zzso and with zzso was zzso We show that protein A1 can zzso bind U2 and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso H zzso of U2 zzso involved in base pairing with the branch site, totally eliminates the zzso zzso zzso zzso protection and zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso protein A1 specifically binds the zzso regions of both zzso and zzso zzso However, while on the zzso zzso only binding to the zzso tract was observed, on the zzso zzso a 32 zzso zzso encompassing the branch point and the AG zzso zzso was bound and zzso Such protection was drastically reduced in the presence of U2 zzso zzso these results indicate that protein A1 can establish a different pattern of association with different zzso and support the hypothesis that this protein could play a role in the zzso of U2 to the branch site and hence in the early events of zzso complex zzso
