A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the tube of zzso zzso zzso collected from the wall of an actively venting zzso structure on the East Pacific Rise at zzso zzso The cells were zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso long and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew between 65 and 80 zzso zzso 75 zzso 15 and 35 g zzso zzso zzso 30 g zzso and pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso Generation time under optimal conditions was 26 zzso Growth occurred under zzso conditions with zzso as the energy source and zzso as the carbon zzso zzso and sulfur were used as electron zzso with zzso formation of ammonium or hydrogen zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the culture medium inhibited zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene and of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso indicated that this zzso formed a novel lineage within the class zzso equally distant from the type strains of the type species of the three zzso that represent the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The polar lipids of strain zzso differed substantially from those of other members of the zzso and this zzso produced novel zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that the zzso represents a novel zzso and species within the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
