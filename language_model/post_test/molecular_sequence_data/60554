In complex with zzso the zzso zzso binds to and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins promote cell cycle progression in zzso and human cells by regulating translation and polarization of the zzso zzso A zzso domain of the zzso proteins shares identity with protein and zzso zzso but only one zzso zzso and no regulators of the zzso cascade have been zzso We report here that zzso zzso has an intrinsic protein zzso activity capable of zzso zzso and this activity is abolished by an active site zzso and inhibited by zzso or zzso We find that an intact zzso zzso domain is essential for zzso functions in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso or of a central region of the zzso proteins distinct from the zzso and zzso zzso was toxic in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso suppressed this toxic zzso zzso of the zzso domain leads to a zzso cell cycle arrest, consistent with an zzso of zzso function in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso C zzso suppressed growth zzso by the zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings identify a toxic zzso domain of the zzso proteins that may interact with zzso or regulators of the zzso zzso cascade and that shares sequence identity with other zzso family members, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso
