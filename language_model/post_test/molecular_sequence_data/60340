zzso is a zzso protein essential for zzso export from the nucleus in zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso human zzso zzso which is zzso identical to zzso Like its zzso zzso zzso is localized within the zzso and at the nuclear zzso By zzso zzso the nuclear zzso fraction of zzso has been localized to the zzso zzso of the nuclear pore complex zzso zzso with this zzso we show that both the human and zzso proteins directly interact with an zzso region of the zzso zzso In a conditional zzso strain in which zzso is zzso when shifted to the zzso temperature, zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso to the zzso Thus, zzso is recruited to the zzso via a zzso interaction with zzso To investigate its function, we generated defective zzso zzso and zzso their effects in zzso export by zzso in zzso zzso A zzso protein containing a zzso change in the zzso zzso inhibited the nuclear exit of zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which is recruited to the zzso zzso of the zzso where it zzso in the export of zzso out of the zzso
