The mobility of zzso zzso element zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso terminal zzso repeats zzso and approximately 250 zzso zzso at each zzso These sequences flank the coding region for the zzso zzso zzso which is required for the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso has a zzso DNA binding domain, and recognizes the zzso and zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso binds zzso to repetitive zzso and zzso zzso of which 25 copies are found in the zzso and 20 copies in the 3' zzso zzso zzso affinity is highest when these sites are flanked on the 3' side by an additional G zzso zzso which is found at zzso of binding zzso Moreover, zzso binds specifically to the zzso zzso albeit with much lower zzso Two zzso within the zzso that zzso zzso abolish zzso binding zzso The basic DNA binding domain of zzso is split into two zzso zzso to the zzso motifs is accomplished by the zzso zzso alone, whereas recognition of the zzso requires the zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso is extremely flexible in DNA zzso Two direct or zzso binding sites are bound equally well, and sites that are five to twelve bases apart are similarly well zzso The consequences of these findings for the zzso zzso reaction are zzso
