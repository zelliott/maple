zzso delta virus expresses two forms of a single zzso the small zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso which are identical except for an additional 19 zzso present at the C zzso of delta zzso While delta zzso is required to promote zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso this process and also zzso packaging of the viral zzso by envelope proteins of the helper virus zzso B zzso zzso within the zzso responsible for nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified, yet it is not clear how these particular activities contribute to the ultimate replication and packaging zzso Here we report the following zzso zzso Although the removal of the nuclear zzso signal from either zzso resulted in significant zzso zzso both proteins still had access to the zzso As a consequence, no functional zzso was observed with either zzso zzso The zzso domain, although necessary for delta zzso function, could be deleted from delta zzso without compromising its ability to either inhibit replication or promote zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso domain was required for both the zzso of replication by delta zzso and the zzso of replication by delta zzso This region, with an additional 20 zzso acids zzso to it, was necessary and sufficient to zzso inhibit replication by interacting with the small zzso zzso The packaging property of delta zzso required a zzso zzso region which is hypothesized to interact with the zzso B virus envelope proteins during the assembly zzso
