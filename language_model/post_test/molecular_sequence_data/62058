zzso A1 and zzso are novel zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that possess a unique zzso linkage in the zzso zzso zzso we report the zzso sequencing, zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which includes seven open reading frames predicted to be involved in the zzso and transport of these natural zzso The genetic architecture and domain organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in arrangement with respect to the putative order of the zzso assembly of the zzso zzso A zzso domain identified at the zzso end of the zzso zzso is predicted to catalyze an zzso hydride transfer to the zzso intermediate zzso to yield a linear zzso zzso that is subsequently captured zzso with the zzso group of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to form a stable zzso zzso While a few zzso zzso associated with zzso have been identified, the zzso zzso is the first to mediate zzso zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso coupled with the recent characterization of the zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso from zzso support the involvement of this cluster in zzso zzso
