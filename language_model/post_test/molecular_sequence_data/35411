We have previously reported protection against hypoxic injury by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso interaction inhibitor zzso zzso in zzso cardiac zzso In the present work we demonstrate the zzso of this zzso to the inner membrane and zzso of zzso when it is zzso into isolated rat zzso We also used ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso of heart zzso to demonstrate reduced zzso zzso I zzso release from zzso rat hearts zzso with this zzso 50% zzso zzso of zzso collected from zzso rat heart preparations zzso zzso zzso allowing its detection in Western zzso In hearts receiving 20 zzso of zzso followed by 30, or 60 zzso of zzso the zzso zzso percentage of zzso zzso release was 30 zzso 7 and 60 zzso 17, respectively, with additional zzso release occurring after 150 zzso of zzso zzso of hearts with the zzso interaction zzso prior to 20 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso release by zzso Additionally, we found that when soybean zzso inhibitor zzso was added to rat heart zzso it could also be zzso using zzso and detected in western zzso This provided a convenient method for zzso protein zzso between zzso Our results support the further development of the zzso inhibitor as a potential therapeutic for combating cardiac zzso zzso In addition, we have developed an improved method for the detection of zzso release from zzso rat zzso
