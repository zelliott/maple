The aim of this study was to gain more information about the possible zzso mechanisms in zzso We analyzed the complex zzso patterns against human zzso nerve zzso in zzso of patients with glaucoma and tried to identify important zzso 

zzso of 133 patients were zzso healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso primary zzso glaucoma zzso zzso zzso and normal tension glaucoma patients zzso zzso zzso The zzso were tested against Western blots of human zzso zzso and zzso bands were zzso with zzso zzso zzso patterns were analyzed by zzso statistical techniques, and the most significant zzso were identified by mass zzso zzso 

All subjects, even healthy ones, showed different and complex zzso zzso zzso groups showed specific zzso and zzso of zzso zzso compared to the control zzso The zzso analysis of zzso found significant differences zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso profiles against human zzso nerve zzso between both glaucoma groups and healthy zzso The identified zzso include: zzso basic protein zzso in the zzso group), zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in the glaucoma zzso and zzso zzso in the glaucoma groups in comparison to zzso 

Using human zzso nerve zzso we were able to demonstrate that complex zzso zzso patterns exist in zzso of patients with zzso Large correlations between the given and our previous studies using bovine zzso nerve zzso could be zzso Furthermore, zzso basic protein zzso which can also be detected in patients with multiple zzso were found in zzso of glaucoma zzso
