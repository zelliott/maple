Total chemical synthesis of two zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing five zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso possessing four zzso of zzso was zzso zzso binding zzso were obtained for each zzso and these differed considerably from each zzso The binding zzso for zzso was complex and could only be fit to zzso models involving multiple zzso binding zzso The data for zzso binding to zzso was uniquely fit to a simple zzso zzso In the case of zzso circular zzso zzso studies revealed a zzso without zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and a dramatic shift to a high degree of zzso at zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso possessed significant zzso structure, and zzso with zzso produced a less substantial change in its zzso zzso zzso with zzso of the change in zzso content of zzso produced a zzso value for zzso that was essentially the same as its zzso from direct binding studies, demonstrating that occupancy of the single zzso binding site resulted in the zzso zzso Similar zzso with zzso provided a zzso value in concert with the zzso for binding of zzso to this zzso Moreover, in agreement with these particular zzso structural changes, gel zzso analyses demonstrated significantly reduced zzso volumes of both of these zzso after zzso of their zzso forms with zzso with zzso showing a more pronounced change than zzso zzso zzso zzso showed both line broadening and changes in chemical shifts of several zzso zzso zzso zzso after addition of zzso to zzso again suggestive of a large zzso zzso change in this zzso A zzso of zzso was zzso with all zzso acids present in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso displayed zzso binding zzso nearly identical to those of zzso and underwent a zzso zzso change very similar to that of zzso zzso injections of zzso and zzso in young zzso 2 weeks) and older zzso weeks) mice produced the expected zzso and zzso effects, zzso The zzso zzso was inactive in these zzso These studies demonstrate that synthetic zzso and zzso possess their expected zzso and undergo large and defined zzso zzso in the presence of zzso We propose that binding of zzso to these zzso contributes to their ability to adopt a defined zzso and this zzso zzso zzso is necessary for their zzso
