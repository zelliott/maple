The zzso gene of zzso coli specifies a product that is a key element in the initiation of DNA zzso zzso of zzso occurs from two zzso zzso and zzso which flank a zzso protein binding site zzso zzso In this paper we describe the effects of zzso box zzso on zzso from the two zzso measured with the use of zzso gene zzso All of the zzso examined led to a zzso increase in expression from the upstream promoter, zzso suggesting that expression from this promoter is zzso zzso by binding of zzso protein to the zzso The same zzso led to a decrease in expression from promoter zzso suggesting that the zzso box plays a role in zzso promoter zzso under normal zzso zzso of zzso zzso above normal zzso levels, led to decreased zzso from both zzso We present evidence from analysis of both zzso zzso and zzso protein that promoter zzso is subject to growth zzso control and that this promoter, but not promoter zzso is completely shut off in the stationary phase of zzso
