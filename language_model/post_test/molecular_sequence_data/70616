A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with small zzso acid changes was zzso zzso in the charge, zzso or length of the zzso peptides did not improve the zzso activity, and there was no statistically significant correlation between any of these factors and the zzso for zzso zzso zzso coli, or zzso zzso Individual peptides demonstrated zzso with conventional antibiotics against zzso strains of zzso zzso The peptides varied considerably in the ability to bind zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and this correlated significantly with their zzso activity and ability to block zzso tumor necrosis factor and zzso zzso In general, the peptides studied here demonstrated a broad range of activities, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso
