A zzso zzso zzso virus zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso type 1 zzso in a genetic background of zzso was used to develop an animal model in which a zzso zzso expressing the zzso envelope zzso caused acquired immune zzso syndrome zzso in zzso An zzso zzso zzso that died from AIDS at 24 weeks zzso experienced two waves of zzso one extending from weeks zzso and the second extending from week 18 until zzso zzso zzso isolated during the first wave was neutralized by zzso appearing at the end of the first zzso phase, but the virus zzso isolated during the second zzso phase was not neutralized by these zzso zzso of zzso into 4 zzso zzso resulted in severe zzso T cell loss by 2 weeks zzso and all 4 zzso died from AIDS at zzso weeks zzso Because this virus had a zzso zzso we zzso the zzso gene and compared these sequences with those of the zzso gene of zzso and parental zzso With reference to zzso zzso had 18 and 6 consensus zzso acid zzso in the zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso These compared with 10 and 3 zzso acid zzso in the zzso and zzso regions of zzso Our data suggested that zzso and zzso probably evolved from a common zzso but that zzso did not evolve from zzso A zzso virus, zzso constructed with the consensus zzso from the zzso on a background of zzso confirmed that zzso acid zzso in zzso were responsible for the zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the selection of a zzso virus that was responsible for the second wave of zzso
