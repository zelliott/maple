Various members of the zzso zzso of signaling molecules are known to have important roles in zzso patterning and differentiation during zzso and zzso zzso Here we characterize a new zzso member from zzso zzso that is most closely related to the zzso muscle differentiation factor zzso and to zzso zzso Northern analysis shows that zzso is expressed throughout the zzso life zzso In zzso zzso detects zzso transcripts that are enriched in the pole zzso and later become enclosed in the pole zzso Between stages 11 and 14, zzso zzso is exclusively detected in zzso cells and their zzso Following stage 14, high levels of zzso expression are observed in the developing zzso muscles as well as in visceral muscles and zzso We also show that the zzso expression of a recently described zzso zzso which maps to the same zzso 102 on zzso 4 as zzso is restricted to the developing central and peripheral nervous zzso
