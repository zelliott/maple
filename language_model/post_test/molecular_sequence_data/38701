zzso is a family of zzso factors which are expressed in all zzso however, in most non-B cells, they are zzso in the zzso in inactive complexes with specific zzso zzso termed zzso We have recently shown that zzso factors are zzso activated in human breast cancer and zzso zzso tumors, and function to promote tumor cell survival and zzso Here, we have examined the zzso of induction of zzso factors upon zzso treatment of female zzso zzso rats in zzso and in human zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso We observed that zzso zzso is an early event, occurring prior to zzso zzso In zzso rats, increased zzso binding was detected in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso from zzso of animals 3 weeks zzso with 15 zzso zzso zzso this is prior to formation of tumors which normally begin to be detected after 7-9 zzso In zzso zzso cells, in zzso zzso transformation upon treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso resulted in a zzso to zzso increase in activity of classical zzso zzso zzso induction was zzso with a decrease in the stability of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced the zzso zzso promoter, which is driven by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, reduction zzso zzso immortalized following zzso exposure, showed zzso induction of classical zzso prior to zzso zzso Together these findings suggest that zzso of zzso plays an early, critical role in the zzso transformation of zzso zzso
