Although zzso zzso has been identified in an array of zzso zzso recent recognition of its capacity to zzso marine zzso was zzso Here, zzso from 2 naturally infected sea zzso zzso zzso were characterized biologically, zzso and zzso DNA was extracted from frozen muscle of the first of these sea zzso and was characterized as zzso zzso by zzso chain zzso zzso amplification followed by restriction zzso length zzso analysis and zzso zzso from sea otter zzso 1 were up to 350 zzso long, and the zzso zzso on the zzso wall were up to zzso zzso long and up to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were tapered towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar to zzso zzso zzso from the muscles of cats zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso muscles from a second sea otter failed to support zzso amplification of markers considered diagnostic for zzso zzso but did induce the shedding of zzso when fed to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Such zzso were subsequently fed to knockout mice for the zzso zzso resulting in infections with an agent identified as zzso zzso on the basis of zzso serum zzso and diagnostic sequence zzso Thus, sea zzso exposed to zzso zzso may support the development of mature zzso that are infectious to competent definitive zzso
