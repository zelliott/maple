zzso engagement can induce either T cell proliferation and differentiation or zzso T cell death zzso through zzso The zzso signaling pathways that dictate such a disparate fate after zzso engagement have only been partially zzso zzso zzso zzso induce a partial zzso zzso signaling pattern and cause zzso on zzso cycling T zzso In this study, we examined zzso signaling during the induction of zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso This zzso activates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso adapter zzso despite the inability to cause calcium zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso also fails to effectively activate zzso protein of 70 zzso or zzso Using zzso T cells deficient for zzso or zzso we provide compelling evidence that zzso of zzso is required for the induction of zzso Our data indicate that a selective and distinct zzso signaling pattern is required for zzso by zzso partial zzso zzso
