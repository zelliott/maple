A zzso zzso zzso library was generated from zzso zzso strain zzso and clones with zzso in survival in a high concentration of zzso were zzso One of these zzso zzso has the zzso integrated within the coding region of the zzso termination factor zzso Analysis of this zzso zzso showed that the cells are zzso and present a normal cell cycle, but have a longer generation zzso This strain is sensitive to zzso zzso to the presence of different zzso and to heat zzso but it responds well to zzso light and alkaline zzso The most striking zzso of the zzso zzso is that it is extremely sensitive to zzso stress, in both exponential and stationary zzso zzso using a zzso fusion of the zzso promoter region to the zzso gene showed that zzso gene expression varies during the cell cycle, showing very low expression levels at the zzso cell stage and presenting maximum levels in early zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is increased in the zzso zzso strain, which is indicative of an zzso circuit, and there is a small variation in the cell cycle pattern of zzso Several peptides have their synthesis altered in the zzso strain, as zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso most of which show a reduction in zzso These results indicate that the zzso factor is essential for an efficient response to certain stresses in zzso
