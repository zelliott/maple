We have developed a coupled zzso DNA unwinding zzso and have used it to monitor the rate of zzso DNA unwinding zzso by the zzso T4 DNA replication zzso zzso This procedure can be used to follow zzso activity in zzso in systems in which the zzso reaction is not synchronized on all the zzso zzso We show that T4 replication zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be assembled onto a loading site located near the end of a long zzso DNA template in the presence of a zzso crowding agent, and that this coupled zzso system can carry out zzso strand displacement DNA synthesis at zzso rates zzso to 500 zzso per zzso and with high zzso in the absence of other T4 DNA replication zzso These results suggest that a direct zzso interaction may be central to fast and zzso zzso DNA zzso and lead us to reconsider the roles of the other replication proteins in zzso zzso
