The two known zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso are hormone zzso zzso factors that have distinct roles in regulating cell proliferation and zzso The natural zzso 17 zzso zzso binds with high affinity to both zzso alpha and zzso zzso However, a close zzso 16 zzso zzso (16 alpha zzso showed about zzso selectivity for zzso alpha over zzso zzso From X-ray studies, it has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso of the two receptors are zzso similar, and that only two changes fall within the binding cavity zzso alpha zzso to zzso beta zzso and zzso alpha zzso to zzso beta zzso To understand the molecular basis for the zzso alpha selectivity of 16 alpha zzso zzso and zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta were generated, and zzso and zzso functions were zzso The zzso alpha zzso Met zzso behaved like zzso alpha zzso in the presence of 16 alpha zzso whereas the profile of the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso beta zzso The zzso beta zzso zzso Met behaved like zzso alpha with 16 alpha zzso The results clearly demonstrate the role of zzso alpha zzso in the zzso alpha selectivity of 16 alpha zzso
