Thirteen zzso virus zzso obtained during the time period between 1995 and 2004 from zzso zzso zzso of nine sheep and four zzso from different geographical areas of Greece and Italy with suspected contagious zzso infection were zzso DNA of all zzso was successfully amplified by zzso with the zzso zzso and identified them as zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence of zzso virus zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso analysis of the available zzso and zzso acid comparison of the zzso resistance protein zzso by this zzso region was carried zzso According to the results of the present report a precise zzso of the zzso region studied might provide evidence for the genetic variation and movement of the circulating zzso virus zzso
