zzso is an essential zzso factor that promotes binding of U2 small nuclear zzso at the zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso that zzso specifically with zzso Using this zzso we show that zzso is zzso distributed in the zzso with additional concentration in nuclear zzso which represent zzso compartments enriched in zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Furthermore, transient expression zzso using zzso deletion zzso of zzso indicate that targeting of the protein to nuclear zzso is not affected by removing either the zzso binding domain, the zzso domain, or the region required for interaction with zzso The association of zzso with zzso persists during zzso when zzso and zzso are zzso Moreover, zzso is localized to nuclear zzso in early zzso cells that were treated with zzso zzso during zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso in zzso is independent of the presence of zzso in the nucleus, which is consistent with the idea that zzso represent storage sites for inactive zzso zzso After zzso infection, zzso redistributes from the zzso and is zzso detected at sites of viral zzso By combining zzso infection with transient expression of deletion zzso we show a specific requirement of the zzso domain for recruitment of zzso to sites of active zzso in the zzso This suggests that interactions involving the zzso region of zzso may play an important role in targeting this protein to zzso in zzso
