The gene zzso human zzso was isolated from a human lung zzso zzso DNA library with a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso unit is zzso zzso in size and contains three zzso interrupted by two zzso of approximately zzso and 650 base pairs, zzso zzso 1 encodes the zzso region of the zzso zzso 2 the putative signal sequence and the initial portion of zzso and zzso 3 encodes the remainder of the zzso which contains six copies of the zzso sequence in contrast to five copies in the rat zzso zzso The predicted human zzso zzso structure has 242 zzso acids compared to 255 zzso acids in the zzso zzso with rat zzso is zzso and zzso at the zzso acid and zzso acid levels, zzso zzso zzso sites and zzso and 3' zzso borders were confirmed rigorously by sequencing a human zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction and human zzso zzso
