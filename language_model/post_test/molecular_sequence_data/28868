A zzso gene was cloned on a zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso identified an open reading frame zzso a deduced protein of 700 zzso zzso zzso of the signal zzso sequence resulted in a predicted protein that was 68 zzso in zzso Analysis of the sequence indicated that the zzso contained a zzso domain belonging to family 18 of zzso zzso Three putative binding zzso a zzso binding domain, a novel zzso kidney disease zzso domain, and a zzso type III domain, were also identified within the zzso zzso comparisons of each domain to the most closely related sequences found in database searches clearly demonstrated variation in gene sources and the species from which related sequences zzso A zzso protein with zzso activity was zzso from culture zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso interaction zzso Although the protein was significantly smaller than the size predicted from the zzso the zzso sequence verified that the first 15 zzso acids were identical to the deduced sequence of the mature protein zzso by zzso zzso exchange zzso of zzso resulted in zzso strain zzso which was devoid of zzso activity and lacked the zzso protein in culture zzso zzso zzso was also reduced in the ability to suppress summer patch disease on Kentucky zzso supporting a role for the zzso in the zzso activity of zzso zzso
