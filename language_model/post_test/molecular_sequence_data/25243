We have characterized zzso factor I zzso a zzso factor present in avian nuclear extracts which binds to the zzso zzso virus long terminal repeat zzso and zzso Through deletion and point zzso we show that zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso Although the zzso motif is essential for zzso recognition, zzso shows surprising latitude in the zzso sequences zzso the zzso motif to which it will bind with high zzso zzso will zzso to the binding sites of a number of previously described zzso factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a range of affinities that is at most zzso lower than the high affinity binding site for zzso in the zzso zzso virus long terminal zzso We present evidence, however, that zzso is probably identical or very closely related to zzso and zzso This is based on the fact that zzso in avian nuclear extracts binds with equal or zzso greater affinity to the binding sites of zzso and zzso despite less than 50% zzso (outside the zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso recognition zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso give rise to identical gel zzso patterns in extracts from a variety of different cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to zzso zzso upon zzso exchange zzso separating into two zzso components (A and zzso which must be zzso to recover substantial DNA binding zzso zzso weight estimates for the two zzso components of zzso zzso and a zzso binding protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso are very zzso zzso DNA binding activity has recently been shown to be induced by serum and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Genes & zzso 4, zzso The close relationship or identity between zzso zzso and zzso thus has important implications regarding the mechanisms by which serum or the zzso zzso may affect changes in gene zzso
