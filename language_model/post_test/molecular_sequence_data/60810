A partial zzso zzso zzso zzso had been previously cloned and zzso in Japanese zzso The zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends techniques were used here to identify a zzso sequence of the quail zzso that contains a complete open reading zzso For the first time in an avian species, this zzso sequence and the corresponding zzso acid sequence are zzso They are compared with the known zzso sequences previously described in zzso and with the zzso sequences identified in a selection of zzso and avian zzso The analysis by Northern zzso of the zzso zzso expression in the brain and zzso revealed the presence of several zzso The presence of zzso identified by reverse zzso chain reaction demonstrated a widespread distribution quite different from the distribution of zzso The complete zzso distribution of zzso zzso as determined by in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso is also zzso zzso are present in many zzso implicated in the control of reproduction such as the zzso zzso nucleus, the nucleus zzso zzso and the nucleus zzso the avian zzso of the zzso These data demonstrate the presence of zzso in a zzso species and indicate that the zzso distribution of this zzso type has been zzso in these two classes of zzso The role of this zzso in the control of reproduction and other zzso processes should now be zzso
