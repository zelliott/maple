Two zzso zzso with the size of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were isolated from the liver of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the precursors of zzso 4 and zzso zzso Both genes shared virtually identical overall organization with three zzso separated by two zzso which were inserted in the similar positions of the zzso coding zzso Moreover, their zzso sequences shared approximately zzso zzso This result reveals the evolutionary relationship between zzso and zzso The zzso structures of zzso 4 and zzso genes were similar to that reported for zzso c zzso a zzso zzso DNA from a sea snake zzso zzso However, in contrast to the finding that the zzso 2 of these genes had a similar size, a notable variation with the size of zzso 1 was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso and 197 zzso for zzso 4, zzso and zzso c zzso zzso The different size with zzso 1 is due to the middle region at the first zzso of zzso 4 and zzso zzso which zzso small zzso zzso zzso being absent in that of zzso c zzso These results, together with the finding of the potential mobility of zzso genes during evolution, suggest that zzso insertions or deletions of zzso genes occur with the evolutionary divergence of snake zzso and zzso
