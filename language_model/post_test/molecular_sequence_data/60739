zzso was the only zzso in the order zzso until the recent characterization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present study of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso focuses on a naturally occurring group I zzso in the zzso target site of zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso 1, belonged to the zzso structural zzso and was most closely related to large zzso zzso zzso that express zzso zzso zzso in zzso of algae and in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of in zzso zzso indicated that the zzso was not spliced out of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the first group I zzso to be found in bacterial zzso or zzso and it may delay the zzso zzso zzso replication cycle by affecting zzso zzso
