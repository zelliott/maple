We have identified elements in the zzso region of the zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso gene which control the response to serum, zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso in cell zzso These elements lie between zzso and zzso relative to the translation initiation start site in the gene and are distinct from those that control expression in response to virus zzso The zzso and spatial expression of the zzso gene was also zzso during mouse zzso using in zzso zzso A transgenic mouse line was constructed which expressed a zzso Z fusion zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso we were able to compare the expression of the zzso with the zzso zzso Thus we concluded that most of the sequences controlling in zzso expression of zzso were present in the zzso and could be zzso to the zzso region of the zzso
