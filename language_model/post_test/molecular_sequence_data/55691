zzso of the zzso zzso promoter by zzso zzso protein was examined in several cell lines by using a transient expression system in which zzso expression zzso activate the zzso promoter linked to a zzso zzso reporter gene or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protection analyses confirmed that the induction of zzso by zzso was zzso and affected both zzso and zzso start sites in a zzso zzso line, zzso and a zzso line, zzso zzso analyses of the zzso promoter revealed that two distinct regions could zzso zzso responsiveness in two zzso lines, a zzso site upstream of zzso and a zzso site within the first zzso zzso In contrast, only the zzso site was required for other cell lineages zzso Five separate zzso sites were located in this zzso site and found to be important for zzso trans zzso DNA binding was necessary for zzso zzso as shown by the loss of function associated with zzso of zzso zzso domain and by zzso zzso activity of the DNA zzso zzso zzso The involvement of additional protein factors was addressed by zzso protein synthesis with zzso in a conditional expression system in which the activity of zzso zzso was under the control of zzso These experiments indicate that de zzso synthesis of additional proteins was not necessary for zzso trans zzso Together these data reveal two cell zzso pathways by which zzso regulates zzso however, both pathways are mechanistically indistinguishable in that direct DNA binding by zzso is required for zzso zzso whereas neither de zzso protein synthesis nor other zzso proteins are zzso
