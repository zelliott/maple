zzso virus and zzso virus, the first known viruses capable of naturally infecting the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were recently identified by zzso sequencing of wild zzso zzso By similar analysis of another wild zzso zzso zzso we have now discovered and zzso the complete zzso of a third novel virus, Le zzso virus, that is zzso related to zzso and zzso zzso All three viruses are zzso zzso viruses with zzso zzso that are most closely related to zzso Identification of a third virus capable of infecting zzso zzso enables comparative analysis of this zzso of viruses and strengthens this model for investigating zzso zzso
