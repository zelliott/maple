We examined three tissue samples from each of four cows with zzso skin, tissue samples from a cow with multiple zzso mast cell tumors, and samples from another cow in which mast cells were zzso multiple zzso of the skin, for the presence of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso and zzso were tested using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso could be demonstrated in frozen and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in neither frozen nor zzso sections of zzso or zzso skin zzso zzso linkage with a zzso rabbit zzso skin zzso zzso was highly specific in bovine normal zzso zzso and tumor mast zzso More than zzso of the tumor mast cells were distinctly zzso With zzso blue, only slightly more than zzso of the mast cells stained clearly positive and with zzso blue hardly any zzso of mast cell zzso could be zzso No zzso labeling of mast cell zzso in any of the tissue sections was detected by the use of rabbit zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that there is a striking zzso similarity of bovine zzso to its canine and human zzso The demonstration of zzso is an important tool in confirming the diagnosis of zzso mast cell zzso In contrast to other species, zzso appears to be completely absent in bovine skin mast zzso
