Conventional zzso direct sequencing of candidate genes for a family with zzso zzso with unknown zzso failed to identify any zzso zzso 

To carry out zzso sequencing of entire transcripts of the whole X zzso to investigate a family with X linked zzso 

zzso sequencing of all the transcripts of the X zzso after zzso zzso zzso was performed on one of the two affected male subjects (the zzso and an unaffected male subject (his zzso A nonsense zzso in zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso direct sequencing of other family members confirmed the presence of this zzso zzso in the other affected brother and zzso in the zzso mother and maternal zzso zzso zzso usually cause abnormal zzso function in addition to neurological zzso but this zzso had normal zzso zzso 

zzso zzso next-generation sequencing is sufficient to fully zzso all the transcripts of the X zzso This method is particularly suitable for zzso screening of zzso zzso disorders and can avoid biases in candidate gene zzso
