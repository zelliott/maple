A zzso tomato golden mosaic virus zzso A component DNA, which results from replacement of the coding region of the viral coat protein gene zzso with the larger bacterial zzso coding sequence zzso can replicate in zzso leaf discs but is unstable in zzso infected plants zzso We have made similar replacements of the zzso zzso gene with the zzso coding sequence in both the sense and zzso zzso Both derivatives zzso in leaf discs zzso via zzso However, systemic movement of the zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso The only zzso A derivatives detected in zzso infected leaves of zzso plants were similar in size to the wild type viral zzso zzso analysis of derivatives from six independently zzso plants revealed that they did not result from internal deletions of the larger zzso detected in leaf discs but, instead, were generated by fusion events zzso within the original zzso zzso These results indicate that systemic movement of zzso in zzso zzso plants provides a strong selective pressure favoring viral derivatives similar in size to the wild type virus zzso
