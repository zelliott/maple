zzso are the largest known family of zzso zzso infecting zzso insects, and zzso Here we isolated three novel zzso from mosquitoes sampled in zzso zzso Ghana, and zzso The viruses define a highly diversified zzso sister zzso to all members of the zzso zzso and are virtually zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid identities between zzso putative proteins of the novel group and zzso ranged between 12 and zzso The type zzso tentatively named Herbert virus zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso comprised zzso with zzso M, and S segments of about zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the shortest zzso M segments known and did not seem to zzso zzso and zzso proteins but contained an zzso L segment with an zzso zzso zzso that shows no identity to other zzso The viruses zzso to high zzso in insect cells but did not replicate in zzso zzso The enveloped zzso were 90 to 110 zzso in diameter and zzso at cellular zzso with zzso features typical of the zzso zzso zzso zzso recovered from infected cells showed zzso zzso sequences of 9 to 22 zzso suggestive of cap snatching during zzso zzso as described for other zzso Northern zzso identified zzso species of full and reduced zzso suggested upon zzso with other zzso to constitute zzso zzso and transcript zzso zzso zzso studies will be necessary to determine if this group of viruses constitutes a novel zzso in the zzso zzso
