The zzso zzso zzso contains three putative zzso zzso to human zzso and zzso These zzso are predicted to be zzso involved in the synthesis of the zzso zzso linkage region of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The genes zzso active zzso which we have designated zzso zzso and zzso (where zzso stands for zzso zzso zzso zzso truncated soluble forms of all three zzso efficiently transfer zzso from zzso to the linkage region zzso zzso zzso zzso has specificity for zzso whereas zzso and zzso act on a wide array of zzso with zzso terminal zzso and zzso Gal zzso Their highest activities are obtained with zzso with a terminal zzso zzso indicating their possible involvement in the synthesis of the zzso zzso in addition to the zzso linkage zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures widely found in zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso also serve as zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of all three zzso are zzso expressed throughout the zzso stages and in adult zzso of zzso Thus, all three zzso are likely involved in the synthesis of the zzso linkage region in zzso and zzso and zzso appear to be involved in various zzso transfer reactions for the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso This activity zzso these zzso from their zzso zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso alignment of the zzso zzso with zzso in human, zzso and zzso zzso demonstrates the conservation of a majority of the critical zzso acid zzso in the active sites of the three zzso zzso
