We report the definition and characterization of a zzso zzso designated the short zzso zzso and demonstrate that all of these share the unique property of selectively zzso the fetal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have characterized newly identified zzso from zzso zzso and have conducted a more detailed characterization of zzso previously reported from additional zzso zzso Among the results, the characterization of the short zzso revealed diverse zzso of a block of the fetal muscle zzso particularly in zzso zzso The zzso relationships of native zzso and some zzso revealed a single zzso acid locus zzso either His or Pro in native zzso that is a critical zzso of the zzso zzso The unprecedented binding selectivity for the fetal muscle zzso coupled with the kinetic diversity, should make zzso useful zzso for a diverse set of zzso The rapidly zzso peptides may be most suitable for zzso studies, while the relatively irreversible peptides should be most useful for binding and zzso zzso
