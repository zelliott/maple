The vitamin D3 zzso is a zzso zzso regulatory zzso The zzso zzso the zzso of target genes by binding directly to specific DNA sites, termed vitamin D response zzso these sites vary considerably in their zzso to each zzso In order to approach the question of what sequences can constitute high affinity recognition elements for the vitamin D3 zzso we have selected for such sites in zzso by mixing zzso and zzso vitamin D3 zzso DNA binding domain with an zzso duplex pool containing a completely zzso central region flanked by zzso zzso Following multiple rounds of zzso and amplification by zzso to enrich for high affinity sites, individual clones were zzso and found to contain nearly identical zzso zzso yielding a consensus zzso This sequence is similar to some known vitamin D3 zzso binding sites, such as zzso but quite divergent from zzso This suggests that the vitamin D3 zzso may be able to selectively recognize at least two classes of sequence zzso
