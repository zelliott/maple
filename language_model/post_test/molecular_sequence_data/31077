Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe, we have isolated two zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, from a zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, eve and the zzso zzso constitute a family of related genes based on similar zzso zzso In addition, zzso 1 and zzso 2 share extended zzso acid conservation outside of the zzso The zzso 1 protein consists of 416 zzso acids as deduced from the longest open reading frame of zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 is located zzso zzso from the zzso 5 locus on mouse zzso zzso It is expressed in zzso zzso stem cells but not in cells differentiated with zzso acid and zzso During zzso zzso 1 shows a zzso expression zzso From days 7 to 9 zzso zzso 1 expression emerges at the zzso end of the zzso within the primitive zzso and later in the zzso and zzso From days 10 to zzso zzso zzso 1 transcripts are restricted to specific cells within the neural tube and zzso along their entire lengths and zzso zzso as well as zzso with maturation of early forming zzso possibly zzso zzso The early and late zzso pattern is compatible with a role of zzso 1 in specifying zzso zzso information along the embryonic axis similar to the zzso zzso and in specifying zzso cell fates within the zzso neural tube in zzso to eve in the embryonic central nervous system of zzso zzso
