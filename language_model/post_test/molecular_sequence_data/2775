zzso acid sequences of the second domain zzso zzso and the signal sequence zzso zzso are presented for a number of zzso zzso zzso There is less zzso in these regions than is found in the first domain zzso zzso a result expected from previous zzso acid sequence zzso The distribution of the zzso follows a locus and zzso zzso This permits an easy assignment of gene zzso that is useful for ordering the events which have taken place in the first zzso The relative zzso of the second zzso within zzso related zzso makes them likely candidates for zzso the zzso recognized by public zzso zzso
