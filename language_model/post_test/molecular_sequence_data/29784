The zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent the zzso oldest order of zzso that are believed to lack the zzso immune system of zzso zzso In order to search for molecular markers specific for cellular components of the zzso immune system in zzso we used the zzso chain reaction zzso to identify genes for zzso factors of the zzso family in zzso DNA and zzso libraries from two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso family of zzso factors consists of five members, zzso zzso zzso Eos and zzso of which the first three appear to be essential for zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso named zzso and zzso were identified in zzso They both have the zzso zzso structure of seven zzso and show alternative zzso like their counterparts in zzso zzso The genes code for predicted proteins of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The proteins contain six highly zzso zinc finger motifs that are zzso identical to the zzso members of the zzso zzso The remaining parts of the sequences are, however, mostly zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso segments of the sequences does not identify the zzso gene in zzso zzso but rather shows zzso of the zzso zzso factors to each other and to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies by reverse zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso however, provide evidence for moderate expression in presumed zzso zzso like the gut zzso and for high levels of expression in the zzso especially in the zzso
