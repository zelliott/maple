zzso peptides zzso both the native domain around the zzso zzso site of zzso and zzso sequences there of, previously zzso in zzso zzso experiments, have been studied by CD in different zzso systems, such as water, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in order to ascertain the ability of each zzso to stabilize secondary structural zzso A combination of zzso methods and empirical calculations, that allow zzso of the contributions due to zzso structures from the zzso suggests that mainly two distinct families of ordered zzso containing zzso and/or structurally different zzso are present in solution, the relative stability of the different zzso depending on the nature of the zzso The presence of zzso is in line with a previous zzso study in zzso and zzso zzso of the CD zzso in zzso zzso of peptides undergoing processing with a sequence not processed in zzso shows that only the latter possesses a stable and zzso zzso zzso This observation suggests that the zzso involving zzso but no zzso which was observed by CD both in zzso and organic zzso zzso at high water zzso might be of biological zzso The similarity of this zzso to molecular models obtained from zzso data in zzso and zzso is zzso
