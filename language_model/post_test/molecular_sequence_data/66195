The zzso coli outer membrane zzso A zzso zzso is normally a zzso zzso but it can be directly activated in outer zzso by zzso zzso associated with a breach in the zzso zzso We now demonstrate that a zzso A zzso zzso in an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso in outer zzso The zzso A zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso sensitivity and, unexpectedly, with serum sensitivity, which resulted from zzso zzso absence due to a zzso determined zzso at the first outer core zzso unit of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso A background aggravated the zzso zzso sensitivity as a result of losing a partially zzso increase in zzso A zzso while simultaneously restoring serum resistance and zzso attachment to intact zzso zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso inactive zzso zzso restored the zzso core zzso However, the intact zzso was preserved after zzso with an internal deletion zzso zzso which mostly eliminates a zzso zzso zzso domain but fully supports cell surface zzso A zzso Our findings indicate that zzso of zzso not only triggers zzso A zzso in the outer membrane but also separately zzso the zzso core zzso in the zzso We discuss the implication that zzso might function as an zzso sensory zzso which can be activated by a breach in the outer membrane zzso zzso
