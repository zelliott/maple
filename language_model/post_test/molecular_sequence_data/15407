zzso zzso one of seven zzso is an zzso commonly found in the zzso complex that adds zzso to zzso In the three zzso studied to date, the zzso gene directs production of zzso protein using either of two zzso start zzso The product of the smaller transcript serves the traditional zzso role in the zzso This form also complexes with zzso a zzso zzso to form zzso zzso In addition to a zzso role, the protein translated from the longer transcript appears on the plasma zzso of some cells where it serves as a zzso zzso in zzso interactions such as zzso zzso The objective of this study was to sequence the zzso region of zzso zzso and examine the sequence for relationships to the zzso human, zzso and chicken zzso zzso The sequence for the zzso base pair zzso region of zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of the deduced protein sequences revealed that the zzso region displayed the highest identity between the four zzso The zzso domain was zzso identical between the zzso sequence and those of the zzso human and zzso The zzso protein had the lowest overall zzso to the chicken zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Conservation of both zzso start sites in the zzso gene supports the existence of two zzso When compared to the other zzso zzso zzso the zzso coding sequence contained a single zzso zzso inserted into the region zzso the zzso zzso Two putative zzso sites in the mouse zzso domain were zzso in the zzso zzso Northern blots revealed a widely expressed zzso zzso transcript that was more abundant in the zzso zzso during zzso These results are important for studies of the function of this unusual and important zzso during zzso zzso zzso and zzso
