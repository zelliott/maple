To gain insight into the impact of zzso zzso on soil microbial communities, we characterized the bacterial community of several zzso zzso from two sites with different histories of contamination and zzso of zzso The amount of extracted DNA, the total cell counts and the number of zzso were lower in the zzso zzso Analysis of soil bacterial diversity by zzso showed a predominance of zzso and zzso in the zzso soils, as well as the presence of zzso zzso from zzso zzso were identified as zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso Finally, a pristine soil was spiked with different zzso of TNT and the soil zzso were incubated for 4 zzso The amount of extracted DNA decreased in the zzso with a high TNT concentration zzso and zzso g zzso zzso zzso of zzso over the incubation zzso After 7 days of incubation of these soil zzso there was already a clear shift of their original zzso towards a community dominated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that TNT affects soil bacterial diversity by selecting a narrow range of bacterial species that belong mostly to zzso and zzso
