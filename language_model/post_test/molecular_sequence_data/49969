The zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso cultured in rich or minimal media was analyzed by zzso zzso and quantitative zzso protein identification zzso The overall correlation between zzso and protein expression was zzso positive with a zzso rank correlation zzso of zzso for zzso zzso To place the data sets in a proper biological context, a zzso approach based on protein pathways and protein complexes was zzso zzso expression levels were zzso controlled for not only single zzso but for entire protein pathways zzso Met, zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the protein expression of zzso in several protein complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso The zzso of the methods described provided insight into the biology of zzso zzso and a zzso strategy by which future studies should be zzso
