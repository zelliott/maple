A zzso clone for the zzso of bovine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mr zzso zzso was isolated from a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli colonies were screened by in zzso colony zzso with 2 different zzso zzso corresponding to a region unusually rich in zzso within the zzso Three positive clones were isolated and shown to zzso zzso by an in zzso zzso zzso of their fusion protein products with zzso The results of the sequence analysis of the longest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso coding region, in exact agreement with the bovine zzso zzso acid sequence zzso et zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of total bovine zzso DNA showed that there is a single gene coding for zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso nucleus zzso using zzso zzso derived from the clone zzso demonstrated the existence of 2 abundant zzso species, corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The high concentration of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus is in agreement with the known distribution of this zzso
