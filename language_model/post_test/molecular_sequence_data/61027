zzso in cancer often occurs in zzso islands that span the promoter regions of tumor zzso zzso However, it is not clear if zzso is limited to single target genes or if multiple genes are simultaneously zzso To understand the extent of zzso de zzso zzso we have analyzed the zzso pattern of a number of zzso genes in leukemia from the same cohort of zzso We used zzso zzso sequencing to characterize the zzso pattern of the zzso islands associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in the bone zzso from 9 normal and 20 patients with acute zzso zzso zzso All of the normal control samples were essentially zzso for each of the eight zzso genes zzso In contrast, 19 of 20 zzso of the zzso patients had an abnormal zzso pattern in at least one zzso and 15 of 20 zzso had abnormal zzso patterns in two or more of the target zzso We conclude that there is a general deregulation of zzso island zzso in leukemia and that zzso is not limited to single zzso but a number of genes are zzso zzso Moreover, the subset of genes that are commonly zzso in leukemia appear to be cancer type zzso
