zzso peptides derived from the predicted zzso 1 and 4 of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to study the zzso specificity of zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso 1 and 4 are surface exposed and carry in their zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were induced with zzso whole cell zzso zzso zzso were evoked in volunteers after one zzso with 50 zzso or 100 zzso protein of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso was determined in zzso using zzso zzso zzso The zzso specificity of zzso zzso for both zzso and human zzso could be demonstrated by direct zzso zzso using overlapping zzso peptides almost spanning the entire zzso 1 or 4 of the zzso The capacity of peptides to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso and human zzso was investigated using zzso strain zzso zzso as a target zzso zzso activities could be inhibited with both zzso and zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso and zzso
