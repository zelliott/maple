A total of 12 zzso zzso zzso were selected with zzso in the minor zzso which suppress a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso normally has zzso zzso next to and 3' of the zzso zzso zzso Since the presence of zzso prevents zzso some of the zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso had zzso in the primary sequence abolishing the formation of zzso However, several of the zzso zzso species had a normal level of zzso and a zzso zzso loop, showing that neither zzso zzso nor an zzso zzso loop, is a prerequisite for zzso zzso Moreover, base zzso far from the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and at the top of the zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso When the zzso site zzso CCC is in the zero frame and a zzso zzso moves the zzso to the zzso zzso is overlapped by a nonsense zzso zzso the efficiency of zzso decreased when release factor 1 was zzso and increased at an elevated temperature in a zzso with a zzso release factor zzso The zzso site zzso was also overlapped with the sense zzso zzso which is zzso by a zzso species having a zzso zzso zzso at position zzso zzso in the zzso gene affect the formation of this modified zzso and result in an A instead of zzso in the zzso Such an zzso zzso is very inefficient in translation and the efficiency of zzso increased in a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso event occurs at the zzso since the efficiency of zzso was sensitive to the decoding activity of the overlapping zzso We conclude that zzso with zzso far from the zzso with a zzso zzso loop and having zzso induce zzso zzso at the zzso
