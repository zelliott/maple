To understand the information zzso in an zzso zzso the authors have attempted to simplify the zzso sequence of zzso yellow protein zzso with a set of simple zzso The rules are designed to reduce overlapping structural zzso The simplified zzso zzso which was composed of only nine species of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Met, zzso zzso and zzso took a completely different structure than the native zzso Even after the zzso zzso zzso were restored in the simplified zzso the zzso zzso did not properly fold, indicating that the information zzso in the zzso zzso is insufficient for the structure zzso Additional zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not lead to a zzso that formed the native zzso The structural properties of these zzso and the zzso protein in zzso solution zzso zzso zzso was successfully performed by creating zzso proteins composed of combinations of zzso zzso and zzso The structural characterization of each zzso protein indicates that the important information on the structure formation is zzso in the zzso zzso
