Mouse zzso zzso cells have the spontaneous ability to take up zzso zzso A proportion of the zzso DNA is further zzso into zzso zzso In this work, we have followed up the fate of the foreign DNA upon zzso into zzso We have found that the zzso zzso DNA becomes tightly associated with the nuclear scaffold, is extensively zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of two randomly selected clones independently recovered by zzso rescue from zzso zzso zzso cells shows that DNA fragments from the zzso are integrated into the mouse zzso zzso The sites of integration are identical in both zzso suggesting that these events do not occur randomly, but take place at preferential zzso A zzso II consensus sequence is found adjacent to one end of the integration site, suggesting a possible role of this zzso in the process of zzso zzso
