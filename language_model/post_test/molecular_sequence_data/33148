zzso the genetic zzso that alter zzso protein expression may further our understanding of the risk for development of gastric cancer zzso We used zzso to identify the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at its zzso site of zzso 2 and zzso to detect zzso protein expression in zzso patients and zzso subjects and analyzed the association between this zzso and zzso protein zzso We found that the frequency of AA zzso was significantly high in the zzso patients and the risk for zzso in AA zzso carriers increased zzso Moreover, we found a significant zzso of zzso protein in zzso as compared to zzso subjects, which was zzso correlated to AA zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this study provides a possible zzso insight that the zzso zzso zzso at its zzso site zzso the zzso functions of zzso which is important to the zzso protection of gastric zzso Thus we have provided evidence that may identify the zzso zzso zzso at zzso site, as a potential genetic factor which leads to an increase in zzso for zzso through zzso of zzso gene and zzso expression in the population that carry the A zzso
