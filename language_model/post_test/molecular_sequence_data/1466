The design of synthetic agents to disrupt zzso interactions has received relatively little attention in recent zzso In this review we describe strategies for targeting different types of protein surfaces using zzso of protein secondary or zzso zzso In this way strong and selective binding to a protein surface has be achieved and disruption of clinically important zzso interactions has been demonstrated in models of human zzso
