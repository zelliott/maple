The precise location of the zzso processing zzso zzso P zzso P) and the mechanism of its zzso distribution have not been completely zzso We show that three protein zzso of human zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found in the zzso and that each can zzso a reporter protein to zzso of cells in tissue zzso In contrast to zzso which is zzso distributed in zzso zzso and zzso are confined to the dense zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess functional, yet distinct zzso required for zzso zzso The zzso zzso lacks such a domain and appears to be dependent on a zzso process to reach the zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso active zzso P exists in the zzso We also provide evidence that zzso and zzso reside in coiled bodies, zzso that are implicated in the zzso of several other small nuclear zzso required for processing of precursor zzso Because some protein zzso of zzso P are shared by the zzso zzso processing zzso zzso zzso these two evolutionary related zzso may share common zzso zzso and assembly pathways to coordinate the processing of zzso and zzso zzso
