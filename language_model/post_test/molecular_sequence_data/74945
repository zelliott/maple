zzso sequence analysis of a zzso clone shown to direct the synthesis in zzso coli of a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso with an apparent molecular weight of zzso has clarified the zzso nature of the zzso genes present in the Chinese zzso lung cell line zzso By comparison with other zzso zzso different forms of zzso produced by these cells or by zzso zzso derived from them zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso and with the use of zzso zzso to generate homogeneous populations of specific zzso zzso for subsequent translation in zzso we demonstrate that, with respect to the proteins they zzso these zzso differ only at zzso acid position 95; a conversion of zzso at this position is solely responsible for the zzso mobility and zzso differences between the Mr zzso zzso zzso and Mr 20,000 zzso zzso forms of the zzso We also show that the conversion of zzso to zzso at position 22 of the Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso form whose zzso activity is equal to or greater than normal, but whose zzso for zzso is 85 zzso Additionally, the in zzso translation experiments show that the minor zzso forms of zzso known to exist in Chinese zzso lung cells are generated by a zzso or zzso modification zzso zzso evidence suggests that this modification may result from an zzso of the N zzso of the zzso
