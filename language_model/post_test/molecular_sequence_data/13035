Two very closely related human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso These zzso are products of distinct genes and are zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to the recently described human zzso zzso (now designated zzso zzso are zzso to a family of five zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso They are also closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in the stress response, and play a central role in the targeting of short-lived regulatory proteins for zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in all cell lines and zzso zzso with zzso transcripts generally expressed at the highest zzso Analysis of Southern blots suggests that there are likely to be other related members of this zzso Both zzso and zzso form zzso zzso zzso with zzso and have activities similar to zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso to target proteins in the presence of the human zzso protein zzso zzso These results establish the existence of a highly zzso and widely zzso family of human zzso zzso zzso
