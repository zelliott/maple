Upon exposure to the heavy metals copper and zzso a large amount of zzso heat shock protein zzso was zzso in normal, zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas only a little increase of zzso synthesis was observed in zzso zzso zzso To determine the zzso mechanism of zzso induction in the zzso cells, we first analyzed the zzso zzso of these zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells increased immediately after exposure to these zzso In zzso cells, however, the increase of zzso zzso was delayed, even though it eventually increased to a similar or slightly lower level compared with zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso of heat shock zzso factor zzso showed that a significant zzso of zzso was observed immediately after exposure to these metals in the zzso cells, whereas the zzso of zzso was initially zzso in the zzso zzso Thus, the decreased induction of zzso synthesis observed in the zzso cells seemed to be due to the reduced translation of zzso zzso and also in part to the reduced zzso of zzso Furthermore, by the gel mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso the association of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso The amount of zzso complex was prominent in zzso cells, in which the zzso content was 5 to 10 times higher than that in the zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that the activity of zzso is zzso regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso
