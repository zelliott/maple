The structures of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been investigated by chemical analyses and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was found that all of them consists of a relatively simple zzso structure of the zzso repeating block zzso The zzso around the zzso and zzso linkages in these kinds of zzso were also studied by using molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations, together with zzso zzso The results are similar to those found within the zzso chains of zzso with a zzso zzso for the zzso linkage and a certain restriction around the zzso bonding imposed by the zzso
