zzso zzso is the model for investigating zzso zzso plant zzso To further the zzso of its zzso zzso full-length zzso sequences were used to construct databases for the promoter and untranslated regions of zzso zzso zzso A subset of clones was zzso to determine full zzso zzso These and the original zzso were assembled into zzso representing zzso or zzso of the predicted zzso zzso zzso The new sequencing allowed the confirmation of zzso gene models, zzso of which contain an zzso The use of full-length zzso clone sequences ensured that untranslated regions were physically linked to the open reading frames zzso not merely aligned upstream of the start of zzso zzso sequence features include: zzso over 500 potential short upstream zzso zzso 95 gene models that require further zzso zzso one new potential ORF, zzso varying zzso content in different gene regions, zzso a zzso motif for the start of translation, zzso the correlation of zzso length with transcript representation in zzso libraries and with gene function categories, zzso a relationship between natural zzso transcripts and zzso length that differs from that of zzso zzso a potential relationship between DNA replication and the control of transcription, and zzso new insights regarding mechanisms for the control of zzso and zzso maturation in zzso zzso
