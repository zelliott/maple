B zzso are among the first cells to be infected by mouse zzso tumor virus zzso and they play a crucial role in its life zzso To study zzso regulation of zzso in B cells, we have analyzed two areas of the long terminal repeat zzso next to the zzso zzso binding site, zzso (at position zzso to zzso from the cap zzso and zzso (at zzso to zzso Both showed zzso protection in zzso I in zzso zzso zzso and contain binding sites for zzso zzso factors, a large family of proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation and zzso zzso In gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound the zzso zzso factor zzso protein zzso present in zzso nuclear zzso which was identified by various criteria: formation of zzso and zzso sensitivity to zzso conditions, zzso of binding by specific zzso and zzso of complexes with those formed by zzso zzso zzso which prevented complex formation in zzso abolished zzso zzso from an zzso zzso linked to a reporter gene in zzso zzso zzso lines, whereas they did not affect the zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso resulted in an increased level of hormone response of the zzso reporter zzso and produced a synergistic effect with the zzso zzso zzso indicating cooperation between the zzso This is the first example of zzso cooperation with a steroid zzso providing the opportunity for studying the integration of their zzso signaling zzso
