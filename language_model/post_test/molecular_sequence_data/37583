The Walker zzso zzso present in all the six zzso of zzso exists in a folded form, known as zzso loop zzso Analysis of the zzso angles showed only small zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso This indicated a good overlap of the backbone zzso The zzso zzso zzso D, E and zzso showed significant changes in the zzso angles and the side chain zzso angles, but not the structural zzso zzso A, B and zzso Most striking among these are the changes associated with zzso and zzso corresponding to a flip in the zzso unit between them when a zzso is bound zzso D or F compared to zzso chain zzso The zzso analysis further revealed a zzso unnoticed hydrogen bond between zzso of the flipped zzso and terminal zzso of the zzso This assigns a role for this zzso zzso acid, otherwise ignored, of making an unusual direct interaction between the zzso backbone of the zzso protein and the incoming zzso zzso zzso of this interaction is zzso as it is limited only to the zzso zzso and also likely to involve a mechanical rotation of bonds of the zzso zzso Hopefully this is part of the overall events that link the chemical zzso of zzso with the mechanical rotation of this zzso now famous as tiny molecular zzso
