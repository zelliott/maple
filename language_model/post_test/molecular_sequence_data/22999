The formation of zzso by zzso of zzso was detected in peptides from rice leaf and potato zzso zzso zzso in zzso and membrane zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and identified using a zzso mass zzso zzso was detected in 29 peptides representing 17 different zzso With one exception, the zzso zzso all of these proteins were either zzso active themselves or zzso in zzso zzso zzso The same site was modified in zzso several adjacent spots containing the P protein of the zzso zzso complex, zzso two different zzso of the zzso processing zzso in complex III, and zzso the same zzso zzso in zzso zzso in both rice and potato zzso This indicates that zzso zzso is a selective zzso
