We have determined the primary structure of a novel gamma zzso zzso 12, previously designated gamma zzso of G protein zzso from bovine zzso The mature gamma 12 protein composed of 68 zzso acids had zzso zzso at the N zzso and zzso zzso at the C zzso This was consistent with the zzso zzso signal in the zzso acid zzso which was predicted from gamma 12 zzso isolated from a bovine zzso zzso zzso Western blots with the specific zzso against gamma 12 showed that gamma 12 is present in all zzso zzso Among various gamma zzso zzso 1, gamma 2, gamma 3, gamma 7, and gamma zzso gamma 12 has a unique property to be zzso by protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso (or zzso The zzso beta gamma 12 associated with Go alpha more tightly than the zzso zzso Exposure of Swiss zzso and zzso smooth muscle cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso of gamma zzso zzso of zzso smooth muscle cells with natural zzso agents such as zzso II and zzso also induced zzso of gamma zzso The extent of zzso of beta gamma 12 in zzso was suppressed by a complex formation with Go zzso which was relieved by the addition of zzso zzso or aluminum zzso These results strongly suggest that gamma 12 is zzso by protein zzso C during zzso of zzso and G zzso in living zzso
