An unexpected feature of the zzso II form of zzso virus zzso infection seen in the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso is the presence of spliced zzso zzso zzso from the zzso A zzso of the viral zzso and running in the opposite orientation to several zzso zzso cycle zzso The importance of these zzso transcripts and the specificity of their association with zzso remain to be zzso In this study, we examined the extent to which such zzso are present in other zzso distinct forms of zzso zzso seen in B zzso Two independent zzso of zzso zzso were zzso amplification across defined zzso junctions in zzso using the zzso chain reaction, and in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso specific for a putative open reading frame downstream of these zzso zzso Such methods, which easily detected zzso zzso in fresh zzso zzso and zzso zzso lines, also revealed consistent expression of these transcripts in all zzso zzso zzso cell lines displaying the highly restricted zzso I form of infection zzso promoter zzso as well as in all zzso zzso cell lines zzso displaying the zzso III form of infection zzso promoter zzso zzso in established zzso occurring irrespective of virus producer status, was not a consequence of continued in zzso zzso thus, appropriately spliced zzso transcripts could be amplified from normal B cells within 1 day of their experimental infection in zzso along with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso both on zzso zzso cell lines and on zzso showed that essentially every cell contained zzso zzso although at levels apparently lower than those observed in zzso We conclude that expression of the zzso zzso is a consistent feature shared by all known forms of zzso zzso zzso
