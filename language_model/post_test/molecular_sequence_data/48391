zzso is one of the important zzso effective against bacterial blight disease of rice caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using natural population of zzso we analyzed the sequence variation in the functionally important zzso of zzso across the zzso zzso DNA sequences of zzso zzso from 27 rice zzso revealed higher zzso diversity among the reported zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed synonymous and zzso zzso in addition to a number of zzso in zzso regions of the zzso High sequence variation was observed in the promoter region including the zzso with zzso value zzso and zzso w zzso Comparative analysis of the identified zzso zzso with that of zzso and zzso indicated the operation of both positive selection zzso and neutral selection zzso The genetic distances of zzso of the gene from zzso zzso were zzso to zzso as compared to zzso We also found the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso box in the isolated zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was localized in the zzso domain for which the functional significance is yet to be zzso However, the absence of functional zzso box in all the zzso except zzso suggests the maintenance of single resistant zzso throughout the natural zzso
