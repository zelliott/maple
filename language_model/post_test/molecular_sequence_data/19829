The zzso zzso and folding of a membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to target zzso tissue in zzso including zzso zzso in tumors, zzso and inflammatory zzso In a mouse breast zzso model, zzso labeled zzso finds solid zzso tumors with high accuracy and accumulates in them even at a very early stage of tumor zzso The zzso signal is stable for zzso days and is approximately five times higher in tumors than in healthy counterpart zzso In a rat zzso arthritis model, zzso zzso accumulates in inflammatory zzso zzso also maps the zzso cortical zzso however, kidney zzso can be reduced significantly by providing mice with zzso drinking zzso The zzso has three zzso soluble in water, bound to the surface of a zzso and inserted across the membrane as an zzso At zzso zzso the equilibrium is toward water, which explains its low affinity for cells in healthy zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso shifts the equilibrium toward membrane zzso and tissue zzso The replacement of two key zzso zzso located in the zzso part of zzso by zzso or zzso led to the loss of zzso zzso into zzso of zzso red blood cells, and cancer cells in zzso as well as to the loss of specific zzso in zzso zzso zzso introduces a new method of zzso zzso and possibly treating zzso diseased tissue by using the selective zzso and folding of membrane zzso
