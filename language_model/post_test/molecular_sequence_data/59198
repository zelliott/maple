The function of the compound eye is dependent upon a zzso program that specifies different cell fates and directs the expression of zzso distinct zzso in different zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso gene that encodes a biologically active visual zzso that is expressed in a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso cell of an individual zzso is strictly coordinated with the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso files, which lack zzso zzso cells, the expression of the zzso protein in zzso cells is zzso providing evidence for a specific zzso signal between the zzso and zzso cells that is responsible for the paired expression of zzso zzso
