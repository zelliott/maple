We have recently described a zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which is expressed on virtually all zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso to zzso can inhibit zzso zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso zzso events normally observed after stimulation of T cells with an zzso to the zzso zzso complex or with the zzso zzso zzso Our previous studies did not reveal the molecular nature of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and protein sequencing demonstrate that zzso is identical to the zzso zzso a zzso for the zzso zzso which is also called zzso in humans, zzso in mice, and zzso in zzso The identity of zzso and zzso was independently confirmed in gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was selectively zzso with zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso clone but not with zzso zzso The results of the present report, together with our previous functional studies, may have implications for the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
