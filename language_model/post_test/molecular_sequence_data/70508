We have studied a zzso with three siblings with isolated zzso zzso caused by compound zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The disorder was transmitted as an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso loop 3 of the zzso was associated with a zzso in the third zzso domain of the zzso zzso that has never been described zzso This zzso zzso results in a complete loss of function, indicated by the lack of zzso zzso zzso 3 production by zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells after zzso zzso The two brothers had zzso and bilateral zzso and were referred for lack of zzso whereas their sister had primary zzso and a complete lack of zzso Their zzso zzso zzso were below the reference range, and their zzso zzso zzso patterns were zzso with a zzso frequency of small zzso or no apparent zzso zzso zzso zzso administration (10 zzso every 90 zzso for 40 zzso resulted in increased mean zzso without any significant changes in testosterone levels in the two brothers, whereas the zzso zzso profile of their sister remained zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso (20 zzso every 90 zzso for 24 zzso caused the sister to produce recognizable low zzso zzso zzso The zzso of free zzso significantly increased in all patients during the zzso zzso zzso Thus, these zzso patients are partially resistant to zzso zzso administration, suggesting that they should be treated with zzso to induce zzso or zzso rather than with zzso zzso
