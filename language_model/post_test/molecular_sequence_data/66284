Many viruses which cause disease including human zzso virus zzso and influenza are zzso by a membrane and infection of a host cell begins with joining or zzso of the viral and target cell zzso Fusion is zzso by viral proteins in the viral zzso For zzso and for the influenza virus, these fusion proteins contain an approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds to target cell zzso and plays a critical role in zzso For this study, the zzso fusion zzso zzso and influenza virus fusion zzso zzso were chemically zzso with uniform zzso zzso labeling over large zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained for the zzso fusion peptides and an zzso zzso zzso assignment was obtained for the labeled zzso in zzso and zzso The membrane used for the zzso sample had a zzso zzso and cholesterol composition comparable to that of host cells of the virus, and the zzso chemical shifts were more consistent with beta strand zzso than with zzso zzso The membrane used for the zzso sample did not contain cholesterol, and the chemical shifts of the dominant zzso were more consistent with zzso zzso than with beta strand zzso There were additional zzso in the zzso spectrum whose shifts were not consistent with zzso zzso An zzso zzso and zzso assignment was obtained in an zzso sample with more selective zzso and two shifts were identified for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These sets of two shifts may indicate two beta strand zzso such as parallel and zzso Although most zzso were obtained on a zzso T zzso one zzso correlation spectrum was obtained on a zzso T instrument and was better resolved than the comparable zzso T zzso More selective labeling and higher field may, therefore, be approaches to obtaining zzso assignments for zzso fusion zzso
