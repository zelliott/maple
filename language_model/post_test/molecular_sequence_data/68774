zzso is described for characterization of the zzso and zzso of zzso interchange reactions of the zzso bonds in the zzso zzso hormones zzso zzso and zzso and the related peptides zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso interchange reaction zzso are analyzed by zzso zzso liquid zzso The effect of zzso composition and pH on the zzso capacity factors for the native zzso and reduced zzso forms of each zzso was zzso In each case, the capacity factor decreases as the zzso content of the mobile phase zzso For each zzso zzso pair, the capacity factor is larger for the zzso form of the zzso indicating that the zzso side chains of the linear zzso are more accessible for interaction with the zzso stationary zzso To illustrate application of the methodology, rate and equilibrium zzso are reported for the zzso interchange reactions of zzso with zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to form two mixed zzso which in turn react with another zzso of zzso to give the zzso form of zzso zzso and zzso Rate and equilibrium zzso were determined for each step by analysis of reaction zzso by zzso The results are compared to rate and equilibrium zzso for reaction of zzso with oxidized zzso
