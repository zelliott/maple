The third zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in the four major stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was too unstable to be zzso from zzso zzso zzso Two genes zzso zzso were cloned and zzso the predicted zzso acid sequences differ only in five zzso zzso Since Southern blots suggested the presence of a single copy per zzso zzso the two genes found are probably zzso One of these zzso zzso a protein with zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as an active zzso zzso which was as unstable as the native zzso Modeling of the zzso zzso zzso using the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso as template suggested the lack of two out of five salt bridges proposed to strengthen zzso interactions in the active zzso zzso of these bridges by zzso zzso resulted in a more stable zzso zzso zzso zzso which was used to determine the kinetic zzso The zzso value for zzso zzso zzso was identical to the values reported for zzso from zzso but the zzso for zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than the value reported for the human zzso and closer to that for the zzso zzso zzso This suggests the possibility that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso under development as potential drugs against African zzso might also be successful for the chemotherapy of zzso zzso
