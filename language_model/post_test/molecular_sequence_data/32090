zzso of the zzso barrier of zzso zzso in older flowers, a phenomenon known as zzso or transient zzso has been described as an advantageous zzso assurance strategy that allows zzso after opportunities for zzso have been exhausted zzso zzso is quite prevalent as a mixed mating strategy in nature, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not zzso We had previously shown that zzso zzso exhibits cryptic natural variation for zzso which is uncovered by transformation of different zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes from its zzso sister species zzso zzso zzso Here, by using this transgenic zzso zzso model, we show that zzso is caused by a zzso zzso of zzso an zzso gene zzso a previously zzso zzso zzso and U zzso protein that regulates zzso transcript zzso This is the first gene underlying zzso to be identified and the first report in which cryptic natural variation unveiled by a zzso enabled the cloning of a gene for a complex zzso
