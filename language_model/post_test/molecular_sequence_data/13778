zzso characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by fast atom zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso is zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso of zzso zzso allowed identification of the zzso sugar and provided information on the zzso chain zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso provided even more structural information, and some of the useful daughter zzso appeared in the higher mass region than the precursor zzso to a lower zzso These zzso can be applied to the structural analyses of zzso with much larger molecular masses and higher zzso such as the zzso zzso
