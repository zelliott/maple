The zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso is a zzso agent with a well-known ability to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso and induce systemic resistance in zzso Even though a zzso response has been confirmed as a component of zzso by zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso and characterization of an zzso zzso by zzso zzso a small protein designated zzso zzso protein zzso zzso lacks toxic activity against plants and zzso Instead, native, zzso zzso triggers production of zzso oxygen species in zzso and zzso zzso rice, and cotton, and zzso the expression of zzso genes both locally and zzso in zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that zzso is expressed throughout zzso development under different zzso conditions and in the presence of a host zzso Using an zzso zzso system, we show that zzso expression and zzso of the protein is significantly higher in the presence of the zzso zzso of cotton zzso with zzso provided high levels of protection to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in the induction of resistance by zzso zzso through the zzso of plant defense zzso
