A zzso clone zzso a putative zzso carrier protein zzso zzso II zzso a key zzso in fatty acid zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso a woody oil zzso The isolated zzso clone of zzso contained a zzso open reading frame coding for zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of about zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso that has been proposed as the active site of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso clone had about zzso identity with the zzso from other zzso The transcript of zzso was detected in all zzso examined and increased during seed zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso could complement the fatty acid composition of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso under the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter in zzso resulted in decreasing zzso fatty acids and increasing zzso fatty acids in leaves and zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso could function in zzso fatty acids zzso in plant and may be useful in the genetic engineering of zzso zzso
