zzso atomic models of a zzso 5 S zzso zzso zzso 5 S zzso and of a zzso 5 S zzso zzso and zzso 5 S zzso from zzso zzso were built using computer zzso Both models integrate zzso constraints and experimental data on the accessibility of bases and zzso towards several zzso zzso The base sequence was first inserted on to three-dimensional structural fragments picked up in a specially devised zzso The fragments were modified and assembled zzso on an Evans & Sutherland zzso Modeling was zzso by zzso and energy zzso In spite of some uncertainty in the relative spatial orientation of the zzso the broad features of the models can be generalized and several conclusions can be zzso zzso both models adopt a distorted zzso structure, with zzso B and D not far from zzso zzso no zzso interactions exist between loop c and region d or loop zzso zzso the internal zzso in particular region zzso contain several zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to be more important for protein or zzso binding than for maintaining the zzso zzso The models are zzso by zzso experiments with zzso proteins and by the analysis of various zzso Such models help to clarify the zzso relationship of 5 S zzso and are useful for designing zzso zzso zzso
