The aim of this study was to identify potential zzso of zzso suitable for further development as novel zzso peptides using zzso display zzso The human zzso protein was immobilized as a target followed by incubation with a zzso zzso display random zzso zzso After one round of zzso and two rounds of zzso zzso screening at the third round of panning was performed to identify the highest affinity zzso zzso which had a specific binding activity to zzso in human prostate cancer cells were isolated and the DNA corresponding to the zzso were zzso to provide three consensus zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as other sequences that did not display zzso Two of the zzso sequences deduced from DNA sequencing of binding zzso zzso and zzso were labeled with zzso and shown to bind and zzso with zzso on human prostate cancer cells by zzso zzso The high stringency requirements yielded peptides with affinities zzso zzso or greater which are suitable starting points for affinity zzso While these values were less than anticipated, the high stringency did yield zzso sequences that apparently bound to different surfaces on zzso These zzso sequences could be the basis for further development of peptides for prostate cancer tumor imaging and zzso
