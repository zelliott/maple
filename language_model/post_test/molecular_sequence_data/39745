A zzso zzso containing the zzso genes of the zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by inverse zzso chain zzso zzso the entire zzso cluster was cloned and zzso It revealed that the zzso regions of the zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso are more tightly spaced than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence deduced from zzso was highly zzso that from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes were cloned in the expression zzso zzso resulting in zzso The zzso was detected from cell extract in zzso coli zzso containing zzso using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso
