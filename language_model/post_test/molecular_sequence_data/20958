The presence of four different zzso of zzso zzso hormones zzso and one zzso zzso zzso has been reported in zzso In the human zzso only zzso and zzso genes have been zzso The human zzso gene is composed of four zzso separated by three zzso Three zzso zzso or zzso genes have been zzso The well-established zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is composed of three zzso separated by two zzso In this study we investigated the expression of transcript forms of zzso in human benign zzso zzso zzso with reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using gene specific zzso Thirty-five human zzso specimens were obtained at zzso zzso human zzso collected at autopsy served as zzso zzso extraction and zzso with zzso zzso for zzso forward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out to determine the zzso expression for zzso transcript zzso The expected zzso products amplified with gene specific zzso were zzso zzso with 319 zzso zzso zzso with 309 zzso and zzso zzso with 219 zzso zzso products for zzso zzso were detected in 21 zzso and for zzso zzso in 5 of 35 zzso zzso zzso No zzso products for zzso zzso were zzso In conclusion, we detected zzso for zzso in human zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso gene may have more than two zzso zzso or zzso transcript forms of zzso Our findings support the merit of further investigation of the expression of zzso and its transcript forms in human zzso
