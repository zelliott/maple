We have reported that transgenic mice zzso rat zzso E shows marked reduction of plasma cholesterol and zzso levels due to the disappearance of zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated the metabolism of plasma zzso in transgenic zzso After intravenous injection, the rates of clearance of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso greater in transgenic mice than in controls, zzso Furthermore, clearance of zzso remnants estimated by oral zzso zzso test was markedly enhanced in transgenic zzso The zzso expression of LDL receptors by zzso analysis was similar in both zzso These data suggest that elimination of zzso containing zzso B was due to enhanced clearance of these zzso enriched with zzso E through zzso LDL zzso When fed a high cholesterol diet, controls showed twofold zzso of plasma cholesterol levels with marked increases in zzso and LDL cholesterol on gel zzso zzso In contrast, zzso transgenic mice showed resistance against these zzso High cholesterol feeding decreased the activity of zzso LDL receptors and had no effect on enhancement of zzso remnant clearance in transgenic zzso Thus, zzso of zzso E zzso metabolism of zzso containing zzso B presumably primarily via the LDL zzso zzso and possibly through an interaction with the zzso remnant zzso
