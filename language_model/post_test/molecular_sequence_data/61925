The species Human zzso B zzso in the family zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso B1 to zzso zzso 1 to 7, 9, 11 to 21, 24 to 27, and 29 to zzso and zzso 69 and zzso We have determined complete zzso sequences for the remaining 22 zzso zzso whose sequences were not represented in public databases and analyzed these in conjunction with previously available complete sequences in zzso Members of zzso were zzso relative to all other human zzso species in all regions of the zzso except in the zzso region zzso where they are known to cluster with members of zzso Within zzso zzso constructed from the structural zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso suggesting that zzso had zzso zzso plots and zzso analysis across the complete zzso identified multiple sites at which the zzso of a given zzso sequence zzso indicating potential zzso zzso These points are distributed in the zzso and throughout zzso and zzso but no sites with zzso zzso support were identified within the zzso Individual sequence comparisons and zzso analyses suggest that members of zzso have zzso with one another on multiple occasions, resulting in a complex mosaic of sequences derived from multiple parental viruses in the zzso regions of the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a common mechanism for zzso evolution and that zzso within the zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso has been observed only among members of the same zzso
