Among the several zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso promotes the majority of the adherence capability of the zzso to zzso cells and it is a major zzso factor in an zzso mouse infection zzso zzso targeting the zzso loop zzso adherence binding domain of the zzso protein should therefore provide an effective protection against initial colonization and infection with zzso To selectively elicit adherence blocking zzso the zzso zzso domain was chosen as zzso zzso for the construction of zzso protein and live zzso While synthetic zzso protein zzso provided some zzso protection, zzso proteins with zzso or zzso fused zzso zzso peptides did not zzso protective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the minor coat protein of zzso zzso or surface exposed regions of an outer membrane protein resulted in a display of the zzso on the surface of the zzso particles and bacterial cells zzso However, in zzso studies neither of these live vaccines were effective zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso combines several advantages of an effective zzso surface display zzso zzso zzso proteins with zzso insertions of a zzso zzso did not zzso significant zzso zzso whereas multiple tandem insertions of the same zzso increased the serum zzso response in mice a thousand zzso Multiple insertions of zzso peptides from different frequent zzso prototypes may be an interesting alternative for a zzso zzso zzso zzso
