A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from the stem of zzso zzso zzso collected from Yunnan province, zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso zzso comprised an evolutionary lineage within the zzso zzso The isolate clustered with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso W zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with which it shared zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, zzso However, zzso zzso demonstrated that strain zzso zzso was distinct from its closest zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso was zzso and the zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso evidence, the isolate represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso
