zzso are a group of proteins that are accumulated during environmental stress such as drought and low temperature or during late zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso from zzso kernel by an acid extraction method, removed the zzso acid groups from zzso zzso by zzso via treating the protein with zzso zzso and identified the sites of zzso by tandem mass zzso Our results showed that each of the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tract could be zzso The zzso procedure was shown to be essential for the detection and subsequent site mapping of the heavily zzso zzso by mass zzso We also found that protein zzso zzso could catalyze the zzso of the zzso protein in zzso and the level of zzso was comparable to that of the zzso isolated from zzso zzso Moreover, the in zzso zzso also occurred on the zzso zzso in the zzso tract region, suggesting that zzso might be involved in the zzso of the zzso track region in zzso kernel in zzso
