The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso purple zzso zzso zzso functions as the terminal electron zzso in its respiratory zzso The zzso zzso the reduction of highly oxidized zzso like zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso At a zzso zzso zzso two single electrons are transferred from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso generating zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso this zzso was isolated, cloned and zzso and its zzso location zzso It was shown by zzso and zzso data that zzso and zzso are identical zzso zzso zzso were derived from short zzso sequences and a 700 zzso zzso was amplified by zzso zzso subsequently cloned and zzso labeled to screen a prepared zzso DASH zzso Positive zzso clones were zzso into zzso and subsequently transformed into zzso coli to sequence the zzso zzso By an zzso protein zzso high yields (5 zzso zzso zzso with a specific activity of 30 zzso were zzso The molecular mass was zzso determined by zzso mass zzso zzso to be zzso Da and from the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso to be zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in space group zzso with unit cell dimensions of a zzso b zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso A zzso beyond zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure was solved by a combination of multiple zzso replacement zzso and molecular replacement zzso The atomic model was refined to an zzso of zzso for zzso independent zzso The zzso protein consists of four zzso with a zzso cavity that leads to the freely accessible zzso zzso zzso The sole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the single chain protein has the zzso zzso bound to the zzso group of only one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, two zzso zzso and the oxygen of a zzso side chain are bound to the zzso zzso
