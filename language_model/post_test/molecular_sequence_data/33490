The structures of the zzso zzso of two zzso of closely related but not identical zzso zzso zzso islands, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso zzso island with yet unknown function, zzso have been zzso Both zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the known proteins that bind their DNA targets by means of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso in zzso and zzso are longer than those in other zzso and the structured zzso N zzso is positioned zzso to the large zzso zzso These differences strongly support the proposal that the zzso of the zzso islands make up a distinct evolutionary branch of the zzso zzso that zzso a unique zzso zzso
