The zzso protection by zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is dependent on a 33 zzso acids zzso between zzso C and D of zzso which is probably may be due to the interaction of zzso with unknown zzso zzso In this study we used the zzso between zzso C and D of zzso as bait to screen a zzso cells zzso library constructed during zzso in a zzso zzso system and retrieved a clone that encodes zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso zzso beta type zzso which plays important roles in zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso These data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso is probably related to its interaction with zzso
