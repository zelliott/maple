zzso zzso Alpha zzso zzso is a member of the recently described zzso zzso of zzso zzso family that was isolated by interaction cloning with the zzso zzso G alpha zzso and was recently shown to be a zzso protein zzso In zzso cells zzso expressing zzso we found that zzso is zzso and faces the zzso because it was not released by sodium zzso treatment but was zzso by zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso and metabolically labeled with zzso two pools of zzso soluble and a zzso zzso zzso Since the N zzso of zzso contains a zzso string motif and zzso string proteins are heavily zzso we investigated the possibility that zzso zzso might be zzso We found that after labeling with zzso acid, the zzso pool but not the soluble pool was zzso In the zzso zzso system, zzso was found to interact specifically with members of the G alpha i zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and G alpha zzso but not with members of other G alpha zzso G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and G alpha zzso The C zzso of G alpha zzso is important for binding because a zzso zzso zzso and a point zzso of G alpha zzso showed significantly diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso with the activated zzso form of G alpha zzso which is in keeping with its GAP zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso GAP with a zzso string zzso This zzso present in zzso string proteins found on synaptic zzso pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests zzso possible involvement in membrane zzso
