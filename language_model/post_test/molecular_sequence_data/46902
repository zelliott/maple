zzso zzso C zzso is found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A region of protein sequence similarity exists between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The functional relevance of zzso and zzso of zzso both in this region, was tested with a panel of zzso at each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso although the specific activity decreased zzso and zzso was reduced zzso Thus an zzso zzso at zzso 81 is essential for zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso could be close to the zzso active zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso is significantly more potent than zzso the less bulky zzso This knowledge prompted us to test whether replacement of zzso with an zzso acid possessing a bulky zzso would zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed for that zzso zzso lacked zzso activity, while zzso zzso and zzso retained 33 to zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso and zzso zzso became resistant to zzso as predicted if the zzso zzso reacted with zzso in the zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso a bulky zzso that zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso We conclude that a bulky zzso (or zzso at position 80 of zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these observations place zzso and zzso at, or close to, the active site of zzso from zzso zzso
