zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso expressed on zzso is a major zzso for zzso and mediates zzso rolling on the zzso Here we show that human zzso interacts with zzso zzso a zzso zzso that attracts zzso T zzso A zzso soluble form of zzso zzso zzso bound zzso among several zzso zzso This interaction was zzso by zzso treatment of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso play a critical zzso In contrast, removal of either zzso or zzso by zzso treatment of zzso did not affect the zzso The binding of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso inhibitor was lower than that produced in normal zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso abolished the zzso further supporting the role of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso the zzso for zzso In addition, the expression of human zzso on zzso zzso cells resulted in reduced zzso to zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso in regulating zzso responses, in addition to its role as a zzso zzso
