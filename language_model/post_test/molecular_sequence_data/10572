zzso zzso such as zzso are one of the most potent zzso for zzso zzso The interaction of zzso peptides with their specific cell surface receptors has been studied extensively and used as a model system for the characterization of zzso signal zzso in zzso The cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from several species and the identification of zzso genes have allowed detailed studies of structural and functional aspects of the zzso Recent findings that the zzso is expressed in zzso cells and that zzso peptides can activate the zzso suggest potentially novel functions and the existence of additional zzso for this zzso
