Nuclear zzso is critical for animal cloning and stem cell creation through nuclear transfer, which requires extensive zzso of zzso architecture involving dramatic changes in zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of nuclear zzso it is critical to identify zzso factors specify the zzso zzso In this report, we have developed a zzso selection method, based on zzso zzso display and zzso zzso to isolate zzso factors expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells using primary mouse embryonic zzso zzso Seven zzso proteins have been isolated by this zzso We have also isolated several zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso Our method provides a powerful tool to rapidly and selectively identify zzso zzso The method can be used to study zzso modification of zzso during nuclear zzso cell zzso and zzso
