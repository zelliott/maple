The zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso represent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso In zzso the zzso complex has been previously shown to have a zzso effect on the zzso activities of the zzso zzso By using zzso zzso we found that, in cellular zzso the two zzso proteins from zzso do not form stable zzso zzso Only zzso B was found to associate zzso with the zzso zzso thus suggesting that the two zzso proteins are not functionally zzso The zzso zzso zzso complexes associate in an zzso manner and are stabilized upon zzso zzso The two zzso proteins were zzso in cellular extracts as zzso zzso zzso experiments and sequence analysis indicated that this process involved transcript zzso and dual zzso initiation zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso modifications and their zzso dynamics of zzso may constitute important zzso of zzso zzso
