zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene cause zzso clinical zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso B disease, the former being further classified into three zzso namely zzso juvenile and adult zzso and zzso zzso zzso were shown in these zzso We tried to zzso the bases of these diseases from a structural zzso We first constructed a three-dimensional structural model of human zzso by means of zzso zzso The human zzso consists of three zzso such as, a TIM barrel fold domain, which functions as a zzso domain, and two zzso zzso fold zzso We then constructed structural models of representative zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and predicted the structural change associated with each zzso by calculating the number of affected zzso determining the zzso zzso and the zzso surface area, and by color zzso The results show that there is a good correlation between the structural changes caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as well as zzso and clinical zzso in these representative zzso zzso structural study is useful for zzso the bases of these zzso
