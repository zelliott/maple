The zzso zzso machine is required for the zzso zzso and/or stabilization of more than 50 proteins directly related to zzso zzso zzso contains small zzso binding sites at both its zzso and zzso zzso however, limited structural and zzso data regarding the zzso binding site is zzso In this report, the small zzso binding site in the zzso zzso domain was revealed by zzso zzso and zzso labeling utilizing zzso The identified site was characterized by generation of a zzso model for zzso using the zzso open structure of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso into the generated zzso The resulting model for the zzso zzso of zzso bound to zzso is presented zzso
