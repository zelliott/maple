Nuclear extracts of cultured human cells contain multiple proteins that recognize specific sequence elements within the zzso control region of the human zzso human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso Here we report the zzso of host expression factor zzso zzso a zzso protein from human zzso that binds to each of the three zzso pair repeat zzso elements in the zzso long terminal repeats of zzso and the related virus, zzso zzso is composed of two zzso of 41 and 59 zzso We show that zzso is distinct from a second zzso present in zzso cells, that binds to overlapping sites in and near the zzso pair zzso This second protein is composed of a single zzso zzso and appears to be identical to the previously described zzso factor zzso A third zzso also distinct from zzso binds within the first zzso The present results suggest that there may be multiple modes of zzso promoter recognition involving distinct sets of cellular zzso
