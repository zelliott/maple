We undertook a zzso search for novel zzso zzso zzso in the malaria zzso zzso zzso We used the zzso program to predict structures in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that were zzso with at least one of seven other zzso zzso zzso zzso By using Northern zzso analysis for 76 zzso predictions and zzso analysis for the majority of candidates, we have verified the expression of 33 novel zzso transcripts including four members of a zzso family in the asexual blood zzso These transcripts represent novel structured zzso in zzso zzso and are not represented in any zzso zzso We provide supporting evidence for zzso selection acting on the zzso verified zzso by comparing the zzso zzso in the predicted zzso candidate structures in zzso zzso with the closely related zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso The high confirmation rate within a single zzso life cycle stage suggests that many more of the predictions may be expressed in other stages of the zzso life zzso
