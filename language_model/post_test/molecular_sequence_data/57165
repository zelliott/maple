Two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which replace zzso acid 17 with either zzso zzso or with zzso zzso were produced and zzso Both zzso displayed specific activities similar to the wild type zzso zzso was equivalent to the wild type zzso in all zzso zzso except that the zzso had slightly more zzso exposure of zzso zzso zzso with zzso suggest that the charge on zzso is not required for zzso stabilization, nor is its zzso required for the low pH structural transitions seen zzso In contrast, zzso was significantly different from the wild type zzso For example, zzso had zzso higher exposure of zzso surfaces in the zzso state; zzso considerably lower stability to zzso by zzso zzso easier exposure of organized zzso surfaces on initial zzso even though zzso to the final zzso state was the same as for the wild type; zzso the ability to zzso without assistants but with lower yields and somewhat slower zzso and zzso similar zzso to zzso and evidence of a new clip site closer to the zzso zzso However, zzso and the wild type zzso had very similar zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso had a very similar ability to suppress zzso zzso These results indicate that changes in the zzso sequence can have dramatic effects on the stability of zzso and on its ability to be zzso in the absence of zzso They further suggest that interactions with zzso do not rely exclusively on the detailed zzso at the zzso zzso A model that incorporates observations here includes zzso in which the zzso sequence folds onto the zzso domain late in the folding process after the protein had adopted a near native zzso
