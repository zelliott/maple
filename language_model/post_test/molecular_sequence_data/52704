The zzso family of zzso zzso factors regulates the expression of several genes by binding to a variety of related DNA zzso One of these zzso zzso regulates a zzso of these zzso We have shown previously that zzso binds to the zzso T zzso sequence zzso In that complex one zzso base specifically interacts with the preferred zzso half site and the other zzso binds zzso to the 3' half zzso 

Here we describe the crystal structures of two new zzso zzso One complex contains a zzso zzso T zzso DNA sequence taken from the zzso of the gene zzso zzso 8 zzso and the other contains the zzso zzso T zzso target DNA taken from the zzso of the gene zzso type zzso zzso As expected, the global positioning of the zzso on both DNA targets is roughly zzso however, the zzso patterns at the zzso zzso differ zzso One of the zzso zzso in complex with the zzso DNA binds to an extra base pair located immediately upstream of the zzso half zzso We also show that zzso binds to these targets with almost equal affinity and that different zzso have variable roles in binding different zzso zzso 

Taken together, these structures reveal that zzso exhibits the unique capability to specifically bind DNA targets of variable lengths from four to ten base zzso Also, the small protein segment zzso is at least partially responsible for flexibility in zzso zzso
