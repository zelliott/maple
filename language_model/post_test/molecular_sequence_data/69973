The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso related zzso zzso proteins and both are induced by zzso the stalk zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed throughout the zzso region of the zzso zzso but only later, at zzso do the zzso cells express the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is induced at the entrance to the stalk tube and we have identified two, apparently zzso promoter elements that control this zzso They act as zzso preventing zzso in the tip of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso They have a zzso consensus sequence zzso where zzso is in one case 2 and in the other 4 zzso Either element alone is able to repress zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso Introduction of a single zzso element into the promoter of the zzso gene changes its expression pattern to resemble that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is altered, cause repression during the zzso stage but allow premature zzso expression during zzso suggesting that the effective strength of the zzso signal may increase during zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells blocks both stalk cell maturation and zzso gene zzso We show that the block to gene expression zzso precisely with the presence of a functional zzso element and this is consistent with the notion that expression of the zzso gene is controlled by a zzso release from zzso zzso
