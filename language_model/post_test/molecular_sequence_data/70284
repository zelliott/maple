We have isolated a novel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso expression is neural specific and is detected as early as stage 11 1/2, making it one of the earliest markers of neural induction so far zzso Moreover, zzso expression within the neural plate is regionally zzso zzso bands of zzso zzso mark discrete positions along the zzso zzso while zzso bands mark a discrete position along the zzso zzso This latter site of zzso expression appears to zzso the prospective zzso zzso a boundary zone that later separates the functionally distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions of the spinal zzso In sandwich zzso lacking any underlying zzso zzso is expressed in zzso stripes located lateral to the zzso This provides the first indication that zzso or zzso zzso signals are sufficient to establish at least some aspects of zzso identity along the zzso axis of the neural zzso By contrast, the zzso stripes of zzso expression are not zzso suggesting that this aspect of zzso neural pattern is lost or delayed in the absence of vertically passed zzso The restricted zzso expression of zzso suggests that zzso patterning of the neural plate is an early event, and that this zzso can be achieved in the absence of inducing signals derived from underlying zzso
