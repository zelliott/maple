We have previously identified a discrete zzso zzso of the zzso type, named zzso as an abundant protein species in zzso zzso The molecular characterization of this protein is now zzso From all evidence zzso zzso zzso represents a new gene product, distinct from the known members of the zzso family A1 and zzso It is, instead, mostly related to a still hypothetical human protein of zzso type, as well as to the zzso zzso protein zzso
