zzso S is an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 388 was used to identify genes required for zzso S zzso Five zzso zzso zzso were isolated which exhibited an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso possessed insertions within a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is not zzso with the zzso S zzso zzso zzso 469 and 550 mapped to a region downstream of the zzso zzso which has been previously shown to contain a promoter region that is zzso regulated with zzso S zzso zzso sequence analysis of a zzso zzso region zzso the zzso 469 and 550 zzso identified 12 zzso open reading frames zzso Database searches indicated that the first ORF, zzso is zzso The other 11 zzso demonstrated high zzso to the zzso proteins of the zzso zzso type III export zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso strains indicated that zzso and zzso form an zzso To determine whether zzso was exported by a type III zzso derivatives consisting of internal deletions or lacking zzso or zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso nine zzso are required for zzso zzso Combined data from zzso zzso zzso and sequence analyses provide strong evidence that zzso zzso possesses a type III zzso apparatus which is required for the export of zzso S and potentially other zzso regulated zzso
