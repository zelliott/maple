zzso is the zzso of zzso a zzso sugar substitute commonly used in zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso at the zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso when the zzso zzso system zzso zzso is zzso However, it is completely negative in the reverse zzso zzso using zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso zzso In order to characterize the zzso induced by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of 24 induced zzso zzso and 16 spontaneous zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso About zzso of the zzso of ST clones zzso out of 24) were localized in the region between zzso 280 and 330 from the starting zzso zzso whereas no zzso of SP clones were found in that zzso The zzso identified in the region included transitions (three zzso zzso (four zzso a zzso and a zzso There were no other marked differences between ST and SP zzso zzso zzso were dominant over zzso and deletions zzso zzso 20 versus zzso SP zzso 16 versus zzso and base change zzso occurred more frequently at zzso pairs rather than at zzso pairs zzso zzso 15 versus zzso SP zzso 12 versus zzso The possibility that zzso zzso gives pause to DNA synthesis around zzso zzso thereby stimulating the duplication, deletion and zzso zzso in the defined region of the zzso gene is zzso
