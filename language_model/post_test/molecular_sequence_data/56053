zzso experiments have been performed on zzso factor 1 zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso To study this zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso strategy has been zzso Complete zzso assignments of all the zzso from the five aromatic zzso were determined by a modified standard zzso zzso The reduced contribution of spin diffusion upon the zzso zzso zzso for the selectively zzso zzso as opposed to the fully zzso zzso has allowed for the identification of the spin systems and of the long-range zzso contacts between zzso and zzso zzso in the protein core and between zzso and zzso zzso The latter suggests an interaction between the proposed zzso zzso arm and the zzso zzso of the paired zzso A previously proposed zzso structural model zzso zzso zzso Schneider, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 104, zzso has been modified using zzso calculations incorporating the zzso determined set of zzso zzso This new model has been analyzed with regard to the relative mobility and the relative zzso accessibility of the aromatic zzso which have been measured by the zzso zzso relaxation times of the aromatic zzso for the fully zzso protein and the relaxation time enhancements upon selective zzso zzso
