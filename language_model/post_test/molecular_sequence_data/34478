zzso maturation is often applied to improve the properties of zzso isolated from universal zzso libraries in zzso A synthetic human zzso zzso library was constructed in single zzso framework to enable rapid affinity maturation by updated zzso zzso The initial diversity was generated predominantly in the zzso domain combined with only 36 zzso domain zzso yielding 3 zzso zzso unique members in the zzso zzso After three rounds of panning the enriched zzso genes from the primary library selections against zzso were incorporated into a zzso circular zzso affinity maturation library containing 7 zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Several unique zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affinities against zzso were found after panning from the affinity maturation library, contrasted by only one zzso zzso clone with zzso zzso zzso among the clones panned from the primary universal zzso The presented zzso strategy provides a way to convey significant amount of functional zzso domain diversity to affinity maturation without zzso zzso leading to a diverse set of zzso with binding affinities in the low zzso zzso
