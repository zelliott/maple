The zzso zzso consists of at least four zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso each comprised of several zzso The zzso expression of the alpha 1, beta zzso gamma 2 and delta zzso was studied in the zzso inferior zzso nucleus by in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso appearance and distribution of zzso and zzso binding sites, alpha and beta zzso zzso respectively, were also studied zzso The beta 3 zzso was zzso expressed in each of the zzso of the inferior zzso The signal was strong at birth, increased throughout zzso week 1 and rapidly declined thereafter to low adult zzso A similar pattern of labeling was observed with zzso zzso levels of alpha 1 zzso zzso zzso signal and zzso binding sites were also present in the inferior olive at birth, decreasing zzso Low to moderate levels of beta 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 zzso zzso were present in zzso zzso throughout zzso development, while delta zzso were largely zzso It has been reported previously that, during the 2nd zzso week, the ratio of climbing fiber terminals to zzso cells is reduced from zzso as observed in zzso to the zzso relationship observed in the adult zzso zzso Our results raise the possibility that the zzso composition of the zzso zzso in inferior zzso zzso zzso changes during development, and that this process may be related to the elimination of multiple climbing fiber zzso of zzso zzso zzso
