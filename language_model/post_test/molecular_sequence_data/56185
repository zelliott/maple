The zzso zzso for zzso G immune complexes on natural killer zzso cells and zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso mediates cellular zzso through a zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso gamma zzso zzso results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and demonstrate a physical association of zzso with zzso gamma zzso in zzso from zzso cells obtained using zzso gamma zzso zzso or immune zzso Our studies show that the zzso chain, the signal zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso and of T cell zzso associates with zzso and, in zzso cells, is a zzso for this zzso Such direct association of zzso with the zzso zzso as confirmed by demonstrating the interaction in zzso cells zzso with zzso expressing zzso and zzso Our findings demonstrate both functional and physical association of zzso with zzso gamma zzso through direct interaction of the zzso with the zzso and/or the gamma signal zzso zzso of the zzso These data suggest a possible mechanism by which zzso via zzso gamma zzso zzso
