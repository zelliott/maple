We reported previously the cloning and sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene which encodes the essential zzso factor required for initiation of translation zzso zzso zzso Tucker, zzso Chiang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rabinowitz, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The location of the zzso border of the zzso zzso was investigated by using zzso plasmids carrying various DNA fragments from the region upstream of the zzso zzso The lethal effect of disruption of the zzso zzso unit could be suppressed when the integrated zzso introduced the zzso promoter upstream of the zzso zzso and zzso were selected in conditions of induction of zzso zzso Such an integrated zzso was used as a starting point to clone the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso extension mapping suggests that a single zzso zzso promoter controls zzso of the zzso zzso The sequence of a zzso region encompassing the zzso gene was zzso The zzso zzso is located immediately downstream of the zzso gene and comprises seven open reading zzso four of which appear to be the zzso of genes present in the same order in the zzso coli zzso zzso including zzso The striking similarity between the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the function of each gene pair is zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is 124 zzso shorter than its zzso coli counterpart, could play a role similar to its role in zzso zzso
