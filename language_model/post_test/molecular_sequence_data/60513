To identify regulators of the type zzso zzso II zzso zzso we investigated the interaction of cellular proteins with a fusion protein containing the rat zzso zzso zzso An approximately 20 zzso zzso protein zzso with the fusion protein in a zzso manner and was identified as zzso A control zzso with high affinity for zzso and a zzso corresponding to a membrane zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso to known zzso sequences were zzso and tested for zzso Using in zzso binding zzso combined with gel shift analysis, we demonstrated the formation of complexes between zzso and both zzso which were zzso and of zzso zzso zzso gels produced from these peptides also zzso zzso from cell zzso These results suggest a novel feedback regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso and identify the membrane zzso region of the zzso as a focal point for interactions important for zzso zzso zzso
