As part of the international project to sequence the zzso zzso zzso the DNA region located between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assigned to the zzso zzso In this paper, the cloning and sequencing of 176 zzso of DNA and the analysis of the sequence of the entire zzso zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso 273 putative coding sequences were zzso Although the complete zzso sequences of seven other organisms (five bacteria, one zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are available in public database, 65 genes from this region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins without significant similarities to other known protein zzso Among the 208 other zzso 115 have zzso in the currently known zzso zzso DNA sequences and the products of 178 genes were found to display similarities to protein sequences from public databases for which a function is zzso zzso of these genes shows a high proportion of them to be involved in the adaptation to various growth conditions zzso cell wall constituents, zzso and zzso zzso a small number of the genes are essential or zzso anabolic zzso
