zzso is the cellular zzso for zzso A avian zzso and zzso virus zzso The viral zzso function of zzso is determined by a zzso zzso motif called the zzso zzso Here we report the solution structure of the zzso module of zzso determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso module has a structure similar to those of other reported zzso zzso the zzso zzso adopts a different zzso The zzso module of zzso does not contain the signature zzso zzso observed in other zzso zzso and it is more flexible than other reported zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso provides zzso insights into how a simple viral zzso functions in zzso zzso The side chains of zzso and zzso of zzso which have been identified as viral contact zzso by zzso analysis, are zzso exposed, suggesting that they are directly involved in zzso zzso However, the side chain of zzso another potential viral contact zzso identified zzso is buried inside of the module and forms the zzso core with other zzso Thus zzso likely zzso the zzso structure but is not a viral interaction zzso In addition, we propose that the flexible zzso region of zzso plays an important role in determining specificity in the zzso zzso
