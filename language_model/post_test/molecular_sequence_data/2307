It is generally believed that the gag gene product of human zzso virus type 1 zzso is processed into several core proteins by a zzso zzso We used deletion zzso analysis to study the role of zzso zzso in the processing of core proteins and its requirement for viral zzso Several zzso zzso with deletions in the zzso gene were zzso A zzso cell line, zzso zzso with the zzso viral zzso was shown to produce zzso containing processed core zzso while zzso cells zzso with two zzso zzso could express only the core protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced infectious zzso both zzso expressing the zzso zzso also produced zzso and one of them still retained reverse zzso zzso However, the zzso viral particles were devoid of zzso zzso with a distinct central core and an zzso zzso zzso out from the plasma membrane of zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso that zzso either into zzso zzso or out from the plasma membrane of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso contained zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso plays a role not only in the maturation of the core proteins but also in the assembly of the virus and thus is required for viral zzso
