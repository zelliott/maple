To investigate the zzso regulation of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we fused the zzso zzso promoter, including zzso zzso of the zzso region, zzso 1, and most of zzso 1, to the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso When zzso into human cell lines, this zzso construct zzso zzso supported high level cat gene zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that the normal zzso zzso zzso start point zzso is zzso and zzso that zzso 1 is faithfully removed by zzso from the majority of primary zzso zzso A series of zzso containing deletions in the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso were prepared to define potential regulatory zzso zzso of these deletion plasmids revealed that a region between zzso zzso sequences zzso and zzso is absolutely required for cat zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso and deletion zzso into two human cell zzso line which does not produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one which produces high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify sequences that zzso influence the level of zzso in either cell zzso A putative zzso zzso responsive element or zzso recognition zzso zzso situated upstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was examined by zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso Additionally, the potential interaction of zzso and zzso proteins with the zzso zzso promoter was examined by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso expression zzso in zzso zzso Both of these treatments, which are known to enhance zzso of several genes containing zzso zzso failed to induce zzso zzso These data suggest that the putative zzso sequence in zzso zzso is unresponsive both to zzso zzso and to these particular zzso zzso factors of the zzso and zzso zzso
