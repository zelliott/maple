zzso is a zzso zzso protein of animal cells that zzso in zzso storing and expression of genetic zzso This protein displays high zzso and specific affinity for zzso and accompanies zzso during its entire zzso from synthesis to zzso In the nucleus, zzso regulates zzso zzso In the zzso it is responsible for the global and selective regulation of protein synthesis and for zzso life zzso This review is mostly focused on the role played by zzso in regulation of translation, and specifically, on possible mechanisms of its positive and negative zzso Evidence based on our recent results is provided for zzso acting as the major structural component of zzso and for its zzso together with zzso in formation of these zzso Also, we first present an overall detailed description of specific interaction between zzso and zzso
