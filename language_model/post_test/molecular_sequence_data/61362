Fast zzso zzso in the central nervous system is zzso through zzso acting on zzso zzso zzso However, zzso acting on zzso zzso receptors zzso can also exert an zzso zzso Here, we report by zzso and zzso to our knowledge, the first zzso zzso to be found in terminals of zzso in the zzso zzso group III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso and thus zzso functions as an zzso zzso of zzso by the group III zzso zzso zzso and zzso or by zzso itself, evokes a decrease in the zzso calcium zzso concentration zzso in isolated zzso This effect is blocked by the group III zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for other classes of zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso acid, or zzso zzso no effect on the zzso in isolated zzso The zzso of the zzso in zzso by zzso provides evidence for an zzso feedback loop at the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This negative feedback may be a mechanism for the fine adjustment of the zzso release of zzso from zzso and may serve as a safety device against zzso levels of release at this zzso zzso Such a mechanism may provide a model for feedback zzso in other parts of the central nervous zzso
