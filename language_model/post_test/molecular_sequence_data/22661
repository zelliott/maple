zzso A zzso is unique amongst zzso in being able to form zzso structures that may possess important functions in the pathology of specific zzso zzso also forms complexes with other plasma zzso the zzso serum zzso zzso complex zzso being zzso We have zzso this complex using a novel zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso is linked zzso to the zzso of zzso by a zzso bond between zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso binds to zzso receptors on zzso and zzso and elicits a respiratory burst that is comparable in magnitude to that of zzso zzso The solution arrangement of zzso was identified by X-ray scattering and zzso The radius of zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso is more extended in solution than zzso zzso of zzso zzso Its distance distribution function zzso showed two zzso that indicated a zzso solution structure similar to that for zzso and a maximum dimension of 25 zzso which is greater than that of 21 zzso for zzso zzso equilibrium showed that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso ratio of zzso which is greater than that of zzso for zzso The constrained zzso of the zzso structure using known structures for zzso and zzso generated zzso zzso zzso models of which 52 gave good scattering zzso The zzso structure was located at the base of the zzso zzso in zzso in an extended zzso Such a structure accounts for the functional activity of zzso and supports our previous zzso analysis of the zzso solution zzso The zzso complex may suggest the potential for creating a new class of targeted therapeutic zzso based on the zzso of zzso to carrier zzso
