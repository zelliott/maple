Recent experimental and theoretical studies in protein folding suggest that the rates and underlying mechanisms by which proteins attain the native state are largely determined by the zzso complexity of a specific fold rather than by the fine details of the zzso acid zzso However, such arguments are based upon the examination of a limited number of protein zzso To test this view, we sought to investigate whether proteins belonging to the zzso zzso display similar folding zzso To do so, we compared the zzso transitions of zzso zzso zzso with those of its close zzso zzso zzso and to those of the structurally related Ras binding domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that displays no apparent sequence zzso with the zzso family zzso As demonstrated for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 39, zzso we show that a two-state transition model with no burst phase intermediate can describe folding of both zzso and zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso all three proteins zzso at rates that are within 1 order of magnitude zzso zzso and 370 zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), zzso both zzso and zzso zzso display similar zzso zzso and zzso the folding free energy barriers of both zzso and zzso zzso display a similar temperature dependence and sensitivity to a stabilizing agent or to zzso of a structurally equivalent central core zzso These findings are consistent with the view that rates and mechanisms for protein folding depend mostly on the complexity of the native structure zzso rather than on the fine details of the zzso acid zzso
