An oval to zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso sample collected from a pink zzso zzso zzso was zzso and had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a and zzso of the zzso series were present as the major zzso zzso zzso zzso required zzso and zzso for zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso minor amounts of zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The major zzso was zzso and major polar lipids were zzso zzso and two unidentified zzso zzso zzso analysis on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso clustered with species of the zzso zzso in the class zzso zzso zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that strain zzso should be classified as a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
