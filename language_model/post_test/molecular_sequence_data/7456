Two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso One type zzso to the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso as published by zzso et zzso (1991) and another type encodes for a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso more zzso to the zzso beta zzso cloned from zzso Northern zzso analysis with zzso specific zzso showed that the zzso alpha zzso transcript of 2 zzso is more abundant than the zzso beta zzso of zzso zzso during zzso and in adult zzso Both transcripts are highly expressed in zzso and heart relative to the other adult zzso zzso The high expression levels of both zzso alpha and zzso beta transcripts in the zzso decrease during the first zzso embryonic zzso zzso of zzso expression starts at about the same time for both zzso during the zzso stage, but the zzso beta transcript shows only a moderate and transient increase and declines again during the zzso stage whereas expression of zzso alpha increases further during the same period until the onset of zzso
