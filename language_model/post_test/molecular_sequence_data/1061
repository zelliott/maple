zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso implicated in a variety of cellular functions such as zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report identification of an yet zzso zzso zzso in zzso complexes zzso from zzso zzso The transcripts were detected in all tested zzso except zzso A zzso zzso with apparently reduced zzso activity did not form filaments in the transient expression system using zzso zzso By Western zzso analysis using a specific zzso zzso was detected in various cell lines as well as brain zzso zzso complexes zzso from zzso brain with zzso and zzso zzso were found to contain different zzso zzso based on zzso analyses followed by zzso and Western zzso zzso study revealed cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso and zzso stress fibers in zzso cells and zzso cells, respectively, and their zzso distribution was dependent on the zzso structures with which the protein is zzso zzso partially zzso with stress fibers and zzso in zzso zzso
