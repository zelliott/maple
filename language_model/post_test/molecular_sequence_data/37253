In contrast to the high zzso in sequence data for zzso zzso methodology for genetically manipulating these strains is still at an early zzso This study aimed to develop a gene disruption system for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso were isolated by positive selection using zzso acid zzso and used as hosts for further transformation zzso We then attempted targeted disruption of the zzso locus in the host strain by zzso zzso as disruption of zzso was expected to result in zzso zzso an easily zzso zzso A disruption zzso harboring the zzso marker within zzso was constructed for zzso zzso The host cells were transformed with the zzso DNA using the zzso method, and several zzso could be selected based on genetic zzso zzso and zzso analyses of a zzso revealed the unique occurrence of targeted zzso as well as a zzso change of zzso from zzso to zzso caused by integration of the zzso zzso into the host zzso at zzso As with the circular zzso gene disruption with linear DNA was also possible when the zzso regions were relatively zzso Shortening these regions led to zzso zzso between the zzso marker in the zzso DNA and the zzso zzso on the host zzso In contrast, we could not obtain zzso zzso by zzso zzso using a zzso designed for zzso zzso The gene targeting system developed in this study provides a zzso tool in the research on zzso zzso and will open the way to a zzso genetic approach for the zzso of unknown gene function in these zzso
