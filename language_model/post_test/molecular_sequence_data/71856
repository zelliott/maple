Two zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso red zzso zzso zzso were zzso to apparent zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso had similar zzso properties such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular masses of the native zzso zzso as determined by size exclusion zzso The zzso size of the zzso zzso as determined by zzso was zzso for both zzso The zzso were not inhibited by zzso or affected by zzso or zzso zzso zzso that they belong to the class I group of zzso while other red algae are known to have one class I and one class II zzso inhibited by zzso zzso clones of the zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and zzso The gene for the zzso zzso contained a zzso untranslated leader zzso while the gene for the zzso zzso exhibited a transit sequence of 56 zzso zzso Both zzso showed about zzso zzso in the deduced zzso zzso A gene tree relates both zzso to the basis of early zzso class I zzso The zzso relationship to other zzso particularly to zzso class II zzso is zzso
