zzso zzso produces a zzso factor, protein A zzso that contains five zzso zzso zzso The interactions of zzso with the zzso region of zzso zzso can stimulate a large fraction of B cells, contributing to zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular basis for this activity, we have solved the crystal structure of the complex between domain D of zzso and the zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso to zzso zzso In the complex, zzso II and III of domain D interact with the variable region of the zzso heavy chain zzso through framework zzso without the involvement of the zzso regions implicated in zzso zzso The contact zzso are highly zzso in human zzso zzso but not in other zzso The contact zzso from domain D also are zzso among all zzso zzso zzso suggesting that each could bind in a similar zzso Features of this interaction parallel those reported for zzso zzso that are zzso for many T zzso The structural zzso between zzso zzso regions and the zzso zzso zzso regions zzso their comparison, and both types of interactions involve zzso zzso surface remote from the zzso binding zzso However, zzso zzso reportedly interact through hydrogen bonds with zzso zzso zzso backbone atoms in a primary zzso manner, whereas zzso relies on a zzso zzso binding with zzso side zzso suggesting that this common bacterial pathogen has adopted distinct molecular recognition strategies for affecting large sets of B and T zzso
