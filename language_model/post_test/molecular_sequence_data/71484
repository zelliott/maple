A zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso II zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated molecular zzso replaces the zzso copy zzso zzso was zzso With the exception of the zzso 12 zzso acid extension, which has a zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso zzso to its bacterial zzso zzso characterization of this zzso shows that it expresses the engineered gene correctly and is competent for zzso zzso Fluorescence analysis and oxygen evolution zzso in the presence of zzso zzso indicate that the observed zzso results from a zzso zzso rather than from the absence of function associated with zzso suggesting that the zzso protein is assembled into a functional zzso zzso of oxygen evolution by zzso belonging to different classes shows that the sensitivity of the zzso zzso is changed only towards zzso zzso This result indicates slight zzso modification of the zzso binding pocket of the D1 zzso caused by the bulky zzso protein in the zzso and also suggests close structural interaction of the D1 and zzso zzso in the zzso arrangement of zzso
