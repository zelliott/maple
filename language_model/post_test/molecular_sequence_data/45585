The entire zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso producer of zzso zzso and zzso It consists of zzso base pairs with an overall zzso G + C content of zzso Fifty-five potential open reading frames were identified and zzso using various zzso zzso zzso of functionally related putative genes were defined zzso zzso replication and zzso To verify the zzso of structural zzso they were resolved by zzso gel zzso and were submitted to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso proteins identified included the portal and major and minor tail zzso Based on the overall zzso sequence comparison, similarities with other known zzso zzso include primarily zzso from zzso zzso and some regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results support the theory that zzso zzso are mosaics with respect to each zzso
