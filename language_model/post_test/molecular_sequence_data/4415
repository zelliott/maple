The zzso drug zzso zzso needs to be converted into zzso acid zzso by the bacterial zzso zzso in order to show zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso is naturally resistant to zzso To investigate whether this natural resistance to zzso is due to inability of the zzso zzso zzso to convert zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned by using the zzso tuberculosis zzso gene as a zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso long, zzso a protein with a predicted size of about zzso zzso but Western zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso migrated as a 24 zzso band when expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that zzso zzso zzso has zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with the corresponding zzso from zzso tuberculosis and zzso coli, zzso Southern zzso analysis with the zzso zzso zzso gene as a probe showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have close zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not give significant zzso zzso Transformation with the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso tuberculosis complex organisms, indicating that the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso is not due to an ineffective zzso zzso but appears to be related to other factors such as transport of zzso
