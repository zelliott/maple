An active site, zzso zzso has been obtained in high yield from bovine serum zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance leads to the identification of X as zzso This result indicates that, contrary to previous proposals, zzso zzso is not the active site zzso in zzso copper zzso zzso Although zzso has been implicated in zzso the data presented suggest that this compound has a functional role at an zzso active zzso
