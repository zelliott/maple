zzso is the third leading infectious cause of death worldwide and is estimated to be responsible for approximately 2 million deaths a zzso While many infectious causes of zzso have been established, approximately zzso of all zzso cases are of unknown zzso In an effort to identify novel viruses that may be zzso agents of zzso we used high zzso mass sequencing to analyze stool samples collected from patients with acute zzso 

zzso with limited similarity to known zzso were detected in a stool sample collected in Australia from a child with acute zzso Using a combination of mass sequencing, zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the viral zzso was zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely related to, members of the zzso zzso We have tentatively named this novel virus zzso zzso We also detected zzso 1 by zzso in a zzso zzso collected from a patient in zzso Louis, United States as well as in zzso sewage collected in Barcelona, zzso 

zzso 1 is a previously zzso zzso that is globally widespread and present on at least three zzso Further investigations to determine whether zzso 1 is a human pathogen are zzso
