Recent use of zzso to improve the affinity of zzso zzso has made peptides an attractive alternative to small molecules and zzso Using this strategy, we have developed peptides with affinities comparable to zzso and zzso often better than small molecules or zzso These peptides can be used as a delivery vehicle for drugs or zzso especially in the case of tumor targeting zzso drugs or targeted zzso We describe here an zzso to identify an ideal pair of peptides suitable for zzso zzso
