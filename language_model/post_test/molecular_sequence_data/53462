The zzso response in zzso coli depends primarily on the transient increase in the cellular level of zzso zzso factor final zzso zzso by the zzso zzso which results from both enhanced synthesis and transient stabilization of normally unstable final zzso zzso synthesis of final zzso was previously shown to occur at the translation level by melting the zzso secondary structure formed within the zzso coding sequence of zzso including the translation initiation zzso The subsequent decrease in the final zzso level during the adaptation phase has been thought to involve both zzso of synthesis zzso and zzso of final zzso by the zzso zzso although direct evidence for zzso repression was zzso We now show that the zzso synthesis of final zzso does not shut off at the translation level by using a reporter system involving zzso zzso Furthermore, the apparent zzso was not observed when the synthesis rate was determined by a very short pulse labeling (15 zzso zzso of final zzso stability at 10 zzso after shift from 30 to 42 degrees C revealed more extreme instability zzso zzso than had previously been zzso Thus, the dynamic change in final zzso stability during the zzso response largely accounts for the apparent zzso of final zzso synthesis observed with a longer zzso These results suggest a mechanism for maintaining the intricate balance between the zzso zzso the zzso translation as determined primarily by ambient temperature and the turnover of final zzso as modulated by the zzso (and presumably zzso zzso zzso
