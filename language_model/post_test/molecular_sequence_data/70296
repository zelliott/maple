This paper is devoted to the comparative study of zzso of genetic texts of various organisms and zzso To determine the zzso of a zzso we have introduced the strict measure for that zzso The measure for a zzso zzso is the length of restriction of zzso Dictionary of a given genetic zzso zzso Dictionary is the zzso of all zzso belong to a given genetic text, accompanied by the zzso of their zzso The restriction length is defined as that one, for which all the zzso (of that zzso are zzso We have found, that genes of human viruses are less zzso in comparison to those of human zzso Other aspects of a comparative zzso investigations of the genes are zzso The problem of the determination of zzso zzso could be treated by this methodology, as well, as the evolution of zzso
