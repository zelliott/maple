zzso E zzso zzso play a fundamental role in allergic disease and are a target for therapeutic zzso zzso functions principally through two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso trigger mast cell or zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso leading to an inflammatory zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso on zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso is unique among zzso receptors in that it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the interaction of zzso with zzso is zzso calcium has been reported to increase the affinity for zzso but the structural basis for this activity has previously been zzso We have determined the crystal structures of the human zzso head domain of zzso in its zzso and zzso forms, as well as the crystal structure of the zzso head domain of zzso in complex with a zzso of zzso consisting of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together with zzso zzso the crystal structures of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we demonstrate that zzso binds at the principal and zzso zzso binding site in zzso zzso binding drives zzso at the base of an zzso loop zzso zzso from the trans to the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso change and ordering of zzso in the zzso These zzso structural changes in zzso lead to additional interactions with zzso a more zzso favorable interaction, and a zzso increase in affinity of a single head domain of zzso for zzso Taken together, these results suggest that binding of zzso brings an extra degree of zzso to zzso zzso
