Recently, a zzso zzso DNA virus named zzso virus zzso has been reported in association with zzso to G zzso as well as sporadic acute and chronic liver zzso A method was developed for the detection of zzso to zzso zzso by means of immune zzso and detection of zzso DNA by the zzso chain zzso The test serum was incubated with zzso recovered from feces of a carrier, and after zzso the formed immune complexes were zzso with goat zzso to human zzso zzso DNA was sought for by the zzso chain reaction in both zzso and zzso The detection of zzso DNA in the zzso but not in the zzso was considered to represent zzso in the test zzso Of the 44 healthy blood donors in Japan, zzso was detected in one of the six zzso with zzso DNA and 11 of the 38 zzso without zzso zzso In the two patients with zzso zzso to G zzso free zzso developed as they cleared zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso in serum, zzso by zzso zzso with goat zzso zzso and testing for zzso DNA, zzso while the patients had elevated zzso zzso zzso The determination of zzso would be useful for detecting resolved infection in surveys for exposure to zzso in the general population, and for establishing the mechanism of liver injury associated with zzso zzso
