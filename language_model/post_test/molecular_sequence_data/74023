Gill zzso cells of zzso crustaceans demonstrate net inward transport of sodium zzso possibly via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso channels working in series with the zzso zzso + zzso We have identified and zzso the zzso coding for a zzso zzso zzso starting with zzso isolated from zzso of the zzso green shore crab zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso includes an open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso A search of zzso revealed more than 20 zzso matches, all zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso transcribed from the cloned crab sequence substantially enhanced zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Analysis of crab tissue zzso zzso levels by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction revealed that zzso and anterior zzso of zzso zzso expressed this zzso the most zzso followed in decreasing order by skeletal muscle, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis suggested a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It is clear from this study that zzso zzso zzso vigorously transcribe a gene coding for a zzso zzso Whether these zzso also express a gene coding for an zzso zzso channel or zzso zzso remains to be zzso
