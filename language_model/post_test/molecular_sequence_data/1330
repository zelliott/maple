zzso zzso PG zzso E zzso is zzso expressed in various cells and can regulate zzso zzso immediate zzso zzso In the present study, we found that zzso underwent zzso zzso which was accelerated zzso after cell zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that a zzso protein zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso directly by and associated with zzso in zzso resulting in marked reduction of the K m for the zzso zzso In activated cells, zzso zzso occurred in parallel with increased zzso zzso activity and zzso production from zzso and zzso zzso acid, and these processes were facilitated by zzso zzso protein zzso a molecular zzso that formed a zzso complex with zzso and zzso Treatment of cells with zzso of zzso and zzso and with a zzso zzso attenuated the formation of the zzso complex and attendant zzso zzso and zzso zzso of either of two predicted zzso zzso sites on zzso zzso and zzso zzso its zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso was ameliorated by the zzso zzso protein zzso inhibitor zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results of the present study have provided the first evidence that the cellular function of this zzso zzso is under the control of a molecular zzso and its client protein zzso
