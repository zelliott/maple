zzso necrosis factor zzso is a zzso with a wide range of biological activities in inflammatory and zzso zzso These activities are zzso by specific cell surface receptors of 55 zzso and 75 zzso apparent molecular zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated using partial zzso acid sequence information and the zzso chain reaction zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso transfers specific zzso properties comparable to those of the native zzso The predicted zzso region contains four zzso with characteristic zzso zzso highly similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso the nerve growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso The consensus sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also has similarity to the zzso sequence motif zzso In marked contrast to the zzso regions, the zzso zzso of the two zzso receptors are entirely zzso suggesting different modes of signaling and zzso
