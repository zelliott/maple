The molecular composition of zzso outer and inner envelope zzso is fairly well established, but little is known about mechanisms and elements involved in import zzso After synthesis in the zzso zzso targeted precursor proteins are recognized by outer envelope receptors zzso and zzso zzso plays an important role in regulation of zzso activity and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have identified an zzso zzso outer envelope zzso which is able to selectively zzso zzso at a specific zzso A zzso outer envelope zzso zzso zzso was identified by the same zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas labeling of zzso remains zzso Both zzso do not zzso in zzso and are unable to zzso zzso basic protein as zzso We propose that distinct zzso are involved in regulation of zzso import via zzso of zzso zzso
