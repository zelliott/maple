Human zzso zzso virus type I zzso the cause of adult zzso zzso is also associated with the neurological disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso Tax, that trans activates viral and cellular gene zzso To understand the mechanisms for the production of zzso by zzso in nervous zzso we examined their expression in zzso cells which carried the zzso zzso We demonstrated that Tax expression enhanced the production by zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and transforming growth factor zzso zzso We suggest that the excessive production of zzso in nervous tissue may play a role in zzso of zzso zzso cells that carry the tax gene may provide a model useful for in zzso study of the mechanism of production of zzso in the nervous zzso
