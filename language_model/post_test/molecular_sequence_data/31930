In June zzso the first human zzso influenza virus infection was confirmed in zzso However, the origin and molecular characterization of this virus, zzso zzso have not been well studied thus zzso In the present report, we performed zzso and zzso analyses of this virus and compared its molecular zzso with other closely related zzso zzso characterization of zzso revealed that it is a typical avian influenza virus of low zzso which might not replicate and zzso well in the upper airway in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the virus clusters with zzso zzso in seven zzso except zzso For the zzso zzso zzso was clustered with a different zzso lineage from zzso zzso Although a previous study demonstrated that the zzso zzso and M genes of zzso might be derived from the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that these zzso viruses were derived from more recent strains than that of the zzso of zzso zzso we propose that zzso is a zzso from different zzso lineages circulating in chickens in zzso Furthermore, compared to avian zzso a single zzso zzso zzso substitution in the zzso zzso of the human isolate might increase the zzso zzso binding and, zzso this zzso zzso in zzso Overall, human infection with this virus seems an accidental event and is unlikely to cause an influenza zzso However, its zzso and potential zzso with other influenza zzso are still worthy of zzso
