The zzso zzso of plants encodes the zzso open reading frame zzso which has been used extensively as a zzso marker for zzso of zzso Here we examined the evolution of the zzso zzso itself as a model for group II zzso evolution in zzso Representative zzso zzso sequences were compiled from species spanning algae to zzso and four zzso were newly zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso of group II zzso zzso indicating that they were derived from a mobile group II zzso of the zzso zzso structures of the zzso were folded and zzso which revealed progressive zzso structural zzso and zzso throughout plant zzso The data support a model in which plant zzso group II zzso were derived from zzso zzso that had zzso zzso structures and were competent for zzso and mobility and that subsequently the zzso structures zzso to ultimately become dependent upon zzso zzso We propose that the patterns of zzso structure evolution seen for the zzso zzso will apply to the other group II zzso in zzso
