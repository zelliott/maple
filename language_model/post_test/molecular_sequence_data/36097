zzso is a new complex zzso toxin that was isolated from the zzso of the Australian zzso snake zzso zzso zzso It is composed of three different molecular entities: an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso of 16,000 and a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso linked by zzso bonds, at an approximate zzso of zzso The most active form of the complex was isolated by zzso exchange zzso through zzso followed by two steps of zzso zzso at pH zzso and pH zzso zzso At this stage the complex zzso as a single component in zzso gel zzso and is very toxic to mice (1 or 2 zzso of the complex protein kills a mouse of 20 g within 2 zzso It blocks the high threshold calcium channel current of excitable zzso in heart and does not affect the low threshold calcium channel zzso The block occurs at a site that is accessible zzso but not zzso The block is selective for calcium channels, zzso does not affect single channel zzso but only changes channel zzso and is zzso dependent with higher affinity for zzso zzso The zzso activity of the complex toxin can be separated by zzso using a zzso analog zzso The resulting complex contains only zzso and zzso inhibitor and is still capable of blocking calcium channels, although with less potency than the native zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso in the presence of high salt zzso zzso at alkaline pH zzso separates the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso but at this stage the resulting peptides lose zzso activity towards the calcium zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso inhibitor was determined by automatic zzso zzso The zzso zzso and two zzso displaying zzso activity were zzso at the zzso part of the zzso
