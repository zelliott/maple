zzso the zzso structure of a protein is an effective empirical route to probing three-dimensional structure and biological zzso Here we describe a zzso protein chemistry strategy for studying zzso relationships in zzso Our approach zzso zzso signature zzso involves functional selection from an array of zzso protein zzso prepared by total zzso coupled to a simple chemical zzso that zzso identifies the modified proteins in the resulting active and inactive zzso 

zzso signature analysis was used to study the interaction of the zzso zzso domain from the cellular zzso protein zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a functional selection zzso the qualitative effects of scanning a series of synthetic analog units through the zzso sequence of the zzso domain were zzso The analog units were designed to alter both zzso zzso and the zzso backbone within the zzso These chemical studies revealed that the zzso of zzso 150 in the zzso domain is essential for zzso binding and that changes in the structure of the zzso backbone can also result in loss of binding zzso 

These chemical studies have provided new insight into how zzso binding is related to the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso signature analysis is a powerful and zzso novel way of studying the molecular and chemical basis of protein zzso it combines the advantages of systematic modification of a zzso chemical structure with the practical convenience of zzso zzso
