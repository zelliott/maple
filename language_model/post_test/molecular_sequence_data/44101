zzso zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for the first step in the zzso repair zzso that specifically removes zzso from zzso Here we report the isolation of the zzso and zzso clones for the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso zzso to the major zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso The complete characterization of the zzso organization of the mouse zzso zzso gene shows that the entire zzso coding region for the zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene is contained in an zzso zzso zzso zzso which includes six zzso and five zzso The zzso encodes a predicted zzso zzso zzso protein of 295 zzso acids zzso zzso that is highly similar to a group of zzso that have been isolated from a wide variety of zzso The mouse zzso gene has been mapped to mouse zzso 5 using zzso in zzso zzso zzso
