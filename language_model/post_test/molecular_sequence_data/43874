zzso zzso zzso zzso biologically important zzso including zzso and plays a central role in the regulation of zzso level of these zzso Two distinct forms of zzso zzso A and zzso zzso were defined based on differences in zzso and inhibitor zzso We earlier reported that the region between about zzso 120 and 220 of rat zzso is responsible for determination of the zzso selectivity of zzso A and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ito, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the essential zzso acids in this region that participate in zzso recognition, a series of zzso zzso in which zzso acid zzso that are zzso among various species but are different between the two forms of the zzso were replaced with the corresponding zzso acids of the counterpart and were engineered from the zzso of rat liver zzso A and B, and affinities for several zzso were zzso A single zzso in which zzso in zzso A was zzso by the corresponding zzso of zzso in zzso B was sufficient to convert the zzso zzso zzso and the reverse was exactly the zzso zzso at this position was zzso with zzso for the zzso specificity and zzso was zzso with Val and Ala for the zzso Thus, aromatic and zzso zzso seem to contribute to render zzso selectivity of zzso A and zzso B, zzso
