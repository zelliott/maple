zzso nucleation in zzso requires zzso a highly zzso component of zzso zzso In zzso zzso there are two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the zzso and molecular characterization of the zzso zzso By Western zzso this protein can only be detected in zzso and zzso zzso against this zzso predominantly label the zzso in zzso from early zzso divisions until cycle 15, but fail to reveal any particular zzso of zzso in the developing egg zzso The loss of function of this gene results in female zzso and has no effect on viability or male zzso Early stages of zzso are unaffected by zzso in this zzso as judged both by zzso criteria and by zzso of reporter zzso but the female zzso zzso is extremely zzso Nuclear proliferation within the eggs laid by zzso females is also zzso We conclude that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is under strict zzso regulation and that the organization of the female zzso zzso requires zzso
