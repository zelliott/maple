We previously cloned a zzso that interacts with zzso II type 1 zzso zzso to exert an zzso function on zzso zzso signaling that we named zzso (for zzso zzso zzso In the present study we examined the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression using zzso zzso convoluted zzso zzso We found that serum zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso a response that required de zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso promoter region directs zzso and that a putative binding site of zzso zzso factors zzso is important for zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by small interference zzso showed that the zzso zzso factor zzso is involved in zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso also supported the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter in zzso zzso convoluted zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the expression of zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso convoluted and connecting zzso of the kidney in consecutive zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was decreased together with a zzso suppression of zzso expression in the affected kidney after 7 days of unilateral zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso plays a role in zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso
