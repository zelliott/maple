The zzso site zzso repeat zzso genes are the largest class of disease resistance genes in zzso However, our understanding of the evolution of zzso genes in zzso fruit crops is rather zzso We report an evolutionary study of 103 zzso genes isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso In all, 58 of the sequences contained a continuous open reading zzso zzso analysis classified the 58 zzso genes into nine zzso eight of which were zzso zzso This was taken to imply that most of the ancestors of these zzso genes evolved after the zzso zzso The motif pattern of the 58 zzso genes was consistent with their zzso zzso An extended zzso analysis, incorporating citrus zzso genes from the public database, classified 95 citrus zzso genes into six zzso half of which were zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that citrus zzso genes have been evolving zzso and that they are unstable when passed through an zzso zzso Of 32 zzso genes tracked by zzso zzso 24 showed segregation distortion among a set of 94 zzso zzso This study provides new insight into the evolution of zzso zzso genes and their zzso following an zzso zzso
