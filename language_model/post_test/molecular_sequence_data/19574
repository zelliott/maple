zzso are zzso which are restricted to sponges zzso zzso that mediate the zzso formation of zzso from zzso silicon zzso The zzso protein is zzso in the sponges in the zzso filaments which reside in the zzso canals of the zzso zzso In the present study zzso has been isolated from the freshwater sponge zzso zzso where it occurs in zzso with sizes of 23 zzso 24 zzso and 26 zzso Since the larger protein is zzso we zzso that it is a processed form of one of the smaller size zzso The zzso zzso are zzso modified by zzso at least four zzso exist with zzso of zzso of zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso zzso not only mediates zzso of zzso but also displays zzso activity which is specific for zzso L zzso thus zzso the high relationship of the zzso to zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso as well as the respective zzso were zzso It was found that the five zzso present in the sponge genes are highly zzso up to human zzso zzso This analysis has been completed by sequencing of two zzso genes (both for zzso and zzso and of zzso L from another zzso zzso zzso A comprehensive zzso analysis with these new sequences shed new light upon the evolution of zzso L and zzso families which occurred at the base of the zzso zzso It is concluded, that in parallel with the emergence of these zzso at first the number of zzso increased, especially in the coding region of the mature zzso Later in evolution the number of zzso decreased zzso We zzso that modification of the zzso zzso especially of its first zzso acid, is a suitable target for a chemical zzso of zzso function of the zzso zzso
