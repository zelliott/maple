Previously, a novel protein zzso zzso zzso has been identified in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A and zzso zzso zzso zzso substantial amounts of zzso upon infection of the human host, although the mechanism by which zzso is induced in zzso is zzso Since environmental signals could control the expression of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso was tested by Western zzso in the presence of normal pooled human serum zzso The level of zzso expression increased in the presence of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso medium similarly induced zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso to the concentration of iron in zzso zzso zzso we speculated that iron inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and free iron depletion may be one of the causes of zzso zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso from a zzso fusion gene decreased as iron concentration increased, but not as significantly as the zzso protein zzso It is concluded that the regulatory effect of iron on zzso expression is mainly at zzso zzso
