zzso that zzso of the protein zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso results in the cellular zzso that result in foot process zzso and zzso range zzso emphasizes the pivotal role that this protein plays in regulating zzso filter zzso This article reports the development of zzso necessary to study the biology of zzso in zzso and describes the initial characterization of the zzso zzso 

A zzso including the full-length mouse zzso open reading frame was cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso domain of mouse zzso was zzso 

zzso identified in mouse zzso extract was found to be a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 185 zzso As detected by indirect zzso zzso and zzso electron zzso zzso was located only in visceral zzso zzso cells, where it was targeted to zzso junctions of mature zzso foot zzso In developing zzso of newborn zzso zzso zzso to the earliest slit pore regions between zzso zzso sites where slit zzso first become zzso 

As a putative cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso likely zzso in zzso interactions between zzso foot processes and may represent a component of the slit zzso
