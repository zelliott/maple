A zzso zzso study was performed on seven zzso bacteria isolated from three zzso and alkaline lakes located in China, Kenya and zzso All strains were moderately zzso and zzso Gram positive, zzso zzso The DNA zzso content from the seven zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and their major fatty acid was zzso zzso zzso selected as representative strain of the zzso possesses zzso acid in the cell wall zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as the major polar zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that the zzso belonged to the zzso zzso The seven zzso shared zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and formed a branch that was distinct from the type strains of the recognized species of the zzso zzso They were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso values between the seven zzso were zzso According to the zzso zzso the strains represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
