The zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso is essential for their zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso can zzso the reduction potential of the zzso zzso bond of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The reduction potential is correlated with the acidity of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso As the zzso is zzso the zzso bond becomes more easy to zzso A change in zzso can account fully for a change in reduction potential in zzso zzso motifs of zzso but not of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso equation reveals that reduction potential contains both zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, the difference between the reduction zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be explained solely by differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso data for zzso zzso reveal no single factor that determines the zzso component of the reduction zzso In addition, the zzso component is complex when the zzso state of the zzso motif affects the zzso of zzso other than the zzso These intricacies enable zzso motifs to vary widely in their capacity to assist electron flow, and thereby zzso a family of zzso zzso that play diverse roles in zzso
