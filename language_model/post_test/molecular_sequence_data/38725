We developed a zzso physical map of a part of human zzso zzso where the natural killer gene complex zzso is zzso The zzso includes a cluster of genes with structure similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso that are expressed on the surface of most natural killer zzso cells and a subset of T zzso These killer cell zzso receptors zzso are involved in zzso target cell recognition, leading to zzso or zzso of zzso cell zzso We used a number of zzso site zzso markers from this region to screen two large insert bacterial artificial zzso zzso libraries and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The clones were assembled into zzso sets by zzso content zzso The zzso and zzso zzso covers nearly 2 zzso of DNA and provides an average marker resolution of 26 zzso We have precisely localized 17 zzso 5 expressed sequence zzso and 49 zzso within this zzso Of this total number of zzso 30 are newly developed by zzso zzso We established the order of the genes as zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso symbol zzso This map would facilitate the cloning of new zzso genes and the complete sequencing of this zzso
