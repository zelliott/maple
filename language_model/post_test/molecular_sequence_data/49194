A real-time zzso zzso was developed for the quantitative detection of zzso zzso in foods after enrichment zzso The specificity of the zzso for zzso zzso was demonstrated with a diverse range of zzso species, related organisms, and unrelated zzso The zzso had a linear range of zzso over six orders of zzso and the limit of detection was approximately 12 zzso zzso The zzso was used to detect zzso zzso in both naturally and artificially contaminated food zzso zzso foods, including raw poultry meat, zzso raw zzso and milk samples, were enriched in zzso zzso enrichment broth at 37 degrees C for 24 zzso followed by 42 degrees C for 24 zzso zzso cultures were zzso to zzso zzso zzso selective zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified with zzso zzso DNA was extracted from enrichment cultures with a rapid zzso method and used as the template in the real-time zzso zzso A total of 66 samples were positive for zzso zzso by either method, with 57 samples positive for zzso zzso by subculture to selective zzso medium and 63 samples positive in the real-time zzso zzso The results of both methods were zzso for 84 of the zzso The total time taken for detection from enrichment broth samples was approximately 3 h for the real-time zzso zzso with the results being available immediately at the end of zzso zzso compared to 48 h for subculture to selective zzso This zzso significantly reduces the total time taken for the detection of zzso zzso in foods and is an important model for other food-borne zzso
