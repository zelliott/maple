zzso transport by the zzso human zzso zzso transport protein may involve zzso zzso zzso To examine this possibility, zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to monitor the zzso of the total protein intrinsic zzso exhibited by the six protein zzso zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso and in the presence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso under various conditions, zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso indicating that the bulk of the zzso zzso population occurs in normally zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso decreased an average of zzso and zzso zzso zzso plots displayed decreased slopes in the presence of zzso confirming the relatively reduced zzso In contrast, zzso efficiency increased in the presence of zzso zzso zzso while addition of zzso B had no effect on zzso zzso The overall results are interpreted in terms of zzso movement of an initially zzso protein segment containing a zzso zzso into, or toward, the cellular zzso zzso of this segment, in effect, opens the zzso zzso zzso and zzso B would thus inhibit transport by mechanisms which block this zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses suggested that the region surrounding zzso is an optimal zzso zzso which, in response to zzso zzso could undergo the zzso deduced zzso domain zzso
