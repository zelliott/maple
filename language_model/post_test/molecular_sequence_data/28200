We describe the isolation and zzso of two novel genes of the zzso zzso zzso major that are related by zzso sequence zzso to zzso genes zzso 70 zzso heat shock zzso The zzso of neither gene is zzso but both are zzso throughout the zzso stage of the zzso life zzso A third gene shows differential expression between zzso and zzso zzso stages in the absence of any temperature zzso These genes are related by sequence zzso to the zzso zzso genes of zzso but are located on different, dispersed zzso within the zzso of zzso zzso The open reading frame for translation derived from one of these sequences contains a putative zzso signal zzso at its zzso
