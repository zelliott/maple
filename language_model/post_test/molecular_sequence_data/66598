We have examined the complexity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contains at least four zzso zzso The zzso proteins are similar to other zzso zzso zzso zzso in that they comprise a protein zzso domain with minimal zzso except that two of the proteins contain unusual zzso zzso The spatial and zzso expression patterns of the genes provide information about their presumed zzso zzso of zzso in leaves is zzso zzso and zzso indicating that it encodes the zzso zzso that is responsible for the zzso of leaf zzso during zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso is expressed in leaf bundle sheath cells, zzso in the zzso This suggests that a main function of the zzso gene product is to allow zzso to function zzso in bundle sheath cells in the dark without interfering with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all induced by exposure of tissue to zzso whereas zzso is zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso and zzso genes share the property that their expression is controlled by a rapidly turning over zzso zzso and expression data show that zzso contains zzso of zzso and zzso
