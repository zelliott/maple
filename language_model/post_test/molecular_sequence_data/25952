The zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso chain of collagen were carried out in zzso zzso All zzso assignments are based on two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is predominantly extended with a small proportion of the molecules existing in a type I beta zzso The four zzso involved in this turn are zzso which is stabilized by a C zzso zzso hydrogen zzso The zzso zzso is extended zzso A model is proposed involving zzso and zzso interactions between the extended zzso chain zzso and the adjacent segments of zzso A similar model is proposed for the zzso
