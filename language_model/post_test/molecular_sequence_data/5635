zzso binding zzso factors (Oct zzso play important roles in zzso of zzso of various genes but, in some cases, require zzso that interact with the DNA binding zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso screen with the zzso zzso domain as a bait identified zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be required for the assembly of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is functionally associated with the general zzso factor zzso zzso Further analyses showed that zzso interacts with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was also shown to interact with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is shown to enhance the ability of a zzso zzso H complex zzso zzso to zzso isolated zzso zzso intact zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso II, but not the originally defined zzso zzso zzso mapping indicates that the site zzso of a zzso zzso that zzso zzso binding to DNA is not zzso by zzso However, one zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso previously shown to be zzso suggesting that, in zzso zzso is able to zzso at least one site that is also zzso in zzso These results suggest zzso that interactions between zzso zzso and zzso can target zzso to Oct factors and result in their zzso zzso that zzso not only functions as a zzso assembly factor but also acts to alter the spectrum of zzso zzso and zzso that a zzso interaction may play a role in the recruitment of zzso to the zzso complex or in subsequent initiation and zzso zzso
