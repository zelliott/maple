The zzso major late zzso unit is an example of an alternatively spliced zzso in which a common zzso zzso site can be spliced to more than 15 different 3' zzso zzso Here we show that the specificity in 3' zzso site recognition changes during virus infection, such that 3' zzso sites with long zzso zzso tracts are zzso while 3' zzso sites with short zzso zzso zzso which bind zzso zzso are enhanced in zzso in late zzso nuclear zzso On the basis of these experiments, we discuss a mechanism that helps to explain how the complex pattern of major late zzso is produced late during virus zzso
