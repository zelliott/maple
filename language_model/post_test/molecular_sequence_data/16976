ITS sequence data were used to estimate the zzso of 24 Japanese zzso species and to make zzso observations on 19 of these zzso Two major zzso were identified in Japanese zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso one including all species of section zzso and zzso another zzso two zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis including both Japanese and North American species also shows strong support for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso in the species zzso zzso is the same as that of the zzso indicating that the relative zzso of zzso and zzso are useful characteristics for zzso Two major zzso were supported by zzso zzso All zzso of section zzso had very small zzso while sections zzso and zzso had large zzso The basic zzso number of sections zzso and zzso is thought to be zzso zzso evolution in the zzso zzso with diffuse zzso zzso may be caused by both zzso and zzso Our data suggest that a zzso zzso near the 3' end of the zzso gene is useful for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
