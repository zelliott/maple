Two strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated in zzso one from a Thai AIDS patient and the other from a Chinese zzso zzso The zzso relationship among the two zzso and reference strains of zzso zzso from other geographical populations was zzso Random amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis of the two zzso zzso strains showed that they had zzso band patterns similar to those of the reference Thai zzso and North American zzso although the patterns differed slightly from those of the reference zzso zzso of thirty geographically diverse zzso zzso zzso representing the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso sequences of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso We found that the ITS region contained sufficient information to resolve the zzso relationship among the zzso zzso An zzso zzso constructed from the ITS sequences showed that thirty strains of zzso zzso could be classified into eight geographic zzso Asia type zzso South America types A zzso and B zzso North American types 1 zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso types A zzso and B zzso and East Asia type zzso Based on the ITS region sequence analysis, the two strains isolated from the Thai and Chinese patients in Japan were found to be distinct from Asia type zzso in which eight Thai, one Chinese, one English and one Indonesian isolate were zzso Some extent of DNA zzso was observed between the North America type 1 zzso and the Thai and Chinese strains isolated in zzso We believe that the Thai and Chinese zzso were unique and propose a new zzso East Asia type zzso for the two zzso DNA sequence analysis of the ITS region provided useful information to understand the epidemiology and evolution of zzso zzso
