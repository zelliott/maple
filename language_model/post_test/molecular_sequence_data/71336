Human zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso protein that zzso predominantly in the zzso zzso It is thought to be involved in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso We report the crystal structure of zzso determined at zzso A zzso The structure reveals that zzso adopts a novel fold with seven consecutive zzso zzso flanked by one zzso and two zzso zzso Three zzso form a zzso zzso structure with an unusually zzso charge distribution on the zzso The implications of the structure on previously proposed functions of zzso are discussed and new specific functional properties are zzso
