The zzso unstable zzso zzso is caused by the zzso of at least 45 zzso of zzso zzso zzso clones spanning the two junctions of zzso sequences with insert sequences were isolated and zzso The long insert in the zzso zzso is bordered by Ds sequences on either zzso A 3 zzso double Ds structure which consists of one complete Ds element of approximately 2 zzso and one half Ds element of approximately 1 zzso was found in the zzso zzso at the junction between the 3' region of the zzso locus and the zzso At the junction between the zzso region of the zzso locus and the insert a half Ds element is zzso This truncated Ds element was probably left behind after the zzso of a 2 zzso Ds element from a 3 zzso double Ds structure similar to that found at the 3' zzso zzso analysis of the insert sequences beyond the Ds elements demonstrated that the long zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso originated from the same zzso zzso segment in their common zzso zzso One zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso In the zzso strain, which displays a normal zzso zzso a 2 zzso Ds element is present at the site of the 45 zzso insert in the zzso zzso This 2 zzso zzso which is located in the last but one intervening sequence of the zzso zzso does not inhibit expression of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
