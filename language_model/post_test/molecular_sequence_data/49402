The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso strains isolated from Portuguese adults and children presenting zzso zzso One hundred zzso strains were zzso 82 isolated from adult patients zzso with zzso zzso and 32 with active zzso zzso and 58 isolated from children (54 with zzso zzso and 4 with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was assessed by zzso chain zzso Overall, zzso zzso strains carrying more virulent zzso were much more prevalent in adults than in children, particularly the type I ( zzso and zzso and the zzso ( zzso zzso and zzso strains ( zzso A zzso of adults and children with zzso zzso was also zzso and differences in the prevalence of virulent zzso were observed, either for individual zzso ( zzso for zzso zzso for zzso or in combinations, zzso the type I zzso ( zzso and the zzso strains ( zzso There was no difference between the two populations in the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso Considering the cohort effect in the epidemiology of zzso zzso infection, these results suggest that different strains might circulate during different periods of time, or that, after infection in childhood, individual strains will undergo changes during the course of zzso
