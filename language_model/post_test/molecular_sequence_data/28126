To delineate the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I in the life cycle of the virus, we performed a detailed study of two zzso zzso with zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso of viral DNA and protein zzso during infection showed the zzso to be competent for DNA synthesis but deficient in late protein zzso confirming their defective late zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso translation of viral zzso and zzso zzso mapping of selected zzso demonstrated that the deficit in late protein synthesis stemmed from a zzso in the zzso zzso Intermediate and late gene expression appeared to be most zzso The zzso zzso was of unequal severity in the two zzso However, their zzso were indistinguishable and their respective zzso were mapped to the same 300 zzso at the zzso end of the zzso DNA sequence analysis assigned a single zzso and zzso acid change to one of the zzso
