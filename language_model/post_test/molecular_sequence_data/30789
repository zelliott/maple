The expression of the gene zzso the neuroendocrine peptides zzso zzso and zzso N is strictly dependent on simultaneous exposure to multiple zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels are zzso induced by combinations of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have used transient zzso zzso to delineate the rat zzso gene sequences necessary for this complex zzso Progressive deletions of the zzso zzso region revealed that sequences between zzso and zzso are sufficient to zzso the full spectrum of responses exhibited by the zzso gene to a reporter zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region indicates that it is composed of an array of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso response, and zzso response zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso site or each of two zzso response elements indicates that they are functionally zzso This array of response elements serves to integrate multiple environmental stimuli into a unified zzso zzso
