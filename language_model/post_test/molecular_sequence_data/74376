zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overlapping transcript zzso and zzso zzso overlapping zzso 1 zzso were cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso an zzso acid protein that includes almost all functionally important zzso zzso among zzso zzso such as three zzso type III zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain and a pair of repeated zzso zzso The zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso and zzso and moderately expressed in brain, eye, heart, zzso liver and zzso Both zzso and zzso genes zzso a zzso acid zzso Human zzso gene shares the first and second zzso with the zzso zzso and they are continuously located on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were located at different regions of the zzso However, both zzso regions showed zzso zzso with the human zzso around zzso gene on zzso zzso This result could mean that the zzso zzso around zzso and zzso genes are zzso zzso regions derived from zzso zzso early in the zzso lineage and the overlapping zzso and zzso genes were subsequently zzso
