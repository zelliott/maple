zzso of several zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso channel zzso causes zzso changes that lead to opening of the zzso It is not clear how zzso changes in zzso are coupled to channel zzso Here, we show that the loop connecting zzso and zzso at the base of the thumb region of zzso interacts with zzso to stabilize the channel in the closed zzso zzso of these two regions is important for optimum gating of the zzso In zzso when zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso they formed zzso bond in the closed zzso Breaking of the zzso bond by reducing agent zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the current zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the open state but not in zzso zzso state, suggesting zzso zzso movement of this zzso We also identified a salt bridge between highly zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso that is important for optimum zzso Based on our results and other published work, we propose that zzso binding in zzso is followed by the displacement of the zzso loop of the zzso leading to the rotation of zzso zzso movement zzso to zzso and the channel gate opens by the zzso movement of zzso and breaking of the salt bridge between zzso and zzso
