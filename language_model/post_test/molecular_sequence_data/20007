The zzso zzso proteins play regulatory roles in cell division, transcription, DNA repair, and protein zzso zzso zzso other zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso processed to maturity, zzso to targets by zzso zzso and subsequently recognized by specific downstream zzso containing a zzso motif zzso zzso and its zzso from the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by essential zzso Here we describe the zzso A resolution crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso portion of the zzso complex derived from the expression construct mimics an zzso and binds zzso in a manner resembling zzso binding to human zzso family zzso In the complex, zzso binds a surface zzso from zzso zzso zzso The structure implies that a single zzso of zzso cannot bind zzso to both the zzso binding site and the zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso However, formation of zzso complexes can occur, where a single zzso zzso linked to one zzso zzso zzso also binds zzso to another zzso of zzso zzso with other structures from the zzso zzso suggests that formation of the zzso zzso complex occurs mutually exclusively with many other zzso and zzso interactions in the zzso zzso By contrast, high-resolution insights into how zzso can also interact with downstream recognition zzso come from contacts with the zzso zzso Interestingly, the overall architecture of the zzso complex is zzso similar to recent structures from the zzso zzso The results imply that zzso zzso zzso complexes are zzso platforms, which function as parts of larger zzso involved in many protein zzso regulatory zzso
