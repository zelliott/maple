zzso DNA zzso is the first zzso family B DNA zzso reported to lack zzso recognition function and successfully zzso zzso zzso We have focused on two zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in the fingers zzso of zzso DNA zzso which were predicted to be located in the middle of the fingers zzso based on zzso acid sequence alignment of the zzso DNA zzso with structurally determined zzso DNA zzso Those two zzso were replaced by zzso zzso and the zzso properties of the zzso were zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso located in the middle of the fingers zzso affects the zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis has allowed us to enhance the protein function as well as understand the function of the zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso exhibited a roughly zzso enhanced zzso and extension rate compared to wild type, enabling more efficient zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso outperformed zzso DNA zzso with enhanced specificity and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso DNA zzso could be most effectively zzso in real-time zzso using zzso zzso without the risk of zzso zzso
