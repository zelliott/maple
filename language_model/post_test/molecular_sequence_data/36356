zzso computer models were developed for how zzso peptides may assemble in zzso to form two types of zzso zzso The models are based on experimental data and zzso zzso Initially, zzso zzso in a zzso zzso were arranged as zzso zzso to position zzso zzso of adjacent zzso in zzso The zzso were zzso to bind to the membrane with the zzso zzso sunken into the zzso layer and the zzso zzso spanning the zzso zzso This causes a thinning of the top zzso layer of the zzso A collection of the membrane bound zzso were then used to form the type I channel structure, with the pore formed by the zzso zzso zzso Type I channels were then assembled into a zzso lattice to explain the large number of peptides that bind to the zzso A concerted zzso change of a type I channel leads to the larger type II channel, in which the pore is formed by the zzso zzso By having the zzso move together, the zzso zzso are inserted into the zzso core without having to zzso the charged zzso It is also shown how this could bring zzso zzso into the pore zzso
