zzso marine zzso known as zzso can zzso zzso fatty acids zzso such as zzso acid zzso The zzso pathways of zzso in zzso are poorly zzso zzso In this study, we attempted to reveal the zzso involved in zzso synthesis in zzso Nine zzso strains representing 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used for zzso detection of the genes zzso zzso and zzso and for fatty acid zzso The zzso zzso were designed to amplify the zzso and zzso zzso and the partial sequences of the zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso and zzso These fragments were identical to those of known zzso and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso was detected in the strains belonging to the zzso zzso however, suggesting that this group likely zzso zzso not via the zzso zzso but via an alternate zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso The fatty acid profiles of zzso were consistent with the presence of genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, our findings suggest that two zzso pathways for zzso exist in these zzso
