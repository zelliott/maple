Using a zzso strategy, we have identified a novel cell surface zzso which interacts with the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1 zzso termed zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells zzso zzso The full-length zzso coding for a zzso of 290 zzso acids presents an zzso single zzso zzso domain, a zzso region and a zzso tail with five zzso zzso two of which are in the context of an zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso for three other zzso forms of zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned by reverse zzso zzso The gene zzso for zzso contains nine zzso is located on human zzso 17 zzso and is zzso to previously identified molecules termed zzso and zzso zzso northern zzso and zzso analysis with specific zzso zzso indicated that zzso is expressed on zzso zzso and zzso leukemia cell zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed the recruitment of zzso to zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso 205 is the main zzso site for this zzso Finally, zzso of zzso results in the zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
