zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso as a zzso To determine precisely the site of action of zzso zzso on the operator zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed on the zzso zzso operator and its zzso The results indicate that the zzso binds to the zzso operator as well as zzso operator sequence at zzso position or zzso position, and protects the zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso of the upper zzso and the zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso of the lower zzso with a few hypersensitive zzso This is consistent with previous speculation that the zzso operator is an approximately 40 zzso imperfect zzso DNA sequence capable of binding with two molecules of zzso zzso However, the protection pattern of the zzso operator which lacks half of the zzso structure is quite different from the corresponding region of the wild zzso Though two zzso zzso bound to the zzso operator, as revealed by parallel binding studies zzso zzso and Campbell (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only 12 to 13 zzso on the DNA sequence was protected, suggesting that one zzso of the zzso zzso is hanging near the DNA backbone of the zzso operator even though the zzso zzso is functioning as a zzso
