Different zzso zzso zzso zzso class II zzso zzso zzso to promote nuclear export, zzso zzso and zzso of gene zzso However, little is known about mechanisms operating in the opposite direction, which, possibly through zzso should promote class II zzso nuclear entry and subsequent gene zzso Here we show that zzso forms a complex with the zzso zzso C zzso A zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso binding studies demonstrate that the zzso of zzso interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and experiments using zzso acid or zzso interference have revealed that zzso controls zzso nuclear zzso Moreover, we identified zzso zzso as a putative zzso site important for zzso nuclear zzso The zzso zzso mimicking zzso of zzso zzso is defective in nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso partially zzso the zzso in zzso nuclear import observed in cells with zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso via the zzso of multiple zzso including the zzso binding sites and zzso zzso controls zzso nuclear zzso
