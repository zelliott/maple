zzso is a recently identified protein zzso by the fused locus in mice that is required for normal zzso axis zzso We have defined a zzso sequence in zzso that comprises the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction domain zzso In contrast to full-length zzso which has been shown to antagonize zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and activates zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso lacking key regulatory zzso such as the zzso domain, which is required for interaction with the zzso zzso coli zzso bind and inhibit zzso in zzso suggesting that these zzso are critical for proper regulation of zzso zzso We have identified a novel zzso domain in zzso and have shown that formation of an zzso regulatory complex in zzso is critical for axis formation and zzso zzso Based on these data, we propose that the zzso complex may directly regulate zzso zzso activity in zzso These observations also demonstrate that alternative zzso of zzso can mimic the effect of zzso in developing zzso zzso
