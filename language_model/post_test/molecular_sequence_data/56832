The de zzso construction of defined zzso from two DNA fragments of zzso virus zzso is zzso One zzso spans the region containing the origin of replication of the virus from base zzso to base 161, a region which is zzso during virus zzso The other fragment, of 142 zzso zzso to zzso is within the region coding for viral proteins zzso and zzso and serves for zzso Both fragments form zzso with similar efficiency when combined with zzso zzso as well as when exchanged with existing core zzso The zzso I zzso pattern and zzso III analysis both indicate that true zzso zzso are formed, and that a prolonged tail is not protruding from the zzso The efficient formation of a zzso core particle from the origin region of DNA implies that the absence of zzso from this region during viral infection is not prescribed by the specific base sequence of origin DNA, and is therefore likely to be determined by zzso nuclear factors associated with the zzso replication zzso
