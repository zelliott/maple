The zzso zzso of the cellular slime mold zzso zzso contains at least 18 gene copies coding for a zzso Using a combination of zzso genetic analysis and molecular biology techniques, 14 of the 18 individual members of this gene family could be assigned to particular linkage zzso According zzso this analysis four zzso genes are located on group I zzso zzso I, zzso two genes on group II zzso seven genes on either group III or VI zzso B, zzso zzso zzso M, zzso and one gene on group zzso zzso Eight of the zzso genes have been cloned and zzso All genes are identical in that part of the gene which zzso to the mature zzso thus representing true zzso members of this gene zzso Different members of this gene family can be distinguished from each other because they reside on restriction fragments of different lengths and because each gene contains unique zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, a certain degree of sequence conservation within these zzso regions is apparent for members of this gene zzso According to in zzso expression analyses of individual genes in zzso zzso all isolated zzso copies represent functional zzso zzso
