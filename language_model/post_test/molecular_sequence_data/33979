Two genes zzso zzso designated as zzso and zzso were cloned from a zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso and were successfully expressed in zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences zzso by zzso and zzso showed strong similarity with the sequence of zzso zzso family zzso zzso and western zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso were zzso into the culture medium and the zzso analysis confirmed that both zzso zzso had zzso zzso Several zzso properties of the two zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso showed optimal activity at pH zzso and zzso respectively, and at 50 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed good pH stability in the range of zzso and both zzso demonstrated good zzso ranging from 30 to zzso The zzso and zzso values using zzso cellulose zzso soluble zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso at optimal conditions were zzso The activities of the zzso on a variety of zzso zzso were investigated, and zzso can zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso whereas zzso can zzso all zzso except zzso
