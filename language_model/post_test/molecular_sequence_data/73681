zzso zzso covering three zzso defined groups of zzso zzso were successfully designed and zzso The specificity of each probe was examined by zzso to zzso from an assortment of zzso zzso zzso as well as additional zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso method was determined by using one of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso was extracted from a culture of zzso the probe was able to detect target cells at zzso as low as zzso zzso When zzso or more target zzso were added to cattle rumen samples, zzso zzso signals were obtained with 1,000 zzso of total zzso loaded onto the nylon zzso In contrast, the sensitivity was reduced to zzso target zzso at 100 zzso of zzso per zzso The zzso were used to type 19 novel zzso zzso The zzso placement was confirmed by partial zzso zzso gene zzso The use of the zzso in community-based studies indicated that the zzso groups examined in this paper did not represent a significant portion of the bacterial zzso zzso pool in the rumen of the zzso zzso and deer zzso
