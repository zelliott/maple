We have identified by protein sequencing the precursor of beta protein in newborn rat zzso A rabbit zzso was raised against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso 30 zzso zzso of the putative zzso protein precursor zzso et zzso zzso The zzso recognized multiple bands at zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso extract of newborn rat brain zzso The partially zzso zzso proteins were subjected to zzso zzso transferred onto a zzso zzso membrane and analyzed for the partial zzso zzso Each of the three major zzso zzso yielded the same zzso sequence of zzso zzso unidentified, zzso zzso assigned zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso of the putative zzso
