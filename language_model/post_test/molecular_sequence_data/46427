The zzso fusion gene which represents the most frequent genetic zzso in childhood zzso usually results from zzso zzso in zzso zzso 5 and zzso zzso 1 or zzso At the protein level, the zzso domain and zzso zzso central region of zzso are typically fused to almost entire zzso including zzso zzso 

We identified two ALL patients with zzso zzso within zzso zzso 4 resulting in zzso zzso fusion lacking the zzso zzso zzso central zzso This region was supposed to play an important role in zzso function, particularly in zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso We aimed at investigating the impact of the loss of this region on disease behavior and zzso zzso We compared clinical and biological zzso treatment response, and outcome of the zzso versus classical zzso cases, analyzed zzso wide gene expression profiles and performed reporter gene zzso 

No distinct differences between zzso and classical zzso cases were observed including gene expression profiling and detailed zzso By using reporter gene zzso we showed that the loss of the central region does not influence the zzso zzso zzso 

The deletion of the central region did not affect the zzso zzso we did not find any relevant differences in clinical and biological features when zzso versus classical zzso cases were zzso Thus, our data does not support hypothesis that the central region of zzso is indispensable for zzso driven zzso
