The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in timing the levels of zzso production in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso are part of a zzso zzso whose expression is induced during the stationary phase of zzso Here it is reported that zzso of the zzso zzso is positively regulated by zzso a zzso zzso zzso In an zzso zzso expression of the zzso genes loses its normal zzso and the zzso becomes deficient in zzso production, in a clear correlation with the zzso shown by a zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso induction in the zzso zzso was restored by zzso with a zzso copy of the zzso zzso showing a strict link between zzso and induction of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso indicated that zzso binds to specific sequences about zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso start zzso In the putative operator sequence three almost identical direct tandem repeats of seven zzso were identified where the central sequence is essential for zzso recognition and zzso zzso zzso of the divergent zzso and zzso promoters indicated that zzso does not regulate its own transcription, and that it binds to the operator region to control exclusively the zzso induction of the zzso zzso
