Members of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are dominant within the zzso component of the zzso and contribute significantly to global zzso zzso These organisms are known to be susceptible to infection by zzso zzso that zzso zzso and it is believed that zzso infection in the oceans has exerted selective pressures on the evolution of both zzso and host and continues to influence community zzso zzso of the processes of zzso interaction within the marine environment is zzso however, new insights have arisen from sequence analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to zzso zzso of the key zzso II reaction center core zzso D1 and zzso These reaction center zzso are known to be rapidly turned over in zzso cells in a repair cycle that helps to protect zzso zzso against zzso This finding suggests that zzso infecting marine zzso may play an active role in protecting their hosts against zzso thereby ensuring an energy supply for replication by preventing the deleterious effects on host cell integrity seen during acute zzso
