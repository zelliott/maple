zzso acid zzso editing can extend zzso and zzso diversity by changing the identity of a particular zzso zzso zzso as a result of zzso zzso zzso editing can alter highly zzso or zzso coding positions in zzso Interestingly, examples exist in which zzso editing sites in one species are fixed zzso as a G in a closely related zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso at the DNA level may be corrected by zzso zzso zzso editing, while in turn, the edited I zzso may be zzso into the zzso resulting in an zzso zzso We propose a model in which nuclear zzso zzso editing acts as an evolutionary intermediate of genetic zzso We not only provide information on the mechanism behind the evolutionary acquisition of an zzso zzso editing site but also demonstrate how to predict nuclear zzso editing sites by identifying positions where an zzso editing event would maintain the conservation of a protein relative to its zzso in other zzso We identified a novel edited site in the fourth zzso of the cacophony transcript coding calcium channel zzso and verified it zzso
