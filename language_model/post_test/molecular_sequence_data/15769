Following a protracted carrier state in the infected cell, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by inserting the zzso zzso into the host zzso The integration region in the zzso and the host zzso respectively, and the two junctions in the zzso zzso were isolated and their zzso sequence was zzso The zzso and host attachment sites shared an identical zzso zzso zzso Located on either side of each core were two unique arm zzso Each of the two zzso junctions contained an intact core flanked by a hybrid combination of zzso and host arm zzso A zzso symmetrical sequence arranged as zzso repeats with zzso spacing straddled the core zzso A zzso repeated zzso zzso was found zzso to the core in opposite orientation at the zzso attachment site, while an zzso form of this sequence was present in the host attachment zzso These sequence characteristics indicate that zzso zzso of zzso was accomplished by a zzso zzso mechanism similar to zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso the zzso and the host attachment sites in the zzso system contained a high G + C zzso bias (except for the core sequence zzso
