zzso the specificity of zzso carbohydrates interaction with zzso and receptors is important for the development of new zzso and zzso zzso This approach is, however, limited to the availability of natural and truncated sequences of the zzso and the sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso here is the synthesis of the cancer zzso zzso H zzso an zzso found on the cell surface of breast, zzso and zzso zzso and its truncated sequences by using the zzso zzso synthesis zzso The zzso were then arrayed zzso on glass slides with different density and used for the zzso binding analysis of two zzso zzso against zzso H and the serum from breast cancer patients, to define the specificity of these zzso It was shown that the terminal zzso binds the zzso zzso equally well as does the zzso and the zzso zzso is required for effective zzso The serum binds both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso without a significant difference, perhaps because of the zzso nature of the serum or the presence of diverse immune responses to different sugar zzso at various zzso This method requires very small amounts of materials and is more effective and sensitive than the traditional zzso method, and thus provides another platform to monitor the immune response to zzso zzso at different stages during zzso zzso or zzso
