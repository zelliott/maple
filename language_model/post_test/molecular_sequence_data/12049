zzso of zzso peptides by human zzso zzso class I molecules is dependent on zzso transport into the zzso zzso by the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso step is currently regarded as zzso for all peptides with zzso zzso capable of binding to zzso class I molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Howard, zzso zzso Butcher, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso In this report, we show that the human zzso selects peptides according to a binding motif based on the strong effects on zzso affinity of the three zzso positions and the zzso zzso TAP favors strongly zzso zzso in position 3 zzso and zzso or charged zzso in zzso whereas aromatic or zzso zzso in zzso as well as Pro in zzso and zzso have strong deleterious zzso zzso of naturally presented peptides by the zzso is suggested by their higher average affinity for zzso as compared to zzso zzso The TAP preferences in the three zzso positions zzso to those of the vast majority of human zzso zzso class I zzso but they represent an obstacle for zzso supply to some zzso zzso the zzso zzso We propose that peptides binding to these zzso and in general, peptides with TAP affinities below a certain zzso may be transported as extended zzso
