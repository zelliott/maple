zzso motifs are zzso interaction zzso that often bind to zzso zzso zzso The two zzso proteins characterized in skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso occur in the zzso complex, suggesting a role for zzso proteins in muscular zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso protein zzso a novel protein in skeletal muscle that contains an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels only in differentiated skeletal muscle, while an alternatively spliced form occurs at low levels in the zzso zzso is not a component of the zzso complex, but occurs in association with zzso at the Z lines of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso binds to the zzso motifs of zzso defining a new mode for zzso domain zzso Fine genetic mapping studies demonstrate that zzso occurs on zzso zzso near the zzso locus that is zzso in zzso muscular zzso
