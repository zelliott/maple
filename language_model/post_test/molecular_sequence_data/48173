zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso repeating zzso We previously identified and analyzed a zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso zzso consisting of 13 genes responsible for its zzso zzso Within this gene zzso we found a central region of genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso that showed similarity to zzso In this study, we investigated the sugar specificity of these zzso zzso zzso the first step in the zzso of the zzso repeating zzso It exhibits zzso activity and transfers zzso onto the zzso zzso The second step is fulfilled by zzso which transfers an zzso onto the first zzso The activity of zzso was determined by characterizing the zzso produced by an zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso This zzso consisted of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an approximately zzso ratio, thus suggesting that zzso codes for the branching zzso zzso probably codes for the zzso since it is the only zzso to which no gene has been assigned and it exhibits similarity to other zzso zzso shows the zzso features of zzso whereas zzso and zzso exhibit the primary structure of zzso belonging to zzso family 4, whose members are zzso in all major zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso
