zzso is a novel zzso protein which zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso In the present study, we report molecular zzso functional expression and characterization of the gene zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence suggested that zzso is zzso as a precursor with 31 extra zzso zzso acids including a putative signal zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso in addition to the 118 zzso zzso mature region with zzso zzso From the zzso zzso prepared from the producing zzso strain, a zzso zzso zzso the mature region of zzso was amplified and zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso by a single step on zzso zzso column zzso exhibited comparable specific activity as native zzso in the zzso zzso extension zzso The effect of zzso was blocked by zzso suggesting that zzso influx through the zzso zzso channels is essential for its zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis of zzso demonstrated that both zzso zzso bonds are essential for its biological zzso
