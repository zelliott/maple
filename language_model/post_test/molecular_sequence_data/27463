The first known cases of human infection with highly zzso avian influenza zzso H5N1 viruses in Vietnam occurred in late zzso However, zzso H5N1 and zzso avian influenza zzso zzso and zzso viruses were isolated from domestic waterfowl during zzso market zzso surveillance in Vietnam in 2001 and zzso To understand the possible role of these early viruses in the genesis of H5N1 strains infecting people, we performed sequencing and molecular zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso genes of two geese zzso H5N1 strains belonged to zzso 3, and their surface zzso and replication complex genes were most closely related zzso zzso to zzso zzso virus, detected zzso in southern China, whilst the M and zzso genes were derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene of the duck zzso H5N1 strain belonged to zzso 5 and acquired a gene constellation from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis further indicated that all eight gene segments of goose and duck zzso H5N1 and zzso zzso viruses were distinct from those of H5N1 zzso viruses known to have caused fatal human infections in Vietnam since late zzso The duck zzso zzso derived genes from zzso influenza zzso and their zzso zzso belonged to the Korean zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso virus had zzso at position zzso Based on the molecular characterization of specific zzso acid zzso in the surface and relevant internal zzso zzso the Vietnamese H5N1 and zzso virus zzso indicated specificity to avian cell surface zzso and zzso for currently licensed zzso A virus zzso Our findings suggest that the H5N1 and zzso viruses that circulated among geese and ducks in zzso in zzso Vietnam, during 2001 and 2003 were not the immediate ancestors of the zzso viruses associated with fatal human infections in zzso The zzso zzso H5N1 viruses were independently introduced into zzso
