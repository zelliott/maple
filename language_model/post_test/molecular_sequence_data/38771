This work was performed to clarify the differences in zzso zzso between multiple molecular mass forms of bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso After zzso of both bovine zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were successively zzso by zzso A affinity zzso and zzso on an zzso zzso Four zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from both zzso of bovine zzso and zzso On the other hand, a zzso zzso at zzso was only detected in hydrolysate of bovine zzso indicating that bovine zzso possessed five zzso zzso The zzso linked to zzso of bovine zzso was found to consist of zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso and zzso zzso analysis of this zzso on a normal phase column showed that zzso of several zzso were zzso These zzso changed to one major zzso consisting of only zzso and zzso on zzso zzso From these results, this zzso seemed to be of the complex type and possess zzso zzso
