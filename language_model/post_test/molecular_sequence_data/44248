Survival of zzso zzso within the infected host requires the zzso to actively maintain its protective zzso The components responsible for this maintenance are therefore attractive targets for zzso or zzso Here we report the molecular characterization of a zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity to zzso light chains and zzso associated zzso A zzso zzso the zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of 181 zzso acids and predicts an zzso point of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso with the highest concentration found in zzso Our data show that the zzso zzso specifically interacts with a zzso zzso zzso zzso light chain that we have previously described zzso zzso zzso and Strand, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso extract demonstrated that this zzso zzso light chain and the zzso zzso were present in a complex that zzso at zzso zzso zzso We have also shown by zzso zzso that a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso displays ideal characteristics of a potential vaccine candidate, including zzso expression in the zzso zzso significant divergence from zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso we are currently evaluating its zzso zzso
