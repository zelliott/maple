A protein that binds to a synthetic zzso of zzso has been zzso from zzso zzso tumor cells by a zzso affinity zzso The protein zzso has an apparent molecular mass of 70 zzso as zzso by zzso zzso A competition experiment revealed that zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso has a zzso The complementary zzso and the double stranded DNA did not show the zzso It is also confirmed by zzso zzso analysis that the zzso duplex takes a zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso This raises a possibility that the duplex forms two zzso zzso in zzso the zzso strand being bound to zzso zzso analysis of the resulting zzso strand by zzso zzso gel zzso demonstrated the presence of slower and faster migrated zzso in a neutral pH buffer containing 50 zzso zzso at 5 degrees zzso The ratio was dependent on the DNA zzso Both zzso disappeared in the absence of zzso This suggests that zzso can form zzso and zzso complexes by zzso zzso zzso The possible biological function of the zzso duplex and the zzso is zzso
