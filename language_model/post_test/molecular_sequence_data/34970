zzso in zzso and zzso processing frequently cause zzso in plant cell wall architecture, including changes in the structure of zzso which is the most abundant plant zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with an essential function during cellulose zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and contains eight potential zzso sites in its zzso zzso Here, we expressed zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso active protein in insect cells and analyzed its zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that all eight potential zzso sites are zzso Individual elimination of zzso zzso zzso sites did not abolish proper zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in considerably lower zzso zzso In contrast, production of zzso zzso in the presence of the class I zzso inhibitor zzso which abolished the conversion of zzso zzso into complex structures, did not affect the activity of the zzso To address zzso site occupancy and zzso composition of zzso under more natural conditions, we expressed a zzso zzso fusion protein in leaves of zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso carried zzso zzso zzso the six other zzso sites were modified with complex zzso Interestingly, the partially functional zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed only zzso structures when expressed in zzso zzso indicating its retention in the zzso zzso In zzso our data indicate that zzso of several zzso sites is important for zzso activity, whereas the structure of the attached zzso is not zzso
