A progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function, a decrease in beta cell mass and zzso of zzso zzso is characteristic of type 2 diabetes zzso The main constituent of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the ability of the zzso zzso to cleave zzso and prevent human zzso pancreatic beta cell zzso 

zzso and a zzso compromised zzso zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit human zzso zzso and human zzso pancreatic beta cell zzso zzso of human zzso by zzso was followed by zzso and the degradation products were identified by zzso 

zzso prevented zzso zzso by zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It also appears to prevent human zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso protected against beta cell zzso induced by zzso added or zzso produced human zzso 

The data presented support a potential therapeutic role for zzso in preventing type 2 diabetes zzso This study supports the hypothesis that zzso human zzso contributes to human zzso beta cell zzso Whether human zzso exerts its zzso effect through a totally zzso mechanism or through a cellular zzso mechanism is unclear at this zzso
