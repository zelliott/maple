Tight junctions are zzso localized structures that regulate the passage of small molecules and proteins through zzso regions of zzso or zzso zzso These structures are complex zzso zzso that contain both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of scaffolding proteins that contain multiple protein interaction zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and have been grouped into five discrete zzso based on zzso Little is known regarding the most recently described zzso of zzso termed zzso zzso with zzso domain zzso Here we show that two of the three known zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present in the tight junctions of cultured zzso zzso A broader examination of zzso expression in zzso shows that it is present in the tight junctions of all zzso cell types zzso Human zzso transcripts are alternatively spliced at three sites, and two forms are expressed only in zzso zzso predominantly in zzso The major form that is expressed in cultured colon zzso zzso cells, as well as several zzso zzso contains an extended zzso zzso zzso potential nuclear targeting zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that they form a zzso complex that is incorporated into the tight junction upon zzso Finally, all of the alternatively spliced forms of zzso show tight junction zzso and this zzso occurs in the absence of the zzso zzso and WW zzso as well as the extended zzso zzso
