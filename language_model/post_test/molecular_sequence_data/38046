zzso zzso transfer proteins zzso have important roles in zzso zzso as well as in membrane zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso have been cloned from zzso cells, which are unrelated in sequence to zzso zzso (the product of the zzso zzso However, all three zzso can perform zzso to zzso function in zzso zzso We have now zzso the major zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and cloned the zzso This zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso and zzso We have also cloned a second gene zzso related in sequence to zzso In addition, an independently cloned zzso encodes a relative of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were all able to mediate the transfer of zzso from one membrane compartment to zzso they thus exhibited the hallmark of zzso zzso all three zzso were able to rescue zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, indicating that all three zzso were capable of stimulating zzso zzso The identification of zzso related to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a single zzso will provide a unique opportunity to examine the functions of this class of protein with genetic zzso
