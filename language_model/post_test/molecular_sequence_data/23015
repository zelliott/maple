Although zzso play important roles in the cell and zzso zzso little is known about zzso transport across the zzso zzso Using a zzso approach specifically targeted to the zzso zzso zzso we have identified zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly expressed in green zzso and we validated its zzso envelope zzso zzso expression experiments demonstrated that zzso is involved in copper zzso and that deletion of its zzso zzso partially affects the metal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed a lower zzso copper content and a diminution of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso No effect was observed on the zzso content in these zzso The zzso zzso zzso grew like zzso plants in standard condition but presented a zzso zzso under high zzso Finally, direct zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso zzso envelope zzso showed that the zzso activity of zzso is specifically zzso by zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso offers an additional way to the previously characterized zzso envelope zzso zzso to import copper in the zzso
