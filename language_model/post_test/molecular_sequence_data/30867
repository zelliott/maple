We have expressed the zzso acid zzso domain of the Alzheimer's zzso precursor protein zzso as a bacterial fusion zzso The zzso zzso properties of the zzso fusion zzso zzso were virtually identical in all respects tested to those of zzso zzso zzso Both proteins strongly inhibited pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and less well zzso growth zzso protein zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and 6 zzso and the zzso of nerve growth factor zzso zzso 8 and 9 zzso Neither protein appreciably inhibited plasma and pancreatic zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The remarkable similarity of the zzso zzso profile of zzso to that of zzso zzso suggests that proper zzso zzso bond formation has occurred in the bacterial fusion protein and leads to the conclusion that the zzso precursor protein zzso domain is a relatively specific inhibitor of only a few zzso zzso zzso
