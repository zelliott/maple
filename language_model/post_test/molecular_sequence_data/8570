DNA sequences of the reverse zzso gene of long terminal repeat zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and cloned from the zzso of sugar beet zzso zzso Both zzso types are highly amplified in sugar beet and may account for zzso of the zzso The zzso family, representing the first zzso zzso reported from a zzso species, shows zzso to the zzso zzso family of long zzso repeated sequences zzso and to zzso elements from zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso family are zzso to the zzso class of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso families are characterized by sequence zzso and are probably zzso The deduced zzso sequences were used to investigate the relation to other zzso from plants, insects and zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso was used to investigate the physical distribution and revealed that both zzso families are present on all sugar beet zzso and largely excluded from zzso regions zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso family is organized in discrete zzso while the zzso family of zzso zzso shows a more uniform distribution along zzso arms and is absent from some zzso zzso These contrasting zzso emphasize the differences in evolutionary amplification and zzso mechanisms between the two types of zzso The in zzso results of both elements reflect significant features of a higher order structure of the zzso as it is known for both short zzso repeated sequences zzso and zzso in zzso
