This report describes the cloning and characterization of a plant zzso coding for a protein which shows high zzso acid sequence similarity with zzso whose gene is associated with zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complete zzso were isolated, and the expression pattern of zzso was examined using zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso A single zzso protein was detected in various plant species and in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using tobacco leaves revealed zzso in a zzso zzso zzso conservation of zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso suggests a similar function in plants, zzso and zzso
