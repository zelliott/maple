A zzso model for zzso zzso of zzso zzso was developed to study selective gene transfer into tumor cells and to establish a reliable means of determining the rate of tumor cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was created in which the zzso coli zzso gene served as a marker for gene expression from the integrated zzso This zzso exhibited a high rate of zzso in zzso mouse zzso cells in zzso The zzso zzso was injected directly into the zzso magna of the zzso zzso of zzso showed that the rate of gene integration was high in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the possibility of zzso gene therapy for zzso dissemination of zzso zzso
