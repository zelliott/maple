zzso also known as human zzso growth factor 1 zzso contains a 40 zzso acid region with some similarity to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso However, sequence zzso is largely restricted to the classical zzso motif with only limited similarities in other zzso zzso differences to human zzso include the absence of all seven zzso between the two zzso zzso and a zzso shorter loop between the third and fourth zzso We examine the hypothesis that, in spite of these differences, zzso can adopt the characteristic zzso zzso zzso 5-6 zzso bond zzso A comparative structural model of the growth factor zzso was constructed on the basis of its similarity to zzso transforming growth factor alpha zzso and the zzso domain of human zzso factor zzso The predicted zzso bridges and zzso zzso were analyzed and appear viable in the modeled zzso Moreover, to ascertain the importance of zzso arrangement for zzso zzso two zzso peptides were zzso and then zzso using either a simple zzso or a controlled sequential zzso zzso The zzso peptides were tested for their ability to stimulate zzso activity, for zzso of zzso zzso and for zzso zzso in zzso 453 human zzso zzso cells and zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso Data suggest that zzso does adopt the zzso zzso 5-6 zzso pattern and thus forms the classical zzso fold in spite of the significant deletions within the folding zzso The predicted structure of zzso shows some of the characteristics of both the zzso and zzso growth zzso
