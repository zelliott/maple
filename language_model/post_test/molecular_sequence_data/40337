The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso constitutes the zzso core of the zzso zzso complex responsible for zzso critical signaling zzso during development and for the production of zzso peptides zzso implicated in Alzheimer's zzso The only other known zzso zzso zzso zzso are the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso outside zzso has not been zzso Here we report the existence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

We have employed in zzso activity zzso to show that zzso a zzso membrane protein from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso bearing the signature zzso and zzso zzso motifs of zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis showed zzso could cleave model zzso zzso zzso at several sites within their zzso zzso zzso zzso could also cleave zzso derived from the zzso precursor protein zzso without the need of protein zzso as required by zzso Two distinct zzso sites within the zzso domain of zzso could be identified, one of which coincided with zzso the zzso site processed by zzso Finally, an established zzso and zzso zzso analog inhibitor could inhibit zzso 

Our findings suggest that a primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso can zzso key zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso promises to be a more zzso simpler system for in depth structural and zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso
