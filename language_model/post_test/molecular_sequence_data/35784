The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system recognize the target sequence zzso The genes of the zzso zzso system have been cloned and zzso and their products have been characterized following zzso and zzso The gene of the zzso DNA zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso The gene of the restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso target site, thus representing the first zzso zzso identified in zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso between the A zzso and the 3' terminal G of the target zzso Both zzso of the zzso zzso system are, therefore, functionally identical with those of the zzso zzso system, zzso by the Gram negative species zzso zzso This functional zzso zzso with a pronounced similarity of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and restriction zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Since the genes are also very similar zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso systems apparently have a common evolutionary zzso In spite of the sequence conservation the gene organization is zzso different in the two zzso zzso While the genes of the zzso zzso system are separated and transcribed zzso the genes of the zzso zzso system are transcribed in the same direction, with the 3' end of the M gene overlapping the zzso end of the R gene by 17 zzso
