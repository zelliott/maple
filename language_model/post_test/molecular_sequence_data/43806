The zzso clones of Sat gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso in plants, were isolated from the zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The determination of zzso sequence of zzso zzso pair zzso length revealed the presence of two zzso of 1939 zzso zzso and 515 zzso length in the zzso The zzso start point was determined by primer extension zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of the Sat gene and a couple of additional related sequences in the zzso of zzso zzso The expression of Sat was analyzed in zzso plants growth under zzso and/or zzso conditions and in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso Only slight zzso zzso zzso of Sat gene expression was observed upon sulfur zzso for 48 zzso Interestingly, the addition of zzso which is a precursor of zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso enhanced the expression of Sat by zzso zzso
