zzso zzso constitute one of the most abundant classes of repetitive elements in zzso zzso In this paper, we present a new zzso for detection of full-length zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso identifies regions in a zzso sequence that show structural characteristics of zzso zzso Three key components distinguish our zzso from that of current software - zzso a novel method that zzso the entire zzso sequence in linear time and produces high quality pairs of zzso candidates in running time that is constant per pair, zzso a thorough zzso evaluation of candidate pairs to ensure high quality zzso and zzso a robust zzso set encompassing both structural constraints and quality controls providing users with a high degree of zzso zzso of both our serial and parallel zzso of the zzso against the zzso zzso indicates both superior quality and performance results when compared to existing zzso
