The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c and d of zzso zzso was found to be positively regulated at zzso level by a zzso protein produced by the previously zzso zzso Region 1 on the zzso zzso B of the 230 zzso invasion zzso The gene zzso zzso was identified and its zzso sequence zzso No zzso b or c was produced in the absence of an intact zzso gene although lower levels of d were zzso The previously reported regulatory activity of the zzso gene some 30 zzso distance away was shown to act exclusively through zzso In contrast, the zzso of the zzso gene necessary for zzso spread occurred directly by zzso without the requirement for zzso This study thus ascribes a critical function to a previously zzso but functionally zzso zzso locus on the large invasion zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene appears to have a central role in zzso of the 230 zzso zzso zzso zzso
