zzso the zzso zzso anchor signal sequence of neural cell zzso zzso zzso for the signal sequence of zzso zzso zzso generates a mature protein with zzso external zzso but zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that this resulted from the presence of a functional specificity signal within this sequence and generated zzso zzso to identify this zzso zzso the zzso zzso 6-10 zzso acids downstream of the zzso anchor addition site with the corresponding zzso zzso resulted in zzso proteins lacking the zzso biological functions of zzso zzso and differentiation zzso zzso this region from zzso into zzso in conjunction with the upstream zzso zzso was sufficient to specify the addition of the zzso zzso zzso this study identifies a novel specificity signal consisting of six zzso acids located within the zzso anchor attachment zzso which is necessary and sufficient to specify the addition of a particular functional zzso anchor and, zzso the ultimate function of the mature zzso
