An zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso by zzso solid phase zzso synthesis and subsequent zzso zzso A zzso links the two zzso chains between zzso and zzso zzso zzso structure zzso indicates only minor structural changes of the folded synthetic protein compared to the similar zzso positions in the native zzso The zzso spectrum of the reduced synthetic protein is very similar to that of native zzso zzso zzso and the molecular mass determined by laser mass zzso has the expected value zzso zzso No metal is transferred to the gas phase by the laser beam merely by mixing the zzso and zzso zzso that the folding procedure is a necessary zzso for protein zzso The zzso chemical zzso has also been zzso and behaves in a closely similar zzso
