We describe a novel zzso zzso local motif that involves three zzso zzso and a Pro zzso zzso zzso Database analysis shows that when Pro is the zzso of an zzso the distribution of zzso acids in adjacent positions changes dramatically with respect to the average distribution in an zzso but not when Pro is at position zzso zzso Pro zzso are usually associated to zzso and zzso at position zzso Val at position zzso and a zzso zzso zzso at position zzso The side chain of the zzso Pro packs against zzso while the zzso zzso at positions N' and zzso make favorable zzso To analyze the role of this putative motif zzso fingerprint zzso we have zzso a series of peptides and analyzed them by circular zzso zzso and zzso We find that this motif is formed in zzso and that the accompanying zzso interactions contribute up to zzso zzso to zzso zzso The fact that some of the zzso in this fingerprint are not good zzso and zzso zzso results in a small overall stabilization of the zzso with respect to other peptides having zzso as the zzso and Ala at zzso and zzso This suggests that the zzso motif will not specially contribute to protein stability but to the specificity of its zzso In fact, zzso of the sequences that contain the fingerprint sequence in the protein database are adopting the described structural zzso and in none of them is the zzso extended to place Pro at the more favorable zzso zzso
