zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso take place in the bone zzso and is a tightly controlled zzso Cell zzso molecules of the zzso and zzso families have been shown to be involved in these zzso but almost nothing was known about the involvement of the zzso family in the zzso zzso A zzso screening of zzso of human bone zzso zzso cells with specific zzso for classical zzso revealed that zzso which is mainly expressed by cells of zzso origin, is also expressed by bone zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso of bone zzso sections confirmed this unexpected zzso A more detailed analysis using zzso columns and dual color flow zzso showed that the expression of zzso is restricted to defined maturation stages of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso express zzso mature zzso do zzso A functional role of zzso in the differentiation process of the zzso lineage was indicated by zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso to bone zzso zzso cultures containing zzso zzso drastically diminished the formation of zzso zzso These data suggest a zzso expression and function of zzso in one defined zzso cell zzso
