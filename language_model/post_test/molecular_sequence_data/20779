The zzso sodium channel zzso is regulated by hormones and by other zzso or zzso zzso It is activated by the zzso drug zzso The zzso effect of zzso is fast and zzso and was observed in zzso zzso zzso the alpha zzso from human, zzso or guinea pig (but not zzso with zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of this effect is not yet well zzso We zzso that the zzso loop of zzso plays a major role in this zzso zzso and zzso of alpha zzso harboring different parts of the rat and guinea pig zzso zzso zzso were generated and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso activity was measured using zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso part of the zzso loop of the zzso pig zzso was significantly zzso by zzso zzso whereas the zzso combination was not activated by this zzso zzso of specific zzso on the rat alpha zzso did not generate channels sensitive to zzso suggesting that the overall structure of the zzso loop is required for zzso of the channel by this zzso These results support the hypothesis of the existence of a role played by the last 100 zzso acids of the zzso loop and confirm that the zzso behaves as a zzso channel similar to several other members of the zzso zzso
