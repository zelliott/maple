Through functional studies of zzso zzso we have identified sequence and/or structural features important for specifying the many distinctive properties of E coli zzso zzso Many of the zzso zzso contain an zzso sequence change from zzso and are now zzso for E coli zzso zzso zzso We describe here the effect of further mutating the zzso base 73 and zzso 72 at the end of the zzso stem on: zzso recognition of the zzso zzso by E coli zzso zzso recognition by E coli zzso zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso in initiation in E zzso For zzso recognition, our results are, in general, consistent with interactions found in the crystal structure of the E coli zzso zzso zzso The results also support our previous conclusion that zzso of zzso zzso is important for its function in zzso
