zzso stress in soybean zzso causes the zzso of pre-existing heat shock zzso factor proteins zzso zzso results in the induction of DNA binding activity which leads to the zzso of heat shock zzso From a soybean zzso library we have isolated zzso clones corresponding to six zzso zzso Two zzso genes are expressed zzso at the zzso level, and the remaining four are zzso Two of the heat zzso genes are also responsive to cadmium zzso Comparative analysis of zzso sequences indicated higher conservation of the DNA binding domain among plant zzso than those from zzso or other higher zzso The putative plant zzso zzso domain contains zzso zzso repeats characteristic of coiled coils and seems to exist in two structural zzso The zzso zzso are reduced in size and the zzso zzso repeat is zzso
