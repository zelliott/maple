Human zzso is the zzso protein of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease zzso and zzso with zzso Bodies zzso The zzso half of zzso contains seven imperfect repeat zzso One of the zzso point zzso zzso has been reported in the imperfect repeat sequences of zzso and is prone to form zzso zzso The presence of seven imperfect repeats in zzso raises the question of whether or not zzso corresponding to zzso in the other imperfect zzso repeats have similar effects on zzso and zzso as well as their zzso to form zzso To investigate the effect of zzso zzso in each imperfect repeat zzso we zzso the zzso acid corresponding to zzso in each of the seven repeated sequences with a zzso zzso The zzso in the imperfect zzso repeat sequences of the zzso region were prone to decrease the lag time of zzso zzso In addition, zzso imaging suggested that the zzso zzso formed twisted zzso while the other zzso formed zzso zzso and short zzso These observations indicate that the effect of the zzso on the zzso of zzso formation and zzso of zzso varies according to their zzso
