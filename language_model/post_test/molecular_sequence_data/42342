The regulation of bovine zzso zzso an important component of the zzso defenses of the zzso zzso is poorly understood compared with the other milk zzso The complete sequence for bovine zzso zzso shows it to be highly zzso to other zzso and zzso However, regional differences in the deduced AA sequence of bovine zzso compared with human zzso and zzso imply functional differences between zzso zzso levels of bovine zzso zzso (by Northern zzso in the bovine zzso zzso indicate that bovine zzso expression is minimal in the developing and zzso zzso but is strongly induced by zzso zzso The overall regulation of bovine zzso in the zzso zzso appears to be contrary to that of the other milk zzso Features identified in the zzso of bovine zzso zzso may contribute to the differences in regulation between zzso and other bovine milk proteins and to differences in zzso of zzso in milk across zzso zzso zzso by bovine zzso cells grown in zzso does not appear to be dependent on zzso and shows regulation by zzso serum, and cell population to be different from that for zzso In contrast to zzso efficient zzso of zzso from the cell does not require detachment of collagen zzso
