We previously found a zzso zzso which momentarily appears immediately before DNA synthesis in the cell cycle of zzso coli synchronized by zzso zzso and which is closely related to the initiation of DNA replication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso unpublished zzso The zzso was named zzso zzso It was zzso approximately zzso with a recovery of zzso The isolated zzso appeared homogeneous by gel zzso and zzso Its molecular mass was estimated by zzso gel zzso and zzso as approximately 66 zzso The zzso point of zzso In is zzso and its optimal pH is approximately zzso Although protein In zzso zzso zzso for zzso its zzso activity seems markedly affected by zzso sequence lying towards the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso does not zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso activity is inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso activity are weak or not zzso Its activity is strongly affected in the presence of zzso and zzso and at a concentration of zzso M, these increase the activity zzso and zzso respectively, above that without zzso zzso In was strongly inhibited by various zzso of zzso acid, and their zzso effects were roughly correlated with those on growth of zzso zzso zzso activity was found in the zzso zzso
