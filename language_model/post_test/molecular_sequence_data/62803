Most zzso regulatory elements have generally been assumed to activate a single nearby zzso However, many genes are clustered together, raising the possibility that they are regulated through a common zzso We show here that a single zzso zzso response element zzso located between the mouse zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso on both genes zzso by zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso zzso A functional zzso zzso zzso downstream of the promoter of zzso zzso a zzso alpha target zzso was identified by a gene zzso zzso This zzso was positioned zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene and also functioned with the zzso zzso In addition, this zzso when combined with the natural promoters of the zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso alpha and zzso gamma zzso The zzso sequence specifically bound to the zzso of zzso alpha and zzso alpha or zzso gamma 2, as assessed by zzso gel mobility shift zzso Furthermore, zzso binding of zzso alpha and zzso gamma to the zzso was demonstrated in zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of these genes is induced through the same zzso in the liver and zzso zzso where the two zzso zzso are specifically zzso
