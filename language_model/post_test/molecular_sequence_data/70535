The zzso tumor zzso gene is zzso in over 50% of human zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The most notable zzso feature of zzso is its ability to act as a zzso zzso zzso Through use of the suppression zzso zzso differential screening technique, we identified zzso as a target for zzso stimulation by zzso in cells undergoing zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, in zzso induction of zzso in the zzso following zzso exposure to zzso radiation is zzso zzso zzso responsiveness does not reside in the zzso zzso zzso Rather, a distinct region within the zzso gene first zzso binds specifically to zzso and zzso upon the zzso promoter the ability to become zzso activated by zzso zzso Identification of zzso as a specific target for zzso zzso by zzso establishes a direct link between these two pivotal regulatory proteins and raises the possibility that zzso contributes to some of the biological effects of zzso
