zzso of the class zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely distributed in the marine zzso yet zzso properties of the many zzso lineages are completely zzso This study therefore zzso zzso content from a single zzso cell designated zzso obtained from the sediments of zzso Bay, zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso zzso was abundant in upper sediments but was absent below zzso below sea zzso A zzso assembly was obtained and was estimated to represent up to zzso of the full zzso The predicted zzso is much larger than zzso of cultivated zzso and appears to zzso zzso zzso Numerous genes zzso zzso of core and auxiliary zzso pathways were identified, suggesting that this zzso is capable of zzso various fatty acids and/or structurally related zzso Additional zzso versatility was indicated by zzso which may enable the zzso to zzso aromatic zzso Genes zzso zzso of the reductive zzso zzso were identified, which may also enable the fixation of CO2 or zzso of zzso completely to zzso Genes zzso a putative zzso zzso were the only evidence for a respiratory terminal zzso No evidence for reductive zzso genes was zzso zzso evidence also suggests that the zzso could zzso zzso by converting zzso to zzso by zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso marine adaptations such as salt tolerance and zzso zzso were zzso Together, these analyses provide the first insights into the potential zzso traits that may enable members of the zzso to occupy an ecological niche in marine zzso
