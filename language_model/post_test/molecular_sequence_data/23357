We detected a protein in rabbit skeletal muscle extracts that was zzso rapidly by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1), but not by protein zzso zzso and identified it as zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso in zzso All three zzso were zzso in skeletal muscle from zzso mice, but not from mice that do not express zzso zzso also zzso the related zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located within identical zzso sequences zzso repeated three times in zzso These zzso were zzso in zzso in the liver, zzso zzso and skeletal muscle of zzso mice, but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells using small interfering zzso also suppressed zzso of the zzso zzso in the repeat region of zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso transformed it into an excellent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which could then zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the repeat zzso zzso of zzso cells with the specific zzso inhibitor CT zzso increased the zzso mobility of zzso in zzso cells, demonstrating that this protein is zzso by zzso in zzso Our results identify zzso and zzso as zzso zzso for zzso and demonstrate that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso it for zzso by zzso
