The promoter region of the human zzso protein zzso gene comprises two distinct regions zzso for Acute Phase zzso zzso each one containing information necessary and sufficient for liver specific and zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso In this paper we show that both zzso contain a low affinity binding site for the liver specific zzso factor zzso The two sites are separated by approximately 80 zzso zzso in either of the two sites abolish zzso zzso The same effect is specifically obtained in zzso competition experiments when the human zzso zzso site is used as zzso However, zzso is not the zzso zzso of zzso because synthetic promoters formed by zzso copies of different zzso binding sites are not zzso activated by this zzso An expression zzso zzso full length zzso is capable of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso promoter but not from zzso which have lost the ability to bind zzso Moreover, the level of zzso observed with the natural promoter containing both zzso binding sites is far greater than the level of zzso zzso containing only one of the two zzso This result strongly suggests that two zzso molecules bound simultaneously to sites distant from each other can act zzso to activate gene zzso
