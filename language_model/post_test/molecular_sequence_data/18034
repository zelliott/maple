zzso and zzso scattering experiments showed that in mixed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso a membrane mimicking system, the segregation of zzso may occur zzso zzso experiments using zzso containing zzso zzso proved that zzso added to cells in culture enter the cell and bind to its membrane as components of zzso which specifically interact with a protein of about 30 zzso This suggests that zzso segregation may be a natural zzso zzso when added to zzso cells in culture led to increase in protein zzso the effect exerted being related to the amount of zzso molecules inserted zzso into the cell zzso layer and an increase of zzso of the cell original zzso content promoted an increase of 57% in the incorporation of zzso into cell membrane zzso From the above results a possible relationship between zzso segregation and involvement of zzso in zzso activity control is zzso
