zzso zzso found at zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso IV zzso gene zzso Here we characterize a novel short zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso that differs from the previously described long zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso domain by 13 zzso zzso The two zzso zzso use alternate first zzso zzso zzso was expressed mainly in the brain and zzso Multiple forms of zzso zzso protein were observed in zzso cells, having zzso 96 zzso 100 zzso and approximately 250 zzso which may represent soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a band shift is observed following zzso F zzso zzso was expressed primarily on the cell surface of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibits high sequence zzso with other zzso zzso but lacks a zzso zzso zzso and lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso motif did not zzso zzso zzso activity upon zzso Thus, although zzso is similar in structure and sequence to the other zzso zzso it lacks vital zzso required to zzso zzso zzso activity and has instead evolved features that enable it to act as an important component of zzso zzso zzso
