zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are widely spread throughout the bacterial zzso These zzso can be potential targets of new zzso drugs useful for the treatment of socially important diseases such as zzso In this study, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria were classified according to the zzso properties of zzso acid zzso in the zzso site of the zzso Nine zzso were identified that line the surface of the zzso pocket, and zzso were classified based on these zzso Twenty groups were discovered, five of them containing zzso zzso The two most abundant groups contained zzso protein zzso that belong to the various branches of the zzso tree, whereas certain groups are zzso or even zzso zzso modeling of the typical representatives of each group revealed that the zzso is reliable, and the differences between the protein zzso zzso pockets predicted based on their signatures are apparent in their zzso The zzso is expected to be useful for the selection of targets for new zzso zzso
