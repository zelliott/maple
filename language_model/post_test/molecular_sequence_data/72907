In search of candidate genes for zzso retinal disease, we have employed a zzso and differential zzso cloning strategy and isolated a novel zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The putative protein contained a zzso domain of copper zzso zzso which is found in various species from bacteria to zzso It showed the highest zzso to bovine serum zzso zzso which is believed to control the level of serum zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of human adult and fetal zzso revealed that the protein is expressed abundantly and specifically in zzso as a zzso zzso Thus, we considered this protein a human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso We propose that zzso may be a candidate gene for zzso zzso zzso
