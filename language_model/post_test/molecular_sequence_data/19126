zzso of the zzso zzso genes found in the zzso zzso gene repeat units of numerous zzso species suggest that such linkages were not inherited from a common zzso but were the result of independent zzso zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso zzso genes are found either in the zzso repeated units coding for zzso genes or in independent zzso repeated zzso Given that zzso species where zzso zzso genes are within the zzso repeated units coding for zzso genes are zzso zzso one might zzso that this arrangement is the result of an ancestral zzso of zzso zzso genes into the zzso repeated zzso gene family of zzso Here, we use the types of zzso zzso genes found associated with zzso zzso the zzso regions of the inserted zzso zzso genes and the position of these insertions to show that most of the zzso zzso genes found within zzso gene repeat units of zzso species were not acquired from a common zzso but are the results of independent zzso These multiple zzso zzso genes zzso events in zzso are likely the result of frequent founder events in different hosts and/or geographical locations in species having short generation zzso
