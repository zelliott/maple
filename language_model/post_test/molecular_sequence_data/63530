zzso about structural variation of candidate genes could be important to improve breeding selection scheme and preserve genetic zzso in livestock zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes are involved in the energetic zzso and are obvious candidate genes for zzso By sequencing zzso and zzso genes in 72 pigs belonging to lean zzso White and zzso fat zzso and zzso breeds and also Wild zzso 98 zzso sites, of which 91 were novel, were found in the zzso sequence while only the previously described zzso was found in the zzso zzso A total of 18 zzso zzso were observed and their distribution was unequal among the zzso The zzso analysis showed two zzso branches distinguishing between lean and fat zzso
