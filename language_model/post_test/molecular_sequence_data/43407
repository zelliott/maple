zzso transcript zzso 3 is a novel cell surface zzso of the zzso zzso which is selectively expressed by zzso zzso presenting cells zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso contains putative zzso zzso zzso motifs that suggest an zzso function of zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso to zzso receptors expressed by zzso results in a dramatic zzso of the increased zzso and zzso zzso triggered by these zzso Signal extinction involves zzso protein zzso zzso 1, which is recruited by zzso upon zzso zzso can also function in zzso capture and zzso It is efficiently zzso upon zzso and delivers its zzso to an zzso compartment where it is processed and presented to T zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso zzso that can zzso regulate zzso of zzso and can be used by zzso for zzso zzso
