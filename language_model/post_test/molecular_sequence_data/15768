The zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso DNA zzso gene was identified with the aid of an zzso probe corresponding to an zzso acid sequence zzso among viral DNA zzso of other virus zzso A zzso pair region of the zzso DNA, from zzso to zzso map units zzso was zzso and an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso was zzso From the first zzso of this ORF, a translation product of zzso zzso acids (Mr zzso was zzso zzso acid sequence similarities to other viral DNA zzso were zzso zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso zzso analysis and zzso protection studies of zzso zzso The zzso is transcribed in the zzso direction as a zzso zzso zzso appear to initiate at two differently regulated sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the initiating zzso zzso and to be zzso at a single site near a signal zzso which zzso the zzso termination signal zzso at zzso zzso were observed only during a narrow window between 2 to 8 zzso zzso zzso with maximum expression between 4 and 6 zzso zzso zzso gene transcripts were observed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso which also blocked the zzso of these early zzso zzso an inhibitor of both viral and host DNA zzso inhibited zzso gene zzso suggesting a unique regulation involving DNA zzso
