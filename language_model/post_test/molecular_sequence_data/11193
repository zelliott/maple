To examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso heavy chain zzso predominantly expressed in fetal zzso we have isolated and characterized the zzso region of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that 105 base pairs of zzso sequence was necessary to direct high level zzso in zzso cells, vascular smooth muscle cells derived from rabbit zzso An essential zzso element was localized between zzso and zzso base pairs from the zzso start site based on the results that replacement zzso within this region significantly reduced promoter zzso zzso of this region is completely zzso between mouse and rabbit and fits no known DNA binding zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that a specific zzso complex was formed at this site with nuclear extracts from zzso cells, which can be zzso by zzso zzso box but not by zzso zzso box or other zzso zzso We conclude that expression of the zzso gene is regulated through an interaction between a sequence element located at zzso and a distinct member of zzso zzso
