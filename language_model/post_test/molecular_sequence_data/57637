The zzso coli zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that a zzso zzso event occurs during the expression of zzso resulting in the synthesis of an additional zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have recently found that the transition from the 0 to the zzso frame occurs via the bypassing of a zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Here we show that the frequency of zzso zzso (or zzso can be regulated both in zzso and in zzso This frequency is zzso zzso to the rate of initiation of translation of the zzso zzso zzso modulating the level of translation initiation affects the frequency of zzso
