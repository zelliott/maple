Nuclear zzso such as those for zzso zzso and zzso control many zzso zzso zzso with structures similar to these zzso but for which zzso have not yet been identified, have been termed orphan nuclear zzso One of these zzso germ cell nuclear factor zzso has been shown to be germ cell specific in the adult and, therefore, may also participate in the regulation of zzso zzso In this paper, we examine more closely the expression patterns of zzso in germ cells to begin to define zzso zzso of its zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso is lacking in the zzso of zzso zzso mice, which lack developed zzso but is present in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is, indeed, germ cell specific in the adult zzso zzso of the specific in zzso zzso signal in zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso is most abundant in stage zzso round zzso Similarly, Northern analysis and specific in zzso zzso show that zzso expression first occurs in zzso of zzso mice, when round zzso first zzso zzso in the male, zzso expression occurs zzso and may participate in the zzso changes of the maturing zzso In contrast, female expression of zzso is shown in growing zzso that have not completed the first zzso zzso Thus, zzso in the female is expressed before the completion of zzso Finally, the nature of the two different zzso that zzso to the zzso complementary DNA was zzso Although both messages contain the DNA binding domain, only the larger message is recognized by a probe from the extreme 3' untranslated zzso In zzso zzso with these differential zzso demonstrates that both messages are present in growing zzso In addition, the coding region and portions of the 3' untranslated region of the zzso complementary DNA are zzso in the zzso
