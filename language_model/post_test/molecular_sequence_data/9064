zzso is a zzso modifier that is involved in cellular functions through its zzso attachment to target zzso zzso can also be zzso to itself at seven zzso zzso and at its zzso zzso to form eight zzso zzso chains for individual cellular zzso The zzso zzso chain is recognized by tandem zzso motifs zzso of zzso for the regulation of DNA zzso To understand the recognition mechanism between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso in solution, we determined the solution structure of the zzso complex by using zzso restraints and zzso data derived from zzso zzso The structure showed that the zzso adopts a nearly straight and single continuous zzso and the two zzso units of the zzso separately bind to each zzso zzso The zzso are formed between zzso patches of the two zzso units and the zzso zzso of the zzso We also showed that the zzso region between the two zzso motifs possesses a zzso zzso in the free state, but zzso the zzso transition upon complex formation, which simultaneously fixes the relative position of zzso zzso These data suggest that the relative position of zzso zzso in the zzso complex is essential for zzso binding of zzso zzso
