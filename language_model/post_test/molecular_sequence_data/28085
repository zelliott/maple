Several members of the zzso zzso are expressed on neural cells where they participate in surface interactions between cell bodies and zzso Their zzso zzso are more closely related to each other than to zzso variable and constant zzso and have been grouped into the C2 zzso Here, we report the cloning and characterization of another member of this group, the mouse zzso cell surface zzso zzso The F3 zzso sequence contains an open reading frame that could zzso a zzso acid protein consisting of a signal zzso six zzso zzso of the C2 type, a long zzso region containing two segments that exhibit sequence similarity to zzso type III repeats and a moderately zzso zzso zzso The protein does not contain a typical zzso segment but appears to be attached to the membrane by a zzso zzso zzso against the F3 protein recognize a prominent zzso protein in mouse zzso In fetal brain cultures, they stain the zzso cell surface and, in cultures maintained in chemically defined zzso most prominently zzso and zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene maps to band F of zzso zzso The gene transcripts detected in the brain by F3 zzso zzso are zzso zzso the highest amounts being expressed between 1 and 2 zzso after zzso The F3 zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence show striking similarity to the recently published sequence of the chicken zzso cell surface protein zzso However, there are important differences between the two zzso In contrast to zzso zzso has a zzso and a zzso zzso Whereas zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and is tightly associated with the zzso about equal amounts of F3 distribute between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among other neural cell surface zzso F3 most resembles the zzso cell zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso acid identity between their zzso zzso Based on its structural similarity with known cell zzso proteins of nervous tissue and with zzso in particular, we propose that F3 mediates cell surface interactions during nervous system zzso
