Loss of function zzso of the zzso zzso channel, zzso have been implicated in zzso disease, a genetic disorder characterized by low weight zzso zzso zzso and, in some cases, eventual zzso zzso Recently, our laboratory used an zzso cloning strategy to isolate an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cell line A6 that had high zzso to human zzso We now report a full-length native zzso clone zzso containing zzso and 3' untranslated zzso isolated by screening a zzso library from A6 cells that was successfully expressed in zzso zzso In addition, we compared the properties of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso of zzso and zzso consisting of the open reading frame zzso into an zzso zzso expression zzso zzso of the full-length zzso zzso clone resulted in large, strongly zzso outward currents that were not significantly affected by the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Reduction of the zzso pH zzso from zzso to zzso inhibited outward zzso currents by 27 zzso zzso for zzso and 39 zzso zzso for zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso have highly similar functional zzso Unlike zzso and most other zzso channels, expression of zzso in zzso does not require the removal of its untranslated zzso and 3' zzso zzso solutions inhibited both zzso and human zzso zzso opposite to the zzso effects of low external pH on other zzso channels, suggesting a possibly distinct regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso
