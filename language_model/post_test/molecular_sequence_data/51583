A fraction of DNA fragments of highly zzso and completely unfolded zzso DNA inevitably remains associated with chemically resistant zzso zzso zzso This fraction can be isolated by zzso zzso because the zzso DNA fragments are retained on zzso filters while bulk DNA passes through the zzso The fraction of zzso DNA from human zzso retained on filters as a result of the binding factors zzso approximately zzso represents a subset of zzso sequences with a sequence complexity different from zzso DNA and DNA recovered in the zzso zzso DNA sequences prevalent in the retained fraction were detected by differential plaque zzso of a zzso zzso zzso library with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso zzso showing much stronger zzso signals with the zzso probe than with the zzso probe were selected, zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso of such clones showed that repetitive DNA sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso family, satellite III and satellite zzso sequences are highly enriched in the retained zzso which indicates that these sequences specifically attract the zzso involved in the tightly bound and resistant zzso This property of repetitive sequences is of interest since zzso repetitive sequences have been suggested to code for zzso fixation and stabilization of the zzso fiber in the cell zzso
