A zzso approach based on structural data was exploited in a search for zzso and zzso zzso with improved intrinsic zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid level comparisons were carried out against known zzso zzso and zzso beneficial zzso and zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso fragments were constructed by zzso zzso of regions in the zzso and zzso zzso expected to be most sensitive under physical stress zzso These zzso were located on three sites in the zzso constant zzso a mobile loop in the zzso domain, zzso surrounding the two largest zzso zzso cavities located in the interface of the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso core regions of both zzso and zzso zzso levels of functional zzso fragments, zzso unfolding zzso and circular zzso zzso were used to evaluate the relative zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The highest zzso stability was reached through the zzso strategy, where the zzso and the packing density of the zzso zzso cavity in the zzso interface was increased by the replacement of the zzso zzso in the zzso domain by a more zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of the transition curve from native to unfolded states of the zzso measured by zzso zzso occurred at zzso of zzso zzso of zzso M and zzso M for the zzso zzso and the most stable zzso zzso Our results illustrate that point zzso targeted to the zzso interface were advantageous for the overall zzso stability of the zzso zzso
