zzso I and II are nerve zzso proteins thought to function in synaptic zzso zzso In addition to a zzso zzso domain, the proteins contain a highly zzso putative zzso binding site and numerous consensus zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso I but not zzso II is a zzso which zzso zzso during nerve terminal zzso Further, both zzso I and II interact with the zzso domain of zzso a zzso enriched protein implicated in synaptic zzso zzso The interaction is direct and zzso through a 43 zzso acid region of zzso containing the putative zzso binding zzso These data further support a role for zzso I, II and zzso in synaptic zzso zzso
