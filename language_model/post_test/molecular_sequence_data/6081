The activities of zzso zzso factors are inhibited by interactions with members of the zzso zzso tumor zzso family, zzso zzso and zzso In cycling cells zzso and zzso also interact with zzso comprised of zzso and either A or E zzso We characterized zzso complexes present in zzso and zzso mouse cells induced to differentiate into muscle and zzso cells, zzso In both zzso zzso and zzso cells, in addition to free species, zzso was found in complexes containing zzso or zzso and zzso No zzso complexes were detected by zzso mobility shift zzso even though such cells were shown to contain zzso and zzso species capable of interacting in zzso These results suggested that although present, zzso was unable to interact with zzso Following differentiation of zzso cells into zzso zzso was present in at least two complexes which contained zzso but not in those containing zzso or zzso Low levels of zzso complexes were also detected in fully differentiated zzso zzso and in freshly isolated skeletal zzso In the case of differentiated zzso zzso cells, zzso was found in complexes containing zzso zzso and zzso However, such cells may not be representative of fully differentiated zzso as studies with zzso brain extracts indicated that only zzso complexes and those recognized by a zzso serum were zzso These results suggested that in both muscle and zzso zzso and zzso may play specific roles in the development or maintenance of terminal zzso
