We recently reported the function of zzso which is involved in the zzso zzso 1) zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso at the 21 and 22 positions of compound 1 with zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso In this study, zzso which is located in the zzso zzso 2) zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso and encodes an zzso with zzso zzso acid identity to zzso was characterized using zzso zzso When compound 1 and zzso were used as zzso two major products and a trace of minor product were zzso The structures of the two major products were determined to be zzso zzso compound 1 at either the 20 or 21 zzso Because compound 2 and zzso zzso zzso both of which are compound zzso compounds produced by zzso zzso have the same zzso zzso at the 20 and 21 position, respectively, zzso should catalyze the zzso in compound 2 and 3 zzso More zzso and surprisingly, zzso accepted zzso zzso zzso which is an intermediate of compound 1 zzso that has a structure similar to that of compound 1, and zzso a regular zzso of compound 4 at either the 21 or 22 position, though the reverse zzso was observed with compound zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso have the potential to alter their position and zzso zzso for zzso and could be zzso for the synthesis of industrially useful zzso
