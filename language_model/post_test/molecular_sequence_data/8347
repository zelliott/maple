zzso zzso hormone zzso is considered to have an important role in the control of reproduction in zzso zzso As a basis for understanding the zzso functioning of zzso at the molecular level, we characterized the zzso sequences of two types of zzso zzso the precursors of zzso in zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso by a cloning strategy based on reverse zzso The two types of zzso are referred to as zzso and zzso and consisted of 435 and zzso bases zzso Both precursors are predicted to contain a signal zzso the hormone and a zzso zzso that is attached to the hormone via a zzso zzso The presence of two types of zzso zzso with either zzso was confirmed by Northern zzso analysis of brain zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and rainbow trout, zzso zzso The zzso zzso had zzso and zzso overall identity with zzso zzso from zzso salmon and putative zzso zzso deduced from the gene of the Atlantic zzso zzso zzso respectively, whereas the zzso zzso had zzso and zzso overall identity with the former and the latter zzso The zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso showed less similarity zzso These results indicated that each zzso species possesses two differing zzso zzso The results of Southern zzso analysis using zzso DNA extracted from individuals support this evidence in zzso zzso zzso salmon and rainbow zzso
