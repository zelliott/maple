zzso transmission of the pandemic zzso 2009 zzso virus in pig populations resulted in zzso events with endemic zzso influenza viruses zzso 

We investigated whether zzso zzso viruses are present in South Korea and sought to determine the zzso potential of the novel zzso zzso 

Pig lung zzso were collected from commercially slaughtered zzso zzso zzso influenza viruses were genetically analyzed and characterized in zzso and in zzso 

We identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso viruses containing zzso segments in Korean pigs that are genetically closely related to strains recently detected in pigs and humans in North zzso Although the zzso and novel zzso zzso demonstrated efficient replication in mice and zzso all the zzso strains exhibited growth advantage over the representative zzso virus in human airway zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso zzso were more readily transmitted to zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso evaluation showed poor zzso to contemporary reference human seasonal zzso vaccine zzso 

We report here for the first time the isolation of zzso viruses outside North America and of novel zzso zzso zzso viruses with zzso zzso Apart from further complicating the genetic diversity of influenza A viruses circulating in domestic zzso our data also indicate that these strains could potentially pose threat to public health asserting the need for continuous virus monitoring in these ecologically important zzso
