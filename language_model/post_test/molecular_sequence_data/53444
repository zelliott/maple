zzso findings have indicated that zzso B virus zzso DNA zzso into the cellular DNA of zzso chronic zzso zzso The integrated sequence zzso of zzso DNA at the zzso junction is zzso in a zzso region which is adjacent to direct repeat zzso A cellular protein which we zzso from the nuclear extract of zzso cells binds to the IS and was designated IS binding protein 3 zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined and found to be identical to that of zzso initiation factor zzso and Yang 1 zzso An zzso against zzso zzso acids of zzso recognized zzso in a Western zzso analysis and an zzso mobility shift zzso Furthermore, zzso also zzso with zzso which zzso to the zzso binding zzso to enhance zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso is known as a zzso factor, the IS did not exhibit any effect on the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The possible involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso of linear zzso zzso DNA has been examined zzso zzso et zzso unpublished zzso Data suggest that zzso is involved in the joining reaction between zzso DNA and cellular DNA to form the zzso zzso
