zzso is the second most widespread human zzso zzso It is principally treated with one drug, zzso that is administered to 100 million people each year; less sensitive strains of zzso are zzso One of the most appealing drug targets against zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso This natural zzso zzso is a peculiar fusion of a zzso domain with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located on a flexible zzso arm that is usually zzso in the available structures of the protein and is essential for the full zzso activity of zzso In this study, we dissect the zzso cycle of zzso zzso zzso by structural and functional analysis of the zzso zzso The zzso data presented zzso include the zzso the oxidized form (at zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso forms zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a different crystal form of the zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso showing the zzso zzso and the entire C zzso of one zzso Whenever possible, we determined the rate zzso for the zzso between the different zzso states of zzso by kinetic zzso By combining the zzso analysis with computer zzso we were able to throw further light on the mechanism of action of zzso zzso zzso In particular, we hereby propose the putative functionally relevant zzso change of the C zzso after the transfer of reducing zzso from zzso to the zzso sites of the zzso
