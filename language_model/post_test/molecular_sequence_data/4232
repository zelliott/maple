zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is highly induced by various zzso zzso Two zzso truncated forms of this zzso termed zzso and zzso are also found localized in zzso from zzso zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso has a zzso zzso signal that zzso the targeting of the protein to both the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso acid stretch of zzso is thought to provide signals for zzso membrane zzso and also stop zzso The present study provides evidence that a sequence motif immediately zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain functions as a zzso targeting signal under both in zzso and in zzso conditions, and that the positively charged zzso at positions 34 and 39 are critical for zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso of zzso nascent zzso which escape zzso membrane zzso are processed by a liver zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso zzso activates a cryptic zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso showed that a portion of zzso expressed zzso is zzso with the zzso marker protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso are localized within the inner membrane zzso as tested by resistance to limited zzso in both intact zzso and zzso Our results therefore describe a novel mechanism zzso proteins with zzso signal sequence are targeted to the zzso as well as to the zzso
