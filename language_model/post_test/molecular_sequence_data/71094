In an effort to identify novel zzso modulated during the course of zzso conversion, we have used a simplified differential display technique and have isolated a zzso zzso an zzso zzso tremendously expressed in the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso is likely to be the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso and of the partially known sequence of the rat zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in several zzso but zzso the highest levels of gene expression are found in zzso tissue and zzso zzso transcript levels are barely zzso in zzso but are induced several zzso during the zzso differentiation of zzso or zzso cells and of rat precursor primary zzso These changes in transcript levels parallel a sharp increase in zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso present in zzso or zzso zzso closely resemble the features of the zzso activity previously described in white and brown zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso levels and zzso activity drop in response to zzso of the zzso zzso and to the zzso tumor necrosis zzso indicating that two major signaling molecules of zzso tissue development and metabolism can control zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso transcripts and activity are clearly zzso in white zzso tissue from obese zzso zzso Because of its known zzso effect on zzso zzso its zzso properties and its pattern of expression and regulation, zzso could play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso
