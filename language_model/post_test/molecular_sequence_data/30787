zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso A zzso results in reduced visual zzso behavior zzso and an zzso zzso for which the zzso is zzso We mapped the zzso gene genetically to a 20 zzso zzso within the zzso region of the X zzso isolated this zzso region, and used P zzso transformation to zzso the zzso gene to a 9 zzso zzso Analysis of zzso clones indicates that this region encodes alternatively spliced transcripts zzso protein products of approximately 77 zzso that differ only in their zzso 35 zzso zzso Analysis of zzso generated in zzso in this zzso unit confirm that these transcripts are the products of the zzso zzso
