zzso zzso named zzso is a zzso 2 zzso protein that binds with high affinity to the zzso insulin zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso At least two zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso which differ in the zzso zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso have previously been identified in insulin target zzso such as human skeletal muscle and fat zzso Here we report the cloning of the third zzso of the zzso family zzso from human skeletal muscle and its zzso to human zzso zzso We have also determined the human zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso contains an intact zzso domain and an zzso sequence that is present in zzso but absent in zzso zzso protection zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in insulin target cells including skeletal muscle, liver, and zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in zzso cells and various breast cancer cell zzso The protein bound with high affinity to the insulin zzso in cells, and the interaction was dependent on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso also underwent zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso are potential downstream signaling components of the insulin zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso domain may play an important role in the involvement of these zzso in signal zzso pathways initiated by insulin and other growth zzso
