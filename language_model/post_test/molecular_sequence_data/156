The zzso zzso zzso Database zzso contains available information regarding full-length coding sequences zzso of the zzso crops wheat zzso zzso and barley zzso zzso and includes functional zzso and comparative zzso zzso zzso provides a search interface using zzso for gene function and related Gene zzso terms and a similarity search for DNA and deduced translated zzso acid sequences to access zzso of zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso consist of similarity search results against several sequence databases and domain structure predictions by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences in zzso are grouped with the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso rice zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso thresholds of sequence identity, providing zzso zzso results based on full-length protein zzso The database also provides sequence similarity results based on comparative mapping of zzso onto the rice and zzso zzso zzso which together with current zzso can be used to predict gene structures for zzso zzso To provide the possible genetic locations of full-length zzso zzso entries are also assigned to the genetically mapped zzso sequences of barley and zzso zzso which are currently zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso data are zzso from the search zzso of both zzso The current zzso contains zzso full-length zzso from barley and wheat and includes putative full-length zzso for barley and zzso which are publicly zzso This zzso content provides an zzso gateway for zzso zzso and grass comparative zzso zzso is publicly available at zzso
