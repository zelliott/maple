zzso of signal zzso pathways have evolved as connected zzso recognizing several binding partners with remarkable affinities and zzso Ras is one of these zzso sensitive to rapid and subtle changes, thus enabling the correct transfer of zzso The dynamic nature of such systems makes their structural characterization challenging, despite the vast amount of experimental data zzso These data, however, can be used as a restraint for generating comprehensive models of the association of Ras with its zzso We believe that by following this type of approach, the derived zzso models can provide zzso understanding of important biological issues, such as how Ras discriminates between the Ras binding zzso of its various zzso The modeled binding zzso could be used as the starting points for selective zzso of interactions and pathways using small zzso peptides or zzso
