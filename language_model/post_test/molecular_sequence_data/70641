G zzso zzso zzso zzso have been principally characterized by their ability to zzso and zzso G zzso zzso However, recent studies suggest that zzso may have more diverse zzso interactions in zzso Based on the identification of a consensus zzso binding motif within the zzso zzso domain of zzso we tested the direct binding of zzso full-length zzso to various zzso zzso fusion zzso and we discovered a specific interaction of zzso with the zzso scaffolding zzso Interestingly, analysis of zzso and zzso which lack a zzso zzso domain, revealed in zzso binding properties similar to those of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso fusion proteins were used to map overlapping regions in the N zzso of both zzso and zzso that appear to mediate zzso zzso zzso In zzso association of zzso and zzso was suggested by zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso cells and was further supported by zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso significance for the zzso interaction was demonstrated by the potent zzso of zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso scaffolding domain zzso These data reveal a novel mode for the regulation of zzso that is likely to play an important role in their cellular zzso
