Members in the zzso gene family of proteins are zzso zzso factors that play critical roles in determining organ zzso We have isolated a zzso clone from rice that encodes a zzso zzso This zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It carries a zzso motif and a zzso domain, as do those in zzso zzso A fusion protein between zzso and zzso is located in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso experiments also indicated that the transcript accumulated in the zzso and zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso gene does not show polar expression pattern in the zzso of floral zzso Our transgenic plants that zzso expressed zzso were normal during the zzso growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso compared with those of the wild zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a major role in zzso development and maintenance of zzso and zzso rather than in determining zzso
