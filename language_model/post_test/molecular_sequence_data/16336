The zzso gene of zzso coli zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was cloned following zzso of an zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso The hybrid zzso carrying the zzso gene was able to complement a zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso not only was the zzso activity of the zzso restored after the acquisition of the zzso zzso but it was about ten times higher than that of the wild zzso zzso of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled us to locate the zzso gene on an zzso zzso of about zzso zzso The zzso promoter was located toward the zzso end of the fragment, as shown by the use of the zzso zzso series of zzso zzso of the zzso gene indicated the presence of an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which should zzso to the zzso zzso zzso extension experiments enabled us to identify the zzso end of the zzso zzso and to deduce the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso synthesis performed by an in zzso coupled zzso system, showed the presence of a protein of about 35 zzso This is in agreement with the molecular weight of the zzso protein zzso zzso as deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso coli and human zzso allowed the detection of several regions of strong zzso between the two zzso Two of these regions zzso as expected, to the putative zzso and zzso sites of the human zzso
