To investigate the consequences of zzso zzso zzso expression under the control of the normal zzso zzso a zzso mouse bearing the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso models are distinct from transgenic models because the zzso gene is expressed at normal levels, in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso mice had normal expression of zzso zzso but levels of the zzso and zzso protein fragments of zzso were reduced while levels of the zzso were zzso When crossed into zzso mice, the zzso zzso accelerated the onset of zzso zzso deposition in a zzso dependent zzso zzso mice also had zzso deposition that was widely distributed throughout the brain and spinal zzso zzso double zzso mice had elevated levels of zzso sufficient to cause zzso deposition beginning at 6 months of zzso zzso deposition increased zzso over time in zzso mice, whereas the increase in zzso mice was zzso The zzso double zzso mouse represents an animal model that exhibits zzso deposition without zzso of zzso
