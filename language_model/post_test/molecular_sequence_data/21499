zzso zzso is a member of the large zzso zzso and is required for the zzso of the zzso zzso into the host zzso either to establish or exit from the zzso zzso This zzso can also mediate zzso integration in zzso cells in a zzso manner and has been considered as a potentially powerful tool for gene zzso It has previously been reported that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and markedly zzso its integration efficiency, and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been identified as the interacting zzso Here, we report that both the deletion of the zzso or the replacement of zzso with His greatly reduced the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso further demonstrated that the zzso ability and binding specificity of the two zzso were dramatically zzso zzso analysis indicated a probable zzso zzso motif between zzso zzso a region that contains the zzso zzso However, neither truncated zzso nor zzso alone could bind to the zzso target zzso zzso of a circular zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso did not fold correctly into a zzso structure, which may be one of the reasons for its lack of zzso zzso Thus, the identification and confirmation of four key zzso acids in the zzso specificity and zzso activity of zzso zzso provide information about the domain structure and function of the large zzso region and suggest important implications for the more efficient use of zzso in gene transfer and gene zzso
