zzso of a novel zzso zzso protein was isolated from rat tissue by a zzso cloning approach, and was designated zzso because its deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso is remotely similar to that of members of the zzso family zzso identity with zzso zzso of zzso was found predominately in zzso zzso zzso exhibited rapid exchange of bound zzso zzso for zzso zzso but lacked a zzso intrinsic zzso zzso A second zzso clone was isolated which contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso with characteristics of an zzso zzso this zzso introduces a stop zzso after zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso derived from the zzso carrying the zzso was loaded with zzso during zzso but showed almost no exchange of the zzso for zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso appears to harbor a structural element which is essential for the zzso exchange of the zzso
