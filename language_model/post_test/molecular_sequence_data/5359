zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso have applications in the diagnosis and therapy of human zzso Many of these zzso define linear zzso of three, four or five zzso acids within an zzso region of the zzso protein zzso Various synthetic peptides which incorporated this region were prepared and zzso linked to zzso beads for use as affinity zzso An unrelated zzso was identified as a zzso for one of the zzso zzso using zzso display technologies and this was also evaluated as a potential zzso in an affinity zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso of an zzso zzso was performed using zzso tissue culture zzso as zzso Following sample application and column zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso by zzso zzso with increasing zzso of zzso The procedure has proved efficient for the zzso of zzso zzso and the concentration of zzso required for zzso zzso gives a measure of the relative binding affinity of the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso so that separation strategies may be zzso
