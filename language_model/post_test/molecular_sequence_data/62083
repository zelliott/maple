zzso represents a powerful methodology for the analysis of protein structural and functional relationships and dissection of complex zzso zzso The suicide zzso zzso mechanism of the proteins of the zzso zzso offers unique challenges for the design of zzso zzso All zzso share a zzso core structure and most adopt a zzso zzso that is required for zzso zzso zzso studies focused on the zzso center loop, the hinge region, zzso zzso zzso stability, and accessory zzso binding zzso have led to a well-established zzso zzso mechanism and have defined specific biological interactions and functions for a number of zzso in development, zzso and host zzso Nonetheless, great care must be taken in the design and interpretation of zzso zzso studies, since the rapid zzso changes that occur during zzso zzso can be affected at many zzso
