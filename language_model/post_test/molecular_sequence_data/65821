zzso of the zzso region involved in gas zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is driven by two divergent zzso zzso and zzso separated by only 35 zzso Both promoters are activated by the zzso zzso zzso which in the case of zzso requires a zzso sequence zzso consisting of two zzso zzso sequence portions located upstream of zzso Here, we determined the two zzso elements in the promoter region of zzso by scanning zzso using zzso containing zzso (without zzso fused to the zzso reporter gene zzso an zzso with zzso activity, or the dual reporter construct zzso with zzso fused to zzso and zzso to an altered version of zzso The two zzso elements found exhibited a similar extension and distance to zzso as previously determined for the zzso in zzso Their zzso zzso portions almost completely overlapped in the zzso of zzso and zzso in this region zzso affected the zzso zzso of both zzso Any zzso of the distance between zzso and zzso resulted in the loss of the zzso zzso as did a complete substitution of the zzso zzso portion, underlining that a close location of zzso and zzso was very zzso
