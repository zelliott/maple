Given that the analysis of a single gene does not necessarily provide zzso zzso information, it is important to scrutinize as many genes as zzso Using the maximum likelihood method, particularly suitable for a total evidence approach, we evaluated the zzso information provided by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence data in order to resolve one of the most debated zzso questions: the relationships among the major groups of zzso Our analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso are closer to zzso zzso than to zzso
