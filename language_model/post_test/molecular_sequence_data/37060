zzso tube growth relies on an extremely fast delivery of new membrane and wall material to the zzso region where growth takes zzso Despite the obvious meaning of this fact, the mechanisms that control this process remain very much zzso It has previously been shown that zzso growth is regulated by zzso free calcium zzso so it was decided to test how changes in zzso affect zzso in zzso tube growth and zzso The zzso was zzso in living cells using zzso imaging of zzso zzso It was found that growing zzso tubes exhibited a higher zzso activity in the zzso region whereas in zzso cells zzso zzso is zzso zzso During zzso tube zzso a spatial zzso of zzso activity was observed with the highest zzso in the side to which the cell will zzso zzso increases in zzso induced by zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso In order to find if zzso changes were modulating zzso directly or through a zzso zzso tests were conducted to find how changes in zzso levels and zzso activity zzso regulators of the zzso zzso affect the zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was found that increases in zzso levels could promote zzso (and zzso Interestingly, the increase in zzso did not significantly affect zzso distribution, thus suggesting that the zzso zzso is regulated in a concerted but differentiated manner by the zzso zzso and the activity of zzso zzso zzso are likely candidates to mediate the zzso zzso as shown by zzso experiments in growing zzso zzso
