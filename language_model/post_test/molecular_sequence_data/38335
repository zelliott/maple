To clarify the role of core protein zzso in zzso zzso of human and duck zzso B viruses zzso and zzso respectively), we have examined the zzso states of different forms of zzso zzso core protein and the zzso effects of zzso in the zzso sites of zzso and zzso core zzso We show that zzso core protein is zzso to similar zzso in the form of protein zzso and after further assembly in zzso zzso zzso Individual and multiple zzso of zzso and zzso acid for zzso in the zzso sites of zzso core protein resulted in zzso and synergistic effects on zzso zzso ranging from zzso enhancement to more than zzso zzso Core protein zzso with zzso in all zzso sites exhibited zzso effects on zzso zzso by zzso zzso The results suggest that the presence of zzso at position 162 of zzso core protein is required for zzso zzso whereas zzso at position 170 zzso the process and zzso might be preferable in position zzso zzso of the zzso capacities of zzso core protein zzso in which four zzso sites were jointly zzso to zzso or zzso acid, suggests that zzso of zzso core protein at these sites may zzso zzso zzso but that its impact is much less profound than in the case of zzso The possible mechanisms by which zzso zzso may be modulated by core protein zzso are discussed in the context of the observed differences between the two zzso
