We report the isolation of zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso a novel zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells that encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The 236 zzso acids of zzso include both a basic region and a zzso zzso at the zzso in contrast to zzso of zzso which features these structures at its zzso zzso expression was strongly zzso by zzso zzso zzso could specifically bind to the unfolded protein response zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso displayed enhanced zzso zzso expression in response to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso
