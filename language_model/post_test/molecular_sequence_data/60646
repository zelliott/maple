The mouse fatty liver zzso zzso zzso is characterized by transient zzso and fatty liver during the zzso period, followed by development of a peripheral zzso To uncover the zzso zzso that is disrupted by the zzso zzso we analyzed the altered pattern of gene expression in the fatty liver of zzso zzso by zzso difference analysis of zzso zzso expressed genes detected include a novel member of the Ras zzso of small zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso and several zzso zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso light zzso Because these proteins have a potential functional link in the propagation of hormone signals, we investigated zzso dynamics in zzso cells in response to hormone zzso These studies revealed that zzso from zzso mice exhibit impaired formation of zzso membrane zzso in response to insulin zzso These findings suggest that the altered zzso expression levels detected in zzso tissue represent a zzso response for the zzso zzso gene and that the zzso gene product may be required for development of normal insulin zzso
