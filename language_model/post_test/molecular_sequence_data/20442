This review summarizes and analyzes both literature data and results of our own studies on molecular mechanisms of action of natural and artificially created zzso peptides on functional activity of zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso There are considered zzso toxins from insect zzso synthetic peptides that are derivatives of zzso zzso of receptors of the zzso type as well as artificially created peptides with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Action of most of these peptides on activity of zzso is highly selective and those themselves are able to mimic the zzso zzso to be thereby zzso regulators of the signal systems coupled with zzso zzso
