Mercury resistant bacteria have developed a system of two zzso zzso and zzso which allows them to efficiently zzso both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso bond resulting in the formation of zzso mercury and a reduced zzso The zzso mercury zzso is subsequently reduced to the less zzso zzso mercury zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso To better understand zzso unique zzso activity, we used nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso to determine the structure of the free zzso zzso is characterized by a novel protein fold consisting of three zzso zzso zzso surrounded by six zzso By comparing the zzso data of free zzso and the zzso complex, we identified a set of zzso that likely define a zzso binding zzso These zzso cluster around two zzso zzso and zzso that are crucial to zzso zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the structure revealed the presence of an extensive zzso groove adjacent to this zzso binding zzso This extensive zzso groove has the potential to interact with the hydrocarbon zzso of a wide variety of zzso and may explain the broad zzso specificity of zzso
