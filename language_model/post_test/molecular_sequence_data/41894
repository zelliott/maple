We have previously identified a 12 zzso long sequence element, the zzso that was demonstrated to be necessary for zzso control of expression in the male germ line of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso It is zzso among all seven members of the zzso gene family, that zzso structural proteins of the zzso zzso The zzso is invariably located in the zzso untranslated region zzso at position zzso relative to the zzso start zzso In this paper we zzso the mode of action of this zzso We show that protein binding occurs at the zzso after incubation with zzso protein extracts from zzso zzso While several proteins are associated with the zzso control element in the zzso only one of these proteins directly zzso to the sequence zzso The binding activity is exclusively observed with zzso protein extracts but can be demonstrated with zzso extracts from other zzso species as well, indicating that regulatory proteins involved in zzso regulation in the male germ line are zzso Although binding to the zzso can occur independent of its position relative to the zzso start site of the in zzso zzso its function in zzso is not exerted when shifted further downstream within the zzso zzso of a fusion zzso In addition to being a zzso control element the zzso also functions as a zzso zzso zzso a zzso complex is also formed at the zzso In contrast to the zzso complexes we find zzso complexes with protein extracts of several zzso of zzso zzso
