zzso are zzso from zzso steroids by a unique form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso We have shown that zzso expression of human zzso is determined, in part, by the use of alternative zzso Previous methods of analysis for determining the specific zzso of the different transcripts included zzso zzso protection, primer extension, and Northern zzso In the present study we have used the zzso procedure zzso amplification of zzso zzso to amplify and clone the zzso zzso of zzso transcripts expressed in human corpus zzso zzso zzso of the resulting clones supports the results of the previously performed zzso Specifically, the zzso promoter, zzso is the zzso promoter zzso in zzso such that the start of zzso occurs 26 zzso downstream of the putative zzso zzso A minority of the clones possess an alternative zzso namely zzso zzso Northern analysis confirms that the majority of the zzso transcripts in zzso tissue contain sequence specific for promoter zzso Similarly, zzso Northern analysis indicates that transcripts in human zzso as well as zzso cells in culture, contain primarily sequence specific for promoter zzso
