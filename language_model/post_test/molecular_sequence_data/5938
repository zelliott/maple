zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso are zzso toxins that kill human immune zzso We have obtained a zzso zzso zzso to a cell surface zzso present on zzso zzso cells that can inhibit zzso by both zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso target cell zzso yielded two zzso chains of approximate molecular masses of 100 and 170 zzso zzso of zzso peptides from the two proteins showed complete zzso with zzso and zzso the two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso binding experiments demonstrated the ability of an immobilized zzso to bind zzso zzso present in a zzso zzso of human zzso target zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso genes into a cell line zzso that is not sensitive to either zzso toxin resulted in zzso expressing cells, zzso that were sensitive to both zzso These experiments identify zzso as a cell surface zzso that mediates toxicity of members of this family of zzso zzso
