zzso zzso are involved in the synthesis of the zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso assembly of the repeating zzso unit of zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used as both zzso preparation and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid were used as sugar zzso A linear zzso unit is assembled on a zzso zzso carrier by the sequential addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso The in zzso synthesis of zzso was also accompanied by the incorporation of zzso into a zzso product, which was characterized as zzso on the basis of gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso reactions showed that essentially zzso is zzso In addition, the direction of chain zzso has been studied by in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso repeat units occurs by the successive transfer of the growing chain to a new zzso The reaction involves zzso of zzso at the reducing end of the zzso growing chain and zzso of zzso at the zzso position of the newly formed zzso zzso generating a zzso zzso with a zzso side zzso
