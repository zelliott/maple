zzso proteins play important roles in the organization and function of the early zzso zzso by participating in membrane traffic and selective transport of cargo between the zzso zzso zzso the intermediate compartment zzso and the zzso To identify new cycling zzso we have developed a novel procedure for the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso cells treated with zzso A, a drug known to accumulate cycling proteins in the zzso zzso enriched zzso over the zzso for zzso were obtained and analyzed by mass zzso Major proteins corresponded to established and putative cargo receptors and components zzso protein maturation and membrane zzso Among the zzso zzso a zzso protein termed zzso is a novel cycling membrane protein with sequence zzso to zzso and zzso two proteins enriched in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and partially zzso with the human zzso of zzso and zzso which mainly zzso to the zzso zzso interacts with human zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso and zzso experiments, and zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso increases the turnover of zzso We propose that zzso functions as a zzso of the zzso complex by stabilizing zzso Our novel approach for the isolation of the zzso from zzso cells may ultimately lead to the identification of all proteins rapidly cycling early in the zzso zzso
