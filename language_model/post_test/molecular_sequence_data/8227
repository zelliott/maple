A zzso zzso hormone zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso The mechanism underlying this phenomenon was previously suggested to be secondary to zzso zzso zzso C zzso in some zzso We zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and isolated cells zzso expressing zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the alpha zzso zzso production in the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and zzso production through zzso zzso with a zzso C zzso zzso (10 zzso abolished the zzso zzso calcium response, whereas it did not affect the zzso zzso zzso Treatment with various agents zzso zzso C zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso had little effect on the zzso zzso zzso The parent zzso and zzso alpha zzso cells contained similar amounts of zzso alpha zzso and 45 zzso respectively), as detected with zzso analysis, and exhibited similar zzso of zzso synthesis with zzso toxin and zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso alpha zzso cell zzso was also enhanced by zzso Furthermore, incubation of zzso alpha zzso cell zzso with zzso directed against the zzso portion of zzso alpha inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that the zzso zzso synthesis in zzso alpha zzso cells reflects direct stimulation of zzso zzso zzso the alpha zzso zzso production observed in some native zzso may involve the multiple mechanisms of the direct zzso of zzso zzso and a secondary effect through zzso of zzso zzso
