An insulin zzso zzso was constructed utilizing zzso zzso to delete the zzso basic zzso acid zzso site zzso zzso from the zzso zzso the human insulin zzso This zzso was zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso of metabolically labeled cells revealed a zzso zzso which bound to wheat germ zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso were also observed and contained approximately zzso as much protein as the zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso of intact metabolically labeled cells decreased the zzso band by zzso zzso studies revealed a zzso of 28 h for the zzso When cells were zzso with zzso zzso the zzso incorporated zzso as much label as the zzso alpha zzso in spite of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells at 37 degrees C for 20 zzso resulted in zzso of the labeled zzso but little labeled zzso becoming resistant to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso revealed that zzso of the processed labeled zzso but very little zzso contained zzso Thus, this zzso zzso is zzso zzso and expressed on the cell surface as zzso zzso although some processing to alpha and beta zzso still zzso It exhibits a markedly decreased affinity for insulin, and when insulin is bound to, demonstrates defective zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso is required not only for the development of high affinity binding sites, but also for normal zzso of the signal which activates the beta zzso zzso zzso
