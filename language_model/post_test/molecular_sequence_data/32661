zzso zzso elements zzso constitute the majority of sequences under zzso selection in the human zzso yet their function remains largely zzso Experimental evidence suggests that many of these elements play regulatory roles, but little is known about regulatory motifs contained within zzso Here we describe a systematic approach to discover and characterize regulatory motifs within zzso zzso by searching for long motifs zzso zzso with significant enrichment in zzso and studying their zzso and zzso zzso Our analysis identifies 233 long motifs zzso matching a total of approximately 60,000 zzso instances across the human zzso These motifs include 16 previously known regulatory zzso such as the zzso zzso motif and the zzso zzso element, as well as striking examples of novel functional zzso The most highly enriched motif zzso zzso to the zzso motif known from zzso and zzso We show that it is bound by the zzso protein and identify thousands of zzso motif instances, suggesting a broad role for the zzso family in gene zzso A second group of motifs zzso does not match any previously known zzso We demonstrate by zzso and zzso methods that it defines a binding site for the zzso zzso which is involved in zzso function to limit the spread of gene zzso We identify nearly 15,000 zzso sites that likely serve as zzso and we show that nearby genes separated by predicted zzso sites show markedly reduced correlation in gene zzso These sites may thus partition the human zzso into zzso of zzso
