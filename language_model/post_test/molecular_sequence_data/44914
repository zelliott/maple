We have previously shown that all zzso mice exposed to zzso zzso eventually develop oral cavity zzso cell zzso and two-thirds of these tumors have zzso zzso point zzso at zzso zzso Half of the tumors with zzso zzso have loss of zzso zzso at zzso In the study reported here, seven tumors with zzso at zzso six zzso for zzso and six without zzso zzso were analyzed to define the extent of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present in zzso mice were used as zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at zzso showed consistent zzso loss at the zzso portion of zzso zzso The boundary of zzso loss lay between the zzso and zzso beta chain zzso which are 6 zzso zzso None of the tumors that remained zzso for zzso or had no zzso zzso had evidence of zzso loss involving zzso zzso Because zzso was only detected in advanced zzso long after exposure to zzso had zzso we zzso that the zzso zzso by which zzso occurred were independent of the zzso zzso The development of zzso in only half of the tumors with zzso point zzso suggests that zzso was not caused by the initial zzso point zzso but was a highly selected event during zzso
