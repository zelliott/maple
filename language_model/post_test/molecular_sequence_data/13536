Four hundred zzso clones from rice zzso zzso zzso callus and root zzso libraries, with a high similarity to about 70 kinds of zzso proteins zzso in zzso as well as zzso organisms, were identified by their deduced zzso acid zzso Southern zzso of 114 independent zzso clones with total rice zzso DNA showed 77 distinct and specific zzso zzso Of the 77 clones representing the above zzso patterns, copies of 67 clones corresponding to 57 zzso could be estimated and, among these, only 6 clones were single zzso indicating that almost zzso of these zzso in rice were zzso by small zzso zzso zzso of 36 zzso genes could be mapped on the rice linkage map by using 30 full-length zzso clone sequences from specific zzso zzso Another 21 expressed gene zzso were mapped using 3' untranslated region specific zzso zzso amplified from the zzso zzso clones representing 17 of the zzso zzso gene zzso The above 57 zzso were mapped from 51 zzso clones and 41 of these zzso genes mapped to regions that did not show any zzso while in 5 cases, pairs of zzso genes zzso or linked zzso The zzso genes in rice were located throughout the 12 zzso and it was found that more than one copy within a zzso family may be expressed zzso
