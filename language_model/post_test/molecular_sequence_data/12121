A zzso synthetic gene zzso the human blood group B zzso which zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso to give the blood group B zzso Gal zzso zzso zzso (where R is a zzso or zzso has been expressed in zzso coli by replacing its zzso domain with an zzso bacterial zzso zzso The active zzso was zzso from the zzso using zzso affinity zzso and used in the synthesis of zzso amounts of the human blood group B zzso zzso The zzso specificity and zzso of the zzso zzso were comparable to the zzso from human zzso Thus we have achieved the construction of a completely synthetic zzso gene and its successful zzso
