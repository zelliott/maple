Drug resistance in zzso tuberculosis complex strains is solely due to zzso zzso that could affect bacterial zzso zzso epidemiology studies have shown that resistant strains are less likely to be clustered than susceptible zzso However, a few zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis complex strains have been described as causing outbreaks, suggesting that they have restored zzso or increased zzso One of the biggest zzso tuberculosis outbreaks documented to date was caused by the B strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso revealed that the B strain contains two copies of zzso Here, we mapped and zzso the regions zzso the two copies of zzso in the B zzso zzso zzso showed that one of these zzso copies is located within the promoter region of zzso a zzso regulator that is essential for zzso tuberculosis zzso We used zzso to screen 219 zzso zzso tuberculosis complex strains zzso of all zzso zzso isolated in Spain between 1998 and 2002 and found that the B strain was the only strain that contained a copy of zzso in the zzso zzso To determine whether zzso affects zzso promoter activity in the B strain, we individually cloned the zzso gene and its promoter region (including zzso from the B strain and the equivalent region from zzso tuberculosis without zzso as a zzso into a zzso zzso zzso and transformed zzso zzso with the resulting zzso zzso extension analysis showed that zzso zzso was strongly zzso when the promoter region contained zzso as in the case of the B zzso
