To characterize the types of zzso present in the zzso zzso genes of Malaysian zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of H zzso zzso was determined by E zzso zzso for point zzso in the domain V of zzso zzso genes in zzso and zzso strains were performed by sequence analysis of amplified zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso length zzso was performed using zzso and zzso zzso to detect restriction sites that zzso to the zzso in the zzso zzso 

Of zzso zzso from 120 patients, four were resistant to zzso while 183 were zzso The zzso of the resistant strains ranged from zzso to 24 zzso Two zzso had an zzso zzso and another two had zzso zzso A zzso zzso was detected in two out of four zzso zzso and in 13 of 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses with zzso and zzso were able to detect the zzso 

zzso resistance is an uncommon occurrence among Malaysian zzso of H zzso strains and the zzso zzso and zzso detected were associated with low-level zzso
