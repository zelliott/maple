The zzso early puff locus zzso to the zzso zzso and encodes a family of zzso factors whose members are induced by the zzso hormone zzso zzso in the br zzso group substantially reduce the levels of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of mature third zzso larvae but not in mature second zzso zzso zzso levels are normal in the central nervous system of the two zzso zzso The specificity of these effects suggests that a product of the zzso locus mediates the rapid appearance of zzso in mature third zzso larvae experiencing an elevated zzso of zzso The likely identity of this protein has been confirmed by pursuing the observation that the zzso zzso caused by the zzso of a P element into the zzso zzso zzso Both the transcript and a protein carrying this domain are present in the zzso and a zzso zzso protein carrying the zzso finger binds to the first zzso of the zzso zzso Five binding sites have been identified within the zzso by zzso I zzso and a core consensus sequence has been derived which shares some identity with the consensus binding site of the zzso protein to the zzso regulatory zzso Our demonstration that zzso is a target of zzso in the zzso is the first direct evidence of a role for this early gene in a tissue other than the zzso zzso The data reinforce the idea that zzso which clearly mediates a zzso zzso response to zzso may play a widespread role in the zzso zzso of gene zzso in other target zzso
