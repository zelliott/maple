zzso of zzso for zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, prevents induction of zzso and zzso D1 zzso and blocks zzso progression through the zzso phase of the cell zzso We devised an unbiased genetic screen to isolate genes that restore the ability of zzso to stimulate growth in cells that express zzso zzso zzso This screen led us to identify a truncated form of the zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This truncated protein lacks zzso 1 to zzso of zzso and is zzso zzso When we zzso cells expressing zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso D1 was restored and zzso cell proliferation was zzso zzso normally triggers the rapid disappearance of zzso zzso from the cell surface; however, zzso of cells with zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso expression on the cell surface, resulting in elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in zzso zzso and that the truncated zzso compensated for a zzso defective zzso by interfering with this zzso
