Small aquarium zzso become increasingly important in the study of normal zzso development and zzso zzso DNA zzso might play a role in these zzso In the zzso zzso a well-established animal model for melanoma formation, zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso has been zzso We have isolated a zzso for the zzso zzso from this zzso which encodes the first full-length protein from a fish zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso repression of the zzso melanoma zzso in healthy zzso As zzso has been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso might play a role by acting zzso or downstream of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso transcript is present in all adult zzso and cell lines zzso However, developing zzso show a zzso and temporally regulated expression pattern suggesting that the zzso might play a role during development in zzso
