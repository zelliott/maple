By specific zzso screening of a zzso zzso expression library, we identified a class of zzso derived from mouse cardiac zzso T zzso zzso with long zzso containing the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso These long zzso indicated the presence of a novel upstream zzso initiation site in the cardiac zzso zzso zzso extension mapping of the mouse cardiac zzso zzso confirmed an alternative zzso initiation site zzso pairs upstream of the major initiation zzso The upstream initiation site was found significantly more active in the zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing further revealed an zzso zzso sequence of the mouse cardiac zzso gene and relationships between the promoter regulatory elements and the alternative zzso initiation zzso
