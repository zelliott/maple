Single zzso acid zzso have been introduced throughout the zzso DNA binding region of the zzso zzso and the operator binding properties of the resulting zzso zzso have been zzso These studies show that the side chains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for high affinity binding to operator zzso Other side chains in the zzso region do not appear to play major roles in DNA recognition and zzso zzso zzso in the pattern of zzso protection afforded by the zzso zzso protein suggest that zzso contacts the zzso groups of zzso 10 and 12 in the zzso In conjunction with previous results, these findings suggest that part of the zzso region of zzso binds as an extended zzso strand within the major groove of the zzso zzso
