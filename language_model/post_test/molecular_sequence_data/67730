zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are primarily involved in diverse signaling processes by zzso signals from an activated zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso to appropriate downstream zzso within zzso The role of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and heat stress has been reported but the regulation of zzso zzso of plant zzso in response to zzso stress has not zzso been zzso In the present study we report the isolation of full-length zzso of two zzso of zzso zzso 282 zzso and zzso 453 zzso from rice zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso and described their transcript regulation in response to zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment and zzso comparison of zzso zzso of zzso rice zzso with other known plant zzso zzso zzso demonstrated high zzso to barley zzso while soybean zzso and zzso zzso were least zzso The numbers of the zzso and zzso were found to be similar between zzso and zzso but their sizes were zzso zzso of promoter sequences of zzso confirmed the presence of stress-related zzso signature motifs suggesting their active and possible independent roles in zzso stress zzso The transcript levels of zzso and zzso were zzso following zzso cold, heat and zzso zzso However, in drought stress only zzso was zzso Strong support by transcript profiling suggests that zzso zzso play a critical role via cross talk in signaling zzso These findings provide first direct evidence for roles of zzso zzso of rice zzso in regulation of zzso zzso These findings suggest the possible exploitation of zzso zzso of zzso machinery for promoting stress tolerance in zzso
