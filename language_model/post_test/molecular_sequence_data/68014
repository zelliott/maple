An index marker map of zzso 9 has been constructed using the Centre zzso du zzso zzso reference zzso The map comprises 26 zzso with a maximum zzso zzso of zzso zzso and only two intervals zzso 10 zzso Placement of all but one marker into the map was achieved with zzso zzso zzso The zzso length is 151 zzso with male length of 121 zzso and female length of 185 zzso The map extends to within zzso of physical length at the zzso and its coverage therefore is expected to be within zzso zzso of full map zzso The markers are all of the zzso repeat type and have average zzso zzso with a range of zzso The map shows both marked contraction of genetic distance relative to physical distance in the zzso region and expansion in the zzso zzso zzso data were carefully examined for errors by using the crossover routine of the program zzso Five new zzso were observed among zzso zzso events zzso There were two zzso events occurring within an zzso of zzso zzso and another eight were observed within an zzso of zzso zzso Many of these could be due to additional zzso events in which one parental zzso converted to the other by either gene conversion or random strand zzso When there was no correction for these possible zzso events, the number of crossovers displayed by the maternal and paternal zzso was significantly different zzso zzso zzso from that predicted by the zzso distribution, which would be expected in the absence of zzso In addition, the observed crossover distribution for zzso derived zzso was similar to that predicted from zzso zzso frequency zzso In all, the data strongly support the occurrence of strong positive interference on human zzso 9 and suggest that zzso markers at an zzso of zzso or zzso 20 zzso are generally sufficient for disease gene inheritance predictions in zzso genetic counseling by linkage zzso
