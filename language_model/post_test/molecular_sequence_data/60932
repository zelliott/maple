Rem belongs to a zzso of zzso zzso that includes zzso zzso and zzso These proteins are unique among the Ras zzso since their expression is under zzso regulation and they contain distinct zzso and zzso zzso To gain insight into the cellular function of zzso we have undertaken an expression screen using a mouse zzso zzso library to identify zzso proteins and find that Rem interacts with a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies demonstrate an interaction that is independent of the zzso state of zzso Rem is zzso in zzso and binding of Rem to zzso is abolished by zzso Rem with protein zzso zzso Thus, the association of Rem and zzso is zzso zzso of the interaction between zzso and various Rem deletion zzso mapped a critical binding site to the zzso of zzso Finally, we demonstrate the interaction of zzso but not the newly identified zzso protein with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may allow the recruitment of distinct proteins that participate in zzso signal zzso zzso
