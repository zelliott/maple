zzso of bacterial species and zzso is largely caused by horizontal transfer of diverse DNA elements such as zzso zzso and zzso islands zzso zzso islands, zzso A zzso called zzso island zzso carrying genes involved in zzso iron acquisition zzso zzso has previously been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been characterized as an essential zzso factor in these zzso zzso an zzso zzso is a widely distributed zzso zzso among zzso coli and other zzso which cause zzso zzso Here we report on the zzso of zzso coli strain zzso which is distinct from all other zzso described to date because the zzso zzso comprises an additional 35 zzso zzso at the right border compared to the zzso of other zzso coli and zzso zzso This part encodes for both a functional mating pair formation system and a zzso region related to zzso zzso of zzso zzso Upon induction of the zzso zzso the entire zzso of zzso is precisely excised and zzso The zzso of zzso presented here resembles zzso and zzso elements termed zzso It may represent the zzso of the zzso found in zzso zzso and zzso coli, revealing a missing link in the horizontal transfer of an element that contributes to microbial zzso upon zzso
