A chicken zzso library was screened with the human zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso and a zzso pair zzso containing the entire gene zzso this protein was isolated and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed that from the start to end of transcription, the zzso gene is zzso base pairs long and is comprised of 6 zzso ranging in size from 30 to zzso base zzso zzso of the putative cap site are both a zzso box and a zzso box as well as several zzso binding zzso The gene has an extremely high content of G and C zzso zzso in a zzso pair zzso starting 500 base pairs from the putative cap zzso This region zzso the definition of an zzso tiny zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that there is a single copy of this gene in zzso whereas Northern analysis revealed that a single transcript is being zzso from this zzso A comparison of the chicken and human zzso and protein sequences and subsequent calculation of the evolutionary rates indicated that zzso is a slowly evolving zzso The present article, which is the first study on the isolation and characterization of a complete gene coding for a high mobility group zzso zzso indicates that the gene has features characteristic of zzso zzso
