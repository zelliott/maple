To identify regions of zzso protein zzso important for the function of the protein and the binding of zzso zzso zzso we performed a zzso analysis of zzso zzso from all 10 zzso species analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dog, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and specifically bound zzso zzso zzso with high zzso Using the zzso chain reaction, zzso clones for zzso from six species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso show a high degree of identity to each other and to the published sequences for human and rat zzso Two regions of the protein are almost totally zzso among all of the species zzso This suggests that these regions have functional significance and may be involved in inhibitor zzso
