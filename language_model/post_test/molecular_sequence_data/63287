An investigation of the role of the zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso Forest virus zzso in determining zzso in infected mice was carried out by constructing zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sequences showed zzso differences between virulent and zzso strains at positions 21, 35 and zzso zzso zzso incorporating these changes were constructed from zzso zzso and zzso and virulent zzso virus, derived from infectious zzso and zzso A7 and zzso zzso stock zzso Survival rates and zzso in zzso zzso infected mice were zzso While no statistically significant difference between rates of zzso synthesis was detected between strains in cell culture, an increase in survival of infected mice and a reduction in the severity of brain zzso was observed on substitution of the zzso zzso from a stock zzso virus into an infectious clone where the remainder of the zzso was derived from zzso zzso However, substitution of a zzso zzso from an zzso stock virus into an infectious clone where the remainder of the zzso was from virulent virus did not affect zzso These results and other studies suggest that control of zzso is zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso in zzso with other zzso in the zzso
