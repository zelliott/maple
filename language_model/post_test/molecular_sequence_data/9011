zzso and zzso are key proteins in human zzso which, despite their similarities, have different behaviors upon DNA zzso Previous work has shown that unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso thus creating consequential negative zzso on the adjacent DNA, a property that is thought to lead to the stimulation of zzso invasion and was proposed to favor zzso DNA zzso In this report, we show that these activities, originating from the central zzso domain of zzso are also displayed by the zzso domain of zzso but are zzso in the full-length protein by the presence of an zzso domain at the zzso zzso a similar repression is observed on zzso through the binding of a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso proteins originate from a gradual extension of the coding sequences of a duplicated ancestral gene with a consequential progressive zzso of the zzso properties of these zzso Overall, these data suggest that the zzso of zzso and zzso have evolved to finely regulate their ability to zzso zzso
