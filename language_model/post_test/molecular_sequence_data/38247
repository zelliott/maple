A fully active analog of human zzso hormone zzso has been produced by zzso expression in zzso zzso Initially, a zzso sequence zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso gene in the zzso zzso for the eventual expression of a fusion protein of 137 zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene and 340 zzso downstream were deleted by an unknown mechanism during transformation of the zzso zzso This resulted in a new zzso zzso a small zzso zzso fusion product of zzso where X is a zzso zzso downstream sequence of zzso The fusion product was efficiently expressed and the zzso zzso zzso was readily released by acid zzso with a yield of 100 zzso This analog had an effective concentration for zzso zzso zzso stimulation zzso in rat zzso cells of 14 zzso which was identical to that for zzso In the zzso rat model of zzso zzso was fully active as a bone anabolic zzso
