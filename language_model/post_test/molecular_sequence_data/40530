zzso zzso is often a common site for bacterial zzso In zzso zzso two surface proteins that recognize zzso are zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso region of zzso have been shown to bind to human zzso while the zzso region of zzso zzso has been speculated to bind to bovine zzso This zzso region which is zzso in many of the zzso zzso strains was tested for binding to bovine zzso For this, zzso was zzso expressed and zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso experiments carried out with the zzso protein showed that zzso has the ability to bind to bovine zzso It was also observed that other than binding to the native form of zzso zzso also has the ability to bind to the zzso zzso when zzso On studying the influence of zzso on the zzso zzso binding it was observed that the addition of zzso in the zzso experiment greatly zzso the zzso When the primary structure of zzso was zzso it was seen that other than similarities with strains of the same zzso it does not have any similarity with any protein characterized so zzso In addition to this, its secondary structure component analysis by circular zzso revealed that it is composed mainly of alpha zzso and random coils unlike other zzso surface proteins where beta sheets are zzso zzso indeed is a novel protein and understanding the mechanism of its interaction with zzso would be useful in developing strategies to fight against infections by zzso
