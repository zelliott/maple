zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that regulate gene expression through zzso repression or zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso is a target of zzso Human zzso which is highly expressed in zzso target zzso zzso the zzso zzso of various zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso protein is abundant in zzso zzso We identified a near-perfect matching sequence with zzso in the zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso revealed that the reporter activity of the zzso containing the zzso recognition element was decreased in zzso cells zzso zzso but not in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso could decrease the zzso activity in zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso for zzso restored the zzso activity and increased the protein level and zzso activity of zzso zzso These results suggested that human zzso is zzso regulated by zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso protein in breast zzso and adjacent zzso zzso from 24 patients were zzso In most patients, the expression level of zzso was decreased in zzso zzso accompanied by a high level of zzso zzso A significant inverse association was observed between the expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the decreased expression of zzso would be one of causes of the high expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso This is the first study to show that zzso regulate not only essential genes for zzso events but also zzso zzso
