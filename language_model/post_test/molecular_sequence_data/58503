A hallmark of zzso is a high degree of species zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso To identify zzso plasma membrane zzso an zzso to zzso plasma zzso was produced in female guinea zzso The screening of a zzso zzso expression library with this zzso resulted in the isolation of two clones zzso a predicted protein containing two zzso zzso zzso a zzso segment, and an zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein (named zzso is closely related to a large family zzso zzso of putative cell zzso zzso zzso is first expressed by the zzso zzso and is localized to the plasma membrane zzso the zzso supportive of a role in cell zzso However, zzso expression in zzso cells does not result in zzso cell zzso or in zzso zzso to the infected insect cells, suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso The open reading frame of the two zzso clones predicts proteins of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso produced to zzso recognizes three zzso plasma membrane proteins on zzso (Mr zzso zzso and zzso but the lower molecular weight proteins are degradation zzso zzso confirmed that the Mr 55, zzso zzso plasma membrane represents the full-length protein zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso reaction does not appear to alter the molecular weight of zzso but does result in its loss from the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is likely involved in zzso interactions prior to interaction of zzso with the egg plasma zzso
