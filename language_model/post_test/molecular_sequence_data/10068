zzso zzso human zzso zzso has been zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This stable zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso and exhibits a zzso zzso 37 zzso zzso zzso 74 zzso and zzso zzso 24 zzso The sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso modification of zzso groups prompted evaluation of four zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso the zzso whereas zzso is stable but exhibits only approximately zzso changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a stable zzso which exhibits kinetic parameters comparable to those measured for zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whereas zzso is stable, exhibiting zzso diminution in zzso and elevated zzso values for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Such effects would be compatible with a role for zzso in interacting with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are stable zzso lacking substantial zzso zzso zzso The active sites of these zzso zzso are intact, based on their ability to bind a zzso zzso analog with zzso and equilibrium binding zzso that are comparable to those determined for zzso zzso Competitive displacement experiments demonstrate that the zzso zzso can bind zzso with zzso values that are comparable to estimates for zzso zzso The zzso diminution in zzso for the zzso zzso and the demonstration that they contain an otherwise intact active site support assignment of a crucial zzso role to zzso The assignment of zzso as the zzso base that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso acid would be compatible with the experimental zzso
