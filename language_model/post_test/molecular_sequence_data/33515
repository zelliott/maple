zzso zzso zzso zzso cells grown on zzso show increased expression of zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso Additionally, the zzso promoter contains a putative binding site for the zzso factor zzso which has been shown to regulate genes involved in zzso production such as zzso zzso and zzso We hypothesized that zzso a zzso protein of unknown function, is an additional source of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso and determined that zzso is an zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso is regulated by zzso in response to zzso induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in elevated zzso levels and increased resistance to zzso However, the presence of zzso in cells lacking the zzso branch of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in decreased zzso levels and increased zzso zzso These results suggest that in zzso cells zzso contributes to zzso production as an alternative source of zzso
