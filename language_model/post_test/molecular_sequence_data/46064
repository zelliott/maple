We previously identified a zzso mast cell zzso lineage and now aim to determine if these cells function zzso in innate and zzso immunity like their zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of compound zzso or live zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso zzso evident zzso and by increased plasma zzso compared with zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso these responses zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso heavy zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso on zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso a zzso marker, with zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected zzso with matched zzso mouse zzso zzso and zzso or zzso mouse zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated increased plasma zzso compared with mismatched controls zzso zzso zzso These results confirm functional conservation and validate the zzso model as an in zzso screening tool for novel zzso modulating zzso
