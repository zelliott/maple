zzso zzso receptors zzso participate in the zzso of zzso in higher zzso by transporting soluble acid zzso from the zzso network to late zzso zzso The receptors release their zzso into the zzso environment of the late zzso and then return to the zzso network to repeat the zzso However, the mechanism that zzso zzso binding and zzso upon changes in pH is not zzso We report the crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso form at pH zzso A comparison of the zzso and zzso structures reveals a significant change in zzso structure as well as a reorganization of the binding pocket, with the most prominent change being the relocation of a loop zzso zzso The movements involved in the zzso transition of the zzso zzso are reminiscent of those of the zzso zzso zzso These results allow us to propose a mechanism by which the zzso regulates its zzso binding upon changes in zzso the zzso of zzso appears to be responsible for zzso release in the zzso environment of the late zzso zzso and the zzso values of the sugar zzso and zzso are accountable for its inability to bind zzso at the cell surface where the pH is about zzso
