Few studies have addressed the consequences of physical interactions between zzso and T cells, as well as physical interactions among zzso cells zzso We show in this study that zzso cells can enhance T cell zzso and proliferation in response to zzso zzso and specific zzso through interactions between zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso on T zzso Furthermore, zzso interactions between zzso cells also enhanced proliferation of zzso cells in response to zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso cells augment the proliferation of neighboring T and zzso cells through direct zzso zzso These results provide new insights into zzso zzso control of innate and zzso immunity and demonstrate that zzso cross talk between zzso may occur in settings other than zzso cell or zzso cell zzso
