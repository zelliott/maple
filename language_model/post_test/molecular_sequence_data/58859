zzso recognize a wide variety of zzso through highly diverse zzso zzso known as zzso receptors zzso These zzso zzso are composed of alpha and beta or gamma and delta zzso chains consisting of variable zzso and constant zzso zzso zzso associated with at least four zzso chains to form the zzso zzso It is well established that alpha beta zzso recognize zzso in the form of peptides bound to molecules of the major zzso complex zzso zzso information on the three-dimensional structure of alpha beta zzso has recently become available through X-ray zzso In contrast, the zzso specificity of gamma delta zzso is much less well understood and their three-dimensional structure is zzso We have cloned the delta chain of a human zzso specific for the zzso class I zzso zzso and expressed the V domain as a zzso protein in the zzso space of zzso zzso Following affinity zzso using a zzso zzso zzso the zzso V delta domain was zzso in a form suitable for X-ray zzso zzso The zzso are zzso space group zzso with unit cell dimensions a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso and zzso to beyond zzso A zzso The ability of a V delta domain produced in bacteria to form zzso zzso strongly suggests that the zzso space can provide a suitable environment for the correct in zzso folding of gamma delta zzso
