The zzso zzso zzso (also designated zzso and zzso is a zzso for fusion and entry of T zzso strains of zzso zzso is expressed in various cell zzso however, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of its expression remain zzso To delineate these mechanisms, approximately zzso zzso of DNA from the immediate zzso upstream region of zzso gene was zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso using zzso zzso gene reporter zzso revealed that stimulation with zzso plus zzso zzso the zzso promoter activity in the zzso zzso T cell line and zzso and that a DNA zzso from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site contributes markedly to the zzso and induced zzso This zzso contains a consensus zzso box, two potential zzso boxes, and a potential nuclear respiratory factor zzso binding site, which were confirmed by gel mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that a zzso site is especially important for the zzso and induced activity of the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso further revealed that stimulation of zzso with either zzso or zzso to zzso and zzso enhances the zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso promoter activity by T cell stimulation suggests that zzso of zzso may be one of the mechanisms zzso immune zzso and/or zzso of the zzso network zzso zzso expression and replication and thus contribute to the progression of zzso zzso
