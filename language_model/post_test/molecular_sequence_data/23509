To determine how population structure of the host species affects the spread of zzso elements and to assess the strength of selection acting on different structural regions, we zzso P elements from strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sampled from across the zzso of these zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited considerable sequence variation, and similarity among them was correlated to geographic distance between collection zzso By contrast, all zzso zzso elements sampled were essentially identical zzso zzso zzso and exhibited patterns typical of a recent population zzso While the zzso P elements sampled from zzso zzso appear to be long-time residents in that species, a rapid expansion of a very young zzso zzso lineage is suggested in zzso zzso overcoming barriers such as large geographical distances and moderate levels of population zzso zzso comparisons reveal selective constraints on zzso evolution, as indicated by significantly different substitution rates in zzso silent, and replacement zzso Most zzso in addition to replacement sites, selection pressure appears to be strong in the first and third zzso and in the 3' and zzso zzso zzso
