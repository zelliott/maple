Because zzso zzso of all animal species have the same zzso group, differences in their properties, including oxygen zzso zzso mobility, and pH sensitivity, must result from the interaction of the prosthetic group with specific zzso acid zzso in the primary zzso For this reason, fish zzso have been the object of extensive studies in the past few years, not only for their structural characteristics but also because they offer the possibility to investigate the evolutionary history of zzso in marine and freshwater species living in a large variety of environmental zzso For such a purpose, zzso analysis of zzso sequences can be combined with knowledge of the zzso relationships between zzso In addition, Type I zzso analysis is aimed toward predicting the zzso acid zzso that are more likely responsible for zzso diversification of different zzso zzso These zzso mapped on the three-dimensional zzso structure, can provide insights into functional and structural zzso
