zzso proteins serve as regulators of plant development and often form zzso and higher order complexes to zzso zzso expression of zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a key component in the evolution of the inflated zzso syndrome in zzso but zzso studies demonstrate that zzso has also acquired a role in male fertility in zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we have now identified numerous zzso zzso proteins from zzso including zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among the many zzso proteins recovered was a zzso of zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso protein known to be involved in many zzso processes including germ cell zzso Two zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso Both copies were found to be zzso in leaves, zzso and, albeit at lower level, also in roots, zzso and zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that, although the coding sequences of the 2 genes are highly zzso they differ substantially in their zzso and promoter zzso zzso screening of a zzso expression library with both zzso and zzso as zzso yielded numerous gene products, including an zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein that forms part of various zzso expression zzso The function of zzso and 2 zzso proteins in ensuring male fertility and evolution of zzso development in zzso is zzso
