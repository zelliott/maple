Using zzso zzso we have identified and cloned a novel zzso human zzso which we have designated zzso (pronounced zzso This apparently full-length zzso of zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso base pairs and the capacity to zzso a protein of zzso molecular zzso The zzso contains regions zzso to the highly zzso zzso protein zzso domain of other zzso and growth factor receptors but lacks a clear zzso region, indicating that it encodes a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso resembles that of zzso Our data indicate that the protein product of zzso zzso zzso to a previously reported cellular zzso zzso detected with a zzso zzso zzso
