The possibility of preventing infectious diseases by employing zzso vaccine is rapidly growing as a consequence of the new technologies in zzso DNA and protein zzso However, the increasing number of synthetic and zzso zzso further stresses the role of appropriate zzso to ensure zzso vaccine activity and the protection of all zzso Several approaches can be applied to develop safe and effective agents capable of enhancing specific immune responses which can then protect the host from the zzso Among others, the direct use as zzso of those zzso which are induced in animals by the classical zzso zzso has recently become a matter of zzso In particular, zzso 1 zzso has been shown to possess zzso activity for a variety of infectious and zzso zzso However, the numerous side effects associated with the zzso action of zzso represent a serious disadvantage for its use as a vaccine zzso It was therefore of great interest that a zzso contained in the zzso beta sequence zzso zzso corresponding to the sequence zzso is devoid of all zzso activities but maintains the zzso activity of the whole zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso was successfully employed in animals to zzso the specific immune response against zzso cellular zzso T zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as synthetic zzso preparations derived from human zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso have been successfully used in zzso vaccines in experimental zzso It can therefore be concluded that zzso zzso is potentially a good candidate as vaccine zzso for human zzso
