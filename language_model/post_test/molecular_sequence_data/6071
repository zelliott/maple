The ubiquitous zzso of the zzso gene zzso in the central nervous system has led to the search for downstream genes which are regulated by its product, zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso induction by a single injection of the classical antipsychotic zzso may contribute to the subsequent increase in zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso with this proposal, in the present study zzso zzso zzso and zzso N zzso zzso were found to be expressed by the same population of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso complimentary either to bases zzso or zzso of zzso attenuated the subsequent increase in zzso N zzso zzso However, injection of a sense zzso zzso corresponding to bases zzso of zzso did not reduce zzso zzso or zzso N zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso was not reduced by either the sense or zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the sense and zzso zzso zzso failed to reduce zzso zzso zzso which is located in the same zzso zzso that express zzso zzso N zzso zzso which is located in the same zzso zzso that express zzso zzso N zzso zzso Lastly, zzso increases in nerve growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not decreased by zzso injection of either the sense or zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso N expression by selectively reducing zzso expression and emphasize the potential importance of zzso gene induction in the mechanism of action of this antipsychotic zzso
