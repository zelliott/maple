We isolated zzso zzso from populations of the threatened zzso zzso zzso In zzso observations of the zzso the zzso had a flattened zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso bordered by an internal zzso zone, identical to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso fungus of many zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso did not fuse with those of known tester strains of zzso zzso and grew less than half as fast as those of zzso zzso In zzso zzso sequences for zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso regions of the zzso were distinct from those of the zzso identified species of zzso On the basis of the ITS zzso the zzso clustered into two groups that corresponded exactly with the zzso demonstrated for other zzso zzso from zzso and North America despite the geographical zzso suggesting high specificity in the zzso zzso In addition, the two zzso groups corresponded to two different plant clones at different zzso zzso The zzso from one clone constituted one group and did not belong to the other zzso group isolated from the other zzso The possibility of switching to a new zzso partner during the zzso lifetime is zzso
