The zzso of zzso groups is one of the most common zzso modifications of naturally occurring stable zzso zzso Some zzso species have a zzso zzso at the first position of the zzso and it was suggested that this modification zzso the zzso zzso However, no zzso species have been found to have the modification at the second or third position of the zzso In the present study, we measured the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso efficiencies of the zzso zzso of the unmodified forms of zzso coli zzso using a zzso protein synthesis zzso The modification of C in the first position of the zzso into zzso increased the efficiency of reading the zzso zzso On the other hand, the modifications of the second and/or third positions were zzso to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso groups at the second and third positions of the zzso may have some role in the translation reaction, and this may be the reason why zzso zzso are not found in these positions within natural zzso zzso
