We have isolated the zzso gene by zzso screening with, as zzso zzso (formerly zzso which encodes a zzso chain zzso residing in the regulatory particle of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the regulatory particle of the zzso zzso but the deletion of this gene results in zzso zzso At the restrictive temperature, the zzso strain accumulated zzso zzso indicating that the zzso function is needed for the zzso zzso activity at a higher zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso separated by zzso density zzso zzso by native zzso gel zzso and found that a smaller amount of the zzso zzso was produced in the zzso cells and that the zzso zzso was shifted to lighter zzso than zzso The incomplete zzso complexes were found to accumulate in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was not detected in the zzso containing zzso of the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is needed for incorporating zzso into the zzso zzso and that zzso zzso in the assembly and/or stability of the zzso zzso
