A 30 zzso zzso region containing the zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso gene zzso DNA sequence analysis of the region upstream to the zzso gene revealed the presence of an open reading frame zzso which coded for a zzso protein highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso The identification of this zzso as the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso has been carried out using three different zzso zzso zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso in zzso synthesis of zzso at 60 degrees C by a zzso extract of an zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso gene is transcribed zzso from zzso in a zzso zzso zzso which probably also includes a zzso zzso gene zzso identified at its 3' zzso As the products of both the zzso and the zzso genes are main components of the cell envelope of zzso zzso their unusual zzso in the zzso could be related to the existence of specific mechanisms for their coordinate zzso
