The zzso locus controls mating and sexual development in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the genes that zzso mating behavior comprise dissimilar DNA sequences zzso in the mat a and mat A mating zzso In the zzso fungus zzso zzso sequences corresponding to both zzso are located zzso in the zzso zzso which contains one zzso zzso zzso zzso that includes sequences which are similar to sequences found at the mat A and mat a zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we describe the comparative zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso and the corresponding region of the zzso zzso mat a zzso By means of zzso experiments, we identified novel intervening sequences in the zzso zzso of both zzso and, zzso concluded that an additional ORF, zzso a putative zzso of 79 zzso zzso is present in the zzso zzso mat a zzso Furthermore, our analysis revealed zzso of the novel gene with the mat zzso gene in zzso zzso The same mode of zzso was found in the corresponding zzso region of zzso zzso where the zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso with the mat zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso zzso revealed optional zzso of two zzso We believe that this is the first report of zzso of zzso nuclear genes in zzso zzso zzso functions of the novel zzso in regulating zzso gene expression are zzso
