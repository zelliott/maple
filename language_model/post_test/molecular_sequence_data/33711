Complete zzso stationary night zzso zzso is associated with loss of function of rod and cone ON bipolar cells in the zzso zzso In humans, zzso in zzso and zzso have been shown to cause the zzso Through the analysis of a zzso family and screening of nine additional zzso we have identified three families with zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso transient zzso potential zzso channel, zzso M, member 1, also known as zzso A number of other zzso of unknown significance were zzso All patients had zzso reduced central vision, zzso and zzso evidence of ON bipolar cell zzso None had abnormalities of skin zzso although other skin conditions were zzso zzso derived from human zzso and skin was analyzed and alternate zzso zzso were zzso The most zzso zzso is likely to harbor an initiation zzso and the protein sequence is highly zzso across zzso zzso These findings suggest an important role of this specific zzso channel for the normal function of ON bipolar cells in the human zzso
