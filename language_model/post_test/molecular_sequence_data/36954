zzso of a human zzso cell line established from a zzso zzso contained several proteins with putative growth regulating zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso reverse phase zzso zzso and zzso sequencing of zzso peptides resulted in characterization of beta zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso (6 zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso 21 zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso of resulting peptides revealed zzso binding inhibitor zzso 8 zzso and melanoma zzso activity zzso 11 zzso The zzso of beta zzso as part of the zzso I complex may be related to impaired zzso zzso immune zzso zzso may play a role in zzso or zzso of zzso proteins or zzso zzso As zzso cells respond in a zzso manner to zzso zzso may interfere with growth regulation zzso by zzso zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso functions, which are required for degradation of collagen type IV and zzso zzso zzso is clearly associated with a proliferation zzso effect on zzso zzso In conclusion, although this zzso shows a degree of zzso several proteins with putative functions at different cellular levels were identified, related to proliferation as well as to the type of zzso
