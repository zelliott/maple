zzso zzso a highly toxic compound that has recently attracted much attention as an environmental zzso elicits a variety of toxic zzso zzso if not all, of the toxic effects of zzso are thought to result from zzso of gene zzso zzso acts through both zzso and zzso mechanisms to alter gene expression of many zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are examples of the genes zzso zzso by zzso by zzso zzso While effects of zzso on zzso have been extensively zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso changes in zzso stability are poorly zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso factors involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso study showed that a liver zzso protein of 50 zzso zzso selectively recognized the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We also showed that the zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso through a protein zzso cascade but not via de zzso protein zzso This is the first study to show the presence of the zzso zzso binding activity which may be involved in zzso stabilization of zzso
