An association has been reported between zzso in the zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso gene zzso determining region zzso and zzso efficacy in zzso C virus zzso zzso This relationship was analyzed in chronic zzso zzso Forty patients with zzso and 35 with zzso were treated with zzso zzso for 6 months with a total dose of zzso to 860 million zzso zzso zzso sequences were determined by direct zzso A higher complete and sustained response rate was observed in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso levels were lower in complete zzso than zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso acid zzso was greater in complete zzso than zzso in zzso (the region corresponding to the zzso of zzso alone zzso zzso or zzso consisting of zzso plus its upstream region zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso A significant inverse correlation was observed between serum zzso levels and the number of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso With zzso analysis, the number of zzso in zzso was an independent predictor for complete response in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso efficacy is associated with zzso acid variations in the zzso protein in zzso zzso
