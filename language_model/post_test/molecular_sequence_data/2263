zzso initiated in the region immediately upstream from the human zzso zzso gene but transcribed from the opposite strand have been identified in human zzso These divergent upstream transcripts are zzso start at 89 base pairs upstream from the zzso zzso major initiation site, and are composed of two species of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso We have isolated complementary DNA clones derived from the divergent transcripts and identified a zzso open reading frame in one of these zzso zzso sequence analyses have shown that there is no significant sequence zzso between the putative zzso acid sequence and known protein zzso This arrangement of two divergent zzso units suggests that the expression of these two genes may be regulated by a zzso promoter with common sequence zzso
