zzso zzso channel toxins are a large family of zzso with a similar structure but diverse pharmacological zzso Despite many structural and functional data available at present, little progress has been made in understanding the zzso molecular basis responsible for the functional zzso In this paper, we report the first complete zzso sequences of toxins belonging to zzso 6 and identify five new members, called zzso zzso By analyzing the rates of zzso that occurred in the corresponding zzso we suggest that accelerated evolution in zzso regions may be associated with the functional diversification of this zzso To pinpoint sites probably involved in the functional diversity of zzso family, we analyzed this family of sequences using the evolutionary trace zzso This analysis highlighted one zzso surface common for all the zzso This surface is composed of one zzso zzso zzso at position 29 assisted by other zzso at positions 10, 26, 27, 32, 34, and zzso Of them, the positions 29, 32, and 34 have been reported to be the most major zzso of channel zzso Interestingly, another contrary surface was also observed at a higher evolutionary time zzso value, which may be involved in the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The good match between the trace zzso and the functional zzso of the toxins suggested that the evolutionary trace results reported here can be applied to predict zzso sites of the zzso Because, the zzso variation in the trace positions is strongly linked with the functional zzso and zzso surface transfer of zzso family, we conclude that our findings should also be important for the rational design of new toxins targeting a given zzso channel with high zzso
