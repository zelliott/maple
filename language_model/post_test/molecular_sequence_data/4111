To identify human single chain zzso zzso zzso against zzso C viral zzso zzso and its value zzso 

The zzso zzso were panned by zzso zzso which was coated in a zzso zzso After five rounds of zzso 56 zzso clones were identified specific to zzso zzso The affinity and specificity of zzso were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso 

The data of zzso DNA zzso and DNA sequencing showed that the zzso gene was composed of zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that the human single chain zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso had a specific combination character with zzso C virus zzso zzso 

zzso having a zzso affinity and specificity and being easy to zzso is valuable in the detection of zzso zzso zzso
