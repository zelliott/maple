A zzso zzso identical to the primary sequence of domain I segment 3 zzso of rat brain sodium channel I, was zzso With the patch clamp zzso technique, single channel currents could be recorded from the patches of cultured rat zzso zzso when the patches were held at zzso zzso and the zzso solution contained zzso and 1 zzso zzso indicating that zzso incorporated into the zzso and formed zzso zzso The single channel zzso of zzso channels were distributed zzso but mainly in the range of zzso zzso There was a tendency that the mean open time and open probability of zzso channels increased and the mean close time decreased with the increasing of zzso membrane zzso zzso channels are highly selective for zzso and zzso but not for zzso and zzso similar to the authentic zzso zzso
