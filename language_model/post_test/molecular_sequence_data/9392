zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity is an established zzso of exposure to zzso poisons zzso zzso of activity is due to zzso binding of the zzso to the active site zzso Mass zzso has made it possible to monitor zzso exposure by analyzing zzso zzso on zzso in proteins that have no active site zzso Our goal was to test the hypothesis that zzso may serve as a zzso of zzso exposure in zzso A zzso mass zzso strategy to analyze zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso at pH zzso The zzso zzso from a reverse phase zzso column with zzso zzso The fragmentation spectrum of the zzso zzso precursor zzso confirmed its identity as zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso treated mouse zzso after digesting the protein with zzso Mice zzso per zzso were treated with a nontoxic dose of zzso zzso (3 zzso and a toxic dose (10 zzso zzso The zzso zzso plasma yielded zzso up to 120 h after treatment with 3 zzso zzso zzso and up to 144 h after 10 zzso In contrast plasma zzso activity returned to normal after zzso zzso In conclusion zzso mass zzso can be used to diagnose exposure to zzso zzso days after zzso zzso zzso are zzso
