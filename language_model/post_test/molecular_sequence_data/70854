Since plants are emerging as an important system for the expression of zzso zzso especially those intended for therapeutic purposes, it is important to scrutinize to what extent zzso zzso by zzso zzso produced in transgenic plants differ from their natural zzso We report here the first detailed analysis of the zzso of a functional zzso zzso expressed in a transgenic zzso The structures of the zzso zzso attached to the heavy chains of the zzso zzso Guy's 13 produced in transgenic tobacco plants zzso Guy's zzso were identified and compared to those found in the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso sites located on the heavy chain of the zzso Guy's 13 are zzso as in zzso However, the number of Guy's 13 zzso is higher in the plant than in the zzso expression zzso Despite the high structural diversity of the zzso zzso zzso appears to be sufficient for the production of a soluble and biologically active zzso in the plant zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso have zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso linked to the core zzso These zzso zzso structures are not a limitation to the use of zzso Guy's 13 for topical zzso However, their zzso may raise concerns for systemic applications of zzso in zzso
