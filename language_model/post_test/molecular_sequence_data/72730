A mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso for its ability to act as a zzso zzso zzso The metal depletion of a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein showed that zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso protein is a zzso factor zzso The zzso interference zzso showed the specific interactions of zzso with the zzso zzso present on the mouse zzso zzso zzso Point zzso of the zzso nullified the zzso properties of this zzso In mouse zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso complex zzso with zzso properties similar to those of zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso were able to specifically recognize zzso in zzso zzso Competition analysis of zzso proteins from mouse zzso cells with zzso matching the binding sites for zzso and zzso confirmed that both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso interact with the zzso zzso The significance of mutual interactions with the zzso promoter regions of either zzso or zzso zzso factors is zzso
