The mechanisms underlying completion of zzso are still poorly zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso Citron zzso is essential for the final events of the zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were defective in both zzso and zzso zzso In both cell types, early zzso events such as central zzso assembly and zzso ring formation were completely zzso Moreover, zzso rings zzso zzso leading to complete zzso zzso However late zzso of both cell types displayed persistent zzso associated with zzso F zzso and zzso zzso Similar defects were observed in zzso zzso interference zzso zzso which, in addition to abnormal F zzso and zzso rings, also displayed zzso membrane zzso at the zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso in the zzso gene result in zzso abnormal zzso bridges and in delayed resolution of these structures, suggesting that the zzso function of zzso is required for zzso at the end of zzso The zzso of zzso cells is different from those observed in most zzso zzso zzso but extraordinarily similar to that caused by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are in the same zzso for completion of zzso
