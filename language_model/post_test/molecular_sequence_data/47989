The zzso gene region was zzso in 51 lines of zzso zzso Lines differ in their zzso arrangement for segment I of the O zzso zzso and zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein exhibits much more variation than previously detected by zzso The zzso acid replacements responsible for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are different within zzso and within zzso which zzso all previous studies on linkage zzso between zzso and zzso zzso at this zzso The zzso zzso within zzso has a recent origin, while both zzso zzso are rather zzso zzso of zzso variation are higher within the zzso than within the zzso arrangement except for zzso zzso The McDonald and zzso test shows a significant excess of zzso zzso within zzso when zzso zzso is used as the zzso According to the nearly neutral model of molecular evolution, this excess is consistent with a smaller effective size of zzso relative to zzso zzso A smaller population size, a lower zzso and a more recent bottleneck might be contributing to the smaller effective size of zzso
