A zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis was functionally zzso The zzso shows zzso zzso activity using a zzso zzso system as electron zzso and zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso It reduces zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso and resolving zzso zzso zzso are critical zzso acids for zzso zzso The X-ray structure determined to a resolution of zzso A shows a zzso fold similar to that of other zzso family zzso zzso with structural zzso in oxidized and reduced forms indicates that the zzso tuberculosis zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the short distance that separates the zzso atoms of zzso and zzso and the location of these zzso zzso in zzso regions may indicate that the zzso tuberculosis zzso is zzso though the zzso of zzso is poorly zzso It is solely in the reduced zzso zzso zzso structure that both zzso are part of two distinct zzso zzso The zzso tuberculosis zzso is zzso both in solution and in the crystal zzso zzso acid zzso from both zzso delineate the active site zzso
