Within the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso the zzso defined by the beta chain known as zzso or zzso zzso is known to contain two individual zzso These are the zzso complex of zzso where the alpha chain of the zzso is zzso and the zzso zzso zzso containing the alpha V zzso The presence of either zzso and/or the zzso on blood zzso has been zzso We have investigated this problem by performing zzso and zzso studies with rabbit and zzso zzso zzso to each of the zzso of zzso and the zzso On cultured cells of different origin, it was established that almost all expressed the zzso but none had zzso and the only zzso associated with beta 3 was alpha zzso zzso expressed predominantly zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso freshly isolated from blood did not express the zzso but bore on their surface a modified form of zzso This zzso appeared identical to zzso but an zzso on zzso was masked on the intact cell and was only revealed after zzso We have termed this modified form of zzso zzso With differentiation in culture, zzso rapidly lost surface zzso and zzso began to express the zzso Evidence is presented that zzso is derived from particles released by activated zzso and is bound firmly to the zzso zzso Its primary function does not seem to be to mediate attachment to zzso zzso thus, although zzso cells bearing zzso zzso bound zzso in an zzso manner, isolated blood zzso did zzso It is suggested that this transfer of membrane proteins from zzso to zzso and zzso may regulate the expression of the zzso zzso and also serve as a means of zzso zzso zzso zzso
