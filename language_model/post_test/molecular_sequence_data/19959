zzso at contributing to the development of potential zzso agents, we report on the concept and design of two zzso models, which mimic the zzso zzso of zzso and incorporate Met into their sequences to validate its role as zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso of both models cover about the half of the surface, while the positively and zzso charged zzso constitute two separate clusters on the zzso zzso zzso groups were introduced into the zzso groups at positions 3 and 17 to contribute to the zzso character of the peptides and stabilize the zzso face of the zzso zzso study by the combined application of zzso and molecular dynamics simulations, CD, zzso and zzso zzso revealed that model 1 adopts zzso zzso and Met is well exposed to the zzso Model 2 that derives from model 1 by exchanging zzso zzso 1) with zzso and zzso zzso 1) with zzso also displays zzso zzso while Met is rather zzso zzso experiments indicated that model 1 exhibits a zzso more potent zzso activity towards LDL zzso compared to model 2, confirming the role of Met, when is devoid of zzso zzso as zzso scavenger for the protection of zzso
