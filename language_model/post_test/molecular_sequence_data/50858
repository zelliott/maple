zzso synthesis in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso by addition of zzso zzso to the culture medium as a soluble zzso This zzso activity of zzso appeared only when the cells were cultured over their saturated zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso cell attachment site of zzso could not prevent the stimulation of protein zzso Moreover, activity of the zzso zzso was not affected by inclusion of zzso B, which is known to release zzso from cell surface by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the signaling of change in protein synthesis rate by zzso may be distinct from signaling involving cell attachment and zzso
