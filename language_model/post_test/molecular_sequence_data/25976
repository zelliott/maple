zzso consisting of egg zzso zzso and zzso peptides zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with various zzso chain lengths were prepared by the zzso zzso The zzso of the peptides incorporated into the zzso was examined by CD zzso All the peptides incorporated assumed zzso zzso zzso analyses of the peptides and lipids in the zzso showed that the concentration of the peptides with a positive charge at the zzso in the zzso decreased markedly as the zzso chain length increased, reaching zero for the peptides over zzso zzso zzso The peptides without a positive charge were hardly incorporated into the zzso zzso attenuated reflection zzso of multilayered zzso containing the peptides suggests that the axis of the zzso zzso rods is oriented in parallel with the molecular axis of lipids in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso peptides can be incorporated into the zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso the rods of which have a length comparable to the thickness of the zzso zzso and the zzso positive charge of the peptides is essential for the stable zzso incorporated into the zzso
