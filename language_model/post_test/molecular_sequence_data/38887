The aim of the present study is to understand the structural features responsible for the lethal activity of snake zzso zzso zzso of the lethal potency of the five zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of Taiwan zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that the lethal potency of zzso I and zzso V are about twice of that exhibited by zzso II, zzso III, and zzso zzso In the present study, the solution structure of zzso V has been determined at high resolution using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso simulated zzso zzso zzso of the high resolution solution structures of zzso V with that of zzso IV reveals that the secondary structural elements in both the toxin zzso consist of a triple and zzso zzso zzso zzso Critical examination of the three-dimensional structure of zzso V shows that the zzso at the tip of zzso III form a distinct zzso projection zzso of zzso zzso The occurrence of the zzso zzso projection leads to the formation of a prominent zzso between the zzso located at the tip of zzso II and zzso Interestingly, the occurrence of a backbone hydrogen bonding zzso to zzso in zzso IV is found to distort the zzso projection and consequently diminish the zzso formation at the tip of zzso II and zzso zzso of the solution structures and lethal zzso of other zzso zzso isolated from the Taiwan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that a strong correlation exists between the lethal potency and occurrence of the zzso zzso projection at the tip of zzso zzso Critical analysis of the structures of the various zzso zzso from the Taiwan zzso suggest that the degree of exposure of the zzso charge (to the zzso contributed by the zzso zzso zzso at position 44 on the convex side of the zzso molecules could be another crucial factor governing their lethal zzso
