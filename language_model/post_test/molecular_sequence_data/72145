The location and environment of the acquired zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso were investigated in a Japanese zzso zzso clinical isolate zzso zzso that produced the zzso In this zzso zzso was carried on a zzso zzso and similar to the identical zzso found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso clinical zzso it was located on a mobile gene cassette inserted into an zzso The entire structure of this zzso named zzso was zzso zzso is a class 1 element belonging to the same group of defective zzso derivatives that originated from zzso ancestors such as zzso zzso and zzso The general structure of zzso appeared to be most closely related to that of zzso from zzso suggesting a recent common zzso for these two zzso In zzso the zzso cassette is the first of an array of five gene zzso that also includes an zzso cassette and three original zzso that have never been described in other zzso The novel zzso zzso respectively, zzso a new zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family, zzso a zzso zzso zzso a new member of the small zzso resistance family of zzso and zzso an open reading frame zzso a protein of unknown zzso All the resistance genes carried on zzso inserted in zzso were found to be functional in decreasing the in zzso zzso of host strains to the corresponding zzso zzso
