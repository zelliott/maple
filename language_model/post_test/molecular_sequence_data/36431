Many bacterial responses to environmental stimuli are zzso by response regulators which zzso regulate genes involved in particular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify by the zzso chain reaction zzso fragments from genes zzso zzso novel response zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso gene fragments had been amplified from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that a zzso sequence had been amplified from zzso zzso Four amplified fragments from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis and zzso coli clearly came from response regulator zzso but were not closely related to any of the known zzso zzso of the newly identified genes should allow us to determine their function and the genes under their zzso
