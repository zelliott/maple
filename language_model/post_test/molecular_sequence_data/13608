The zzso of high density zzso zzso modified by treatment with zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso was studied in a competitive zzso using 6 different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The competition tests have shown that after zzso treatment the zzso of selected zzso of zzso zzso changed in different zzso While the binding behavior of two zzso remained zzso three zzso exhibited decreased zzso after zzso zzso In contrast to the latter zzso the zzso of an zzso located on the zzso zzso zzso 4 of zzso zzso increased with the degree of zzso A loss of zzso zzso from HDL as a consequence of zzso did not occur as shown by the determination of the zzso zzso concentration in HDL before and after treatment with zzso Using overlapped synthetic zzso it could be shown that the zzso increasingly exposed on the particle surface of zzso HDL consists of the zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are characterized by high zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso Furthermore, these regions belong partially to the proposed zzso domain of zzso zzso Thus, an increased zzso of this zzso might result in elevated cellular binding affinities of HDL occurring after modification of zzso by zzso
