The specific binding of zzso zzso zzso to the hinge region of the zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso 1 zzso can have significant consequences on its ability to zzso into the corresponding extended duplex zzso zzso The binding zzso and the effects on the zzso process were investigated in zzso by a concerted strategy involving ad hoc zzso zzso and zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso which enabled us to characterize the zzso and zzso state of all possible zzso and zzso zzso present simultaneously in zzso For the first time, zzso interactions were observed in zzso including at least one zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso duplex, whereas no interactions were detected when the zzso zzso was placed at its zzso This binding mode is supported by the presence of a zzso motif described by recent crystal structures, which is formed by the zzso of both zzso held together by mutual stacking zzso Using tandem mass zzso hinge interactions were clearly shown to reduce the efficiency of zzso zzso without inducing its complete zzso This outcome is consistent with the partial stabilization of the zzso grip by the bound zzso which can hamper the zzso components from parting ways and initiate the strand exchange zzso These findings confirm that the broad binding and zzso activities of NC induce unique effects that are clearly dependent on the structural context of the zzso zzso acid zzso For this reason, the presence of multiple binding sites on the different forms assumed by zzso can produce seemingly contrasting effects that contribute to a fine zzso of the zzso process of zzso zzso and zzso
