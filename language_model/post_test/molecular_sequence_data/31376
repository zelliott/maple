The possibility of direct zzso effects of sex steroids on zzso gene expression and synthesis was studied in male zzso The animals were treated with a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso twice zzso for 10 zzso Groups of the zzso rats were implanted at the beginning of the injections with zzso capsules containing testosterone zzso 5 zzso zzso or zzso zzso Groups treated with the zzso alone or vehicle served as zzso The zzso treatment decreased unoccupied zzso receptors of zzso by zzso zzso less than zzso serum zzso by zzso zzso less than zzso and serum zzso by zzso zzso less than zzso and serum T became zzso (less than zzso zzso Compared to zzso treatment alone, no further effects on serum or zzso zzso levels found after steroid zzso In contrast, the zzso decreases in serum and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P less than zzso were totally reversed by the T and zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso were decreased by zzso zzso less than zzso after zzso zzso Combination treatment with zzso had no further effect on this zzso whereas zzso partially reversed this suppression zzso less than zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso level of the zzso zzso which decreased with zzso treatment by zzso zzso less than zzso returned to the control level with T and zzso zzso but only partially with zzso The zzso zzso level of the common zzso was significantly suppressed only by combined zzso plus zzso treatment zzso less than zzso However, combination of zzso with the zzso increased zzso zzso levels zzso zzso less than zzso compared to zzso treatment zzso It is concluded that the suppression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso treatment is accompanied in male rats by a parallel reduction in zzso levels of the zzso zzso Sex steroid replacement of the zzso animals selectively reverses some of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase the zzso of zzso zzso but have no effect on the zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso levels of common zzso and zzso zzso and slightly increases that of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
