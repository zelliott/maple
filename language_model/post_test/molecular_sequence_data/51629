Although the zzso zzso heavy chain locus is structurally and functionally similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are limited in zzso and they mature only slightly in affinity during immune zzso During the zzso response of zzso frogs to zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences using elements of the zzso family were zzso zzso and compared with zzso zzso There were zero to four zzso per zzso mostly single base zzso in the framework and zzso 1 and 2 of zzso No zzso were found in zzso Since the point zzso rate was only zzso to zzso lower than that calculated for mice, affinity maturation does not seem to be limited by zzso zzso Because of a relatively low ratio of replacement to silent zzso in the zzso and a very high ratio of zzso to AT base pairs altered by zzso it is suggested that the problem results from the absence of an effective mechanism for selecting zzso which in turn might be related to the absence of zzso centers in zzso
