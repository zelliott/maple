The zzso zzso are simple zzso zzso with a long zzso zzso cell surrounded by a single outer layer of 20 to 30 zzso peripheral zzso zzso Their zzso development proceeds within the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate the appearance of zzso circular zzso and their fate during early zzso in zzso zzso These zzso are highly zzso in zzso suggesting that they consist of zzso zzso Potential open reading frames were not evident in the zzso so these zzso are unlikely to have a zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the circular DNA elements were restricted to the early embryonic larvae and gradually faded out as larvae approached zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis and zzso chain reaction analysis using a high molecular weight DNA as a template provided evidence that the zzso DNA circles are originally present in zzso These observations suggest DNA zzso selective zzso the elements from zzso during early zzso in zzso zzso
