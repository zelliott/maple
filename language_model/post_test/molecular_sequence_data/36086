The distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the mouse central nervous system was studied using two zzso raised against synthetic zzso These peptides represented a region zzso between the cardiac and skeletal muscle forms and a region specific to the cardiac zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso binding analysis showed zzso receptors are expressed in all the brain zzso The activity was prominent in zzso and cerebral zzso zzso study demonstrated that the zzso receptors were localized zzso in zzso Some zzso and zzso zzso in some cells were also zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso region were more labeled than zzso zzso zzso distribution revealed by two zzso was essentially the same but the fibers were more zzso with the zzso raised against the cardiac muscle zzso zzso The zzso of zzso receptors was quite different from that of zzso zzso zzso
