Two distinct zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso of 28 zzso zzso and of 190 zzso zzso stimulate the intrinsic zzso activity of the zzso zzso The zzso GAP activity of zzso resides in its zzso domain zzso Neither zzso nor zzso activates the zzso zzso We replaced zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso and examined whether the domain containing them is involved in its zzso by zzso zzso zzso of either zzso to zzso or zzso to zzso did not change the zzso value for zzso gamma S of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso reduced the intrinsic zzso activity of the zzso zzso while no change was observed with the zzso zzso Both zzso abolished zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was inhibited by the addition of zzso gamma zzso wild type zzso but not by either zzso gamma zzso zzso or zzso indicating that both zzso and zzso are essential for interaction of zzso protein with zzso On the contrary, zzso activated both zzso and zzso zzso to the extent and in a dose dependence to those seen in the wild zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso interact with different zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso for their zzso
