A series of zzso and zzso peptides with the zzso terminal sequence of the small zzso of human zzso were prepared and their zzso zzso potency was zzso zzso peptides showed zzso zzso generation and zzso releasing activity in addition to zzso activity whereas zzso peptides showed only zzso activity and neither zzso generation nor zzso activity was zzso These results imply that zzso peptides from the zzso small zzso might be moderate zzso zzso factors which do not produce zzso and zzso zzso
