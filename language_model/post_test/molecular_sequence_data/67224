The zzso zzso zzso zzso activated cell death 1) shows a zzso that mimics hypersensitive response zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso which encodes a protein containing a domain with significant zzso to the zzso zzso attach complex and zzso domain of complement components and zzso is likely to control plant immunity zzso and has a zzso zzso in its promoter zzso We found that expression of the zzso gene and other zzso containing zzso such as zzso and zzso was promoted by salicylic acid zzso and zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso gene was also zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This latter control was not under zzso because zzso expression was not suppressed in zzso transgenic plants, which are unable to accumulate zzso These expression profiles were confirmed by promoter analysis using zzso transgenic zzso The zzso expression promoted by zzso and the zzso zzso was not suppressed in the zzso zzso which is insensitive to zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso gene is regulated by two distinct pathways involving zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso through an zzso pathway, and zzso zzso zzso through an zzso zzso Three zzso zzso that have multiple zzso elements in their promoters were also found to be under the control of zzso
