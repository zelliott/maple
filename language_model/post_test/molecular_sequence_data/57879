A new zzso species that zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed on the basis of a sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and is characterized by the capacity to establish an effective zzso with bean plants, the zzso of the zzso structural zzso the organization of the common zzso genes into two separate zzso units bearing zzso and zzso the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso DNA zzso An analysis of the sequence of a zzso of the zzso zzso gene shows that this gene is quite different from the gene of zzso zzso In addition, all zzso zzso strains have identical zzso We describe these analyses and discuss additional evidence supporting our zzso
