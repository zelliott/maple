Using a zzso binding zzso we examined zzso zzso and G protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors in zzso of rat brain and spinal zzso We found that zzso (but not zzso or zzso and zzso increased specific zzso zzso binding to zzso receptors in both zzso in a zzso manner, with optimal conditions being 60 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited specific zzso binding to rat brain and spinal zzso zzso with zzso effects of 64 zzso 6 and 71 zzso zzso zzso The order of potency was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was observed in the absence and presence of zzso and zzso The mechanism of zzso in spinal zzso zzso appeared to be a reduction in the number of zzso zzso in one experiment, control zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso respectively, and with zzso zzso zzso the respective values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso reduction in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso binding sites in rat zzso are G zzso zzso receptors regulated by zzso and zzso
