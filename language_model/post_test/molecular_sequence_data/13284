zzso is an zzso zzso containing zzso zzso II zzso zzso sites and an zzso zzso acid zzso The metabolically zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso in zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso cells may suggest that zzso zzso II zzso this zzso The zzso occurs in zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso apparatus were isolated by differential zzso and were identified according to their zzso and the presence of marker zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso the partially zzso zzso and the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso times lower than that of zzso although both zzso zzso and zzso zzso reactions were 50% inhibited by 20 and 100 zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that both zzso contained zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as a zzso donor by both zzso confirmed their capacity to zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins during zzso These zzso zzso may participate in the zzso process of hard zzso
