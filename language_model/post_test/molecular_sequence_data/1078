The zzso zzso protein zzso and its partner zzso comprise an adhesive complex that is required for rapid invasion of host cells by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso complex zzso extensive zzso processing on the zzso surface during invasion, including primary processing of zzso by unknown zzso and zzso shedding of the complex by an anonymous zzso called zzso While it was shown that zzso zzso is necessary for efficient invasion, it remained unclear whether the adhesive complex was liberated by zzso or zzso zzso Here, using a zzso strategy of assigning zzso sites based on intact zzso laser zzso mass followed by confirmation by zzso zzso and inhibitor zzso we demonstrate that zzso is processed by two zzso zzso called zzso and zzso We also define the zzso repertoire of zzso by two-dimensional differential gel zzso using fluorescent zzso Finally, we use complementary mass zzso techniques to unequivocally show that zzso is shed by zzso zzso within its zzso zzso Based on the properties of this zzso site, we conclude that the zzso zzso is likely a zzso membrane zzso of the zzso zzso Our data support a novel zzso zzso model that includes primary processing of the zzso complex followed by secondary zzso to shed the complex from the zzso surface during the final steps of zzso
