The nuclear zzso zzso zzso is a key component of the generic zzso complex that plays an important role in the control of cellular growth and zzso As shown by us recently, the growth zzso function of zzso largely relies on its capacity to repress zzso a key regulator of cellular zzso during normal and zzso zzso We further demonstrated how zzso of zzso due to the zzso zzso dependent loss zzso of zzso contributed to zzso growth in acute zzso leukemia zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso and its implication in zzso zzso is not fully zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso of zzso at the consensus zzso motif is crucial for its zzso and subsequent loss in zzso zzso zzso displayed significantly higher level of zzso specific zzso in almost all zzso derived cells and was subjected to processing by zzso specific zzso zzso zzso To identify the zzso linked to zzso zzso a library of activated zzso was screened with the extracts of zzso zzso leading to the identification of zzso as the putative zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso with this finding, a zzso active zzso consistently zzso zzso leading to its zzso while the therapeutic and genetic zzso of zzso largely zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Site directed zzso analysis of zzso identified zzso 1450 as the crucial zzso whose zzso by zzso was essential for the zzso and loss of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso contributed to the zzso of zzso suggesting a cross talk between zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso could be the common downstream thread of zzso zzso signaling activated by various zzso insults in some zzso of leukemia and solid zzso
