The sequence and crystal structure at zzso A resolution of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the first representative of the last unknown class II zzso zzso have been zzso The three class II zzso sequence motifs are present but the structure was essential for identification of motif 1, which does not possess the zzso previously believed to be an essential class II zzso Nevertheless, crucial contacts with the active site of the other zzso involving motif 1 are zzso and a more comprehensive description of class II now becomes zzso Each zzso consists of an active site strongly resembling that of the zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso recognition domain of 100 zzso and a third domain unusually inserted between motifs 1 and 2 almost certainly interacting with the zzso arm of zzso The zzso domain has a novel zzso zzso zzso structure with three surrounding zzso The active site zzso most probably responsible for zzso recognition, in particular in the zzso binding pocket, can be identified by zzso from zzso zzso due to the zzso nature of the class II active zzso
