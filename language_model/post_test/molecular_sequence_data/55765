We have adapted to zzso molecules the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso procedure of zzso sequencing zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) Science zzso zzso This new zzso the reverse zzso zzso zzso is sufficiently sensitive to allow zzso zzso zzso of minor zzso zzso It is based on the zzso of an zzso zzso of known sequence to every zzso end resulting from the zzso of total cellular zzso Target zzso molecules are specifically zzso and the resulting products are amplified by zzso The zzso of the initial zzso ends is ultimately determined on a sequencing zzso To demonstrate the zzso of this strategy, we have used zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells and zzso and have detected in zzso zzso zzso on two zzso elements of the zzso zzso zzso
