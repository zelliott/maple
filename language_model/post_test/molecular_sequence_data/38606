A high affinity molecular interaction is demonstrated between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso by surface zzso zzso zzso values of 92 zzso and 102 zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso have been determined, zzso zzso of zzso seems not to influence this high affinity interaction, zzso zzso might always be bound to zzso However, the zzso state of zzso determines the amount of zzso released from the zzso zzso of approximately zzso of the zzso zzso could be enough to activate the zzso channel zzso as we have shown previously zzso et zzso zzso zzso 337 (1999) zzso
