The lateral zzso stalk is responsible for the zzso binding of translation factors and zzso of zzso zzso during protein zzso The zzso stalk is composed of three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds two copies of zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso The structure of the zzso stalk is currently not zzso To provide a better understanding on the structural organization of zzso zzso we have determined the solution structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from each of the zzso and zzso form the zzso interface that zzso zzso zzso of zzso accessible surface zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Three zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso are replaced by charged zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso has an extra turn in zzso which forms extensive zzso interactions with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of this extra turn of zzso abolished the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso contains two zzso that each binds one copy of zzso zzso Modeling studies suggest that a large zzso zzso which can accommodate the loop between the zzso of zzso can be found on zzso but not on zzso when the zzso adopts an zzso zzso Based on the zzso properties of zzso a structural model of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso is zzso
