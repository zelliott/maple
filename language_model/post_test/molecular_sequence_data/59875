A zzso strain, carrying a zzso element in the promoter of the protein zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso gene at zzso location zzso has been identified using zzso rescue of the P element and adjoining zzso DNA in zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to demonstrate that the observed zzso of the zzso strain was due to a single zzso element zzso at zzso and to create three zzso strains at this zzso zzso zzso for zzso have reduced levels of zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso activity against four different zzso compared to wild type, while zzso are deduced to have approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso star zzso die in zzso around the time of zzso exhibiting zzso zzso and a block in zzso between zzso and the initiation of zzso Multiple zzso are visible in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in zzso the nuclear and zzso zzso When zzso arrest just prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso radiate from zzso in all directions, but they are rarely associated with any DNA, suggesting that zzso is required for the attachment of zzso to zzso DNA at the zzso
