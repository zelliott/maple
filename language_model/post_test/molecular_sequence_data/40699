The zzso zzso species complex comprises at least six varieties zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This species is unique among the zzso zzso because in nature it is found in association with certain species of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of partial regions of the translation zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso II zzso genes were analyzed in order to detect zzso zzso that might unequivocally distinguish varieties zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso analysis was also performed with an aim to establish zzso relationships among zzso zzso analysis of the partial zzso and zzso genes contained zzso zzso able to unequivocally distinguish variety zzso from the zzso However, distinction among zzso zzso and zzso was achieved only through the zzso zzso The zzso analyses from the combined data sets zzso and zzso indicated that zzso zzso is a zzso group and that varieties zzso zzso and zzso are closely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was placed in a distinct zzso clearly differentiated from the other varieties but still zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The limited zzso variation in partial zzso and zzso among varieties zzso zzso and zzso supports the placement of these groups as varieties and not species within the zzso
