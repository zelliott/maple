All the backbone zzso and zzso magnetic zzso (except for Pro zzso of the zzso form of a truncated human zzso zzso product zzso zzso acid zzso the Ras zzso were assigned by zzso two-dimensional zzso experiments on selectively zzso Ras proteins in combination with three-dimensional zzso experiments on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso assignments were made on the basis of the nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso of zzso zzso with preceding zzso and/or C alpha zzso In addition to sequential zzso zzso spin zzso zzso for zzso zzso and C alpha zzso and zzso exchange rates of zzso zzso were used to characterize the secondary structure of the zzso Ras zzso six beta stands and five zzso were identified and the zzso of these elements was zzso The secondary structure of the Ras protein in solution was mainly consistent with that in crystal as determined by X-ray zzso The zzso exchange rates of zzso zzso were examined to zzso the dynamic properties of the secondary structure elements of the Ras protein in zzso In solution, the zzso structure in the Ras protein is zzso while the second zzso zzso is much more flexible, and the first and fifth zzso zzso and zzso are more rigid than other zzso Secondary structure elements at or near the ends of the zzso loop were found to be much more flexible in solution than in the zzso zzso
