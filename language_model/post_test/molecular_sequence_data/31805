zzso are key proteins that play important roles in innate immune defense in many animal zzso by breaking down the bacterial zzso In this study, we report the molecular zzso sequence analysis and zzso of the first zzso zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso library from zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified and the full-length zzso was obtained using zzso The zzso zzso sequence represents an open reading frame for a putative signal zzso and the mature protein composed of 184 zzso zzso The calculated molecular mass and the theoretical zzso point zzso of this mature protein are zzso Da and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is predominantly found in skin, with lower levels in zzso liver, muscle, and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso had distinct evolution pattern for being juxtaposed with not only zzso zzso but also with the fish, bird and zzso Although the first complete zzso sequence for zzso zzso zzso is reported in the present study, clones zzso zzso other functional immune molecules in the full-length zzso library will have to be further zzso to gain insight into the fundamental aspects of zzso mechanisms in zzso
