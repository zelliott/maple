zzso of zzso molecules essential for the production of functional zzso could lead to attractive new means for male zzso The mouse protein zzso is the zzso zzso of a class of zzso zzso proteins needed for the zzso of zzso genes and for zzso repression zzso of paternal zzso In this report, we describe the human zzso for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso predicts a protein highly similar to its mouse and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso with a cold shock domain and four zzso zzso zzso is highly basic and is rich in the zzso acids zzso and zzso It contains seven putative zzso zzso 2 zzso sites and three putative protein zzso C zzso sites, suggesting that zzso could be highly zzso in zzso The predicted protein sequence contains two nuclear zzso signals, consistent with its predicted role of shuttling between nucleus and zzso zzso maps to human zzso zzso By the criteria of northern and western zzso zzso appears to be zzso specific and distinct from other zzso zzso zzso We predict that zzso of zzso function in zzso germ cells would prevent the formation of functional male zzso
