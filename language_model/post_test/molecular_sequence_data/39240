The nuclear zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family, which are involved in several zzso processes and zzso Here we have investigated how zzso is zzso into the nucleus and show that it is zzso through a zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso is located within the zzso zzso domain, and its zzso abolished nuclear zzso The zzso is also sufficient to cause nuclear import of zzso and the activity requires basic zzso acids within the zzso zzso binds strongly to zzso zzso which also depends on the basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loses its ability to enhance transcription, suggesting that nuclear zzso is essential for zzso zzso Together, these results reveal a previous unknown mechanism for nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and a critical function of the zzso zzso within the zzso
