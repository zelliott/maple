zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso error of metabolism with considerable zzso zzso in affected zzso Using a combination of the zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso we defined a zzso in a family in whom affected males have significant residual zzso zzso A zzso change in the first zzso of zzso 277 resulted in the substitution of a zzso for an zzso at zzso acid 245 of the mature zzso This change appears to represent a deleterious zzso rather than a zzso on the basis of several factors: the change occurs at a highly zzso zzso zzso significant size and change differences exist between zzso and zzso and this change was not seen on zzso screening of 26 unrelated individuals representing 43 zzso Diagnosis of an zzso male newborn in this family was performed using direct zzso zzso In families with partial zzso deficiencies in whom zzso data may be difficult to zzso direct detection of zzso at the zzso locus permits definitive zzso This represents the first description of a zzso in late onset zzso zzso and demonstrates direct zzso analysis by zzso for prospective diagnosis in a genetic zzso
