During zzso development in zzso zzso the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso is already expressed in early zzso zzso zzso where commitment to zzso lineage has been established, but subsequently zzso is dramatically zzso for the remainder of zzso zzso The loss of zzso expression after expression of the zzso zzso complex on the cell surface is essential for the later specific responses of mature T zzso Using appropriate mouse models and zzso zzso zzso we showed that the zzso box in the core promoter region of the zzso zzso locus was occupied only in zzso zzso T zzso Further, by zzso zzso zzso we evidenced that zzso of zzso zzso correlated with zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso In contrast, occupancy of the zzso zzso region zzso regulatory region I) was not detected by in zzso zzso zzso though zzso accessibility of the promoter region for zzso I zzso both in the zzso and zzso stages correlated with the zzso association of zzso and zzso to the zzso core zzso These results exemplify one mechanism by which a promoter enables zzso to switch on and off during zzso zzso
