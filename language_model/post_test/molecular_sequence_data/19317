A zzso zzso purple zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated in pure culture from a zzso in zzso India, in a medium containing 2 % zzso zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso rod that multiplied by zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso clusters with the class zzso highest sequence similarity zzso zzso was to the type strain of zzso zzso and 94 % similarity was observed to the zzso zzso gene sequence of the type strain of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso value of only zzso % with strain zzso zzso zzso contained zzso internal zzso zzso a and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had an zzso requirement for zzso zzso growth at 2-6 zzso zzso and grew zzso with a number of organic compounds as carbon source or electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth could not be zzso zzso extract was required for zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso zzso data and zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso is sufficiently different from other species of the zzso zzso to be recognized as a representative of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
