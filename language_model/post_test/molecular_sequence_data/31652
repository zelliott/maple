zzso is the zzso addition of lipids to proteins though zzso bonds and acts to promote association with zzso zzso also acts to target proteins to specific membrane zzso control residence in and movement between membrane zzso and regulate protein zzso and zzso zzso is unique among zzso modifications of proteins as it is zzso allowing for dynamic control over all zzso dependent zzso zzso cannot be predicted from protein sequence and as a result is zzso when compared with other zzso zzso We recently published a zzso analysis of zzso in plants and increased the number of proposed zzso proteins in plants from zzso to over zzso The wide range of identified proteins indicates that zzso is likely important for a variety of different functions in zzso Many supposedly well characterized proteins were identified as zzso and our new data provides novel insight into regulatory mechanisms and potential explanations for observed zzso These data represent a new resource for plant biologist and will allow the study of zzso proteins in plants to expand and move zzso
