zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to suppress the spread of zzso and salicylic zzso cell zzso Here, we present dual roles of zzso (for respiratory burst zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso suggesting either initiation or prevention of cell death dependent on the distance from pathogen zzso Our data demonstrate that a zzso knockout zzso exhibits increased spread of cell death at the zzso level upon zzso with the fungus zzso zzso However, the cellular patterns of zzso oxygen species zzso and cell death are fundamentally different in the zzso zzso compared with the wild zzso zzso zzso causes marked zzso hydrogen zzso zzso as well as cell death in zzso single cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso This single cell response is missing in the zzso zzso where infection triggers zzso necrosis preceded by less distinct zzso hydrogen zzso zzso in large clusters of zzso While the salicylic acid analog zzso zzso the action of zzso and the development of cell death in infected zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cell death, indicating that both salicylic acid and zzso positively regulate zzso and cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso plants zzso zzso and free salicylic acid compared with the wild type, suggesting negative feedback regulation of salicylic acid and zzso by zzso We propose that functional zzso triggers death in cells that are damaged by zzso infection but simultaneously zzso death in neighboring cells through the suppression of free salicylic acid and zzso zzso
