We report on the zzso and molecular analysis of a zzso melanoma of the soft parts zzso A zzso was found as the only structural zzso change, and this provides additional support for the important role of this zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed in frame fusion between zzso 10 of the Ewing's zzso zzso zzso and zzso 110 of zzso In previously analyzed zzso junctions were observed between zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso zzso The present data thus indicate that, as in Ewing's zzso different fusion proteins can occur in zzso The presence of the zzso fusion gene in the tumor cells was demonstrated by dual color zzso in zzso zzso on zzso zzso Our data provide additional support for the specific association of the zzso and the resulting zzso gene fusion in zzso This particular genetic zzso therefore, serves as a strong diagnostic marker for zzso We conclude that detection of the zzso by zzso or molecular analysis is useful in establishing or confirming the diagnosis of zzso
