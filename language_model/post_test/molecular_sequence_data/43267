zzso difference analysis of zzso zzso is a zzso differential cloning zzso It involves zzso of two populations of zzso with selective amplification of zzso expressed zzso To isolate the zzso expressed genes during zzso development, zzso from embryonic zzso at day 13 zzso and zzso zzso from three-week-old zzso mice were zzso and double stranded zzso zzso Double stranded zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and amplified by zzso using zzso primer to generate zzso zzso These reflect the zzso of most of the zzso zzso The term zzso denotes amplified zzso zzso Among the two populations of zzso zzso kidney zzso was used as a zzso containing target zzso and zzso kidney zzso as a zzso driving the process of zzso following which, they were subjected to zzso under low stringency zzso During the first round of zzso embryonic zzso genes were zzso To competitively eliminate these zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes were supplemented into driver, and subjected to the second round of zzso This resulted in the isolation of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso By Northern zzso zzso the zzso gene and zzso zzso exhibited a high degree of zzso regulation, that is, they were abundantly expressed in zzso zzso and their expression was barely zzso in zzso zzso The differential zzso regulation of zzso zzso was confirmed by tissue in zzso zzso zzso The zzso and novel zzso were rare transcripts in the embryonic zzso However, Southern zzso analyses of representations indicated their zzso expressions in zzso zzso The novel gene was zzso expressed in zzso embryonic zzso and Northern zzso analysis revealed an approximately 10 zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a sensitive technique to identify rare transcripts with differential zzso and since there is a minimal chance to isolate false positive zzso zzso may serve as a powerful tool for zzso zzso or zzso of the genes involved in various pathological or zzso states of the zzso
