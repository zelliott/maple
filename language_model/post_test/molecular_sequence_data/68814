It was previously demonstrated that the serum of some patients without zzso evidence of zzso infection contains the zzso Here we demonstrated by sequence analysis that the serum of such a patient contained a mixed zzso zzso In comparison with zzso zzso of different zzso zzso zzso variations were found in all clones zzso in zzso One zzso variation was identified within the zzso zzso Twelve of the zzso zzso variations caused altogether zzso changes of zzso acid sequence in known or predicted viral zzso The proteins of the P open reading frame, which are most important for viral zzso were affected by nine zzso acid zzso Three zzso acid zzso concerned the product of the X zzso a zzso zzso of various viral and cellular zzso Three zzso were only observed in some of the zzso One point zzso affected the direct repeats of the zzso zzso It occurred together with an 8 zzso involving the C promoter region and the X zzso The third zzso was a single zzso causing a fusion of the X and C zzso One or several of the identified zzso could be responsible for the diminished rate of replication and consequently for the zzso zzso negative zzso zzso
