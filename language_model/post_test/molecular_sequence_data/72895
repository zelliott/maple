Classical zzso experiments have indicated the existence of zzso and zzso zzso that arise as a consequence of zzso induction during zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso is exclusively expressed by zzso zzso Three observations link the expression of zzso to zzso zzso zzso First, the gene is initially expressed at the onset of zzso within a zzso zzso of cells that express the zzso zzso no tail zzso Second, the zzso factors zzso and zzso activate zzso expression in animal zzso Third, zzso of the zzso precursor population following exposure of zzso to zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the zzso derivatives of the zzso zzso which give rise to zzso zzso zzso its expression is extinguished as tissue differentiation zzso zzso of zzso zzso about an hour after initiation of expression of the zzso gene no tail and the organizer gene zzso The dependence of zzso expression on no tail activity was examined in no tail zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso does not depend on no tail gene zzso However, no tail appears to contribute to the maintenance of normal levels of zzso zzso and may be required for zzso zzso in the developing zzso
