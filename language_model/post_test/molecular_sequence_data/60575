zzso family zinc finger proteins are zzso of Sonic zzso zzso signaling in zzso The question remains zzso however, as to how these zzso proteins participate in the zzso signaling zzso In this study, regulatory activities associated with the zzso protein were investigated in relation to the zzso zzso Although zzso acts as a weak zzso zzso it is in fact a composite of positive and negative regulatory zzso In cultured cells, zzso of the zzso domain in the zzso half results in a protein with zzso activity, while removal of the repression domain at the N zzso converts zzso into a strong zzso In transgenic mouse zzso zzso truncated zzso unlike the full length zzso activates a zzso target zzso zzso in the zzso neural tube, thus mimicking the effect of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso of the strong zzso potential of zzso through zzso of the zzso repression domain is one of the key mechanisms of the zzso zzso A similar regulatory mechanism involving the zzso region was also found for zzso but not for zzso When the zzso signal derived from the zzso is received by the neural plate, the widely expressed zzso and zzso proteins are presumably converted to their active forms in the zzso cells, leading to zzso of zzso of their target zzso including zzso
