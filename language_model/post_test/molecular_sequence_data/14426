zzso proteins zzso are the products of a family of genes that is zzso zzso from bacteria to humans and expressed in most zzso zzso and zzso Human zzso (18 zzso is expressed at high levels in steroid zzso zzso zzso where it zzso to zzso and functions in the first step of steroid formation, the transport of cholesterol into the zzso zzso expression is elevated in zzso zzso and during tissue injury, which has lead to the hypothesis that zzso has roles in zzso and the maintenance of zzso zzso We recently identified a new zzso of zzso in both the human and zzso This zzso arose from an ancient gene zzso event before the divergence of the classes zzso and zzso and appears to have specialized zzso zzso and zzso zzso Evidence from the study of zzso zzso in zzso bacteria, and plants supports the conclusion that the zzso family of proteins regulates specialized functions related to zzso zzso In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the divergent function and evolutionary origin of zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
