Although binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso has been demonstrated to act as the trigger necessary for electron transfer and zzso activity, the exact manner in which this is achieved is zzso By using a series of single point zzso of zzso zzso zzso the role that each zzso binding site plays in the transfer of electrons within zzso has been zzso In these zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which coordinates zzso at the zzso position in each site has been zzso to a zzso zzso preventing zzso binding at that zzso The results demonstrate that zzso binding at site I of zzso is critical for all electron transfer zzso All zzso activities measured zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso c zzso in the presence of the site I zzso zzso zzso zzso were only zzso of the zzso activity with zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso to similar zzso These two zzso however, affected zzso zzso activities to a greater extent than they affected activities independent of the zzso zzso The site III zzso zzso zzso activated zzso to levels similar to activities measured with zzso zzso Rates of formation of the zzso complex were also obtained with each of the zzso zzso The relative binding affinities of these zzso do not correlate with the observed differences in electron transfer zzso These results demonstrate that, although binding of zzso to zzso is necessary for zzso specific interactions between the two proteins exist which are required for efficient electron zzso
