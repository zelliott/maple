Two protein fragments containing the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have been studied by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The two peptides zzso and 115 zzso zzso contain a common segment corresponding to zzso zzso of the rat zzso or zzso zzso of the human zzso and include two zzso zzso zzso The structures of this segment are almost identical in the two protein fragments, as judged from chemical shifts and sequential zzso zzso More than zzso of all zzso zzso zzso within a zzso segment encompassing zzso zzso zzso could be zzso assigned by standard techniques, and zzso assignments could be made for the zzso groups in four zzso zzso within this zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate several elements of secondary structure including two zzso segments consisting of zzso zzso and zzso a type I reverse turn between zzso zzso and zzso a type II reverse turn between zzso zzso and zzso and several regions of extended zzso zzso No evidence for zzso zzso was found within the two putative zzso zzso indicating that the structures of these zzso differ from that of zzso zinc zzso The observation of some very slowly exchanging zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso in combination with slow rotation of the zzso aromatic ring indicates that this domain has a restricted zzso flexibility compared to the zzso zzso zzso We also observe several long-range zzso zzso within zzso suggesting that the sequential assignments presented here will provide a basis for a complete structure determination of this segment of the zzso
