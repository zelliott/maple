zzso are components of zzso junctions and play critical roles during zzso and zzso They interact through the formation of zzso zzso to mediate cell zzso migration and zzso We recently showed that zzso also play important roles in the inner zzso zzso in zzso 23 zzso disrupt zzso organization on hair cells leading to deafness and zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso Here we extend our initial study on the structure and function of zzso The mouse zzso locus is comprised of two zzso zzso and 69 coding zzso together they cover a zzso distance of at least 350 zzso zzso acid sequence alignments and secondary structure prediction suggest that zzso zzso adopt a zzso similar to the classic zzso zzso sequence analysis of six zzso of zzso reveals a strong correlation between loss of function zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso transcript with a spliced zzso 68 is the predominantly expressed zzso in the organ of zzso zzso hearing loss zzso is a zzso trait in common zzso strains of mice associated with the zzso locus on zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso between zzso and zzso identified ten zzso acid zzso In the zzso and zzso regions we detected 11 single zzso zzso None of these sequence changes correlate with the zzso zzso Our results provide the necessary framework for further characterization of zzso hearing loss in zzso
