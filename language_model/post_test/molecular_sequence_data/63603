zzso from different olive zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to differ significantly in their content in Ole e 1 and in their overall zzso This zzso is, in addition, characterized by a high degree of zzso in its zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate the putative presence of zzso in Ole e 1 sequences from different olive zzso 

zzso from zzso individually collected from 10 olive zzso was used to amplify Ole e 1 sequences by zzso and the sequences were analyzed by using different zzso zzso Numerous zzso zzso were detected throughout the zzso many of which resulted in zzso acid zzso in the deduced protein zzso In most cases zzso within a single variety was much lower than among zzso Key zzso acid changes in comparison with zzso sequences previously described in the literature zzso a) the substitution of zzso to the zzso bond structure of the zzso b) the presence of an additional zzso zzso and c) point zzso affecting regions of Ole e 1 already described like relevant for the zzso of the zzso 

zzso origin of olive zzso is a major factor determining the diversity of Ole e 1 zzso We consider this information of capital importance for the optimal design of efficient and safe zzso zzso and useful for the genetic engineering of modified forms of the zzso among other zzso
