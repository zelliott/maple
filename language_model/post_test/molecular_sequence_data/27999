The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two identical zzso of 65 zzso and each zzso contains the zzso and zzso zzso On treatment with zzso the zzso exhibiting the zzso property in one of the zzso was zzso to form an zzso active zzso (40 and 65 zzso and then the zzso in the other zzso was zzso to form an active zzso (40 and 40 zzso The zzso bound to zzso but the zzso did zzso zzso analysis showed that removal of one or two of the zzso in the zzso slightly affects its kinetic zzso For all the zzso species, zzso inhibited competitively with respect to zzso and zzso with respect to zzso The partially determined zzso acid sequence of this zzso zzso suggested that zzso a long zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or a portion of the zzso is located between the zzso with zzso and zzso properties, zzso the zzso exhibiting zzso property is in the zzso terminal region of the zzso zzso the zzso acid sequences around the zzso and zzso zzso sites of the zzso are zzso and on the surface of the protein zzso and therefore are susceptible to zzso and zzso the zzso site is located near the zzso terminal region of the zzso zzso
