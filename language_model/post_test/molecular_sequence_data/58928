zzso cells cultured from zzso zzso do not demonstrate significant zzso zzso zzso growth response to the testosterone zzso zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not influence primary zzso cell proliferation in this concentration zzso 

Northern zzso carried out with an zzso reception zzso zzso probe indicated that the extent of zzso gene expression in six zzso primary zzso zzso cell cultures was insufficient to elicit a zzso signal upon zzso However, zzso analysis of total zzso using two sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates the presence of full-length zzso transcripts in two zzso zzso cell cultures zzso and zzso as well as a zzso culture zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso reporter zzso zzso exhibit significant increases zzso zzso zzso in zzso production upon treatment with zzso zzso primary zzso cells exhibit no such response when zzso with either zzso or zzso 

These results indicate that the lack of significant zzso gene expression zzso the zzso independence of primary zzso zzso cell zzso
