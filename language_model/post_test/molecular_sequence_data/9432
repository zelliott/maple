Bone zzso protein 1 zzso is an zzso zzso with important cellular functions and diverse zzso including zzso proteins and zzso of some zzso zzso zzso Combining zzso sequencing and filtering for zzso stretches of identified zzso we found a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso family affected by increased bone mineral density and multiple zzso zzso The zzso is located within the zzso signal zzso and leads to impaired zzso and an zzso in zzso zzso We also characterize a zzso bone zzso harboring zzso in zzso demonstrating conservation of zzso function in osteogenesis across zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of this zzso and a comparison to a second, similar locus reveal that zzso is critically required for zzso generation, downstream of zzso zzso in zzso We thus define the molecular and cellular bases of zzso osteogenesis and show the importance of this protein for bone formation and zzso
