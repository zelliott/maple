zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is required in zzso to produce a high viral load and full pathological zzso zzso has at least three major effects in zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso of T cell zzso zzso and enhancement of viral zzso We have used the zzso zzso system to identify cellular proteins that interact with zzso zzso and could mediate zzso zzso A human zzso was isolated that encodes a new type of zzso an zzso that zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso is unlike the animal types I and II zzso previously cloned but is zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and this zzso interact in zzso and are zzso by zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso unable to zzso zzso do not react or react poorly with zzso An zzso zzso zzso selected for its lack of interaction with zzso was also unable to zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that this human zzso is a cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso
