zzso zzso is described as a novel zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso plant in zzso The species is slow growing with short, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using three zzso shows that zzso zzso forms a strongly supported zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ally these species are quite similar but can be zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lack zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have a previously unknown zzso at zzso 20 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have a single zzso at zzso zzso The most zzso interpretation of zzso changes on the strongly supported zzso tree requires the gain of a novel zzso at position 20 and loss of zzso 26 to arrive at the current distribution of zzso in this zzso This is one of only a few examples of zzso gain in zzso
