zzso zzso causes zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso zzso Little is known about protective immunity to zzso and studies in this area have been complicated by the paucity of defined zzso zzso We examined the zzso responses of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from patients with zzso and zzso to a zzso protein containing a portion of the 170 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to two synthetic peptides (1 and 2) derived from the 170 zzso sequence that were predicted to contain T cell zzso A significant number of patients with zzso and zzso had zzso that proliferated to zzso zzso and several individuals with zzso and zzso had T cells that recognized one or both zzso zzso individuals from a zzso region for zzso did not respond to zzso zzso or to both zzso In regard to zzso response, nine of zzso patients with zzso showed zzso to zzso zzso These same patients had zzso to zzso zzso We identified peptides from zzso zzso that may contain both T and B cell zzso recognized by some patients with invasive zzso These peptides may be valuable zzso in studies of the immune response to zzso
