Peanut stunt virus zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of the family zzso and is widely distributed worldwide, also in zzso zzso is a common pathogen of a wide range of economically important zzso Its coat protein zzso similarly as in other zzso plays an important role in many processes during viral life cycle and has great impact on the zzso In this study, we present the results of zzso analysis of zzso derived from three Polish strains of zzso zzso zzso G, and zzso zzso were determined using zzso amplification followed by sequencing and compared with each other and also with zzso from other known zzso zzso We analyzed their zzso relationship, based on zzso zzso using zzso tools as well as their spatial model using zzso approach with combination of zzso zzso for de zzso zzso We compared our model with those recently obtained for other zzso including zzso Our results have shown that all Polish strains probably belong to the first zzso of zzso zzso zzso level between strains zzso and G proved very zzso Using theoretical modeling approach we obtained a model very similar to the one resolved previously with the differences caused by slightly different zzso acid zzso We have also undertaken an attempt to analyze its distant zzso however, results are not zzso Analysis of symptoms and their correlation with specific zzso acid position was also performed on the basis of results published zzso The zzso interpretation is zzso by the presence of satellite zzso in zzso and P strains modulating zzso severity, zzso
