zzso mediates a crucial step in the life cycle of the human zzso virus zzso The zzso zzso the viral DNA ends in a zzso manner and couples the newly generated zzso groups to zzso in the target zzso Three zzso have been identified in zzso zzso an zzso domain, a central zzso core and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso region is the only domain with unknown structure thus zzso This domain, which is known to bind zzso contains a zzso motif that is zzso in zzso zzso Although the exact function of this domain is unknown, it is required for zzso and zzso 

The three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso has been determined using two-dimensional and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso We obtained 20 final structures, calculated using zzso nuclear zzso effects, which display a backbone zzso square zzso versus the average of zzso A for the well defined zzso The structure consists of three alpha zzso and a zzso zzso The zinc is coordinated with His 12 via the N zzso 2 zzso with zzso via the N delta 1 atom and with the sulfur atoms of zzso and zzso The alpha zzso form a zzso bundle that is stabilized by this zzso zzso The zzso arrangement is similar to that found in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso paired domain and zzso zzso 

The zzso domain of zzso zzso has a remarkable hybrid structure combining features of a zzso bundle fold with a zzso zzso zzso This structure shows no similarity with any of the known zzso zzso The strictly zzso zzso of the zzso motif of zzso zzso are involved in metal zzso whereas many other well zzso zzso zzso are part of the protein zzso
