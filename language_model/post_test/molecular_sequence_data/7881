In the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are derived from zzso We have identified a zzso zzso cells missing zzso that encodes a novel nuclear protein expressed zzso in early zzso zzso Its zzso causes zzso zzso cells to differentiate into zzso whereas its zzso expression forces virtually all zzso cells to become zzso zzso Thus, zzso functions as a zzso switch that turns on zzso fate while zzso default zzso fate of the zzso and their zzso Similar results are also obtained in the zzso zzso of the zzso revealed that zzso zzso can find correct pathways without zzso cells and that zzso and zzso have a common molecular basis for individual zzso
