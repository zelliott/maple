The zzso locus is the most zzso locus known with currently over 100 different zzso zzso Many of these zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tissue transplantation zzso This high level of diversity makes accurate tissue typing zzso Here we present the sequence of a new zzso zzso zzso found in Caucasian siblings zzso and zzso zzso typed as zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso typing by the zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso zzso identified zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso However, zzso failed to identify a second zzso in either of these zzso The unusual finding of a zzso zzso in a Caucasian and the zzso molecular typing results suggested that these individuals might express novel zzso zzso Using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso followed by direct sequencing, we characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso The presence of this zzso was confirmed by cloning and zzso zzso differed from zzso by only one zzso substitution resulting in an zzso acid replacement of zzso by zzso at position zzso zzso this single zzso difference was sufficient to prevent amplification by zzso This striking difference between both the zzso typed zzso and the zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso supports the use of zzso typing for the analysis of zzso class I locus zzso
