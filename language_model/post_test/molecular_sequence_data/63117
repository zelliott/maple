zzso pathogens zzso an array of cell zzso zzso to break down the structure of the host cell wall to facilitate colonization of the host zzso To better understand their role in the zzso a putative zzso from zzso zzso was characterized in this zzso zzso analysis indicates that the protein zzso by gene zzso in zzso zzso (named zzso for zzso zzso zzso 1) contains a zzso signal zzso Multiple alignment shows that zzso has high level of zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The three proteins share a zzso zzso domain, but only the one from zzso zzso contains a cellulose binding zzso zzso was zzso expressed with the highest level in zzso and the lowest in zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso could be alternatively processed when cultured in zzso and after infection of zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso is a zzso zzso Its zzso activity was zzso by zzso red plates, and further confirmed by the zzso acid zzso The finding in this paper will provide the basis for further determination of the zzso properties of the zzso protein and its relevant function in zzso zzso
