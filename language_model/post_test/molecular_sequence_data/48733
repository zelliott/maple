zzso are biologically important for sensing changes in the color and intensity of ambient light and, for zzso organisms, processing this light information to zzso food production through zzso zzso are an zzso and ecologically important zzso group of zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso whose family members sense nearly the entire visible spectrum of light zzso Some zzso contain 12 to 15 different zzso and many family members contain multiple zzso zzso However, the complex interactions that must be occurring within and between these zzso remain zzso Here we describe the regulation and zzso of a unique zzso called zzso zzso by zzso zzso demonstrating that a second zzso called zzso strongly regulates zzso abundance and that zzso uses two distinct zzso zzso to respond to four different light zzso blue, green, red, and zzso The zzso of red or zzso light by one domain affects the zzso of the other domain, and the rate of relaxation of one of these zzso is influenced by the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso results in delayed growth at low cell density, suggesting that zzso zzso growth under this condition, apparently by sensing the ratio of red to zzso light in the zzso The types of complex zzso interactions described here, both between unrelated zzso family members and within zzso zzso of a single zzso may be advantageous for species using these zzso in aquatic zzso where light color ratios are influenced by many zzso and zzso zzso
