The zzso sequences for the zzso family of zzso sequences from zzso zzso were compared with those of the zzso family from zzso zzso and the zzso family which is widespread amongst zzso zzso These elements have a striking degree of similarity in both their putative zzso zzso sequences and their zzso sequences (40 to zzso between zzso including 12 out of 14 zzso conservation in their terminal zzso zzso The evolutionary distance between the zzso family and the zzso and zzso families of zzso origin is approximately twice that between the zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of base zzso in the three sequences has provided insights into the effect of selection for the G + C content of immigrant genes to conform to that of their zzso and into the evolution of biases in overall zzso acid composition of cellular proteins in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso families form a zzso of zzso sequences that has been involved in the spread of a number of zzso resistance zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
