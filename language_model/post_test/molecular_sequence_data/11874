zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso hormone transport protein in zzso zzso abnormalities in the level of serum zzso have been classified as partial zzso complete zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso located on zzso has uncovered the molecular defects causing partial and complete zzso However, the mechanism leading to inherited zzso excess remains zzso In this study, two Japanese families, zzso and zzso with inherited zzso excess were zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso males were 58 and 44 zzso 3- and zzso the normal value, zzso The zzso had normal properties in terms of heat stability and zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the coding region and the promoter activity of the zzso gene were also indistinguishable between zzso and normal zzso The gene dosage of zzso relative to that of zzso which is located on zzso 11, and zzso muscular dystrophy, which is located on zzso was evaluated by zzso of these target genes using zzso chain reaction and subsequent zzso by zzso The zzso ratios of the affected male and female of zzso were zzso and zzso times, respectively, that in the normal zzso The zzso muscular zzso ratios were zzso and zzso times the normal value, zzso These results are compatible with three copies of zzso gene on the affected zzso Similarly, a zzso increase in gene dosage was demonstrated in the affected zzso of zzso A zzso tandem amplification of the zzso gene was shown by in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso from the affected male with a zzso zzso zzso probe, confirming the gene dosage zzso Gene amplification of zzso is the cause of inherited zzso excess in these two zzso
