A mixed culture zzso zzso zzso to zzso was enriched from groundwater that had been subjected to long-term zzso In the zzso of the enrichment, a zzso reductive zzso zzso gene cluster sequence was detected by inverse and direct zzso The zzso gene cluster had four open reading frames zzso showing zzso zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso a zzso able to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed only zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso percent of the zzso acid differences were localized in two defined regions of the predicted zzso Exposure of the culture to zzso and zzso increased the zzso gene copy number by 2 log units, and under these conditions the zzso and zzso genes were actively zzso A very similar zzso gene cluster with zzso identity in the zzso gene sequence was identified in zzso zzso strain zzso the only known isolate that selectively zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso gene of strain zzso possesses the same zzso acid motifs as the new zzso zzso Southern zzso using total zzso DNA of strain zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso indicated the presence of two identical or highly similar zzso gene zzso In conclusion, these data suggest that the newly described zzso are specifically adapted to zzso zzso
