We have identified and genetically characterized an zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Factor zzso This zzso named zzso has been found to have a critical role in development by zzso analysis using a zzso zzso zzso line zzso The zzso zzso plants were zzso but the zzso plants, while retaining their normal zzso growth, displayed empty seed spaces as well as aborted seeds with zzso arrested at the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the disruption of the zzso gene in zzso plants caused severe reduction in genetic transmission of female zzso due to a loss of zzso while the transmission of male zzso was zzso Two independent zzso lines with zzso zzso on the zzso gene also showed the similar zzso Gene expression analysis demonstrated that zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed a group of zzso zzso with unknown function in animals, but not in zzso which suggested a potential important function of this group of genes in the development of zzso zzso
