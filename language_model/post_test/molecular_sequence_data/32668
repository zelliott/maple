zzso zzso zzso protein expression systems hold the promise of overcoming the traditional barriers associated with in zzso zzso This is particularly true for membrane zzso which are often zzso and due to the nature of the zzso difficult to work zzso To evaluate the potential of zzso zzso we cloned 120 membrane proteins from zzso coli and compared their expression profiles in both an zzso coli in zzso system and an zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate zzso is a more robust system and we were able to express zzso of the targets in zzso compared to zzso in zzso To benchmark the quality of zzso produced zzso five target membrane proteins were zzso and their zzso zzso by gel zzso zzso Finally, to demonstrate the ease of zzso acid labeling with zzso a novel membrane protein was zzso with zzso zzso and shown to have zzso incorporation of the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel, robust expression system capable of expressing more proteins than an in zzso system and suitable for production of membrane proteins at the zzso zzso
