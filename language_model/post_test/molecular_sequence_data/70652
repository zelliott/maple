Human and mouse zzso genes were cloned and zzso zzso start sites were identified using primer extension zzso The zzso unit of zzso gene is made of 2 untranslated zzso followed by 6 zzso zzso zzso In zzso translation analysis demonstrated that an zzso for a putative zzso of 36 zzso present in zzso 2 did not prevent zzso translation and confirmed that the initiation site of translation was in zzso 3 as predicted from sequencing zzso Short zzso zzso to zzso and long zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing DNA upstream of the zzso start site of the human gene were made and zzso in zzso or zzso cells allowing characterization of a potent zzso Analysis of several zzso clones encompassing zzso and/or zzso genes demonstrated that the 2 genes are zzso the human zzso gene being located 7 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso
