In the zzso system, zzso information has long been zzso to take the form of molecular zzso within both the zzso and the zzso Recent reports have implicated zzso a member of the zzso (also named class zzso family of zzso zzso receptors zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso Here, we report the cloning and distribution pattern of zzso another member of the zzso family of zzso isolated from a quail zzso zzso During retinal zzso zzso transcripts accumulate in a zzso to zzso zzso within the retinal zzso where its expression becomes restricted to the zzso and bipolar cell zzso Within the zzso zzso transcripts are zzso in a zzso to anterior zzso in the zzso layer and newly formed superficial zzso The pattern of zzso expression in the zzso and zzso is distinct from that of zzso suggesting that complex patterns of zzso zzso and their zzso may play a role in zzso interactions involved in zzso projections and differentiation of the central nervous zzso
