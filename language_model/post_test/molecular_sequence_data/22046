A novel zzso strain zzso which was isolated from soil of zzso zzso zzso Island, Republic of Korea, was subjected to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso which produces zzso spore chains arranged in hooks or spirals on the aerial zzso was shown to have zzso characteristics consistent with assignment to the zzso zzso A comparative analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the zzso formed a distinct zzso within the evolutionary radiation of the family zzso and that it was closely associated with members of the zzso zzso but possessed a 22 zzso extended loop between positions 453 and zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequence zzso coli zzso A broad range of zzso and genetic data supported the suggestion that this zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
