The zzso relationships of two subspecies of zzso zzso were investigated by randomly amplified zzso zzso chain reaction zzso With each of the 12 random zzso the DNA fingerprints generated were subjected to cluster analysis for zzso The analysis indicated that twelve strains were organized into two major zzso and that all strains of each subspecies were confined to one zzso Furthermore, two of the random zzso examined each generated a unique band in zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned these specific bands and determined the zzso zzso A search for zzso acid sequence zzso revealed that the two specific fragments had significant zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein gene of zzso zzso zzso New specific zzso designed for the zzso gene were able to amplify zzso fragments from both zzso However, the specific zzso designed for the zzso protein gene amplified only a zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this gene is unique to zzso zzso zzso These results were further confirmed by dot zzso zzso Finally, a zzso duplex zzso technique in a single tube for the rapid detection and differentiation of the zzso zzso subspecies was zzso
