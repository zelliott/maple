zzso binding to rabbit zzso and its domain I, obtained by zzso zzso of intact zzso was studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data obtained support the proposal that the zzso zzso is coordinated by two zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso and are inconsistent with recently reported zzso studies indicating that zzso zzso is unlikely zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 91, zzso Although the zzso data are consistent with both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso are typical of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso are characteristic for zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data indicate that there is a difference in the zzso environments of the intact zzso and its domain I but overall the zzso information suggests zzso bound to domain I has the same zzso as intact zzso The zzso studies indicate that zzso binding to domain I zzso at least 4 of the 5 zzso This is consistent with zzso zzso of the zzso by two zzso and a zzso change induced by zzso binding affecting two zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso bound to intact zzso and domain I were also zzso by zzso zzso pH dependence studies showed that zzso remained bound to intact zzso over the pH range zzso without any major change in the zzso or environment of the zzso
