The zzso zzso belongs to a novel family of zzso receptors which also includes an insect zzso for a zzso hormone and the protein zzso by a zzso DNA clone from zzso zzso Despite significant structural zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso display distinct functional characteristics when tested with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso These zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and between zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of zzso zzso that appear to be involved in zzso interaction and zzso zzso zzso The search for zzso in the zzso zzso gene in zzso DNA of patients with zzso type zzso zzso revealed several silent zzso and a zzso zzso in the zzso tail region which did not affect zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are therefore rarely, if at all, responsible for zzso A zzso in the zzso zzso is, however, the most likely cause of zzso zzso zzso a rare form of zzso zzso which is associated with severe zzso despite normal or low levels of circulating zzso and zzso A zzso zzso was identified which causes zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus explains the laboratory and the zzso abnormalities in affected zzso
