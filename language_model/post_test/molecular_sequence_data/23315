The functional expression of proteins on the surface of bacteria has proven important for numerous zzso zzso In this report, we investigated the zzso fusion display of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso coli by using the zzso domain of the zzso zzso outer membrane zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso zzso To find out the transport function of a zzso domain of zzso we generated a set of zzso fusion proteins containing zzso truncated derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso The surface exposure of the zzso zzso was verified by zzso zzso zzso accessibility, and zzso cell zzso The investigation of growth zzso and host cell viability showed that the presence of the zzso zzso domain in the outer membrane neither zzso cell growth nor affects cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that the zzso domain of a zzso zzso zzso is an effective zzso motif for the functional display of zzso passenger protein on the surface of zzso zzso This investigation also provides a possible zzso model of the zzso zzso domain, which might serve as a basis for the construction of fusion proteins containing zzso passenger zzso
