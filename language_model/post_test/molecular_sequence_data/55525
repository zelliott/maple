The molecular basis of the ability of bacteria to live on caffeine via the zzso zzso zzso is zzso The first step of this pathway, caffeine to zzso acid zzso has been attributed to poorly characterized caffeine zzso and a novel zzso caffeine zzso Here, we report the detailed characterization of the second zzso a novel zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso This product spontaneously zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso prefers zzso acids and, to a lesser extent, zzso acids as zzso but it exhibits no activity on zzso zzso zzso models of zzso against zzso acid zzso zzso (which zzso zzso acid to zzso reveal a much bigger and zzso cavity to accommodate the larger zzso Genes involved in the caffeine zzso zzso zzso are located in a zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso including zzso zzso for caffeine zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso of this gene cluster to the zzso zzso gene cluster and zzso of zzso zzso revealed two major open reading frames coding for the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso The first one, designated zzso codes for a putative zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso The second one, designated zzso codes for a putative zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso Based on a combination of zzso and zzso a new zzso zzso for caffeine has been proposed via zzso zzso zzso to zzso
