zzso zzso zzso site activity zzso at least in part, on base zzso to zzso small nuclear zzso In transient zzso zzso defective zzso zzso sites can regain activity in the presence of zzso carrying zzso changes, but it is unclear whether such zzso zzso zzso can be permanently expressed in zzso zzso We have explored this issue to determine whether zzso small nuclear zzso with altered specificity may be of value to rescue targeted zzso genes or alter zzso processing zzso This effort was initiated following our observation that zzso with specificity for a zzso site associated with an alternative zzso zzso substantially reduced the synthesis of the potentially zzso zzso protein in transient zzso We describe the development of a zzso zzso system that selects for removal of a zzso zzso placed within a drug resistance zzso zzso was observed in proportion to the degree of zzso between zzso zzso zzso genes and different defective zzso sites, and all cells selected in this manner were found to express zzso zzso zzso In addition, these cells showed specific zzso of defective zzso sites presented by an zzso reporter zzso We discuss the prospects of this approach to permanently alter the expression of targeted genes in zzso zzso
