We found, using a zzso search, a novel human gene zzso trade mark zzso number zzso that possesses zzso zzso The full-length open reading frame consists of 500 zzso acids and encodes a typical type II membrane zzso This zzso has a domain containing zzso zzso which are widely zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The putative zzso domain was expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells as a soluble zzso Its zzso activity was observed when zzso zzso zzso was used as an zzso zzso The zzso product was determined to have a zzso by zzso zzso analysis, and was therefore named zzso zzso The zzso zzso specificity of zzso was examined using various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the best zzso zzso for zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso among the tested zzso zzso zzso real time zzso analysis revealed that the zzso transcripts was restricted in its distribution mainly to the zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso Its putative zzso zzso zzso was also found in a data base of mouse expressed sequence zzso In zzso zzso analysis with mouse zzso showed that the transcripts are expressed in germ line zzso zzso efficiently transferred zzso to zzso of fetal calf zzso which was treated with zzso and zzso However, it showed no activity toward any zzso zzso Although the zzso structure has not been reported in humans or other zzso we have discovered a novel human zzso producing this structure on zzso and zzso
