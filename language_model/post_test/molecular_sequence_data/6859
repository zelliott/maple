zzso zzso is a zzso that regulates various zzso zzso To zzso the involvement of zzso zzso in the early stage of zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso administration on the host zzso mechanism against zzso zzso zzso The in zzso administration of zzso zzso significantly enhanced host resistance at the early stage of zzso infection, as assessed by bacterial growth in the zzso cavity and the zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso were observed from day 1 after infection in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice compared with those in control zzso zzso Mice treated with zzso zzso exhibited significantly higher levels of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and major zzso complex zzso class II expression on the zzso zzso on days 3 and 5 after zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso brought about an zzso of gamma delta T cells in the zzso cavity at the early phase of infection, which was correlated with the expression of zzso zzso protein 60 zzso which is implicated as a potential zzso for gamma delta T cells, in the infected zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso some zzso functions and, consequently, the zzso of zzso cells, including gamma delta T cells, at the early stage of infection, resulting in an enhanced host zzso against zzso zzso
