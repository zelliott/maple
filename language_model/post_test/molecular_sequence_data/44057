This review zzso the considerable body of information now available on the molecular bases of human blood zzso zzso The zzso of this information has only been possible since the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso cloning of the zzso which zzso the blood group active zzso The surface components which are responsible for zzso expression are divided into two zzso zzso and zzso All zzso structures are attached zzso to either zzso or zzso and are zzso in the zzso apparatus of zzso cells (or in other cell lines in zzso zzso As a consequence, the molecular bases of zzso zzso lie in zzso variation seen in the genes which zzso these zzso structures zzso zzso zzso The structural differences in the zzso zzso and Lewis zzso zzso which alter the zzso zzso of these zzso and hence generate the different zzso have been zzso The molecular bases underlying the P blood zzso are zzso zzso in the remaining 19 blood group systems is defined by zzso acid sequence changes in zzso membrane zzso which are generated by sequence variation at the DNA level zzso by point zzso Blood group active zzso membrane proteins can be zzso broadly into six functional groups: zzso membrane zzso or zzso zzso Diego, zzso Kidd, zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or assembly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso The zzso blood group system is defined by zzso variation in C4 of the complement zzso and is zzso passively onto the surface of zzso This system is not considered zzso Only two remaining blood group systems defy molecular zzso zzso and zzso The potential clinical applications of such a rapid zzso of data on the molecular bases of blood group zzso is zzso
