zzso viral zzso contain sequences and structural elements that allow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to correctly initiate and transcribe zzso levels of plus and minus strands during zzso zzso zzso sequences involved in zzso zzso including zzso zzso and, recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso White, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003), have been identified for many zzso A second example of a zzso zzso has been discovered in zzso a zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso hairpin 5 zzso located zzso to the core hairpin promoter, contains a large symmetrical internal loop zzso with sequence complementary to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso bases or zzso of the putative interacting bases enhanced zzso in zzso while zzso exchanges between the zzso and 3' end restored zzso zzso zzso structure analysis indicated that substantial zzso of the zzso zzso region occurs when the three zzso zzso are zzso These results indicate that zzso functions to suppress synthesis of minus strands by zzso the 3' zzso from the zzso zzso of a second sequence strongly zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso suggesting that this sequence may function as a zzso to free the 3' end from interaction with zzso zzso with similar sequence and/or structural features that contain sequence complementary to zzso zzso as well as sequences that could function as zzso are located in similar regions in other zzso suggesting a general mechanism for controlling zzso synthesis in the zzso
