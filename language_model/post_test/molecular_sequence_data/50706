This study sought to test the hypothesis that expression of zzso for two zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and the zzso gene product, is induced in rat lung cells during inflammatory responses in zzso and in zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso are members of the zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso that cause marked zzso zzso and zzso in zzso To investigate expression of the genes for zzso and zzso in rat models of lung injury, zzso zzso for these zzso in the rat were made from zzso chain reaction zzso products generated using mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso showed marked zzso to known zzso sequences zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso were first used to study the expression of these two genes in rat zzso zzso zzso in zzso by Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of rat zzso in zzso caused marked increases in zzso for both zzso and zzso within 30 minutes, which persisted through the 6 hours zzso To study expression during inflammation in zzso rats were treated with zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and whole trachea zzso were zzso There was a marked and rapid increase in zzso and zzso zzso levels within both zzso cells and trachea zzso after zzso zzso The results support the hypothesis that zzso and zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso and zzso in this rat model of acute pulmonary zzso
