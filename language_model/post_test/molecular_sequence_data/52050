In order to determine the extent of the repertoire of the zzso light chain zzso locus zzso in the laboratory rat zzso zzso we constructed a specifically primed zzso library from zzso zzso strain rat zzso The library was screened with a rat zzso probe, and 33 clones containing identifiable V regions were zzso of which 19 sequences are presented zzso In addition to one sequence zzso which was already known, and is closely related to the two known mouse V zzso gene zzso clones zzso representatives of three new, zzso zzso rat zzso zzso were found, namely zzso zzso and zzso At least two of these zzso zzso and zzso contain multiple members as well as restriction zzso length zzso zzso indicating the presence of at least zzso zzso gene segments (including some zzso in the rat zzso An additional ten clones contained no rearranged V region, although they showed a correct zzso zzso suggesting the presence of cryptic zzso promoters between J zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso tree reconstruction based on zzso acid sequence alignments showed at least three of the four rat zzso sequences zzso with distinct human zzso zzso Thus, although rats express zzso zzso at levels no higher than mice, the rat zzso locus is considerably more complex than that of laboratory mice, and its diversity reflects the products of gene zzso which zzso the time of zzso zzso
