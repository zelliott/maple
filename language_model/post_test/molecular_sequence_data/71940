This study focused on three zzso zzso proteins that participate in early steps of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso membrane proteins and the zzso protein zzso We found that zzso the zzso protein was zzso at or near an zzso consensus motif at zzso acid zzso thereby removing its zzso C zzso zzso the zzso form was associated with immature zzso but only the zzso truncated protein was present in mature zzso zzso the zzso form of the zzso protein was zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the truncated form was zzso zzso zzso and truncated forms of the zzso protein existed in a complex with the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein and zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins failed to occur in cells infected with a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was the only viral late protein that was necessary for zzso of the zzso zzso whereas additional proteins were needed for zzso zzso We suggest that zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins is zzso by the zzso zzso and is required to form the zzso associated with immature zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso occur during the transition to mature zzso
