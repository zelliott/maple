zzso encodes zzso the core protein of the zzso slit zzso of the kidney zzso zzso is the zzso gene for zzso zzso syndrome of the Finnish type zzso with massive, treatment resistant zzso We report here the establishment of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein with substantial zzso to human zzso zzso is a type I zzso protein consisting of zzso zzso zzso Together with the recently cloned zzso zzso establishes a new zzso zzso of genes belonging to the zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso The zzso dot zzso experiment revealed that the zzso zzso expression is widely distributed but most prominently observed in the zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in kidney zzso was verified with zzso Further zzso studies with zzso zzso showed a specific band at zzso in the human and rat zzso In zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso but also zzso and zzso parts of the zzso was seen in human kidney zzso Due to its structural similarity and sequence zzso as well as partially consistent expression pattern with zzso we propose that zzso belongs to a functionally important complex of proteins of the zzso zzso zzso
