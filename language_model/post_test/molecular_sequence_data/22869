The zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso is an attractive target for zzso drug development because of its essential function in viral zzso We describe here a cellular zzso in the zzso zzso zzso for the identification of small zzso zzso of zzso zzso by conditional growth in selective zzso In this system, the zzso zzso sequence is inserted into the zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein essential for cell proliferation in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the engineered zzso zzso in zzso cells results in zzso zzso and functional zzso of the zzso zzso thereby leading to an arrest of cell zzso This growth arrest can be suppressed by the addition of validated zzso zzso zzso The growth selection system presented here provides the basis for a zzso screen to identify zzso zzso zzso that are active in zzso zzso
