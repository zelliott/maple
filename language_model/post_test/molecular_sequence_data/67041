zzso trait zzso also known as bovine zzso zinc zzso zzso disease, and zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder first described in 1964, with a clinical presentation similar to that of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The molecular basis of the zzso has not been previously zzso Recently, the basic zzso in zzso was found to lie in zzso We report the characterization of the bovine zzso of zzso and identification of a unique zzso site zzso within this gene in affected zzso The zzso leads to zzso zzso leaving the coding region in zzso The gene product is predicted to lack two critical zzso which lie in adjacent zzso zzso implicated in the formation of a pore responsible for the transport of zzso While further functional studies are warranted, this unique zzso is likely to be responsible for the impaired zinc zzso in this zzso
