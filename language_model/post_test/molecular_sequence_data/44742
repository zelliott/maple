The zzso vaccine zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of a small gene family estimated to comprise six zzso All six genes were cloned and zzso zzso sequence analysis of the different family members identified a set of closely related genes exhibiting between zzso and zzso DNA sequence zzso zzso structure for the various genes zzso the family was found to be zzso Open reading frame analysis and zzso alignments of predicted zzso from the various members of the family revealed that the zzso proteins share between zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were designed which allowed amplification of individual family members in a zzso zzso These were used to investigate gene expression in different zzso stages of the zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso All members of the gene family were expressed during the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family zzso zzso with zzso of eggs and expression is increased in activated eggs zzso One family member, zzso was expressed in the early larvae zzso zzso zzso of genes closely related to the zzso vaccine zzso has important implications for immune evasion under selection from the application of a zzso zzso
