The structures of functional peptides corresponding to the predicted zzso zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were determined using solution zzso experiments on zzso samples, and solid-state zzso experiments on zzso zzso Both zzso segments form straight zzso zzso with no zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at an angle of 12 degrees relative to the zzso normal, with a rotation about the zzso long axis such that the polar zzso face the zzso side of the zzso which is assigned to be zzso A model built from these solid-state zzso data, and assuming a zzso zzso arrangement of zzso zzso results in a zzso architecture for the channel, with the wide opening on the zzso zzso zzso
