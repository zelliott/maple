The zzso factor zzso from zzso cells contains near the zzso of this protein of zzso zzso acids three zzso repeats of an zzso acid zzso zzso typical of the zzso zzso DNA binding domain first found in zzso factor zzso A DNA sequence corresponding to the zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso the three zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso containing the zzso 165 zzso plus 2 from the cloning zzso designated zzso can be extracted with 5 M zzso and then zzso in the presence of zzso to a protein of specific zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso of tightly bound zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using a labeled zzso DNA sequence containing a consensus zzso binding site show that the zzso zzso protein specifically recognizes the zzso zzso sequence in the presence of a large excess of calf zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with 10 zzso zzso results in removal of zzso and the formation of an zzso which does not specifically recognize zzso zzso can be exchanged for zzso in the zzso protein with full retention of specific DNA zzso This is the first zzso zzso protein where this substitution has been zzso zzso of the zzso protein with 6 zzso of zzso of protein results in the complete release of the three zzso zzso zzso of zzso is highly zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
