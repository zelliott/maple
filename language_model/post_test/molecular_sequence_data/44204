The zzso domain zzso is an zzso zzso 50- to zzso module carried by zzso proteins involved in the zzso of signals for cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso drives zzso interactions through binding to zzso zzso This function relies on the zzso secondary structure, whereas the zzso primary structure is highly zzso Taking advantage of the fact that the few zzso zzso acids are clustered near the zzso and zzso ends, we designed zzso zzso spanning these two regions and screened by zzso a variety of normal and tumor zzso for the expression of zzso zzso Using this strategy, we have identified a novel zzso human gene family of six related transcripts that map to four different zzso The zzso domain lies at the zzso end and shows zzso zzso acid zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso segment of this novel zzso (from zzso zzso gene family does not resemble any known zzso Three of these transcripts are zzso and show a peculiar tissue zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the brain, zzso in brain and zzso and zzso is zzso
