Eight peptides with differential zzso activity against the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso were isolated from an extract of the skin of the North American pig zzso zzso zzso The primary structures of these zzso peptides were different from previously characterized zzso peptides from zzso frogs but on the basis of sequence similarities, the peptides may be classified as belonged to four previously characterized zzso families: the zzso zzso and zzso families, first identified in the North American zzso zzso zzso and the zzso family first identified in the European common zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso families, previously isolated from the skins of other species of zzso zzso were not identified in the zzso The zzso and zzso peptides showed broadest spectrum of zzso activity whereas the zzso were active only against zzso zzso zzso replicates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced zzso relaxation of zzso vascular rings from the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso peptides that were isolated in extracts of the skin zzso zzso were present in the same molecular forms in zzso skin zzso of the animal demonstrating that the peptides are stored in the zzso zzso of the skin in their fully processed zzso
