zzso zzso a zzso zzso produces a single zzso the internal peptides zzso of which bear similarity to zzso of several white rot zzso zzso of the total zzso acid composition of this zzso with several zzso zzso indicated zzso in the proportion of some basic and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the circular zzso spectrum of the protein indicated 37% zzso zzso zzso and 38% random zzso content which differed significantly from that in the solved structures of other zzso which contain higher zzso zzso The critical role of the zzso group containing zzso acids was demonstrated by determining the kinetic parameters at different pH and this was confirmed by the observation that a critical zzso is strongly zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in the presence of a number of zzso agents and zzso back to functional state with zzso In the folding experiments under alkaline conditions, zinc could replace copper in restoring zzso of zzso activity indicating the zzso role of copper in this zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso coli by a modification of the zzso zzso approach making it the first zzso zzso to be expressed in a bacterial zzso The zzso sequence was confirmed by way of analysis of a 435 zzso sequence of the zzso
