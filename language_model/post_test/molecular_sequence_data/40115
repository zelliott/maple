zzso zzso provides a natural comparison species for the model zzso zzso zzso given their similar zzso life history, and zzso mode of zzso Despite zzso zzso boasting a published zzso sequence and establishing zzso as a model zzso for zzso and development, little is known about genetic variation across the geographic range of this zzso In this study, we greatly expand the collection of natural zzso and characterize patterns of zzso variation for six zzso in 63 strains from three zzso The pattern of zzso reveals differentiation between zzso zzso strains found in temperate localities in the northern zzso from those sampled near the zzso of zzso with diversity within the tropical region comparable to what is found for zzso zzso in zzso As in zzso zzso linkage zzso is zzso although zzso is evident among some zzso sites, indicating that zzso has occurred at a low rate in the history of the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso temperate regions harbor extremely little variation, perhaps reflecting colonization and recent expansion of zzso zzso into northern zzso We discuss these findings in relation to their implications for selection, demographic history, and the persistence of zzso
