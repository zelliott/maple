In order to establish a productive infection, a zzso must integrate the zzso of its zzso zzso into the host cell zzso While this critical process makes zzso an attractive zzso for gene delivery, the zzso nature of integration presents inherent hazards and variations in gene zzso One approach to alleviating the problem involves fusing zzso zzso to a zzso zzso protein that targets a defined zzso zzso We prepared proteins consisting of zzso or truncated human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso fused to the synthetic zzso zinc finger protein zzso The zzso fusion proteins bound specifically to the zzso zzso recognition sequence as analyzed by zzso I zzso The fusion proteins were zzso active and biased integration of zzso DNA near the zzso site in zzso The distribution was zzso and the major integration hot spots were localized within a zzso region upstream of the zzso strand of the zzso recognition zzso zzso bias was not observed with target plasmids bearing a zzso zzso site or when zzso zzso and zzso were added to the reaction as separate zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso fusion proteins offer an efficient approach and a versatile framework for directing the integration of zzso DNA into a predetermined DNA zzso
