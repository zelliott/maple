The apparent preferential expression of the zzso G zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in zzso of species with zzso zzso suggests mechanisms of zzso regulation unique to these zzso zzso To begin to define the zzso regulatory elements involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene was isolated and zzso The zzso gene spans at least 13 zzso and consists of 5 zzso and 4 zzso This zzso structure, except for an additional zzso is similar to that of the human gene where the first three zzso zzso the signal zzso zzso G binding region, and zzso binding region, zzso The positions of the 16 zzso zzso in zzso 2 and 3 of the human gene are zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso gene contains a zzso box at zzso zzso zzso and sequences with limited zzso to those which might bind the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso The functional promoter activity of the zzso zzso DNA was examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso after transient zzso in human zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region zzso was active in these cell lines, with the highest promoter activity observed in the zzso Progressive zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso up to zzso zzso had no effect on zzso gene expression in all cell lines, relative to the longest zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
