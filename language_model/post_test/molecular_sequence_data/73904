Despite recent advances in the identification of zzso and zzso regions of zzso channels, the zzso that couple such regions to channel opening have not been zzso Moreover, it is uncertain whether zzso binding or zzso are obligatory steps that must zzso channel opening zzso to linear reaction zzso or whether they act to stabilize the channel in an open state that can exist independently of zzso binding or zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso By comparing zzso and zzso channel openings, we now show that retinal and zzso zzso channels are activated by a zzso zzso zzso We further show that an zzso domain, distinct from the pore and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gating transition, accounting for differences in the free energy of gating of the two zzso The zzso transition provides an important mechanism for tuning the zzso response of zzso zzso such as zzso channels, to different biological zzso
