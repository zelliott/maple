The main zzso site zzso zzso of zzso disease virus zzso strain zzso may be adequately reproduced by a zzso with the zzso acid sequence zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of the viral protein zzso The effect of zzso acid zzso within A15 on its zzso towards zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso site A, has been studied by means of zzso technology, based on surface zzso resonance zzso Although these zzso have previously been determined from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso technique is superior in that it allows a fast and straightforward screening of zzso while simultaneously providing kinetic data of the zzso zzso With a view to screening fairly large libraries of individual zzso we have zzso the typical zzso experiment by zzso the zzso on the sensor surface and using peptides as soluble zzso We report the validation of this approach through the screening of 44 site A zzso with results generally in good agreement with the relative zzso previously determined by competition zzso
