zzso zzso gene expression is zzso by specific zzso zzso which bind to zzso elements of gene zzso By analyzing the zzso activities and zzso in zzso of deletion and point zzso zzso fusion proteins of the zzso zzso in which the zzso domain is replaced by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso we localized the zzso and zzso domain to a zzso sequence module of 46 zzso acids zzso zzso This zzso zzso sequence consists of at least three zzso zzso required for zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso A is necessary for zzso zzso such zzso requires both a zzso zzso domain located ten zzso zzso terminal to the zzso and an zzso domain zzso terminal to the zzso zzso of these two zzso does not impair zzso of zzso Further, deletion of the zzso domain does not alter zzso of the zzso zzso We propose that akin to the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso functions of zzso involve a zzso zzso zzso zzso
