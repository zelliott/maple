zzso is a newly described nuclear gene that can substitute for zzso to partially restore zzso fertility to zzso zzso zzso Families segregating for zzso were used to investigate the mechanism of this fertility restoration and to compare it to the restoration zzso by zzso Although zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso it also alters zzso zzso transcript zzso and reduces the zzso of the zzso zzso Like the zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts that accumulate in zzso plants carrying zzso zzso and zzso transcripts accumulate in plants that are partially restored by zzso A survey of zzso zzso lines, zzso and F1 hybrids by zzso zzso gel zzso analyses revealed that zzso is rare in zzso zzso These surveys revealed the presence of another rare, weak zzso factor, zzso which is uniquely associated with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso extension analyses position the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso transcripts at zzso and zzso zzso respectively, 3' of the zzso initiation zzso of the zzso reading zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso transcripts and the 380 zzso zzso zzso transcript from zzso male zzso zzso These results demonstrate that multiple zzso nuclear genes can have similar but distinct effects on the expression of the unique zzso zzso coding sequence to restore zzso fertility to zzso zzso
