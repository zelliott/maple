The minimal zzso of zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso able to promote autonomous zzso replication in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso DNA zzso revealed a high AT content, and the presence of two zzso sequences differing from the zzso core consensus of zzso zzso only by a T and C zzso zzso The zzso insert contains a further six zzso sequences with one mismatch to the zzso zzso core consensus, more then 20 related sequences with two base pair exchanges, numerous direct and zzso repeats, and many copies of a sequence motif called the zzso zzso The original zzso zzso DNA fragment, as well as the minimal zzso zzso in zzso zzso (a zzso of zzso lacking an origin of replication in zzso were then tested for their ability to replicate autonomously in another zzso zzso zzso
