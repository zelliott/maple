The zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso was developed for rapid diagnosis of zzso E zzso This zzso amplified the target gene in less than 45 zzso (even as short as 20 zzso under zzso conditions at 63 degrees C, and the sensitivity of this zzso was zzso greater than that of zzso This zzso demonstrated a detection limit of zzso zzso zzso zzso
