We have studied the zzso of the zzso family of proteins by different zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and this is specific zzso as the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso only weak zzso zzso zzso similar zzso in zzso when zzso together with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso This is seen by both zzso labeling and the appearance of five discrete zzso bands with reduced gel zzso As anticipated, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are blocked by zzso with the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity is also seen in zzso cells as zzso zzso only weak zzso when zzso with zzso activated zzso or zzso Four critical zzso undergoing zzso in zzso cells were identified by expression of the quadruple zzso point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso of zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso identical sites in zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso by the zzso class of zzso zzso and could indicate a key modification allowing control of zzso function by cell surface zzso zzso family zzso and/or cellular zzso
