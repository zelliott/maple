The zzso are zzso zzso peptides of about 5 zzso molecular mass and composed of about zzso zzso acid zzso The first member of the family, zzso zzso was initially isolated from zzso fraction 5, prepared in five steps from calf zzso zzso zzso was supposed to be specifically produced and released by the zzso zzso and to possess hormonal activities modulating the immune zzso Various zzso effects have indeed been reported for these peptides such as cardiac protection, zzso stimulation of wound healing, and hair zzso Besides these zzso effects, it was noted that zzso occur in high concentration in the zzso of many zzso cells and bind to the zzso component zzso zzso it became apparent from in zzso experiments that they zzso bind to zzso zzso and stabilize it in its zzso zzso Due to this ability the zzso are the main zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso they posses the ability to remove zzso zzso from the dynamic assembly and zzso processes of the zzso zzso that constantly occur in activated zzso In this review we will concentrate on the zzso activity and zzso of the zzso zzso their modulating effect on the zzso zzso
