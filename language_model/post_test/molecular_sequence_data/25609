The zzso zzso was continuously zzso in a high yield from three zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso by immobilized zzso zzso and immobilized zzso zzso in an organic zzso zzso zzso The optimal conditions for the synthesis of zzso were established zzso The yield of zzso with zzso in zzso zzso saturated with buffer was more than zzso after continuous synthesis for 116 zzso The optimal conditions for the synthesis of zzso from zzso and zzso by zzso through zzso was established in batch reaction zzso When the concentration of water in the reaction solution was zzso zzso the activity of zzso was zzso The equilibrium between the water concentration in the reaction solution and that in the zzso used for zzso zzso depended on the zzso and was not affected by the presence of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso and zzso with a yield of zzso by continuous reaction for 160 zzso The reactor for synthesis of this zzso was efficient and stable because of the use of zzso and the choice of an appropriate organic zzso The series zzso reactor was successfully operated for 220 zzso with a yield of more than zzso The residual activity of zzso was zzso and that of zzso was zzso
