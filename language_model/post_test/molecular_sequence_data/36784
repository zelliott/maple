The zzso of zzso has much in common with zzso zzso reflecting a close zzso relationship between the two zzso zzso zzso is simpler in several key respects, however, including a lack of pronounced zzso zzso To gain an insight into the molecular changes that accompanied the evolution of zzso zzso and into the relationship between the zzso and zzso body plans, we have undertaken the first molecular level investigation of zzso embryonic zzso We report the zzso complete DNA sequence determination, sequence analysis and expression analysis of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the third-most 3' zzso group of zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison to a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso reveals several stretches of zzso acid conservation within the deduced protein zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso reveals localized expression of zzso in the zzso zzso (but not in the zzso and zzso expression in the zzso nerve cord, of zzso zzso later zzso and zzso The anterior limit to expression in the nerve zzso is at the level of the zzso zzso boundary at the zzso stage, and zzso to just anterior to the first nerve zzso zzso spot to zzso zzso to the anterior expression boundary of mouse zzso zzso and related genes suggests that the zzso brain is zzso to an extensive region of the zzso nerve zzso that contains the cerebral zzso (a region at the extreme zzso zzso and extends zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
