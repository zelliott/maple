zzso is an important component of zzso zzso zzso a significant portion of the total DNA in zzso Despite its zzso long-standing zzso descriptions, and zzso composition of zzso repeated DNA, no general theory unites zzso with its zzso In an attempt to identify zzso sequence zzso we have zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso for the presence of motifs that are known to define regions that anchor the zzso DNA to the scaffold zzso attachment regions or zzso The zzso of zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of a small zzso sequence (the zzso that is clustered in overall A + zzso zzso In comparing zzso and zzso sequences we find that zzso regions are zzso enriched for these zzso defined zzso This high density of zzso sequences not only serves as a molecular tag for zzso but also suggests a hypothesis for its special zzso
