The role of the zzso loop region of a zzso sensitive zzso zzso violet cone zzso is investigated via zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso models predict a complex zzso network that zzso and connects the zzso loop and the zzso zzso that are predicted to disrupt the zzso network are shown to produce visual zzso that do not zzso bind zzso and exhibit properties of a zzso zzso The potential role of a zzso bond between two zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso is necessary for proper folding and trafficking in zzso Lastly, certain zzso in the zzso loop are predicted to stabilize the formation of two zzso zzso joined by a hairpin turn, which interact with the zzso via zzso or van der zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso result in a decrease in the level of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso are crucial for the formation of this cone visual zzso Moreover, there are significant differences in the structure and function of this region in zzso compared to that in zzso
