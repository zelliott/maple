The zzso zzso was identified as a zzso that shows a novel zzso regulatory zzso The zzso zzso dramatically reduces the synthesis of bacterial alkaline zzso activity during zzso zzso in an otherwise zzso host and during the zzso growth phase in a zzso or zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso activity are found in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso when starved for zzso zzso or sulfur or during the stationary phase, zzso zzso rescue and DNA sequence analysis located the zzso zzso to the zzso coding zzso It is a zzso transition that would cause a substitution of Val for zzso in the mature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso gene expression is zzso Also, the zzso protein was zzso and processed as efficiently as the wild zzso Furthermore, the zzso appeared to zzso and to be stable in the zzso But, greater than zzso of the zzso were inactive and found exclusively as zzso zzso An zzso of zzso zzso zzso occurred during the stationary phase with the zzso conversion into zzso 2 and zzso We propose that the zzso zzso affects a late stage in the formation of active zzso An unknown change when zzso is present during zzso growth leads to formation of active zzso which is responsible for this new conditional zzso
