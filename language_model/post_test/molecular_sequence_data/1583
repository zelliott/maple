The guinea pig zzso zzso zzso was cloned from guinea pig brain using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and shows zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity versus the human, rat and mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso bound zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding profile, determined by competition with zzso correlated well with that for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the response was zzso zzso by zzso and zzso giving apparent zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso response was absent using zzso prepared from zzso cells zzso with zzso toxin zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso couples to zzso in this expression system and shows a similar pharmacological profile to that for the human zzso zzso
