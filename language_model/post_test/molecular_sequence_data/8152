zzso zzso contain toxins that block different types of zzso zzso Some of these toxins have affinity for high zzso zzso zzso channels and for zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural features that determine the specificity of binding to different channel types are not zzso We investigated this using natural and synthetic scorpion zzso We have tested the effects of zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and synthetic zzso of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso on a zzso zzso current zzso at a zzso motor nerve zzso and on the binding of a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso channels on rat brain zzso zzso The native toxins contain zzso zzso acid zzso they are over zzso identical in sequence zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and they have similar three-dimensional zzso All zzso except zzso displaced zzso from its zzso binding sites: zzso 18-2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso 105 zzso zzso had no effect at 3 zzso When zzso of zzso with deletions at the zzso portion were tested for their activity on zzso on motor nerve terminals in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were ineffective at 100 zzso and zzso was ineffective at up to 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso completely blocked zzso but zzso zzso zzso did not affect the nerve terminal zzso Different zzso appear to be important for interactions of the toxins with different zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso but it did block zzso whereas zzso was as active as zzso against zzso binding but it did not affect the zzso of the motor nerve zzso The zzso section of the toxins appears to be particularly involved in block of zzso at the motor nerve zzso it is truncated in the inactive synthetic zzso zzso and it is positively charged at zzso in zzso (which is zzso but zzso charged in zzso and neutral in zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
