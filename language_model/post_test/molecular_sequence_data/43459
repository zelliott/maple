The cellular protein zzso functions as an zzso zzso protein zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a member of a family of functionally related zzso proteins that share a zzso zzso region called the zzso zzso Although several different zzso zzso zzso have been shown to function with zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso the zzso that cooperate with zzso in the zzso of its normal zzso are presently zzso Moreover, the basis of functional zzso between specific zzso and zzso zzso proteins has not yet been zzso Here we report the cloning of a new human zzso designated zzso that was identified in a zzso screen through specific interaction with zzso We demonstrate that zzso an zzso closely related to zzso can also bind to zzso The region of zzso involved in complex formation with zzso and zzso was mapped to its zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso two highly zzso zzso that were deficient for interaction with zzso could associate efficiently with another zzso zzso zzso Finally, only the zzso zzso could function in conjunction with zzso in the zzso of an E6 independent zzso of zzso whereas the zzso zzso could zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate for the first time complex formation between specific human zzso and the zzso domain family of zzso proteins and suggest that selective physical interaction between zzso and zzso zzso forms the basis of specificity for functionally distinct zzso zzso
