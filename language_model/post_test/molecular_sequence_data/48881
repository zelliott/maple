The zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The open reading frame zzso of the zzso gene zzso was interrupted by five zzso of 49, 49, 50, 65, and zzso The gene zzso a presumed signal zzso of 17 zzso and a mature protein of zzso zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are likely involved in zzso reactions as an zzso and a zzso zzso The protein possessed 15 potential zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product was zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso 2, which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was functionally expressed in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the culture zzso and it appeared as a single band on zzso with an apparent Mr of zzso zzso showed zzso activity of zzso of protein toward zzso zzso zzso at optimal pH zzso and zzso The zzso exhibited apparent zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso The zzso was highly active on rye zzso as well as zzso zzso but it showed weak activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso and zzso
