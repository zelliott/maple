zzso is a member of the high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso specified by wheat zzso zzso In this work, we found that the full-length zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso the last two of the three zzso zzso which are zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were replaced by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso regions zzso to zzso zzso relative to the start zzso a novel miniature zzso zzso element zzso was present in zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso and zzso like zzso were readily found in zzso wheat subspecies but not several S zzso containing zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the four zzso characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be divided into two zzso zzso The lineage represented by zzso and zzso was more ancient than the one represented by zzso and zzso zzso our data establish that zzso and zzso represent a novel zzso of zzso zzso Based on current knowledge, potential mechanism involved in the differentiation of two zzso lineages is zzso
