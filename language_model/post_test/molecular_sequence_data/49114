The zzso zzso zzso zzso enables the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso to grow on the tobacco zzso zzso The zzso zzso with an overall zzso content of zzso revealed, besides genes and open reading frames zzso for nicotine degradation, a complete set of zzso for zzso essential for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso related to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of the 165 zzso approximately 50% were related to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the ability to take up zzso from the zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of putative nicotine zzso formed a cluster with the gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso related to zzso zzso zzso and natural transformation functions zzso were identified on zzso Few zzso showed similarity to known zzso zzso but zzso could be transferred by zzso to a zzso strain at a rate of zzso to zzso per zzso zzso with no known function represented approximately zzso of the zzso zzso The positions of zzso sequence elements and composite zzso zzso by the zzso content of the zzso zzso suggest a modular composition of the zzso
