A zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso It had the following zzso decreased zzso zzso by zzso zzso reduction in the activity of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an altered zzso and zzso zzso The site of zzso of zzso into the zzso and the surrounding zzso the zzso region zzso effect zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso changes in zzso could be zzso with zzso The zzso region was cloned and zzso and the zzso was found to be inserted upstream of a single open reading frame which led to a failure to transcribe a zzso zzso The loss of this transcript decreased the zzso of zzso and zzso genes and reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression from a zzso zzso resulted in increased message levels for zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso provides evidence for the coordinated regulation of zzso and surface proteins and suggests the existence of a new global regulatory factor in zzso zzso
