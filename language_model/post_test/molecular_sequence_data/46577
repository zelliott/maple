The zzso gene zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that has critical roles in many development zzso In an effort to illuminate the mechanism of zzso repression, we have employed zzso as an affinity zzso to purify zzso proteins from embryonic nuclear zzso One of these proteins was found to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso suggest that zzso and zzso form a complex in zzso and that they interact directly via the zzso rich zzso domain in zzso Cell culture zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso repression by the zzso zzso Furthermore, experiments employing a zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso inactive form of zzso imply that zzso zzso activity is required for efficient zzso zzso Finally, zzso in zzso and zzso have synergistic effects on embryonic zzso and pattern zzso These findings support the view that zzso mediates repression, at least in part, by the direct recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso to the template, where it can zzso local zzso zzso They also provide evidence for a specific role of zzso in early zzso
