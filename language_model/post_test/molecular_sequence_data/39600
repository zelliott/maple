zzso X zzso zzso uses zzso acids as zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso a zzso product of testosterone, is also an zzso zzso Treatment of zzso male mice with zzso induced expression of the zzso target gene small zzso partner zzso In mouse zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso induced zzso expression with a similar kinetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso blocked the induction of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso demonstrated the direct binding of zzso to zzso human zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso resulting in the recruitment of steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso although in contrast to zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater for the mouse zzso than for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso defined zzso acids zzso and zzso as critical for differential species sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso Crystal structure studies suggest that the orientation of the steroid nucleus of zzso acids within the binding pocket of zzso is reversed from all other nuclear hormone zzso In support of this model, we show here that zzso zzso or zzso zzso predicted by crystal structure to interact with the zzso acid tail of zzso but not with zzso altered zzso zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may provide an additional means for zzso or pharmacological zzso of zzso
