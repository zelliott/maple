The zzso head family includes a large number of zzso factors that share a structurally related DNA binding zzso Fork head factors have been shown to play important roles both during development and in the zzso We now describe the cloning of a novel zzso fork head factor that we have named zzso zzso head zzso X zzso which is expressed in many adult zzso In the zzso zzso expression showed a very early onset during the zzso stages of zzso zzso zzso chain zzso site selection experiments showed that zzso bound DNA with a dual sequence zzso Sites recognized by zzso could be classified into two different types according to their zzso zzso of zzso to sequences of each type appeared to occur zzso Our data suggest that either different regions of the fork head domain or different molecular forms of this domain could be involved in binding of zzso to each type of zzso In zzso zzso zzso was capable of zzso zzso from promoters containing zzso sites of either zzso
