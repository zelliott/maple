The ability of wheat to maintain a low sodium concentration zzso in leaves zzso with improved growth under saline zzso This zzso termed zzso zzso contributes to the greater salt tolerance of bread wheat relative to zzso zzso To improve the salt tolerance of zzso zzso we explored natural diversity in shoot zzso exclusion within ancestral wheat zzso Previously, we showed that crossing of zzso a gene locus in the wheat relative zzso zzso into a commercial zzso wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced its leaf zzso zzso zzso Here we show that a gene in the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso located on the plasma membrane of root cells surrounding zzso vessels, which is therefore zzso localized to withdraw zzso from the zzso and reduce transport of zzso to zzso Field trials on saline zzso demonstrate that the presence of zzso significantly reduces leaf zzso and increases zzso wheat grain yield by zzso compared to zzso lines without the zzso zzso
