The zzso of the two different zzso complexes of zzso zzso was compared after isolation from three different zzso zzso components of zzso zzso zzso of 39 zzso 45 zzso and 105 zzso were isolated from all of the three zzso whilst proteins B, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso of two strains zzso and zzso These proteins were not detected in strain zzso zzso of protein synthesis in zzso cells was used as a measure of zzso The zzso complex from strain zzso was highly zzso This strain also produced the zzso zzso However, when zzso at least two of the components of zzso had to be present in higher amounts than those of the components of zzso to cause the same degree of zzso Both complexes zzso from strain zzso were zzso The amount required to cause the same degree of zzso was approximately equal for the components of the two complexes, except that higher amounts of the 105 zzso protein of zzso had to be present than for the other zzso None of the zzso complexes from strain zzso was toxic in amounts comparable to those of the zzso complex of strain zzso and zzso of strain zzso These results indicate that when measuring zzso zzso from zzso zzso at least two different complexes and six different proteins have to be taken into zzso
