The zzso zzso protein binds in zzso to several sites in the white, zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and to at least one site in the zzso gene zzso The distribution of these sites zzso often with that of regulatory elements in these genes as defined by zzso or, in the case of white, by molecular zzso A zzso binding site is frequently found in the immediate vicinity of the zzso zzso binding sites are composed of two or more zzso recognition sequences zzso zzso consensus sequences do not bind or zzso Cooperative interactions are involved both in binding to a given site and between proteins bound at independent zzso zzso bound to one DNA zzso can in fact bind simultaneously to another DNA zzso These results suggest a general role for zzso in bringing together distant regulatory elements controlling the activity of a target zzso In this model, zzso effects are a zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso
