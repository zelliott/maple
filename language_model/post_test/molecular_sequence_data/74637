The gating of zzso zzso channels is controlled by zzso changes in zzso sensor zzso Previous studies have shown that the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso sensor are zzso with respect to motion across the zzso while the zzso sensor paddle consisting of the zzso half of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is zzso The mobile component is attached to zzso and zzso via the zzso turn and the zzso half of zzso zzso In this study, we analyze zzso an zzso zzso zzso channel, to study the mobility with respect to translation across the membrane of zzso We zzso an zzso based on attachment of zzso zzso and its zzso accessibility to zzso Our results reveal that the zzso zzso does not move appreciably across the membrane in association with zzso The zzso behavior of zzso zzso the zzso available to the zzso sensor when it closes and suggests that a set of negative zzso within the zzso inner leaflet remains intact in the closed zzso
