zzso changes in zzso zzso of zzso during seed development of zzso zzso have been explored to discover possible zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Kimura, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 62, zzso which should be involved in the production of zzso type free zzso The structural analysis of the zzso zzso with a zzso sugar chain map, by zzso zzso showed that all zzso expressed on zzso through the zzso stage of the zzso seeds have the zzso type zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso but no zzso type zzso zzso a typical plant complex type structure especially found in zzso zzso was a dominant structure through the seed development, while the amount of expression of zzso and zzso decreased as the seeds zzso The zzso occurrence of zzso type structures and the absence of the zzso type structures on zzso zzso were also shown by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso extracted from the developing seeds at various zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for plant zzso these results suggested that the zzso zzso might be the zzso zzso or some zzso with the zzso type zzso derived from zzso zzso in the quality control system for newly zzso zzso
