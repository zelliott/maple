Among the 16 species of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regarded as the most zzso species in the world and cause clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be an important cause of zzso in Iranian zzso zzso analyses of two portions of nuclear zzso DNA zzso transcribed zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used for the genetic characterization of the zzso zzso zzso of the sequencing data of zzso zzso obtained in the present study zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with other zzso species in the zzso database revealed a particularly close relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the cattle and zzso The zzso based on the zzso sequences shows that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed a distinct group separate from the other remaining zzso zzso in cattle and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence derived from zzso zzso showed zzso similarity to zzso zzso with differences observed at only three zzso This study showed that the zzso and zzso zzso gene are useful genetic markers for the specific identification and differentiation of zzso zzso in zzso
