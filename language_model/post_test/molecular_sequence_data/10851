The mouse zzso gene contains a short zzso zzso zzso To characterize the sequences that regulate zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso derived from the human zzso zzso containing a short internal zzso that is usually skipped by the zzso zzso Various fragments from the zzso gene were inserted into the zzso zzso to measure their effects on the zzso of the test zzso These clones were zzso expressed in zzso and zzso cell lines, and the level of zzso inclusion was measured by primer zzso Several sequences from the zzso zzso region induced the zzso of the zzso zzso The most powerful effect was seen with a sequence from the zzso downstream of the zzso zzso This sequence acted as a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso of the test zzso when placed in the zzso zzso The zzso was strongest in zzso zzso cells but also activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scanning zzso indicate that the zzso is made up of multiple smaller elements that must act in zzso One of these elements was identified as the sequence zzso Three copies of this element can strongly activate zzso of the test zzso in zzso zzso zzso These component elements of the zzso zzso zzso are also apparently involved in the zzso of other short cassette zzso
