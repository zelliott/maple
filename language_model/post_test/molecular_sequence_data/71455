The zzso gene zzso a second zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied for zzso functions in comparison with zzso zzso zzso The effect on decreasing the zzso form of proteins was examined by zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso The results indicate that both zzso and zzso effectively decrease the amount of the zzso form of zzso Both zzso and zzso possessed the same zzso activity as other bacterial and zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were constructed by changing zzso zzso to zzso Effect of the zzso on the zzso activity and zzso zzso was zzso Neither zzso exhibited zzso activity in zzso Nevertheless, they decreased the amount of the zzso form of zzso by zzso as did zzso zzso and zzso These results implied that both zzso and zzso could assist protein folding for nascent protein in zzso coli without requiring energy from zzso zzso
