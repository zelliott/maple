zzso zzso zzso and F belong to a zzso of the zzso sharing a high degree of sequence zzso zzso expression and specific zzso zzso were used to demonstrate great variation in the zzso fate of the zzso zzso H and zzso become zzso zzso into zzso 35 zzso proteins zzso zzso and possibly into zzso 22 zzso zzso No zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso is almost exclusively localized to the nucleus of many cell types while zzso F varies from a zzso nuclear zzso in some cells to a zzso zzso zzso in other zzso The different fates may reflect differences in functional roles that so far only have included nuclear zzso The presence of significant quantities of zzso F in the zzso of many cells indicates that it also may have a functional role zzso
