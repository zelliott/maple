zzso zzso factor attachment protein zzso proteins assemble in tight core complexes which promote fusion of carrier zzso with target zzso Members of this class of proteins are expressed in all zzso cells and distributed in distinct zzso zzso All zzso transport mechanisms known to date have an essential requirement for a member of the zzso protein family, including the zzso in regulated zzso A zzso of zzso was cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso of partially fed female zzso zzso zzso was used to specifically reduce the amount of zzso zzso and protein in female adult tick zzso zzso This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in zzso protein release by the zzso and by abnormalities in feeding by zzso treated zzso We report the efficacy of zzso zzso interference in zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso in tick zzso zzso and the zzso of this technique for studying the mechanism of zzso in tick zzso zzso
