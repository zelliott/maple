The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso The alignment of zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso proteins with bacterial and zzso zzso revealed the presence within zzso of signatures shared by zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso proteins of zzso zzso are the earliest and the least zzso zzso within the family zzso sister group to the zzso zzso of zzso These results are in good agreement with the data obtained when using other molecular zzso and show the closest relationship between zzso and zzso The possible nature of zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been considered on the basis of the assumption that they and zzso could have a common evolutionary zzso
