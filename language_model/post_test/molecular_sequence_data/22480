zzso and related genes zzso the zzso of the zzso component of the major group zzso 1 of zzso 2) of bacterial zzso zzso zzso complexes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso gel zzso zzso method was developed to assess the diversity of zzso gene sequences in environmental samples using a newly designed moderately zzso primer set suitable for that zzso In 35 zzso bacterial strains isolated from a hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso genes were only detected in two zzso zzso and were identical to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso The diversity of zzso genes was examined in DNA extracts from contaminated and zzso subsurface samples at a site containing a zzso groundwater zzso zzso in zzso patterns were observed between strongly zzso less contaminated and zzso samples and between different zzso suggesting that the diversity of zzso genes was determined by environmental conditions including the contamination zzso zzso analysis of the protein sequences deduced from the amplified zzso showed that the diversity of zzso in the environment is larger than suggested from described zzso from cultured zzso which was translated in the zzso zzso Although different positions on the zzso gel can zzso to closely related zzso relationships could be noticed between the position of zzso zzso in the zzso profile and the zzso position of the deduced protein zzso
