The cloned zzso zzso fur zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso by using a zzso expression system, and the zzso protein zzso was zzso by using a combination of zzso zzso and metal affinity zzso The DNA binding activity of the zzso protein was confirmed by gel mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso of the synthetic DNA zzso zzso zzso representing a perfect zzso zzso In addition, it was shown that zzso is capable of binding to promoter and operator zzso of the tightly zzso zzso coli zzso zzso gene zzso The activity of zzso on the promoters of zzso genes involved in the production of two zzso zzso and zzso and in the expression of zzso A was zzso Data indicating that the promoters of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso a positive regulator for zzso production, are specifically recognized by zzso are zzso suggesting that zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso during growth in an zzso zzso However, neither the promoter region of the gene zzso zzso A zzso nor the promoters of the zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso with high zzso of zzso zzso These data indicate that iron regulation of zzso A production involves additional factors which may ultimately be under the control of zzso
