In 1996, a common zzso circular code, called X, is identified in genes of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso This circular code X is a set of 20 zzso allowing the reading frames in genes to be retrieved locally, zzso anywhere in genes and in particular without start zzso This reading frame retrieval needs a window length zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso With a window length strictly less than 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso some words of X, called ambiguous words, are found in the shifted frames (the reading frame shifted by one or two zzso preventing the reading frame in genes to be zzso Since 1996, these ambiguous words of X were never zzso In the first part of this paper, we identify all the ambiguous words of the common zzso circular code zzso With a length zzso varying from 1 to 11 zzso the type and the occurrence number zzso of ambiguous words of X are given in each shifted zzso zzso ambiguous words of X, words which are not factors of another ambiguous words, are also zzso Two probability definitions based on these results show that the common zzso circular code X zzso the reading frame in genes with a probability of about zzso with a window length of 6 zzso and a probability of zzso with a window length of 9 zzso zzso with a window length of 12 zzso by definition of a circular zzso In the second part of this paper, we identify X circular code motifs zzso X zzso in transfer zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso X motif of 26 zzso including the zzso zzso and seven zzso zzso X motifs of length greater or equal to 15 zzso Window lengths of reading frame retrieval with each zzso of these X motifs are also zzso Thanks to the crystal structure zzso zzso et zzso zzso a zzso zzso of X motifs in the zzso shows several spatial zzso involving zzso X zzso zzso and zzso X zzso and four zzso zzso X zzso Another identified zzso zzso X motif is involved in the decoding center which recognizes the zzso zzso in zzso From a code theory point of view, these identified X circular code motifs and their mathematical properties may constitute a translation code involved in zzso maintenance and synchronization of reading frames in zzso
