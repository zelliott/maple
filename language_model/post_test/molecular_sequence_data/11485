The sequencing of a zzso zzso region zzso for a zzso gene previously cloned from a strain defined as zzso zzso et zzso 1994) has revealed that it was a zzso zzso The zzso gene product has been localized at the cell surface of the zzso cell by zzso zzso The zzso protein contains four regions with repeated sequences which account for about zzso of the zzso acids of this zzso A functional analysis of the major repeated region has revealed that it plays an important role in determining the zzso zzso A gene disruption experiment has shown that zzso strain zzso zzso contains at least two zzso genes of the zzso type but that they are supposed to be inactive and do not contribute to its zzso However, zzso zzso zzso performed on intact cells have revealed that a protein expressed at the cell surface of the zzso strain zzso zzso is zzso related to zzso A deletion analysis of the zzso region of the zzso gene has shown that the expression is submitted to controls which depend on the genetic background of the zzso
