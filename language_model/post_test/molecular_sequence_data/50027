The zzso zzso a zzso channel in zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso of skeletal zzso In a previous study zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso we reported that zzso caused zzso release through zzso zzso from the heavy fraction of zzso zzso isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle, and that it specifically bound to a 97 zzso protein which was distinct from zzso or zzso The present study was undertaken to identify and characterize the 97 zzso zzso zzso The 97 zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso by zzso column zzso and zzso zzso The partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso 97 zzso protein was matched with that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso pattern of the 97 zzso protein was identical with that of zzso Furthermore, zzso specifically bound to zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso release was inhibited by zzso addition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso These results indicate that the 97 zzso zzso protein is zzso which zzso regulates zzso release from zzso There may be a functional zzso between zzso release from zzso and zzso for energy supply zzso through zzso in skeletal zzso
