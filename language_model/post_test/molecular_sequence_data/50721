zzso zzso was used to zzso an zzso coli expression library of unique zzso zzso The cassette encodes a central zzso zzso surrounded by every combination of Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Pro zzso over a zzso segment (a total of zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso The cassette was inserted into the gene of a suitable carrier protein and expressed in zzso coli with the zzso expression system, and the zzso library was subjected to zzso protein zzso zzso on zzso zzso When the library was screened with zzso zzso the modified zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso individual colonies that expressed zzso for this zzso were zzso By DNA sequencing through the cassette region of positive zzso the consensus recognition sequence for zzso delta was deduced and found to conform with the well-established zzso selectivity of its zzso zzso zzso Because a large number of clones can be zzso zzso and the positions of zzso zzso zzso a recognition site identified, this approach may be useful as a general screen of protein zzso zzso zzso
