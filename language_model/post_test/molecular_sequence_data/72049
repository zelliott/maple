zzso zzso zzso from the water zzso zzso zzso reared under zzso was analyzed by two-dimensional gel zzso The zzso was shown to be composed of six major zzso chain species zzso as zzso to zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are different from one another, indicating that at least four zzso genes are present in zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso are the same as those of zzso and zzso zzso The six zzso chains were also found in the animal reared under zzso in small amounts and with altered zzso the extent of decrease under zzso was higher in the amounts of zzso zzso and zzso than those of zzso These results indicate that the zzso genes are zzso regulated by the ambient oxygen zzso Four zzso genes zzso a cluster in the order, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found on the zzso of zzso zzso The complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso genes and their zzso showed that the genes have a zzso zzso zzso The structure consists of an zzso separating an zzso zzso a zzso signal zzso two large repeated regions of a zzso zzso structure that zzso each a domain containing a zzso site, and an zzso bridging the two repeated zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the gene products showed higher than zzso identity to one another and showed unique features zzso in zzso magna zzso zzso The analysis also suggested that zzso (or zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
