zzso of zzso C virus zzso infection in humans and chimpanzees is thought to be associated with the induction of strong zzso zzso We studied four chimpanzees infected with zzso derived from an infectious full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso Two of the chimpanzees cleared the infection to zzso levels for more than 12 months of zzso the other two became persistently zzso zzso analyses of zzso immune responses were performed during the courses of infection in these zzso Only weak and transient T helper responses were detected during the acute phase in all four zzso A comparison of the frequency of gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells in peripheral blood by zzso zzso did not reveal any correlation between viral clearance and zzso zzso In addition, analyses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in liver zzso presumably indicative of zzso zzso responses, revealed no distinct pattern in these chimpanzees with respect to infection zzso The present study suggests that the outcome of zzso infection in chimpanzees is not necessarily attributable to zzso sequence variation and that chimpanzees may recover from zzso infection by mechanisms other than the induction of readily zzso zzso zzso zzso
