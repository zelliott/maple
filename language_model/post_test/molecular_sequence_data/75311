The complete sequence of a zzso zzso zzso is presented that codes for zzso extended at its zzso by a 52 zzso acid zzso The sequence of both the zzso portion and the tail is highly zzso to the one of zzso zzso and to a partial mouse zzso The highly basic tail sequence contains a putative metal and zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extended zzso is represented only once in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as its translation product, a 15 zzso zzso is expressed in zzso growing cells and remains present for at least 5 h of zzso Using zzso against a synthetic zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso acid zzso a 15 zzso protein containing the extension a synthetic zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso acid zzso a 15 zzso protein containing the extension was also detected in zzso
