Development of a vaccine against zzso zzso infection is an urgent priority particularly because of widespread resistance to most traditionally used zzso Multiple zzso point to zzso membrane zzso as a prime vaccine candidate directed against zzso zzso asexual zzso To gain understanding of the genetic and demographic forces shaping the zzso sequence diversity in zzso a part of zzso gene covering zzso was zzso from 100 blood samples of malaria zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the sequences were performed using zzso and zzso Very high zzso diversity was detected both at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An abundance of low frequency zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso mismatch distribution and a zzso zzso network of zzso zzso indicated a recent population expansion among zzso zzso The high minimum number of zzso events zzso and a significantly high zzso of zzso zzso in zzso suggested zzso and positive selection as major forces in the generation and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the impact of observed zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interaction solutions were mapped between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and global energies of zzso interaction complexes at the hotspot contact zzso were observed together with zzso of surface zzso zzso at the zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso Finally, a comparison of zzso zzso zzso in five Indian regional zzso retrieved from zzso revealed a significant level of genetic differentiation zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso our results indicated a very high zzso and zzso diversity, a high zzso rate and a signature of natural selection favoring zzso of zzso zzso that facilitated zzso interaction and hence zzso growth in zzso clinical zzso
