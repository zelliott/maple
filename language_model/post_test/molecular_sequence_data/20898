Selective lowering of zzso levels with zzso zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's zzso In this work, we developed a high zzso zzso for screening of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso values of known zzso zzso generated with this method were comparable with reported values obtained by other zzso The zzso was zzso and applied to a small-scale screening of zzso zzso The discovery of several new zzso warrants further zzso This zzso was also proven to be easily adopted to test compounds for zzso and mouse zzso which could be very useful to assess compounds activity against zzso from different species before the in zzso test in animal zzso
