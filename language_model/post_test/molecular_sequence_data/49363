The zzso gene cluster zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is organized in zzso units zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding of the response regulator protein zzso to zzso zzso and zzso DNA promoter fragments was shown by means of zzso shift zzso A repeated zzso sequence spaced by six zzso was identified as zzso binding motif zzso Saturating zzso analysis of the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso revealed the consensus motif zzso for optimal zzso binding with the second, third and fifth position being absolutely zzso Variations in the zzso size between the two zzso repeats revealed a strong conservation of their relative zzso Only DNA with a zzso arrangement of two zzso repeats showed affinity to zzso A zzso zzso between zzso and DNA was obtained by optical zzso zzso which zzso to the binding of two zzso proteins per zzso
