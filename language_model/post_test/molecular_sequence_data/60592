The zzso zzso zzso zzso forms zzso zzso zzso release channels in the zzso zzso of all zzso zzso The zzso has been suggested to have six zzso regions zzso near its zzso zzso A zzso zzso strategy was applied to define the location of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells and single channel function was defined in zzso zzso zzso zzso having the fifth and sixth zzso (and the zzso zzso zzso but missing all other zzso formed channels with zzso properties similar to zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso channels bound zzso but zzso occupancy did not regulate the zzso open pore zzso zzso zzso We propose that a region of 191 zzso acids (including the fifth and sixth zzso zzso zzso near the zzso zzso of the protein forms the zzso zzso Further, we have produced a zzso open zzso pore zzso that is ideal for future zzso zzso studies of the zzso relationships that define zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
