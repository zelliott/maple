The extraction of zzso from zzso for reverse zzso zzso is time-consuming and contributes to variation in analysis of the Philadelphia zzso zzso of chronic zzso leukemia zzso by zzso To detect residual zzso after bone zzso zzso zzso from at least zzso zzso should be zzso but the zzso activity of the cells zzso simple zzso zzso as an alternative to zzso zzso We sought to identify the main source of zzso activity of zzso 

We used a three-step zzso process and zzso acid sequence zzso We selected zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso and selected zzso cells by zzso the zzso with a zzso density zzso 

zzso and zzso acid sequencing identified zzso zzso zzso as the main source of zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced the zzso content of cell zzso by approximately zzso allowing a signal from a zzso of 50 zzso zzso cells mixed with zzso zzso zzso that was equivalent to zzso of the signal in the absence of zzso A similar zzso with zzso cells gave a signal equivalent to zzso of that without zzso zzso zzso extraction gave a signal equivalent to only zzso of the zzso zzso 

The depletion of zzso during the preparation of zzso samples for zzso efficiently reduces the risk of zzso degradation by zzso enabling zzso analysis directly from cell zzso with a better signal than can be obtained by zzso zzso
