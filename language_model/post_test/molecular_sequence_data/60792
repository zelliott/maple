zzso studies have shown that the zzso motif occurs in several viral zzso zzso including zzso zzso and influenza virus zzso Here, the zzso program was designed as a specialized program for identifying zzso regions in viral zzso zzso Based upon the use of zzso as well as other zzso tools, we report detailed sequence analyses of zzso regions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, sequence analyses of these proteins outside their putative zzso zzso illustrate some structural differences between zzso zzso previous zzso studies, the zzso regions detected by zzso provide further evidence that the zzso coiled zzso is a common motif found in many diverse viral zzso zzso The abundance and structural conservation of this zzso even in the absence of sequence zzso suggests that it is critical for zzso membrane zzso The zzso program is available at zzso
