The ability of zzso zzso to produce and tolerate organic acids from zzso metabolism represents a major zzso factor responsible for the formation of zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso intermediate that, when zzso to other zzso pathways such as zzso acid zzso results in the zzso of acid stress by reducing acid end products and aiding in maintenance of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso genes such as zzso and zzso were identified as being zzso in a zzso analysis of zzso zzso under acid stress conditions zzso zzso Len, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene product is involved with zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso as well as in the production of zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we constructed and characterized an zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso Growth experiments revealed that the zzso zzso strain has a lag in growth when nutritionally limited for zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrated that the loss of zzso causes a decrease in acid zzso The zzso strain exhibits a zzso in zzso zzso activity and has reduced zzso activity for zzso and zzso zzso from zzso studies showed that the zzso promoter is zzso during growth at low zzso zzso the results of this investigation show that zzso acid metabolism is a component of the zzso repertoire of zzso zzso
