The zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously isolated from a failed sour cream zzso Its complete zzso sequence zzso zzso is reported here, and the analysis indicated that it represents a new zzso zzso zzso zzso A striking feature of zzso zzso is the low level of similarity of its zzso zzso open reading zzso with proteins in zzso A global gene expression study confirmed the presence of two early gene zzso in zzso The unusual zzso of these zzso combined with results of comparative analysis with other zzso zzso zzso suggests that one of these zzso was acquired through zzso events between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the major zzso protein were demonstrated through structural protein zzso A programmed zzso zzso between the major tail protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso was also zzso A zzso zzso signal followed by putative secondary structures is likely involved in zzso To our knowledge, this is only the second report of zzso zzso zzso in zzso DNA zzso and the first case of zzso zzso between an zzso and an zzso Thus, zzso zzso represents a fascinating member of a new species with unusual characteristics that brings new insights into zzso zzso zzso
