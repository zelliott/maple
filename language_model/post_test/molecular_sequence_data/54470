zzso zzso has been successful in identifying zzso size regulators such as zzso factors, zzso and signal zzso Among them, a zzso zzso family of zzso genes zzso peptides with no zzso zzso is unique in that their zzso have a reduced number of leaf cells specifically along the zzso zzso However, because the zzso lack any obvious zzso with functionally identified zzso and because of genetic zzso among zzso their molecular and zzso roles are zzso In this study we focused on one member in the family, zzso zzso and identified the core functional region within it and we found no zzso processing in zzso zzso analysis of leaf zzso revealed that zzso zzso reduces the zzso zone size within the leaf zzso Moreover, induced local zzso demonstrated that zzso acts as a regulator of the leaf shape via a change in zzso cue along the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso results in a zzso of the main zzso zzso again indicating a change in zzso cue along the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso affects the zzso cue and cell proliferation along the body zzso
