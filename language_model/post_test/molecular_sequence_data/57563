We show that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso DNA binding and zzso by zzso were induced in zzso cells upon treatment with the antioxidants zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and upon transient expression of the zzso zzso zzso While zzso and zzso enhanced DNA binding and zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on its own was only a weak zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was dependent on protein synthesis and involved zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso by the serum response element, suggesting that serum response factor and associated proteins function as primary zzso zzso zzso In the same cell line, the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso B behaved in a manner zzso opposite to zzso DNA binding and zzso by zzso B were strongly activated by zzso while the antioxidants alone were zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso B by zzso zzso while zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso did not influence protein zzso C zzso activity and zzso zzso by zzso indicating that the zzso acted downstream of and independently from zzso
