zzso zzso zzso zzso fulfill an important role in zzso metabolism and therefore have extensively been studied in zzso and zzso However, no zzso genes have been described in avian species to zzso In this paper, we report the zzso functional analysis, and regulation of chicken zzso The sequence shares up to zzso zzso acid identity with zzso in other zzso The zzso of zzso in chicken zzso cells zzso male zzso zzso led to increased zzso zzso zzso regulation was studied in zzso cells at the zzso level and in reporter gene zzso using a construct containing zzso zzso of its zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso or zzso led to a zzso or zzso increase in zzso zzso and a zzso or zzso increase in reporter gene zzso zzso A zzso response zzso unit zzso of 239 zzso containing a zzso nuclear zzso binding site was identified within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso revealed the requirement of this motif for zzso induction by zzso The chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso in zzso shift and zzso zzso Furthermore, the related nuclear zzso mouse zzso and mouse zzso zzso this zzso element, suggesting evolutionary conservation of nuclear zzso interactions in zzso zzso
