Class 1 zzso carried by pathogens have acquired over 100 different gene zzso zzso resistance to zzso compounds, helping to generate a crisis in the management of infectious zzso It is presumed that these zzso originated from environmental bacteria, but exchange of gene zzso has surprisingly never been demonstrated outside laboratory or clinical zzso We aimed to identify a natural environment where such exchanges might occur, and determine the zzso range of participating zzso Here we examine freshwater zzso and show that families of zzso zzso resistance to zzso ammonium compounds zzso are found on class 1 zzso identical to those from clinical zzso on sequence zzso of class 1 zzso only known from natural zzso and on other diverse classes of zzso only known from the zzso of soil and freshwater zzso We conclude that gene zzso might be readily shared between different zzso classes found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that class 1 zzso in pathogens have access to a vast pool of gene zzso any of which could zzso a zzso of clinical zzso zzso of this resource might allow identification of resistance or zzso genes before they become part of zzso human zzso
