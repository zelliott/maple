The zzso rust resistance gene from zzso generates at least four transcript classes by alternative zzso of the third zzso The most abundant transcript class encodes a resistance protein containing zzso that include zzso binding site motifs and a zzso repeat region zzso The remaining three transcript classes zzso truncated products which lack most of the zzso part of the protein containing the zzso region zzso The four transcript classes occur in all plant zzso examined and no induction of zzso expression was observed following infection of resistant plants with an zzso rust strain expressing the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso plants transgenic for an zzso zzso zzso incapable of zzso truncated resistance proteins by alternative zzso expressed zzso resistance indistinguishable from that of the zzso zzso zzso a definitive role for alternative transcripts and their predicted truncated products could not be assigned in the zzso rust zzso
