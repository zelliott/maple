zzso (short zzso zzso is a novel orphan zzso that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain and interacts with other members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso sequences required for interaction with other zzso members, and have defined an zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso system, a fusion of full-length zzso to the zzso DNA binding domain shows zzso zzso interaction with a zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso By deletion analysis, sequences required for this zzso interaction map to the central portion of zzso zzso acids 92 to zzso The same region is required for interaction with zzso in zzso and in the zzso zzso system, and results from the zzso system suggest that the same zzso sequences are required for interaction with other members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso such as zzso hormone zzso and zzso acid zzso In zzso cells, a zzso fusion protein shows about zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso alone, and fusion of zzso to the C zzso of a zzso fusion to generate a triple zzso also results in a strong decrease in zzso zzso zzso required for this zzso function were mapped to the C zzso of zzso This region is distinct from that required for zzso interaction by other members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso and zzso did not interact with zzso in either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso Together, these results identify novel zzso interaction and zzso zzso in zzso and suggest two distinct mechanisms for zzso of zzso signaling pathways by zzso
