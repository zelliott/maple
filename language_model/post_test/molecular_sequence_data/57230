The precise molecular abnormalities that cause primary cortisol resistance have not been completely zzso In a subject with primary cortisol resistance we have observed zzso receptors zzso with a decreased affinity for zzso We zzso that a zzso of the zzso zzso domain is the cause of cortisol zzso Total zzso isolated from the index zzso zzso zzso was used to produce first strand zzso zzso and the entire zzso zzso was amplified in segments and zzso At zzso zzso we identified a zzso A for G point zzso that predicts an zzso zzso for zzso zzso substitution at zzso acid zzso When the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells and zzso for zzso zzso the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells that were zzso with the mouse zzso tumor virus long terminal repeat fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso a fourfold decrease in apparent potency on zzso stimulation of zzso zzso The zzso for zzso substitution at zzso acid zzso zzso the function of the zzso and is the likely cause of primary cortisol resistance in this zzso
