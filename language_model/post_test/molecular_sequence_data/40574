We combined molecular dynamics based free energy calculations with sum frequency generation zzso zzso to study the zzso distribution of zzso peptides near zzso zzso Using a simplified zzso model of the polystyrene zzso surface, molecular dynamics simulations have been applied to zzso the zzso probability of an zzso zzso zzso 2, with respect to the zzso zzso Free energy calculations revealed that the preferred zzso zzso orientation was driven by the favorable interactions between the zzso zzso surface and the zzso zzso on the zzso and additional simulations examined the importance of small zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained via zzso zzso zzso suggest that, at very low zzso zzso zzso molecules tend to lie down at the zzso zzso which zzso well with the simulation zzso When the concentration is increased, peptides exhibit behavior not captured by MD simulations using single zzso zzso A combination of simulations and experiments was shown to yield more reliable results with zzso insights into interaction between peptides and zzso zzso
