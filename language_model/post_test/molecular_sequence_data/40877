zzso zzso is a species from the bacterial family zzso members of which participate in zzso production and in environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and are required for zzso oxide reduction and for optimal current production in microbial fuel zzso zzso is an zzso binding zzso which is an zzso acting together with the alternative zzso factor, zzso in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are involved in regulation of expression of the zzso zzso whose product is zzso a structural component of a zzso Using zzso approaches, we predicted zzso zzso sequence elements that are likely to be regulated by zzso The functional importance of the zzso region containing a zzso binding site predicted upstream of the zzso gene was zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso binding sites are similar to zzso binding sites of zzso and zzso While the number of predicted zzso sites did not zzso from that expected by chance, multiple sites were predicted upstream of genes with roles in zzso and function of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and in cell wall zzso suggesting the possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso in regulation of production and assembly of zzso and zzso
