The mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the membrane of zzso zzso and zzso are largely zzso We have identified a new family of small zzso proteins zzso that are present in zzso zzso and related zzso zzso One of these zzso termed zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso showed that both fatty acids are required for zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso based on its recovery in the buoyant fraction after zzso zzso extraction and zzso density zzso and zzso with the major surface zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso was not affected when zzso zzso and the properties of zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso treatment of zzso with zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso also had no affect on zzso zzso despite causing the massive zzso of the zzso membrane and the partial or complete loss of internal zzso and zzso rod structures, zzso These data suggest that zzso membrane targeting of zzso is not dependent on zzso structures and that zzso in zzso membrane zzso composition disrupt zzso zzso
