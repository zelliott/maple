The blood of the adult zzso contains one major zzso component zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 2, zzso zzso and one minor one zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 2, zzso zzso The zzso were separated by zzso on a zzso zzso zzso column, and zzso with a linear zzso zzso while the zzso chains were zzso on a zzso exchange zzso zzso peptides from the zzso chains were separated by zzso on an zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence was determined by automatic zzso degradation, using film and gas phase zzso For the alpha zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso alignment was carried out relative to the corresponding chains of the zzso goose zzso zzso The close zzso relationship between zzso tree sparrow and zzso is verified by the zzso zzso The zzso of the major and minor zzso components of the zzso are not yet zzso Thus, the results were interpreted on the basis of primary zzso zzso of possible structural significance were examined with the help of molecular zzso
