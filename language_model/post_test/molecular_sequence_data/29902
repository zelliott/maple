The zzso zzso zzso from the seeds of zzso zzso has been shown to react specifically with the Gal beta zzso and the zzso alpha zzso beta zzso sequence which represent the T zzso and the cryptic T zzso zzso We report here the development of labeling techniques that apply zzso to stain zzso sections from rat zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of zzso complexes with 10 zzso Gal beta zzso zzso T zzso or 10 zzso Gal beta zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso reaction also abolished the zzso zzso demonstrating specificity for zzso linked zzso A comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso detects the T zzso and its cryptic form in tissue zzso Application of the zzso zzso sequence abolished zzso (and zzso zzso binding to the T zzso but not to its cryptic form, and therefore permitted their differentiation in tissue zzso zzso evidence was obtained indicating that zzso is a more specific zzso zzso than peanut zzso Data are presented that show the differential expression of the T zzso and the cryptic T zzso in zzso and cells of rat fetuses late in zzso zzso zzso can be used for zzso detection of the T zzso and the cryptic T zzso and zzso discrimination between zzso
