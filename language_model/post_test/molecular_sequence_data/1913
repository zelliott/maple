zzso was originally identified as a protein that binds and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is recognized to have at least two separate zzso as a zzso zzso and second as an inhibitor of zzso an accessory protein of DNA zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA zzso Additionally, zzso plays a role in DNA repair, zzso cellular zzso terminal zzso and cell cycle arrest upon zzso zzso zzso protein levels are regulated both by zzso control by zzso and by factors other than zzso as well as by zzso zzso Although the role of zzso has been explained so far only by its interaction with zzso and with zzso it has several other binding zzso The ability of zzso to participate in several cellular functions has been widely studied by zzso of cells with zzso zzso We describe here procedures for analysis of zzso function in zzso cells after zzso of zzso zzso The procedures include zzso of DNA zzso cellular zzso association with binding partners, and zzso zzso
