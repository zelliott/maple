zzso display zzso chain reaction has been used to isolate genes regulated in vascular zzso cells by the zzso factor vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso Analysis of one of the bands consistently zzso by zzso led us to the identification of a zzso from a human zzso vein zzso cell library that is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso zzso We have referred to the predicted protein as zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence showed an almost identical pattern to zzso suggesting 12 zzso zzso a large zzso loop with potential zzso sites, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was highly expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and zzso showing a distinct pattern and size from zzso and zzso The zzso zzso level in zzso cells increased on treatment with zzso and decreased with the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso whereas zzso zzso levels remained zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells produced a zzso of approximately 150 zzso which was reduced to 120 zzso by zzso zzso An increased initial zzso rate of zzso was seen in clones with high zzso zzso which was dependent on zzso zzso but not zzso and was zzso by the loop zzso agent zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso hybrid analysis placed zzso within an area associated with juvenile zzso zzso These results suggest zzso is a new member of the zzso family that is under distinct regulation from zzso
