Two synthetic zzso designated peptides zzso and zzso representing zzso acids zzso of the G zzso of respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso were evaluated for their properties as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso These peptides were used to characterize the immune response of children with naturally occurring zzso infection during six annual zzso in the Huntington area, West Virginia, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The study group comprised 43 paired zzso from 42 infants and children, who ranged in age between 1 month and zzso years of age zzso age 16 zzso The inclusion criteria were zzso identification of zzso respiratory tract illness requiring admission to hospital, and the availability of paired zzso Five of 30 children with zzso A and 3 of 13 children with zzso B infections developed zzso or dual fourfold or greater zzso responses to peptides zzso and zzso during zzso six of these eight children also developed zzso rises to whole virus zzso Twenty children zzso zzso A and 6 zzso zzso developed such responses in zzso only to whole virus (not to the zzso and 15 children (11 zzso A and 4 zzso zzso failed to develop a rise in zzso Children who developed rises in zzso to the peptides were usually less than 9 months of age, suggesting that a response to peptides was more likely to occur during primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso G protein lacked sufficient sensitivity and specificity to serve as zzso for zzso for characterizing the zzso immune responses to zzso infection in infants and zzso
