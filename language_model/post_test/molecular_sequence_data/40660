The crystal structure of a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined to zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso a central zzso bundle forms the active zzso However, in zzso an unexpected intertwined swapping of two of the zzso that compose the zzso zzso bundle results in a zzso zzso that has not previously been observed for this zzso Interestingly, despite this novel mode of zzso the zzso site for zzso zzso such as zzso that are essential for zzso activity is still zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso that are involved in sugar binding of the zzso are also zzso when compared with other zzso zzso but those that recognize the zzso bases are not zzso suggesting a different zzso zzso
