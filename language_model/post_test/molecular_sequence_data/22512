Identification of zzso could lead to the development of effective screening tests for zzso zzso A previous study from our laboratory showed specific zzso of nuclear structure in colon zzso In an effort to characterize these zzso protein spots were selected from zzso made by two-dimensional gel zzso which were analyzed by mass zzso The sequences obtained from the isolated spots revealed that they have close similarity to zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso F zzso zzso and high mobility group box 1 protein zzso zzso To determine the expression of these proteins in colon cancer, expression was studied in 9 tumor and matched adjacent normal pairs, 5 donor zzso 16 zzso 4 zzso liver zzso and matched adjacent normal pairs, and 3 liver zzso zzso and zzso F were expressed in zzso and zzso of colon tumors, zzso zzso F had a higher frequency of expression than zzso in zzso zzso With the establishment of differential expression of the proteins in colon cancer, their zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso studied both showed high protein levels of zzso F in colon tumors compared with normal colon zzso Surprisingly, zzso levels of zzso were decreased in colon tumors, suggesting that the observed high zzso levels in nuclear zzso extracts are caused by the enhanced zzso of zzso to the nuclear zzso during colon zzso These results suggest an involvement of zzso F and zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, they suggest that zzso F is a potential marker for zzso cancer zzso
