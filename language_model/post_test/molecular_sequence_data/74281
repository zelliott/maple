Although zzso are zzso many species including zzso zzso are zzso We previously reported that a zzso coat zzso protein zzso consisting of 12 zzso zzso growth zzso repeats, is a candidate zzso protein in zzso zzso because the isolated zzso shows higher affinity to zzso than to zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in a low density zzso membrane fraction is a zzso binding partner for zzso We found that zzso specifically interacts with zzso which had been separated by zzso and transferred onto a zzso zzso zzso has an zzso sugar chain, essential for binding to zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso but not in the zzso and the protein appears to be localized on the surface of zzso head and zzso zzso zzso which zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso to zzso However, no significant difference in the binding ability of zzso to zzso was observed in zzso and zzso combinations by Far Western zzso These results indicate that zzso binding in zzso zzso is zzso by the molecular interaction between zzso on the zzso surface and zzso on the zzso coat, but that zzso per zzso is unlikely to be a direct zzso zzso
