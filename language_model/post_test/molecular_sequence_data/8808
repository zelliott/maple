zzso B zzso radiation is a potent zzso of zzso immune responses, particularly those involving the synthesis and the zzso of zzso The discovery of a new T cell zzso zzso prompted use to investigate its expression in skin and to examine the effects of zzso radiation on such zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sheets derived from human zzso as well as from zzso and zzso skin cell populations were zzso for zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Following zzso treatment, zzso zzso was induced in zzso sheets and enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was traced to zzso cells (presumably zzso and not to zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed zzso levels of zzso zzso that were also zzso following zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of zzso protein by zzso that was enhanced following zzso zzso These results constitute the first report of zzso zzso expression and protein production in human zzso In addition to expanding the known influence of zzso radiation on the capacity of zzso and zzso zzso to express zzso zzso these findings suggest a new mechanism by which zzso can promote zzso T cell responses via zzso of zzso
