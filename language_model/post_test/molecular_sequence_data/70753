The mouse zzso contains several zzso of the zzso zzso One zzso zzso contains zzso full-length members and is expanding due to zzso of a large number of active zzso Here we studied the zzso zzso untranslated region zzso which contains promoter activity required for zzso zzso Using reporter zzso we show that promoter activity is derived from zzso zzso sequences and is zzso to the number of zzso in the zzso zzso These data suggest that nearly all full-length zzso elements in the mouse zzso are currently competent for zzso We aligned the sequences of 53 zzso to generate a consensus zzso zzso and determined that most zzso elements are truncated near a potential binding site for a zzso initiation zzso We also determined that much of the sequence variation among zzso zzso results from transition zzso at zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso at zzso
