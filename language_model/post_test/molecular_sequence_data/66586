zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso vaccines designed to elicit zzso immunity in zzso persons are under investigation in phase I to III clinical zzso Little is known about how these vaccines impact the zzso response zzso in persons who break through despite zzso Here, we describe the first comprehensive characterization of zzso zzso immunity in vaccine study participants following breakthrough zzso infection in comparison to 16 zzso subjects with primary zzso zzso Whereas none of the 16 breakthrough infections possessed zzso zzso zzso responses zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso with primary zzso infection developed zzso zzso responses zzso zzso subjects' T cells recognized 43 unique zzso zzso zzso of which 8 are newly zzso and zzso were present in the zzso The zzso of gamma zzso zzso cells recognizing zzso within gene products that were and were not zzso by the vaccine were not different zzso zzso zzso which suggests that responses were not zzso zzso within zzso and zzso proteins were the most commonly recognized in both vaccinated and zzso infected zzso One individual controlled viral replication without zzso therapy and, notably, mounted a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in this individual were able to zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso as well as zzso and zzso in response to their zzso zzso peptides up to 5 years zzso In conclusion, a zzso ability to mount an zzso zzso response zzso is not compromised by previous zzso since the zzso zzso responses zzso are similar to those seen in zzso zzso Finding an individual who is controlling infection highlights the importance of comprehensive studies of breakthrough infections in vaccine trials to determine whether host zzso responses and/or viral characteristics are responsible for controlling viral zzso
