zzso zzso is the major structural constituent of zzso zzso in the zzso It is zzso as a zzso that is larger than the collagen deposited in the zzso In this study, we investigated the conversion of zzso zzso to collagen zzso in human skin and in zzso cells in zzso and identified the zzso using zzso zzso For this purpose, two bacterial fusion proteins containing unique sequences of the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso were prepared, and zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso isolated from cultured zzso but not with collagen zzso extracted from the zzso zzso experiments with the zzso zzso revealed a strong reaction in cultured zzso but the basement membrane zone of normal skin remained zzso The zzso could not be rendered positive by chemical or zzso zzso of potential hidden zzso in the skin, indicating that most of the zzso domain is absent from normal zzso In contrast, a positive zzso with zzso zzso was observed in the skin of a patient with zzso zzso was observed in the skin of a patient with zzso zzso zzso who carried a zzso deletion at one of the zzso junctions of the collagen zzso zzso This aberration led to an zzso skipping of zzso 115 from the zzso and eliminated 29 zzso acids from the zzso domain which include the putative zzso site for the zzso processing zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that in normal human skin, the removal of the zzso domain from zzso zzso precedes its deposition at the zzso zzso Furthermore, they suggest that an aberration in the zzso zzso zzso interferes with the normal zzso of the zzso zzso
