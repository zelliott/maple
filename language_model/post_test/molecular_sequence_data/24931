The zzso system in zzso is comprised of three independently developed pairs of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso is composed of various zzso and zzso cell types that fulfill multiple zzso However, the molecular mechanisms regulating their zzso and functions are still largely zzso In this paper, we report that two class B basic zzso zzso zzso regulators delineate the zzso and the zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso a novel class B zzso factor, is specifically expressed in the zzso duct cells, while the zzso cells are characterized by the expression of another class B zzso factor, zzso The molecular nature of zzso was also zzso it binds to specific sequences of DNA as a zzso with a class A zzso factor and acts as a negative zzso regulator against other zzso zzso This study provides an important cue towards better understanding of the generation and function of multiple cell types in zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression exhibits a reverse relationship with the development of male zzso suggesting its role in gender zzso in the zzso zzso
