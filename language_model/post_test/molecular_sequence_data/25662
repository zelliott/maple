zzso brain high molecular weight zzso proteins zzso can be displaced from assembled zzso by peptides corresponding to the second of three zzso repeated sequences in mouse zzso The zzso zzso zzso can release zzso from zzso zzso and the extended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso in the absence of zzso or zzso agents, and zzso acts as a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant for zzso binding to zzso zzso was zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and 14 zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We estimate that the zzso constant for zzso zzso is about zzso zzso about 100 times lower than for the zzso of zzso These observations suggest that the second repeated sequence in zzso may represent an important recognition site for zzso binding to zzso and that other structural features within zzso may reinforce the strength of zzso zzso
