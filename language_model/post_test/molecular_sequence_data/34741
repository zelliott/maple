zzso is a unique zzso from zzso zzso zzso exhibiting high activity at low temperature and high stability in organic zzso such as zzso A zzso zzso open reading frame of the zzso gene zzso 607 zzso acid zzso consisting of an zzso zzso a mature zzso and a zzso zzso The mature zzso region showed zzso 57% and zzso sequence identity with the mature forms of zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso motifs of zzso are well zzso in zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli zzso cells and the zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso mature form from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is indistinguishable from the zzso zzso directly from zzso To obtain zzso exhibiting higher stability in organic zzso random zzso were introduced by zzso zzso and 600 zzso were zzso The zzso zzso exhibits two times higher stability in organic zzso than the zzso zzso A plausible mechanism for the stability of the zzso zzso in organic zzso was discussed based on zzso models of zzso and the zzso zzso
