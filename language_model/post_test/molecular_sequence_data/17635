Emerging evidence implicates zzso zzso heavy chain gene zzso in the targeting of heavy chain genes for switch zzso In this study, cloned zzso copies of the major zzso alpha heavy chain transcript expressed in the zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso a cell line that switches to zzso in culture, have been used to characterize the zzso alpha zzso zzso The zzso end of these transcripts are heterogeneous, being derived from an zzso zzso I alpha located approximately zzso zzso zzso of the alpha switch zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso clones reveals that alternate zzso donor sites generate I alpha zzso of varying zzso While the two smaller spliced forms of I alpha contain stop zzso in the open reading frame of the C alpha zzso transcripts utilizing the 3' most zzso donor signal may zzso a protein in which zzso acids derived from the 3' end of the I alpha zzso are fused to the C alpha zzso
