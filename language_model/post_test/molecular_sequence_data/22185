In many complexes formed by zzso zzso and their zzso the zzso group provided by water zzso or by the inhibitor zzso zzso is located close to the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the role of this group, we zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso isolated from the seeds of sunflower modified in zzso by zzso zzso and both zzso of zzso zzso All the zzso zzso inhibited bovine zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso appear to be potent zzso of bovine zzso whereas zzso is practically zzso Also zzso zzso activity of zzso is significantly zzso Since the zzso interaction between zzso zzso group of the inhibitor zzso position and zzso of zzso zzso is the main driving force for interaction of both zzso the results obtained are very zzso We believe that these zzso zzso belong to a novel class of zzso zzso zzso
