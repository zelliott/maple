zzso Associated Mouse zzso 1 zzso was isolated from plasma of female zzso An zzso raised against the zzso protein confirmed its zzso identity with the originally described zzso zzso females were observed to have plasma levels of zzso that are increased zzso at day zzso of gestation relative to zzso zzso while male mouse plasma did not contain zzso The zzso protein displayed an apparent zzso molecular mass of 70 zzso irrespective of zzso zzso The native molecular mass, estimated by zzso was about 140 zzso indicating that zzso is circulating as a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the intact protein and the internal sequences of four zzso zzso fragments demonstrated that this protein is not related to any known member of the zzso family nor to any protein in the sequence zzso The zzso and the sequence data thus establish this protein as a novel, zzso zzso but unrelated to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso
