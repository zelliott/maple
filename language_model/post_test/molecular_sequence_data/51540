We immortalized oral zzso by zzso with zzso human zzso type 16 zzso DNA and established two cell lines, human oral zzso zzso and zzso zzso These cell lines were zzso different from the normal counterpart, contained zzso DNA as integrated form and expressed numerous viral zzso However, these cells proliferated only in culture medium containing low calcium zzso zzso and are not zzso in nude zzso To test the hypothesis that tumors can be developed by sequential combined effect of human zzso and chemical zzso in the oral zzso these immortalized cell lines were chemically transformed by exposure to either zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso Such zzso proliferated in medium containing zzso calcium levels zzso zzso and demonstrated enhanced growth potential in nude mice, whereas primary human oral zzso treated with these chemical zzso failed to show any evidence of zzso zzso transformed cells contained zzso intact zzso sequences and transcribed significantly higher amount of zzso zzso messages and transforming growth zzso zzso compared with the immortalized oral zzso Like the zzso cell lines, the chemically transformed oral zzso contained lower levels of newly zzso zzso zzso proteins compared to normal cells, and expressed zzso zzso These results indicate that this in zzso system is useful for investigating the mechanisms of zzso oral zzso
