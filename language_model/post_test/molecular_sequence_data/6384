A zzso able to complement the zzso and zzso growth zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of the zzso strain zzso A zzso DNA region was zzso and showed two open reading frames zzso identified as the zzso and zzso zzso An zzso located upstream from the zzso gene and coding for a zzso zzso showed similarity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso both located upstream from the zzso gene in a complex zzso Two other unidentified zzso zzso and partial zzso coding for zzso zzso were also zzso delta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso obtained by zzso of suicide plasmids containing an zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cassette showed decreased zzso activities and were unable to grow on nitrate as the sole N zzso These zzso were restored by zzso with plasmids containing the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is expressed from a promoter located upstream from the zzso and that it is zzso regulated by the zzso gene zzso
