zzso of an internal DNA zzso into the zzso zzso which encodes one of several zzso proteins in zzso zzso produced a zzso defective in zzso body zzso While zzso zzso appears normal in the zzso it fails to zzso zzso the zzso number of viable zzso The A and C zzso signals, which are required for zzso are produced by the zzso But, while it produces zzso at levels as high as that of the wild type, the zzso produces much less zzso than normal, as measured either by zzso zzso or by the total amount of zzso protein detected with specific zzso zzso of three zzso reporters is altered in the zzso the level of expression of zzso is about zzso of normal, and zzso and zzso have zzso in their time zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso protein is below normal in the zzso It is proposed that zzso protein responds to zzso reception by increasing the expression of the zzso zzso This zzso increase constitutes a positive feedback in the wild zzso The zzso zzso unable to raise the level of zzso zzso carries out only those zzso steps for which a low level of zzso is zzso
