zzso virus zzso is an zzso zzso and zzso DNA virus commonly infecting human beings zzso zzso zzso in paired serum and liver zzso from three zzso individuals were separated by gel zzso and characterized zzso zzso zzso in zzso migrated in sizes ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in liver zzso however, migrated at zzso to zzso zzso as well as at zzso to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso in the liver were found to be circular and of the full zzso length of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso to zzso zzso from either serum or liver zzso were sensitive to zzso zzso but resistant to restriction zzso and therefore, they were zzso By contrast, zzso zzso in liver zzso that migrated at zzso to zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso They migrated at zzso to zzso zzso after zzso with zzso which suggests that they represent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso When zzso zzso were subjected to zzso primer extension and then amplified by zzso with internal zzso those in serum were found to be zzso zzso while those in liver zzso were found to be a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso replicates in the liver via a circular zzso zzso
