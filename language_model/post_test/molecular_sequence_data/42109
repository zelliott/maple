The zzso binding site to the ETA zzso was investigated by substitution of each zzso acid sequence located in the second zzso zzso region of the ETA zzso with the zzso sequences of the beta zzso zzso A zzso acid sequence zzso in the zzso region was implicated as the most important element required for zzso zzso In addition, both the third and the fourth zzso regions zzso and zzso including the zzso zzso regions, were found to play an important role in zzso zzso As for the biological significance of the zzso regions of the ETA zzso we have found that the zzso zzso acid zzso located in close proximity to the seventh zzso region and the zzso zzso acid zzso in the third zzso loop are important for the binding of zzso zzso the zzso third loop and zzso zzso seem to contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the zzso binding site located in the zzso zzso The same lines of experiment showed that the ETA zzso requires zzso 13 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso tail and 10 zzso acid zzso in the zzso region of the third zzso loop to induce an zzso increase in zzso Both regions are possibly involved in the interaction with zzso
