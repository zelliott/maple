zzso is a zzso zzso auxiliary protein that zzso to the nuclear region of zzso zzso is also present in zzso and it is directed into the assembling virus when zzso with zzso Each of these two zzso activities may be important for zzso function, and we recently identified regions of zzso that are critical for zzso zzso In this study we analyzed the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells showed that zzso zzso localized exclusively to the nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso domain that were designed to disrupt a predicted zzso structure resulted in zzso zzso while conservative zzso showed a zzso zzso A region in the central portion of the protein also has the potential for zzso structure, and zzso of two zzso zzso acids in this domain zzso zzso impaired zzso while substitution of a third zzso did zzso In contrast, neither the zzso zzso and zzso at positions zzso nor the zzso basic zzso zzso zzso were necessary for nuclear zzso In addition, zzso insertions within and between the two putative zzso disrupted zzso but zzso in the zzso region did zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso function depends on the two putative zzso zzso but is independent of the zzso zzso motif and of specific zzso basic zzso
