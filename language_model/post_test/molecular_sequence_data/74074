Although their zzso acid sequences and structure closely resemble DNA zzso zzso proteins were recently shown by zzso and colleagues to function as zzso zzso transferring a zzso group to the zzso position of zzso in zzso We observe that human zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso extracted from wild type zzso zzso was zzso to a lower degree, but in the case of zzso there was no difference in the zzso of zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso confirms it to be a target of zzso Using site directed zzso we show here that the zzso has a DNA zzso zzso because similar zzso from motifs IV, zzso and VIII are involved in zzso as identified in DNA zzso In addition, exchange of zzso which is located in a zzso motif zzso among zzso zzso strongly reduced the zzso activity of zzso zzso represents the first example of an zzso zzso using a DNA zzso type of zzso
