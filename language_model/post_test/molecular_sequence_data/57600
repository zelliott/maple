The zzso coli outer membrane protein zzso functions as a zzso channel and serves as the zzso for zzso K and a number of zzso zzso including zzso zzso To identify those segments of the zzso protein that are important for its zzso zzso function, we devised a selection and screening procedure which allowed us to isolate zzso strains zzso normal amounts of zzso Three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were employed for the selection of zzso derivatives of a strain expressing a zzso zzso fusion, and 28 zzso zzso with impaired zzso zzso function were zzso Regardless of the zzso zzso used for the initial zzso selection, zzso against a set of six different zzso zzso invariably zzso With one exception, these zzso zzso proteins could still serve as a zzso K zzso DNA sequence analysis of 10 zzso zzso genes revealed the presence of four distinct zzso zzso two point zzso an zzso zzso and a zzso tandem zzso In three zzso zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso zzso and in four others, zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso The deletion zzso one zzso removed six zzso acids zzso 239 to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso chain, and the DNA zzso zzso two zzso resulted in the addition of nine extra zzso acids zzso 229 to zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso protein and the other zzso zzso proteins the zzso protein was zzso by zzso when intact cells were treated with this zzso The zzso proteins zzso by the four zzso zzso still functioned in zzso zzso in zzso demonstrating that their zzso channel activity was not affected by the zzso that caused the loss of their zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso that zzso resistance against the zzso zzso are clustered in a small region near the zzso zzso of zzso Our results are discussed in terms of a model for the zzso organization of the zzso end of the zzso protein within the outer zzso
