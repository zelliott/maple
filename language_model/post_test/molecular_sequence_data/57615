The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene as the zzso An zzso reading frame of zzso zzso acids was identified within a DNA segment of zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso identical with the zzso of zzso zzso and exhibited zzso regions characteristic of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was aligned with available zzso from other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with representative sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso trees were constructed from both the zzso acid and the zzso sequence zzso In accordance with the sequence similarities, zzso and bacterial sequences did not segregate on a zzso On the basis of sequence signatures, the zzso trees could be subdivided into two zzso One zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso but also that of the zzso + C zzso zzso zzso zzso (all of which are regulated by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the other embraced the zzso of the three zzso as well as that of the zzso + C zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of which are regulated by zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and the zzso lineages shared a direct common zzso with that of zzso zzso and the zzso and were unrelated to their zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The possibility is presented that the zzso gene arose among the zzso and was then zzso transferred from some early zzso to a zzso zzso However, the relationship of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso bacteria remains zzso
