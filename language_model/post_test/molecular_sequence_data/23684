The zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso unit (the zzso zzso whose products share extensive zzso with their zzso counterparts in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso bacterial zzso This gene cluster is essential for addition of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso as demonstrated by zzso mass zzso of zzso A from both zzso and zzso zzso As in zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso A contributes to in zzso resistance of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso expression in zzso zzso is zzso by both the zzso and zzso zzso regulatory systems, it appears to be zzso in zzso zzso with the response regulator zzso interacting directly with the zzso zzso promoter zzso This result reveals that the ubiquitous zzso regulatory system controls different zzso in distinct bacterial zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso zzso has no effect on bacterial zzso in the zzso again in contrast to the situation in zzso zzso The marked differences in zzso zzso regulation in these two zzso close bacterial species may be related to their dissimilar zzso
