zzso 1 zzso encodes a zzso domain protein with no zzso to known zzso channels, zzso or zzso zzso is necessary for the formation of zzso and zzso calcium zzso zzso within the inner ear of zzso and zzso fish that are required for the detection of linear acceleration and zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso define a new gene family with zzso to the zzso zzso of Unknown zzso zzso genes zzso zzso 

zzso comparison of the predicted primary sequences and predicted secondary structures of 62 zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso has established that the genes zzso these proteins constitute a single family that we renamed the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Signature features of zzso proteins are three zzso zzso that are highly zzso between zzso zzso and zzso and a highly constrained predicted loop zzso 

Our studies suggest a refined zzso model for zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso and highlight zzso zzso zzso that will aid in the zzso examination of zzso family zzso The high degree of sequence and structural similarity of the zzso proteins may suggest a zzso role in the zzso trafficking of calcium and the formation of zzso
