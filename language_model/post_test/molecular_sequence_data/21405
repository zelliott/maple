The zzso fungus zzso zzso has been important in traditional Chinese medicine but has yet to be commercially zzso One bottleneck is the very low frequency of zzso formation from artificially infected zzso zzso The mating system of zzso is the determining factor for sexual zzso but zzso genes of zzso zzso have not been previously zzso In this study, the putative zzso gene zzso within the zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso and was determined to consist of zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso genes within the zzso zzso however, were not zzso The zzso gene contained the zzso zzso group zzso box, and zzso zzso sequences were subsequently zzso Although no putative open reading frames of the zzso zzso were detected within the zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso a putative DNA zzso gene (which is present next to both zzso in some zzso zzso was found zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso The intervening distance between zzso and the DNA zzso gene in zzso zzso is larger than that in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso showed low sequence similarities with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and the DNA zzso zzso In the zzso tree, different zzso zzso of zzso zzso clustered together with high zzso zzso As a zzso zzso zzso was detected in all examined zzso zzso zzso including tissue cultures and zzso zzso This report zzso for the first time, a zzso gene of zzso zzso
