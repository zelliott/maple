The zzso protein of the main terminal branch of the general zzso zzso from zzso zzso the outer membrane zzso zzso protects the zzso zzso zzso from degradation and promotes its correct zzso to the outer zzso To determine whether these are zzso functions, or whether resistance to zzso results simply from correct zzso of zzso we replaced the zzso signal zzso of zzso by the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso retained its ability to protect zzso but not its ability to zzso zzso to the outer membrane and to function in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso presumably again by causing zzso of zzso A hybrid protein zzso the mature part of zzso fused to the zzso of full-length zzso protein zzso had similar properties to the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was shown to associate with zzso by zzso zzso The zzso hybrid was rendered completely functional zzso it restored zzso zzso in a zzso zzso by replacing its signal zzso with a zzso signal zzso However, this zzso hybrid protein was only functional if it also carried a zzso sorting signal that targeted it to the outer zzso Thus, the two functions of zzso are separate and fully zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso was shown to be the factor that causes high-level induction of the zzso shock zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can substitute for zzso and zzso can protect the zzso zzso from zzso in zzso coli, indicating the possible existence of a family of zzso zzso zzso
