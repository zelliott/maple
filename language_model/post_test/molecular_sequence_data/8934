A protein named zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso a gut zzso of the zzso zzso It showed not only a high sequence similarity to zzso proteins zzso proteins from starved zzso but also zzso zzso zzso A comparative zzso analysis was performed to gain more insights into its zzso The zzso profile of the zzso gene indicated that it was evolved from a low zzso zzso Its stop zzso usage was also different from the general pattern of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso proteins showed strong correlation with the zzso of host zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified in some zzso related zzso suggesting that the zzso genes had incorporated into the zzso before the divergence of zzso from other zzso The zzso gene had evolved new function but still retained the typical zzso zzso
