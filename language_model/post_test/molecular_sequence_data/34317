zzso zzso resulting in zzso of complement zzso and zzso genes are common in healthy European populations and have shown association with a number of diseases, most notably the zzso disease, systemic lupus zzso The most frequent cause of a C4 zzso zzso following that of C4 gene copy number variation zzso is a zzso zzso arising from a 2 zzso CT zzso into zzso zzso of zzso zzso Previous attempts to accurately zzso this zzso have not been amenable to zzso zzso and have been zzso by failure to account for zzso at this zzso as well as by inability to distinguish between zzso We have developed a novel, zzso zzso zzso to detect the presence and copy number of this zzso We have zzso healthy zzso from the United Kingdom zzso and zzso Overall, zzso zzso individuals from the UK cohort and zzso zzso individuals from the Spanish cohort zzso the CT zzso in a zzso zzso A single Spanish individual possessed a zzso CT zzso There is weak correlation between the C4 CT zzso and zzso zzso zzso Therefore it is important to note that, as with C4 gene zzso zzso due to this zzso will be missed by current zzso zzso association zzso
