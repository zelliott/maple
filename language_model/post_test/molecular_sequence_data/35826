The processing of the human zzso virus zzso gag and zzso precursor proteins by the zzso zzso is an essential step in maturation of infectious virus zzso Like most zzso zzso the zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family and can be inhibited by specific zzso zzso synthetic peptides known to be zzso of human zzso were tested for zzso of zzso replication in tissue zzso One of them, a synthetic zzso zzso zzso which has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso totally blocked infection with different zzso including the zzso zzso prototype, the highly zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in primary blood zzso zzso and in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso for at least 3 zzso It also significantly reduced virus replication in chronically infected zzso cells, without any effect on cell zzso zzso zzso revealed that the inhibitor blocked processing of zzso precursors zzso gag and zzso gag into a mature form of gag zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso when added before infection, efficiently inhibited formation of zzso DNA zzso and successfully suppressed synthesis of zzso zzso These results imply that the zzso zzso inhibitor not only inhibited virus maturation in the late phase of the zzso replication cycle, but also zzso in the early phase, before the zzso was zzso This mechanism of zzso activity provides new possibilities and strategies for AIDS zzso
