The zzso assembly of zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The measured molecular mass of the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso assembly of zzso alpha zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso readily into zzso zzso in solution and under controlled zzso zzso in the gas zzso This is in strong support of an zzso architecture consistent with the recently published zzso zzso In zzso the alpha and beta zzso are capable of zzso to zzso but not further to the zzso zzso
