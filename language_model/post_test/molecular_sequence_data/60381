zzso zzso zzso against lens zzso zzso are highly prevalent in patients with zzso but their origin and zzso significance are zzso We hypothesized that zzso raised after exposure to infectious microbes could zzso with lens zzso To test this hypothesis, we generated a zzso zzso to human zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso sequence in the zzso region of zzso was critical for mounting a zzso zzso Similar sequences were found in three microbial zzso Mice injected with a microbial zzso containing zzso zzso with complete zzso zzso zzso raised zzso which zzso with zzso and developed lens zzso cell zzso damage in zzso We also genetically engineered an zzso zzso zzso Mice zzso with the zzso zzso coli developed zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that exposure to microbes having zzso zzso to self zzso can trigger a zzso immune response that leads to zzso damage in zzso
