The presence or absence of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso in the general patient population was determined by zzso et zzso using zzso zzso for the zzso and normal sequences in the zzso chain reaction zzso delta zzso was identified by Riordan et zzso and it is a zzso deletion of the zzso zzso at position zzso The zzso zzso are an zzso North American population who have three different DNA marker zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA from both a zzso child and one parent from each of 10 zzso families was analyzed for the presence or absence of the deletion zzso delta zzso is associated with one of the three zzso zzso in the zzso population, and this is the most common zzso in a subset of the linkage family data of zzso et zzso The other two zzso zzso zzso are generally rate in Caucasian zzso Since these two zzso zzso do not carry the deletion zzso they must carry a different zzso zzso The results of the zzso analysis for the deletion zzso lend additional support to our previous conclusion that there were at least three original carriers of zzso zzso among the founders of the zzso population and that all copies of the same zzso zzso were identical by zzso One zzso zzso patient has both of the zzso which do not carry delta zzso Analysis of this zzso DNA should allow identification of two additional zzso zzso in this zzso
