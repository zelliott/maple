We report the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene zzso the 32 zzso protein of zzso II from zzso zzso Like its land plant zzso this green zzso protein consists of 353 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is composed of three zzso containing zzso 11 and 90 zzso and of two group I zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso Each of the zzso features an internal open reading frame zzso that potentially encodes a basic protein of more than 300 zzso The primary sequences of the putative zzso proteins are unrelated and none of them shares zzso elements with any of the proteins predicted from the group I zzso sequences published so zzso The first zzso zzso zzso is inserted at the same position as the fourth zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso the second zzso lies at a novel site downstream of this zzso On the basis of their zzso secondary structures, the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 can be assigned to zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso 1 is not typical of zzso zzso zzso its most unusual feature being the location of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that an zzso is located in this region of the group I zzso zzso
