zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso family, characterized by specificity for zzso zzso to zzso zzso only and by resistance to zzso by members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from high salt with a zzso inhibitor zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso The structure has been solved by molecular replacement with the structure of zzso and refined at zzso A to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso with good zzso The structure of the zzso zzso binding site of zzso zzso differs from that of zzso by the substitution of zzso at zzso 23 and 65 in zzso with zzso acid and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso The side chains of these zzso form a barrier across the binding pocket, effectively excluding zzso zzso with large side chains from the zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso explains the unique specificity of this zzso for zzso after zzso zzso and is a major component of its resistance to zzso by zzso
