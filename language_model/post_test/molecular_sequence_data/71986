Several zzso including members of the zzso family, zzso proteins that are zzso into the zzso zzso We have identified an abundant zzso zzso protein that is present in the zzso of zzso infected with zzso zzso 68 zzso also referred to as zzso but not in that of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and of internal peptides revealed that this protein is zzso by the zzso zzso open reading frame zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso protein starts at zzso 25 of the zzso ORF, consistent with the first 24 zzso functioning as a signal zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a single abundant approximately zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso by the zzso zzso Analysis of a partial zzso clone and subsequent analyses of products of rapid amplification of zzso ends coupled with zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrate that the zzso protein is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso initiating at zzso zzso and terminating at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The 3' end of the zzso transcript maps 9 zzso downstream of a consensus zzso zzso Thus, the predicted zzso zzso is a functional gene that encodes an abundant zzso protein which is a candidate for interacting with host cellular receptors or zzso
