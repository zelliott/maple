zzso zzso 1 zzso is an interesting target for potential zzso drugs, and its three-dimensional zzso structure is presently zzso The purpose of this work was to build a zzso model of zzso which could be used in drug design zzso The protein zzso structure was zzso zzso based on the known crystal structure of zzso and new zzso parameters for the zzso coordination complex were developed by means of zzso zzso quantum chemical zzso These parameters were both obtained and validated using the zzso structure as reference, and then they were used for the refinement of the zzso zzso The resulting zzso structure was satisfactory and stable at room temperature, as shown by the molecular dynamics simulations carried out over a zzso time zzso on the entire zzso A number of representative zzso in the active and inactive form, including the inactive zzso modeled in this work, were zzso The results illustrate the zzso zzso of the zzso loop of the inactive form of the zzso and suggest a way for selectively targeting the single zzso
