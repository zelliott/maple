zzso precursor proteins zzso in the nucleus depend on their targeting sequences for delivery to zzso There exist different routes to the zzso outer zzso but a common theme is the involvement of molecular zzso zzso zzso protein zzso delivers precursors via its zzso zzso which transfers precursors to the core zzso in the outer zzso In the present paper, we identify an zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso which shares common features with zzso and potentially provides an alternative route to the zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso possesses a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain capable of binding molecular zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons show sequence similarities between the zzso domain of zzso and those of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and protein was detected in all plant zzso and zzso at the zzso outer envelope was demonstrated by a combination of zzso and in zzso import zzso zzso zzso show that zzso interacts specifically with zzso zzso protein zzso via its zzso clamp zzso Furthermore, zzso selectively recognizes zzso precursors via their targeting zzso and a soluble form of zzso zzso zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso is a novel zzso zzso at the zzso outer zzso zzso zzso protein targeting to zzso
