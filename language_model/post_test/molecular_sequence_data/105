We previously reported on a novel compound zzso 1; zzso identified by zzso screening that zzso human zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso suggesting that it interacts with zzso and flexible zzso protein molecular zzso studies supported this zzso We have now studied zzso effects on zzso and rat zzso which are less sensitive than human to zzso by zzso zzso peptides due to differences in the zzso sequences contributing to the binding zzso We found that zzso was much less potent in zzso zzso of zzso and rat zzso Moreover, zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding to zzso zzso expressing a hybrid zzso zzso composed of human zzso and zzso zzso but not a hybrid zzso composed of zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso were consistent with the functional zzso In zzso studies of zzso administered zzso at a dose of zzso zzso demonstrated zzso effects in both zzso zzso carotid artery and zzso zzso injury models in mice with hybrid zzso zzso zzso these data support zzso specificity for zzso provide new insights into the zzso binding pocket, and establish zzso zzso effects in zzso
