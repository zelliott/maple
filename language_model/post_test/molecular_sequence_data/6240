zzso in the zzso zzso are detected with a high frequency in zzso skin zzso zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso and one third of the zzso zzso zzso carry zzso at the second position of zzso zzso 12 zzso to zzso whereas zzso in zzso zzso 12 occur less zzso Since the zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso are located opposite potential zzso zzso sites zzso it is likely that the zzso are induced by ultraviolet radiation present in zzso We studied the capacity of ultraviolet B zzso light to induce zzso changes in zzso zzso 11 and 12 in human skin zzso zzso induced mostly C to T and G to A transitions and C to A and G to T zzso The zzso change with the highest relative abundance was C to T in the middle position of zzso 11 followed by (in diminishing relative zzso C to A in the middle position of zzso 11, G to A and G to T in the middle position of zzso zzso The C to T and G to A transitions are compatible with zzso zzso as zzso zzso whereas the C to A and G to T zzso could be generated due to the formation of zzso which is the major zzso product of zzso The relative abundance of zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso 11 and 12 does not correlate with zzso observed in the DNA from zzso skin cancer, where the G to T zzso in the middle position of zzso 12 is zzso
