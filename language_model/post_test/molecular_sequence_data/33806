The zzso gene zzso codes for a zzso factor protein that binds to zzso DNA sequences and controls expression of genes during embryonic zzso Here we present the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso bound to an zzso DNA zzso zzso forms a zzso that binds to DNA with a zzso constant of zzso zzso The zzso complex has a zzso mass of 35 zzso consistent with two molecules of DNA bound at both ends of the zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso arm zzso 324 - zzso that binds in the DNA minor groove, and a zzso zzso zzso 362 - zzso that contacts the zzso zzso sequence in the major zzso The zzso zzso forms hydrogen bonds with the zzso base of zzso zzso paired with zzso zzso zzso groups of zzso form zzso contacts with the zzso zzso groups of zzso zzso and zzso responsible for recognition of zzso in the DNA zzso zzso makes similar zzso contacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all have decreased DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso make zzso contacts at the protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and lowers zzso activity by zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is critical for structurally recognizing zzso in the major groove, and that zzso zzso is required to activate zzso of target zzso
