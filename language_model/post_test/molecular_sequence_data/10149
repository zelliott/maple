Down syndrome is a major cause of mental zzso and zzso heart defects and is due to the presence of three copies of human zzso 21 in the affected zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the region zzso which is highly expressed in human fetal brain and adult zzso zzso features of the conceptual protein encourage us to propose involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso and/or signal zzso Higher expression of zzso in the brains of young rats compared to adults suggests a possible role for the gene in the development of the central nervous zzso We have determined the zzso organization of zzso and identified three additional alternative first zzso by zzso and zzso library zzso zzso spans nearly 45 zzso of zzso DNA and comprises seven zzso four of which zzso zzso are alternative first zzso All the zzso are flanked by zzso junctions that conform to the consensus zzso zzso We have studied the expression patterns of the alternative first zzso zzso 2 was detected in fetal brain and liver by zzso Both zzso 1 and 4 were zzso expressed in fetal brain, zzso liver, and kidney and in all adult zzso tested by Northern analysis with two notable zzso zzso 1 was not detected in adult kidney and zzso 4 was not found in adult zzso The high level of expression of zzso 1 in fetal brain suggests that this alternative form of zzso has an important role in brain zzso This information should help us to understand the possible relationship of zzso with Down syndrome and aid in the development of animal zzso
