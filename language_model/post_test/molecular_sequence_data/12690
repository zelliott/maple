zzso zzso protein zzso is a 60 zzso zzso with an zzso acid sequence identical to that of the zzso region of zzso a large zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso Both zzso and zzso were identified by zzso in bovine brain extracts prepared only minutes after zzso Human zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso isolated from human brain by affinity zzso digest zzso and give rise to a zzso with zzso mobility identical to zzso zzso analysis, zzso mapping and zzso zzso acid sequencing indicate that the zzso generated by zzso with human brain zzso is identical to zzso We suggest that zzso is a naturally occurring zzso degradation zzso
