A novel method is described for the rapid concentration of particular zzso and their mapping to specific regions of a zzso The strategy for zzso zzso is based on the zzso of an entire library of zzso to a large zzso of zzso DNA that is zzso bound to latex zzso The zzso zzso are zzso amplified by zzso and cloned into a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso DNA are zzso with subsequent sequence zzso zzso DNA fragments prepared from a zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso which maps to zzso 5 of the small zzso plant zzso zzso zzso were used to prepare a model system and were zzso bound to latex zzso zzso that zzso to zzso were concentrated by zzso to the immobilized zzso The zzso zzso were recovered and amplified by zzso The zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso in length was enriched about zzso The partial sequences of the zzso provided information about genes that are located on the zzso region of the At zzso The zzso scanning strategy provides an efficient method for the mapping of expressed genes which could be used as expressed sequence tags zzso within a zzso
