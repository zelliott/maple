We determined zzso zzso gene sequences of zzso strains infecting the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from Korean coastal waters and compared those data with previously reported sequences of zzso from cultures, infected cells concentrated from field samples, and environmental zzso zzso gene sequences obtained from a variety of marine zzso Further, we used these data to examine genetic diversity in zzso strains relative to geographic origin, host zzso site of infection, and host zzso In our analyses of known zzso zzso the 13 available zzso sequences clustered together within the zzso as three groups forming a zzso group with high zzso support zzso likelihood, zzso zzso or a zzso probability zzso of zzso When the zzso sequences were analyzed along with environmental sequences associated with Marine zzso Group II, nine zzso formed a zzso group with high zzso support zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso known to be from zzso zzso infecting zzso hosts were distributed in seven of those zzso Despite differences in host species and geographic origin zzso United States, and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso grouped together by all of our tree construction methods, even after adding the environmental zzso By contrast, strains within Groups I and III divided into several lineages following inclusion of environmental zzso While zzso strains within Group II mostly developed within the host zzso strains in Groups I and III formed infections inside the host nucleus, a trait that appeared across several of the zzso Host specificity varied from moderately to extremely zzso within groups, including Group zzso Taken together, our results imply that genetic diversity in zzso strains does not always reflect zzso biology or zzso
