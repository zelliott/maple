zzso zzso a type species for the grass family zzso is an important cool season grass that accumulates zzso as a zzso zzso We studied zzso contents and expression of candidate zzso metabolism genes during cold zzso in three varieties of zzso zzso adapted to different zzso Northern Norway, Denmark, and the zzso zzso content increased significantly during cold zzso and varieties showed significant differences in the level of zzso zzso zzso sequences of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cold zzso protein zzso genes were identified and zzso In agreement with a function in zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso gene was induced during cold zzso and zzso zzso in all three zzso zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso and zzso genes was also induced by cold zzso however, zzso of these two genes was zzso higher in the variety from Norway compared to the other two zzso The results presented here suggest that zzso is involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso have previously been suggested to be involved in zzso zzso and freezing zzso and induced expression of zzso during zzso zzso could also suggest a role in zzso zzso However, based on the different zzso zzso rates among varieties and similar expression of zzso and zzso we suggest that zzso is more likely to be involved in zzso freezing zzso zzso by regulating the cell zzso potential through zzso zzso
