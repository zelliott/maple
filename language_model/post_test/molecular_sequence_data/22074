zzso zzso zzso from the zzso family catalyze the zzso step in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a point zzso in the zzso zzso was previously described to show zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso and lack of soluble zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and show that this zzso leads to a more drastic zzso of plant development and zzso of cell zzso Similar to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso has reduced zzso content, with stem zzso essentially made of zzso units and trace amounts of zzso and zzso zzso However, its roots display an zzso zzso and a substantial proportion of zzso and zzso units, suggesting the occurrence of an alternative zzso zzso mechanism active mainly in the zzso Relative to the control, zzso zzso produce very low amounts of zzso zzso but accumulate zzso zzso zzso cell growth seems correlated with zzso in the abundance of cell wall zzso in particular decrease in zzso zzso and profound modifications in gene expression and zzso reminiscent of a stress zzso zzso thus constitutes a critical bottleneck in the zzso zzso and in the synthesis of compounds controlling plant zzso zzso zzso lines show a zzso of zzso defects and changes in zzso content zzso zzso and structure zzso frequency of zzso zzso but content in zzso zzso zzso is similar to the zzso The purple zzso of their leaves is correlated to the zzso of zzso zzso
