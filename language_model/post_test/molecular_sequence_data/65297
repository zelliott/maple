Two zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from clinical specimens of the common zzso zzso zzso during an zzso in the Czech Republic in 2001, were subjected to a zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence similarities, both zzso were allocated to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Both strains reacted equally with zzso zzso zzso and were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso F1 and zzso zzso profiling revealed a high degree of zzso activity and zzso capabilities not observed in other zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Whereas zzso was identical to zzso of zzso from certain zzso marine zzso zzso clustered with zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso gene downstream region identified strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso Both strains zzso five to six copies of the zzso element zzso displaying a unique zzso pattern as determined by Southern zzso In comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso with 296 different zzso the two zzso grouped together, but formed a separate cluster within the zzso zzso zzso sequence typing zzso analysis using nine different zzso also placed the two zzso separately from other zzso In the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was generated with the zzso zzso zzso revealing that the zzso element had integrated between a putative membrane protein and zzso zzso a zzso an integration site not observed in other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be clearly distinguished from all known zzso species and their zzso by means of both their zzso and molecular properties, and therefore represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
