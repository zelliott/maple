The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was derived by prolonged laboratory passage from a highly virulent ancestral strain isolated in zzso We studied the genetic variations of zzso that render it zzso via comparative analysis against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso strain was determined and used to compare with, and then rectify and zzso the zzso sequence of strain zzso Aside from their highly similar zzso structure and gene order, a total of 33 zzso 53 deletions and 301 zzso variations zzso were detected throughout the zzso of zzso directly affecting 101 zzso either in their zzso upstream region or within their coding zzso Among them, the majority of the 44 functional genes are involved in signal zzso stress response, zzso transport and nitrogen zzso Comparative zzso analysis based on quantitative liquid zzso zzso data revealed that among 1 zzso selected pairs of zzso 174 genes in the zzso strain were zzso with enrichment mainly in classes of energy production and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso genes in strain zzso were zzso with the majority enriched in the categories of protein translation and DNA zzso The combination of zzso and zzso approaches illustrated that altered expression or zzso in critical zzso such as those zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso profile of zzso or outer membrane proteins are likely to account for the zzso zzso in strain zzso
