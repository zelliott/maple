zzso is the external domain of zzso zzso a conservative zzso protein of the avian influenza A zzso Previous research had shown that the vaccine of the formation particle of zzso and zzso B virus core zzso zzso can fully protect mice against a lethal H5N1 zzso avian influenza virus zzso zzso As an effective approach against zzso tissue infectious agent, zzso vaccination requires effective and safe zzso Here we have first fused two zzso zzso to the N terminal and the major zzso region zzso of the zzso protein simultaneously to create a fusion zzso named as zzso and then inserted B zzso of zzso coli heat zzso zzso zzso into the N terminal of zzso to construct the second fusion zzso named as zzso These two fusion genes can be efficiently expressed in zzso coli cell and the yield zzso can zzso into zzso particles zzso The mice zzso with two types of the zzso particles by zzso dropping and oral routes revealed that zzso can significantly enhance the zzso immune responses of mice to zzso zzso particle form zzso
