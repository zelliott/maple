zzso zzso can be used to sequence short regions of zzso In this report, I examine the extent to which this method can be used to sequence zzso DNA, using simulation experiments performed on known human zzso DNA zzso and show that segments of sequence of up to zzso length may be zzso zzso using zzso mixed zzso Conventional sequencing or zzso to specific, longer zzso can extend this limit in a mixed strategy that can sequence zzso DNA sequences with zzso conventional sequencing reactions and zzso to a mixed zzso probe zzso
