The soluble zzso zzso zzso of inner zzso complex of the zzso zzso space mediates the import of the carrier proteins and is a component of the zzso import zzso The mechanism by which the zzso complex assembles and binds the carriers is not well zzso but previous studies have proposed that the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso motif coordinate zinc and potentially generate a zzso structure that binds to the zzso zzso of the carrier zzso Here we have zzso the native and zzso zzso complex, and show that both complexes resemble each other and consist of three zzso and three zzso zzso from zzso coupled zzso zzso studies failed to detect zinc in the zzso zzso Instead, the zzso zzso seemingly formed zzso zzso The zzso complex bound specifically to the zzso zzso of the zzso carrier, but had no affinity for zzso an inner membrane protein that is inserted via the zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex thus may prevent zzso of the unfolded carrier proteins in the zzso zzso zzso
