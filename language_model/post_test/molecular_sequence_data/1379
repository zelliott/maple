zzso in Sir zzso 1 zzso suppress defects in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso domain, suggesting that it functions by targeting zzso zzso and zzso proteins for degradation by a zzso zzso zzso with this idea, zzso zzso and zzso proteins are unstable in zzso cells but are stabilized in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso is required for its function in zzso zzso zzso has a zzso of about 21 zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not affect the stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Loss of zzso also did not affect the stability of zzso a highly unstable protein in zzso These results support the idea that zzso controls the turnover of a specific class of unstable nuclear zzso zzso zzso the assembly of silent zzso at zzso and the silent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso can also affect zzso in the zzso indirectly by zzso limiting zzso zzso the stability of zzso zzso by deleting zzso had only subtle effects on zzso suggesting that silent zzso in zzso is robustly zzso against changes in zzso zzso zzso with the idea that zzso zzso as an accessory factor to regulate silent zzso including the silent zzso zzso zzso analysis defined a small but statistically significant role for zzso in zzso of several mating zzso zzso
