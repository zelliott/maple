A rapid diagnostic method employing a zzso chain reaction procedure zzso was used to identify zzso and zzso zzso zzso This procedure amplified a region of the zzso locus zzso from a crude DNA extract of zzso A synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso gene sequence was shown to specifically zzso only with zzso zzso coli zzso strains and zzso zzso Upon zzso amplification, a zzso pair zzso was generated in DNA extracted from feces zzso with zzso or zzso zzso but not in DNA from 70 normal stools lacking these organisms and could be readily detected by the zzso zzso For identifying zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso more sensitive than standard zzso tests and the zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate a novel methodology for zzso sensitive, and zzso diagnosis of zzso caused by these pathogens and underscores the utility of zzso in the diagnostic zzso
