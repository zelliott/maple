In an attempt to understand what zzso severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso coronavirus zzso from other members of the zzso we searched for elements that are unique to its proteins and not present in any other family zzso We identified an zzso of two zzso zzso forming the zzso zzso in the zzso spike protein zzso domain zzso which is not found in any other zzso This surprising finding raises an zzso zzso the zzso motif is a known zzso zzso while the zzso spike protein is known to be zzso Using an in zzso zzso we found that the zzso spike protein zzso is zzso and that this zzso is driven by the zzso zzso We also found that the zzso motif contributes toward the zzso of the entire spike zzso in that, zzso in the zzso motif decrease zzso of the full-length protein expressed in zzso zzso Using molecular zzso we show that the zzso spike protein zzso adopts a distinct and unique structure as opposed to all other zzso In this unique structure, the zzso zzso of the zzso motif are facing each other, enhancing zzso interactions by allowing for the close positioning of the zzso This unique orientation of the zzso zzso also zzso the zzso bundle during zzso molecular dynamics simulation in a hydrated zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the zzso motif can zzso other zzso forms beside a zzso Finally, according to recent studies, the stabilization of the zzso bundle is linked to a higher fusion activity of the spike zzso and the possible influence of the zzso motif on this feature is zzso
