zzso similarities between zzso virus zzso zzso and proteins belonging to the zzso zzso clearly indicate that zzso a zzso acid zzso expressed on the surface of the infected cells, is a novel viral protein that can be added to the expanding list of the zzso zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence contains one zzso domain at the zzso zzso followed by two tandem repeating units and a zzso region, suggestive of membrane zzso The results offer an opportunity for the further study of the probable evolutionary and possible functional relationship between zzso and other members of the zzso zzso Our zzso together with a recent finding that human zzso possibly encodes a protein similar to the zzso class I zzso zzso provides evidence supporting the fact that the viral capture of cellular zzso genes is more common than expected in zzso and other zzso and that usage of an zzso domain as recognition signals might be extended from higher animals to animal zzso
