A panel of 20 zzso zzso fragments zzso with the surface zzso zzso of human type 1 zzso virus zzso were examined for their ability to neutralize MN and zzso strains of the zzso zzso was determined as the ability of the zzso fragments to inhibit infection as measured in both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso One group of closely zzso zzso fragments was found to neutralize virus in both zzso with a 50% zzso zzso at approximately 1 zzso Another zzso neutralized in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso The other zzso fragments showed weak or no zzso zzso The results imply that zzso zzso or zzso of zzso molecules on the zzso surface is not an absolute requirement for zzso zzso Further, all of the zzso fragments were shown to be competitive with soluble zzso for binding to zzso and yet few neutralized the virus zzso zzso that the mechanism of zzso in this case may not involve zzso zzso The observation of a preponderance of zzso zzso fragments with poor or no zzso ability could have implications for vaccine zzso
