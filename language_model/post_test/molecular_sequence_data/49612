zzso zzso transcribed two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso were zzso located in the growing leaves of zzso during cell wall zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso fusion gene activities in transgenic zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso activity was localized in the zzso and leaf zzso whereas zzso was confined to zzso cells and disappeared from the tip during the development of zzso zzso of the leaf showed that the zzso of zzso incorporated into cellulose corresponded to the combination of the zzso zzso patterns of zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso not only inhibited the incorporation of the zzso into zzso but also zzso the induction of both zzso zzso zzso of zzso by expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso sense zzso reduced leaf zzso zzso we came to the conclusion that zzso and zzso probably function to promote leaf growth in zzso by the zzso of zzso
