Two new species in the order zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from human clinical specimens in the USA, are described and zzso The former species is similar to zzso zzso from which it can be differentiated by its ability to grow at zzso and produce zzso zzso zzso zzso is also able to grow and zzso at zzso like zzso zzso the nearest zzso species in this study, however, the former has narrow zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of the sequences of the ITS and the zzso regions of the zzso genes confirmed the novelty of these zzso The in zzso zzso zzso of the new species showed that zzso B was active against all zzso and zzso and zzso showed low zzso
