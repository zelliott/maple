zzso human zzso virus type zzso resistance to the fusion inhibitor zzso zzso is primarily associated with zzso within the highly zzso first zzso repeat zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso however, are remarkably zzso and the envelope genetic background could have an important impact on optimal expression of zzso zzso We have examined the genetic evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso capacity in patients failing zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso obtained from six patients initiating zzso treatment as part of a salvage therapy, were studied using a zzso zzso zzso evaluating the entire zzso and the zzso zzso Regardless of major differences in the baseline zzso zzso viral populations with similar zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected under treatment in four of six zzso As expected, in all patients zzso viruses zzso one or more zzso zzso zzso 36, 38, and zzso Interestingly, in five patients the emergence of resistance zzso was not associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences in sequential samples from two patients showed that the zzso zzso had emerged in the context of zzso zzso that were different from those prevalent at zzso Thus, the envelope genetic context appears to play a critical role in the selection of zzso zzso and the expression of zzso resistance, thereby conditioning the evolution of zzso under fusion inhibitor selective zzso
