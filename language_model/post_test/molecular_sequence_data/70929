Chemical zzso and analysis of zzso fusion products by zzso with zzso zzso identifies an interaction between positions zzso of zzso beta zzso and zzso of zzso alpha zzso This has been supported by zzso of zzso with peptides zzso and zzso by binding of zzso to immobilized zzso and by the hindrance of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulatory region for the zzso activity of zzso zzso The opposite, zzso property of zzso beta has been assigned to its zzso zzso Subdivision of zzso zzso that has zzso effect, into overlapping peptides and zzso for alpha binding and binding competition revealed a tight physical contact at zzso This region, however, is zzso indicating binding a necessary but not sufficient quality for zzso A contact might exist to regions surrounding zzso and/or zzso at zzso alpha as indicated by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso data also confirm a zzso contact in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso show zzso interactions to play an important role in zzso activity zzso
