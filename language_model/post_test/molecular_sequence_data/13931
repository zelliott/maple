The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed by cells of alpha mating zzso On the basis of sequence similarities, zzso has been proposed to contain zzso zzso zzso zzso The low level of sequence similarity to zzso zzso of known structure made zzso modeling using standard zzso alignment zzso zzso We have therefore developed a secondary zzso method that allowed zzso modeling of zzso domain III, the domain most similar to zzso zzso The model was assessed and where necessary refined to accommodate information obtained by zzso and molecular genetic approaches, including the positions of a zzso bond, zzso sites, and zzso zzso The model successfully predicted surface exposure of zzso and zzso sites, as well as identifying zzso essential for binding zzso One side of the domain was predicted to be covered by zzso zzso Surface accessibility and volume packing analyses showed that the regions of the model that have greatest sequence zzso from the zzso consensus sequence are poorly structured in the zzso zzso Nonetheless, the utility of the model suggests that these alignment and testing techniques should be of general use for building and testing of models of proteins that share limited sequence similarity with known zzso
