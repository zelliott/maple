Several species of zzso have been shown to zzso the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso The various zzso alpha zzso are generated through alternative zzso of a single precursor zzso and through the use of alternative zzso zzso zzso We now report the existence of a zzso alpha zzso that uses a previously unidentified promoter and leading zzso zzso zzso zzso In both the canine and human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso is located zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso does not contribute an zzso zzso and thus its zzso encodes a truncated form of zzso zzso zzso of translation is predicted to begin at an zzso in zzso 2, as demonstrated both by in zzso translation and zzso cell expression zzso
