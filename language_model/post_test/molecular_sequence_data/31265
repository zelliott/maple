A family of novel potentially mobile DNA elements called zzso has recently been described zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hall, 1989, zzso zzso 3, zzso The zzso present in the plasmids zzso and zzso are unusual in that they include a zzso of the zzso gene which is located in one of the two zzso segments that make up these zzso In order to define the nature of the zzso in zzso we have zzso the zzso gene region located between the zzso and the zzso genes of zzso This region includes the first zzso bases of the zzso zzso segment present in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the sequence identity in zzso zzso 24 bases beyond the end of the zzso zzso This position zzso to the center of a zzso element, a remnant of which is located at the end of zzso This finding suggests that the zzso element may have been involved in the event which gave rise to the partial zzso
