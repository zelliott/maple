We analyzed extra zzso zzso of avian blood zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso the zzso zzso was completely zzso resulting zzso zzso in zzso This zzso contained the identical gene organization and contents to that of other avian blood zzso previously zzso three functional genes for zzso c zzso zzso I, III, and zzso b with following sets of zzso and scrambled 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was estimated to have the tandem repeated structure as well as previously found in avian zzso zzso Furthermore, we found partial gene sequences of zzso DNA, another extra zzso zzso from zzso zzso These sequences were estimated as partial zzso zzso C and zzso factor Tu A zzso This report is the first description of two extra zzso zzso of zzso zzso
