Although the zzso c zzso reaction product, compound zzso has been a long-standing subject of research, only recently has its broad zzso signal been proven to arise from a radical at zzso Despite this advance, no model has zzso explained the anomalous breadth and shape of this zzso which is conventionally interpreted as having zzso symmetry with g parallel approximately zzso zzso g perpendicular approximately zzso contrary to expectations for a zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, these g values exhibit marked temperature and preparation zzso as well as an unexplained zzso zzso extending from the g zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of compound zzso at 35 zzso as well as those of compound zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso significantly alters the line shape of the zzso free zzso We present a comprehensive model that successfully accounts for the properties of this unusual protein free zzso We show that the zzso zzso of both proteins can be described in terms of a weak exchange interaction between the S zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a radical on zzso a distribution in protein zzso leads to a distribution in the zzso which ranges from zzso to zzso We also zzso for the first time, explicit expressions for zzso and zzso zzso of such zzso systems and show that the model accounts for all the data that previously led to apparent anomalies in the interpretation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we have used the CW zzso and zzso zzso methodology to address reports that the broad signal from the zzso zzso radical is accompanied by a minority zzso zzso narrow signal that is associated with a radical site other than zzso We find no evidence for such a species and discuss the earlier reports in light of our zzso
