The aim of the present study was to characterize zzso zzso of zzso originating from a field of sugar beet where disease patches caused by zzso zzso were zzso Use of both molecular and zzso characteristics gave consistent identification of the zzso zzso of zzso and volatile zzso zzso and induced systemic resistance in plant host were investigated using in zzso and in zzso tests in both zzso and natural zzso This functional approach revealed the zzso diversity as well as zzso potential of the different zzso Different zzso mechanisms were evident for different zzso The most zzso strain, zzso was identified as zzso zzso This is the first report of an efficient zzso strain of zzso being able to reduce the disease in different zzso The ability to produce zzso zzso or zzso around the zzso of the pathogen in zzso was not related to the disease reduction in zzso Additionally, the strains collected from the high disease areas in the field were better zzso The zzso activity was not characteristic of a species but that of a zzso
