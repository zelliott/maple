zzso of zzso zzso proteins has been associated characteristically with the formation of a zzso structure between two compatible zzso zzso zzso In the present study we demonstrate the association of the zzso zzso of zzso response zzso protein zzso with a zinc finger motif of zzso The association of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zinc finger is stabilized if the zzso zzso zzso is intact, zzso that the preferred interactive structure of zzso juxtaposes the zzso zinc finger motif of this protein with the zzso zzso zzso of this same zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the association of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zinc finger in zzso blocks the association of the zzso zzso protein with zzso Similarly, zzso of full-length zzso or a truncated version of this protein corresponding to the zzso 74 zzso acids that make up the zzso and zzso zzso can block the zzso zzso stimulation by zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zinc finger motif stimulates DNA binding of this zzso and zzso interactions with zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the structural zzso of zzso is critical for DNA binding and zzso interactions and, further, that zzso zzso can mediate zzso interactions with structural motifs other than zzso zzso
