Two zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from two separate salt mines in zzso zzso zzso These zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and moderately zzso The two strains required 6-10 % zzso zzso zzso for zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso The polar zzso profiles of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were composed predominantly of zzso zzso zzso three unknown polar lipids and one zzso Minor amounts of other lipids were also zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : zzso zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso : zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons showed that the two zzso formed a distinct zzso with the zzso zzso (in the zzso zzso and were related to the species zzso zzso with sequence similarities of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were related to each other zzso % sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso was 34 zzso On the basis of the zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be classified as members of a novel zzso and as two novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
