The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso carries a region containing several genes that zzso resistance to different zzso and this resistance region is in the same position as related resistance regions in a group of zzso zzso plasmids from various sources that includes zzso Four further additional segments are found in zzso relative to another zzso zzso zzso Using zzso or DNA sequencing to detect the presence or absence of each of these additional segments in the same position in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to include zzso However, in one case the additional segment was smaller in zzso lacking a zzso carrying a second resistance region in zzso The sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also examined and found to share the same or closely related additional zzso The structure of the additional material in zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and potential novel zzso were zzso These additional segments define an zzso lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso which we designated type 2 to distinguish it from type 1 zzso zzso zzso A segment from the zzso coli zzso and an adjacent copy of zzso in zzso was defined by comparison to zzso and zzso which lack zzso zzso also lacks zzso This structure is present in the same position in zzso and type 1 zzso but in the opposite orientation, and appears to have been incorporated via zzso zzso The zzso developed provide a simple means of distinguishing type 1 and type 2 zzso plasmids based on the presence or absence of variable zzso
