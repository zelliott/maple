zzso patients, zzso and the elderly suffer from impaired wound zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously been found to accelerate zzso wound repair in rats, aged mice, and zzso diabetic zzso It also promotes zzso repair in both normal rats and zzso Because zzso are important in wound repair, we hypothesized that zzso may regulate zzso zzso zzso expression in cells that are involved in wound zzso Analysis by zzso of whole excised mouse zzso wounds on days 1, 2, and 3 after wounding showed that zzso increased several zzso including zzso and -9 expression by zzso over control on day 2 after zzso We further analyzed the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso by cells normally present in the zzso Western zzso analysis of cultured zzso zzso cells, and zzso that were treated with increasing zzso of zzso showed increases in the levels of zzso zzso and -9 in a zzso zzso zzso also enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso by activated zzso The central zzso domain, zzso acids zzso had all of the activity for zzso zzso We conclude that part of the wound healing activity of zzso resides in its ability to increase zzso activity via its central zzso zzso Thus, zzso may play a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso during wound zzso
