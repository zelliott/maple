The rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso from zzso zzso zzso donor and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso When activity with other donors and zzso was tested, the initial zzso preparation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso suggesting contamination with wild type zzso zzso The products from reaction of zzso and zzso included zzso zzso and zzso suggesting the presence of both wild type zzso and its zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity within this preparation by zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso preparation was contaminated with wild type zzso Rice zzso zzso generated from a new construct designed to minimize zzso showed zzso activity without wild type zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso donors to zzso zzso The synthetic products from the reactions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso donors were confirmed to result from addition of a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso transferred zzso from zzso donor to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but little to zzso zzso of longer zzso occurred most readily on zzso with an equatorial zzso zzso of wild type contamination thereby allowed a clear assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
