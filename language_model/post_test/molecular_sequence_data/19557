The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso II zzso at DNA zzso on the transcribed strand is a serious challenge to accurate zzso zzso DNA repair zzso which is assumed to be initiated by the zzso of transcription, rapidly removes zzso on the transcribed strand of expressed genes and allows the resumption of zzso Although zzso bulky damage such as a zzso zzso zzso is known to block zzso zzso and to be repaired by zzso it is not clear whether zzso DNA zzso are repaired by zzso First, we examined whether zzso zzso by zzso is stalled at sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso on the transcribed zzso Our results indicate that zzso incorporated zzso opposite the zzso and then zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso factor zzso zzso enabled zzso to bypass zzso but not the other types of damage, while zzso initiation and zzso factor zzso did not bypass zzso These results suggest that zzso is important for preventing cellular death due to zzso DNA damage, assisting zzso to bypass zzso
