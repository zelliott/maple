zzso zzso to the proper cellular destination may be guided by various classes of sorting signals recognizable in the primary zzso zzso in some zzso but not others, may reveal sorting system components by comparison of the zzso profile of the class of sorting signal to that of various protein zzso 

We describe a short zzso zzso domain, sporadically distributed in bacteria, with several key characteristics of protein sorting zzso The domain includes a zzso motif zzso zzso This possible recognition or processing site is followed by a predicted zzso zzso and a cluster rich in basic zzso zzso We designate this domain zzso It tends to occur multiple times in a zzso if it occurs at all, with a median count of eight zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso proteins generally contain an zzso signal zzso and exhibit high diversity and little zzso to known zzso All bacteria with zzso have both an outer membrane and zzso zzso production zzso By a simple zzso for screening zzso profiles in the absence of zzso protein families, we discovered that a zzso of the membrane protein zzso zzso locus protein zzso occurs in a species when zzso zzso are zzso The zzso family contains zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso Most zzso proteins are zzso by zzso zzso preceded by large zzso zzso In the zzso most of these upstream regions share a DNA zzso a probable zzso site that contains a zzso binding zzso The zzso profile for this DNA sequence exactly matches that of three zzso a zzso response regulator zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso 

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso and zzso form a protein export sorting system, analogous to the zzso system of zzso bacteria, and correlated to zzso zzso It occurs zzso in bacteria from zzso soils, and zzso The novel method that led to these findings, partial zzso zzso requires neither global sequence zzso nor arbitrary similarity zzso and appears to be a zzso effective alternative to other profiling zzso
