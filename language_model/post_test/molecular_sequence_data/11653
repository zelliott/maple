We present a zzso approach for identifying and aligning consensus secondary structure within a set of functionally related zzso sequences aligned by zzso The method relies on zzso of secondary structure using a zzso of the dot zzso representation appropriate for consensus sequence data zzso An interactive computer program implementing such a zzso of consensus structure has been zzso The program allows for alignment editing, data and display filtering and various modes of base pair zzso including zzso The utility of this approach is demonstrated with four sample data sets derived from in zzso selection experiments and one data set zzso zzso zzso
