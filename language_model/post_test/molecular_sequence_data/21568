zzso zzso zzso zzso is a disorder characterized by abnormal development of zzso and zzso of zzso origin caused by zzso in the zzso zzso The bovine zzso gene encodes the zzso A, a membrane protein expressed in zzso hair zzso and sweat zzso which is involved in the interactions between cell and cell and/or cell and zzso Four zzso causing zzso zzso in cattle have been described so zzso 

We identified a new single zzso zzso zzso at the 9th base of zzso 8 in the zzso gene in two calves of zzso zzso cattle breed affected by zzso zzso This zzso is located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso As a consequence, the zzso machinery is no longer able to recognize the sequence as zzso and causes zzso zzso The zzso determines the deletion of the entire zzso (131 zzso in the zzso processing, causing a severe zzso of the protein structure and thus the zzso 

We identified a zzso never described before, that changes the regulation of alternative zzso in the zzso gene and causes zzso zzso in zzso The analysis of the zzso allows the identification of carriers that can transmit the disease to the zzso This zzso can thus be exploited for a rational and efficient selection of unequivocally healthy cows for zzso
