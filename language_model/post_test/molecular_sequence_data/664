zzso zzso peptides are an zzso ancient and essential element of innate immunity in higher zzso The precise mechanism by which these peptides exert their zzso activity on bacteria is not well zzso zzso based on the zzso of human zzso were designed and evaluated to study the role of charge in defining the zzso activity and selectivity of these peptides against zzso zzso zzso derivatives of these peptides were prepared in order to further evaluate how positively charged primary zzso contribute to potency in these small zzso zzso These peptides enabled us to explore the relationship between net charge, charge distribution and zzso zzso While the results indicate that net charge is a major factor in zzso activity in these zzso the actual relationship between charge and potency appears to be more zzso
