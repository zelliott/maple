The zzso binding zzso receptors zzso play a key role in zzso against pathogens by linking zzso and zzso immune zzso zzso expression and/or function of zzso may result in the development of pathological zzso Considering the functions of zzso they are potential target molecules for drug design to aim at developing novel zzso and zzso zzso Previous data mostly obtained by X-ray analysis of zzso complexes indicate the profound role of the zzso domain in binding to various zzso Our aim was to zzso linear zzso which are able to bind and also to zzso the function of the low affinity zzso like zzso and zzso To this end a set of overlapping zzso was prepared corresponding to the zzso sequence of zzso zzso domain and tested for binding to human zzso soluble zzso Based on these results, a second group of peptides was zzso and their binding properties to zzso soluble zzso as well as to zzso expressed on the cell surface, was zzso Here we report that zzso representing the zzso sequence of zzso is implicated in the binding to zzso In addition we found that peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso or zzso when presented in a zzso form zzso to zzso chain zzso in zzso oriented copies induced the release of zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso cell zzso These findings indicate that these zzso peptides are able to cluster the zzso zzso and mediate zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso can also be considered as a lead for further functional zzso
