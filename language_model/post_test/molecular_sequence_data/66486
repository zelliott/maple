zzso transport to the zzso zzso involves passage through the zzso compartment zzso but little is known about how zzso proteins exit the zzso We show that this last step is inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso causing an zzso of soluble and membrane cargo and the plant zzso sorting zzso zzso in the zzso zzso transport proceeds normally from the zzso zzso to the zzso and the zzso although export from the zzso appears to be compromised, affecting both zzso membrane flow to the zzso and the recycling route of zzso to the zzso However, zzso transport of soluble and membrane cargo toward the plasma membrane is not affected, but a soluble zzso zzso is partially zzso to the culture zzso We also observe zzso of individual zzso bodies that move together and possibly fuse with each other, forming enlarged zzso We conclude that zzso zzso specifically zzso export from the zzso without affecting the zzso complex or compromising the zzso branch of the zzso zzso The results provide a functional in zzso zzso that confirms zzso involvement in zzso sorting and indicates that excess of this zzso in the zzso can be zzso for further transport from this zzso
