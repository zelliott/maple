A DNA zzso representing a zzso active zzso of zzso type was isolated and characterized from rice zzso zzso zzso The zzso (named zzso includes the coding sequences for the zzso part of the zzso H domain and the zzso part of the zzso domain in the zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso indicated that this element was expressed in rice leaves and zzso suggesting that it is potentially active to transpose under normal growth zzso Using zzso zzso the copy number of zzso was estimated to be about 1600 copies per zzso rice zzso Five zzso copies of zzso were assigned to five distinct positions of four zzso by restriction zzso length zzso zzso mapping approach using an zzso rice zzso zzso population and its molecular linkage zzso
