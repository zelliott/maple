zzso of the zzso zzso gene in transgenic plants produces light zzso patterns when the plants are supplied with zzso We explored whether in in zzso pattern of light zzso truly reveals the pattern of zzso gene expression or whether it reflects other parameters such as the availability of the zzso zzso or the zzso distribution of zzso in which zzso was zzso The zzso distribution of zzso activity and the in zzso pattern of light were examined when the zzso gene was driven by different promoters and when zzso was was redirected from the zzso where it is normally targeted, to the zzso zzso It was found that the distribution of zzso activity closely correlated with the zzso pattern of zzso zzso However, the in zzso light pattern appeared to reflect not only zzso distribution of zzso activity, but also the pattern of zzso zzso
