The zzso chain reaction zzso method was used to detect mycoplasma contamination in a panel of 42 continuous cell zzso According to the zzso zzso zzso on zzso 29 cell lines were chronically infected and 13 cell lines were zzso zzso of outer and inner zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied which zzso to DNA sequences coding for zzso regions of the zzso zzso These zzso allow for the amplification of DNA regions found in at least 25 mycoplasma species (including the ones most commonly found in cell zzso but do not zzso with DNA from zzso zzso zzso cell lines showed distinctive bands in zzso zzso gels, both after the first round of amplification as well as after the second zzso all zzso cell lines were also zzso negative in the zzso zzso Thus, neither zzso nor zzso results zzso zzso that the proper zzso working conditions are scrupulously observed, the zzso amplification has several outstanding zzso high sensitivity, zzso zzso objectivity, speed, and zzso
