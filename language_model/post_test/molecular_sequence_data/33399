Nuclear zzso are intermediate filament proteins that define the shape and stability of zzso in zzso zzso In addition to this dominant structural role, recent studies have suggested that the zzso proteins also regulate fundamental aspects of nuclear zzso In order to understand different roles played by zzso zzso we used zzso interference to generate a series of zzso cell lines to study zzso zzso associated with depletion of zzso protein zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso approaches to monitor global changes in protein expression in cells with zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso Of approximately 2000 protein spots analyzed by two-dimensional zzso only 38 showed significantly altered expression in zzso zzso depleted zzso Of these, 4 protein spots were zzso and 34 were zzso zzso changes were seen to involve the general reduction in expression of zzso zzso consistent with altered functionality of the structural cellular zzso At the same time, zzso in expression of proteins involved in cellular metabolism correlated with altered patterns of zzso zzso In order to link these two features, we used zzso zzso to perform a focused analysis of expression of cell cycle regulatory zzso This confirmed a general reduction in expression of proteins regulating cell cycle progression and zzso in signaling pathways that regulate the zzso activity of zzso The zzso between signal zzso and the zzso emphasizes how structural and zzso networks are integrated in zzso cells to fine-tune zzso zzso
