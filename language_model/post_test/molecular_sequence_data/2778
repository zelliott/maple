Human zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso zzso zzso cell protein which zzso zzso between the zzso and the retinal zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso suggests that the zzso consists of four continuous zzso zzso which arose by several gene zzso some 600 to 800 million years zzso When injected into susceptible animal species, including zzso it zzso an experimental zzso zzso zzso a predominantly T zzso zzso disease of the zzso and zzso tract of the eye, and the zzso zzso In order to further refine specific sites in zzso responsible for its zzso we zzso 120 overlapping zzso corresponding to its entire zzso zzso acid zzso and tested each zzso for its ability to induce an zzso in Lewis zzso Five peptides with extensive zzso acid sequence zzso designated zzso zzso zzso greater than 730 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso when used at a 50 zzso zzso zzso The most potent zzso for the induction of zzso was zzso zzso zzso acid positions 521 to zzso In dose response studies as little as zzso zzso was capable of inducing an inflammatory zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the mid portion of zzso zzso zzso and contains only eight zzso acids zzso was zzso under our experimental zzso Our study identifies multiple zzso sites in zzso and further defines the zzso acids necessary for the induction of zzso in one of these zzso
