zzso are a zzso group of zzso zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are structurally unrelated to zzso and zzso proteins that are defined as receptors for zzso zzso In zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso as a zzso of the human zzso zzso The 117 zzso acids of the zzso display zzso identity with the zzso core of zzso and exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the WW domain at the zzso and is able to rescue the zzso zzso on a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso was present both in dividing and zzso forms of zzso zzso In zzso cells neither cell growth zzso nor cell zzso was affected by the zzso of the small zzso zzso These results suggest the occurrence of a supplementary zzso level of zzso control in zzso
