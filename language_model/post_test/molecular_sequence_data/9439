The zzso zzso are a group of widely used zzso drugs, originally extracted from the Madagascar zzso that disrupt zzso dynamics in zzso cells by interfering with proper assembly of zzso zzso They favor curved zzso zzso that destabilize zzso and induce formation of spiral zzso Their binding energy profiles have been characterized by means of zzso zzso zzso and the binding site of zzso at the interface between two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso by X-ray zzso studies on a complex of zzso with the zzso domain of protein zzso albeit at relatively low zzso Here we use molecular modeling and simulation techniques to build, refine and perform a comparative analysis of the three-dimensional complexes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso interface in explicit water to zzso the binding affinity differences in structural and energetic zzso Our results shed some more light into the binding zzso and the zzso relationships of these clinically useful zzso
