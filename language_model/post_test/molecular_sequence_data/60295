zzso zzso bovine cells as well as zzso bovine peripheral blood zzso cells zzso express a zzso nuclear protein equivalent to the human zzso zzso In zzso to the human system, the expression of the bovine zzso protein is restricted to zzso cells only, since zzso zzso expression paralleled zzso incorporation in zzso A zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso bovine cells, and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells is related to the presence of the zzso within the zzso of the host zzso upon treatment with the zzso drug zzso the zzso are destroyed and the cells cease to zzso and to express the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso of zzso bovine cells revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the new equivalent zzso zzso detected one prominent protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 430 zzso Two zzso clones zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso bovine cells by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences with those of the human zzso protein revealed zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso identity proved to be zzso at the zzso acid zzso The remarkable identity between bovine and human zzso proteins suggests that zzso can be used as a marker for cell proliferation in animal zzso In this context we could identify zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso animals and, zzso we could distinguish between infected and zzso zzso cells using zzso and an zzso against a zzso zzso protein designated zzso
