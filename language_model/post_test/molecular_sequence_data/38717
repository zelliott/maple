The gene zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 125 was zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso was characterized both at the structural and functional level in comparison with the zzso coli zzso zzso which is the most closely related zzso sequence zzso bacterial zzso zzso is rapidly zzso at 50 degrees C zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas at this temperature zzso is stable for at least 3 zzso The optimal temperature for zzso activity is approximately 64 degrees C, which is some 11 degrees C below that of zzso The protein zzso stability was investigated by following changes in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso this clearly suggested that a first structural transition occurs at approximately 50 degrees C for zzso These results agree with the expected zzso of a zzso zzso although the observed stability is much higher than generally found for zzso isolated from zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast with the higher efficiency exhibited by several zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso of zzso are significantly lower than those of zzso over the whole temperature zzso This zzso possibly suggests that the adaptation of this class of zzso zzso to a cold environment may have only made them less stable and not more zzso The affinity of zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso decreases with increasing zzso However, binding of zzso and zzso which both inhibit the initial steps of zzso does not change over the temperature range zzso zzso the observed temperature effect may occur at any of the steps of the zzso mechanism after the formation of the external zzso A molecular model of zzso was constructed on the basis of sequence zzso with other zzso Interestingly, it shows no zzso or extension of zzso but some cavities and a decrease in side chain packing can be zzso
