The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was determined for three species of zzso frogs zzso representing three of the four recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The organization and size of these newly determined zzso zzso are similar to those previously reported for other zzso zzso analyses zzso likelihood, zzso zzso minimum evolution, and maximum zzso of zzso zzso genes at the zzso acid level were performed in combination with already published zzso zzso sequence data of three species of zzso one of zzso and four of zzso zzso analyses based on the deduced zzso acid sequences of all zzso zzso genes arrived at the same zzso The zzso of zzso is strongly zzso Within the zzso zzso is consistently recovered as sister group of zzso to the exclusion of zzso The three species representing zzso exhibited extremely long branches irrespective of the zzso zzso method used, and hence their relative position with respect to zzso and zzso may be zzso due to a severe long branch attraction zzso To further investigate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences of four nuclear zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso with sequences available for the three zzso zzso and zzso were retrieved from zzso and together with a zzso zzso sequence data set containing all zzso zzso genes except zzso were subjected to separate and combined zzso zzso In all cases, a sister group relationship between zzso and zzso was recovered with high statistical zzso
