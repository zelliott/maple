The zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso exchange across the inner zzso zzso zzso exchange is essential when zzso are grown on a zzso carbon source such as zzso but it is not required for growth on zzso Failure to grow on zzso is therefore a zzso indicator of protein function, and it has been used here to screen zzso zzso to identify functionally important zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Single zzso of all four charged zzso acids in the zzso segments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in loss of function, as did zzso in the zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso Seven other zzso were zzso without affecting growth on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso have been used to select zzso zzso to gain further insight into the structure of this membrane transport zzso
