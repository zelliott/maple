Members of the zzso zzso are important zzso involved in cycling organic carbon in aquatic zzso Their diversity has been studied by molecular methods in both freshwater and marine zzso and many novel zzso and species within this zzso have been characterized in recent zzso In this study, we examined the diversity of members of the zzso that could be readily isolated on solid media from river zzso and coastal sea zzso Most zzso zzso of the 55 zzso confirmed as members of the zzso and examined by zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences belonged to the zzso Furthermore, most (62 zzso of these were almost certainly members of the zzso zzso and all but one were from river zzso zzso the zzso zzso were more widely distributed in zzso containing other zzso Some of the zzso were zzso within zzso trees and so could not be assigned to putative zzso Two of these zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso and are proposed as novel species within two new zzso of the family zzso These are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
