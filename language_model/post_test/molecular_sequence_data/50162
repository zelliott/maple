The structure and expression of a novel zzso gene zzso of sweet potato were zzso The protein coding region of the gene consists of 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this sweet potato gene are found in a variety of zzso and zzso plants, but not in animals or zzso zzso of the expression patterns of the zzso gene in sweet potato reveals that the transcripts of zzso are specifically induced in the zzso leaves, and the zzso profile of zzso protein zzso is correlated with that of zzso zzso Studies on the distribution of zzso zzso in rice plants also indicate that zzso zzso is zzso specifically in zzso rice zzso Treatment of detached sweet potato leaves with zzso including zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid and zzso acid resulted in a high-level induction of zzso zzso microscopic analysis demonstrates that zzso is specifically associated with the cell zzso The potential role for zzso during leaf zzso is zzso
