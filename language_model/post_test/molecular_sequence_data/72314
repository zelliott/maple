zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for zzso We have previously shown that multiple zzso zzso species with different zzso regions are expressed in the rat and zzso However, the diversity of zzso zzso species in human has not completely been zzso In this work zzso and zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a human brain zzso library and the zzso located in the human zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis indicates that four species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are produced in human brain and spinal zzso In all human zzso the zzso initiation zzso in the zzso mouse and pig was replaced by zzso which does not serve as an initiation zzso for zzso In zzso translation and zzso expression analyses revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso give rise to a single 69 zzso zzso while zzso zzso produces both 82 and 69 zzso zzso The translation efficiency of zzso zzso was lower than that of the other zzso zzso Moreover, the translation efficiency of human zzso zzso was considerably lower than that of rat zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso for human zzso are zzso for translation initiation compared with the initiation zzso for rat zzso These results provide rational explanations for the previous reports that human zzso protein zzso from the brain and zzso had zzso zzso molecular mass, and that zzso activity in a single motor zzso of human was far lower than that of other zzso zzso of monkey zzso gene showed that the initiation zzso in zzso zzso was also replaced by zzso in the zzso
