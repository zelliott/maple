zzso exert their zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties by zzso enhancing the action of zzso at zzso receptors via their zzso zzso Although these drugs have been used clinically since 1960, the molecular basis of this interaction is still not zzso By using multiple zzso models and an unbiased zzso zzso we identified a binding hypothesis for the zzso structure of the zzso site, which was confirmed by experimental zzso Moreover, two independent virtual screening approaches based on this structure identified known zzso zzso from different structural classes and predicted potential new zzso for this zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies on zzso receptors confirmed these predictions and thus identified new zzso for the zzso zzso Our results support the zzso of the zzso structure of the zzso pocket, demonstrate its suitability for drug discovery and pave the way for zzso drug zzso
