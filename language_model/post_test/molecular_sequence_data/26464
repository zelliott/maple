A zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso was obtained from a rat liver zzso zzso This zzso contained a zzso terminal sequence of 48 base pairs complementary to a sequence in the 3' terminal region (an zzso repeat zzso except for one zzso zzso in the 3' zzso Base sequence analysis of this zzso northern zzso analysis of rat liver zzso using a probe specific to zzso region of zzso base sequence studies of the zzso upstream region of a clone of the rat zzso zzso and some other studies suggested strongly that the zzso repeat sequence of the zzso zzso used was introduced artificially during preparation of the zzso zzso
