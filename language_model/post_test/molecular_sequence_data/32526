We are investigating the genetic basis of zzso differences in skull shape between domestic dogs of different breeds using a candidate gene approach to identify genes involved in the genetic zzso One such candidate is zzso zzso is a zzso zzso important in the embryonic development and patterning of the zzso zzso Mice conditional zzso for the expression of zzso after zzso have a short zzso and a wide skull zzso et zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso zzso of the canine zzso zzso Like the mouse zzso it is composed of six zzso and we also predict that like the zzso there are eight alternative zzso that are generated by alternative zzso zzso We have identified a short 200 zzso sequence upstream of the zzso gene that is highly zzso between species and have predicted putative zzso factor binding sites using the zzso zzso zzso analysis of 4 dogs with different skull types identified genetic zzso None of the zzso however, were predicted to have any functional zzso
