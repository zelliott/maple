zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, plays a critical role in brain zzso Here, we performed a zzso search using the zzso zzso binding zzso namely the zzso zzso to determine the putative downstream target genes of zzso More than 20 identified genes containing the zzso zzso in the zzso regulatory region were found expressed in zzso zzso reporter zzso using cultured zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso and zzso promoter activities of some of these putative target zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso and zzso Among these zzso zzso promoter responded strongest to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso promoter impaired the induction by zzso and zzso We also examined expression of these target genes in zzso knockout mice, it was found that zzso expression was consistently zzso Similarly, both zzso and protein expression levels of zzso zzso 1 zzso which also contains the zzso zzso in its zzso regulatory region, were reduced in zzso knockout zzso We suggest that zzso protein complex regulates expression of these downstream target genes and thus zzso zzso activity and zzso
