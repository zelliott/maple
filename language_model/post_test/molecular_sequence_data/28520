White pine zzso rust zzso is caused by the fungus zzso zzso which has five spore stages on two unrelated zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, during the molecular analysis of the proteins and genes involved in zzso interaction, the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was identified in infected white pine zzso To further characterize zzso zzso an expression zzso library from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso culture was constructed and zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso analysis indicated an open reading frame of zzso zzso which encodes a protein of 153 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a predicted zzso point zzso of zzso Based on the zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso the zzso portion of zzso zzso protein should be 136 zzso acids long with several putative zzso modification sites and a molecular mass of zzso zzso The predicted zzso for the zzso portion was zzso The predicted zzso signal zzso was 17 zzso acids zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the predicted mature protein zzso zzso was identical to the zzso terminal sequence of zzso zzso that was previously zzso Southern zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso contained at least two copies of the zzso zzso zzso Isolation of the zzso zzso fragment, which was approximately 400 zzso longer than the zzso and subsequent cloning and sequencing analyses confirmed that there were three zzso within the coding zzso Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso protein accumulated in large amounts only in the infected white pine zzso while no trace was zzso in the alternate zzso stage or the five different spores, suggesting a critical role of zzso zzso in the zzso stage of the fungus (in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was only found to occur in zzso trees, and not in the young infected zzso The implications of zzso zzso in zzso are zzso
