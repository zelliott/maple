We have isolated nine zzso artificial zzso zzso containing the gene that encodes the human zzso hormone zzso zzso gene by screening the zzso library of the Centre zzso du zzso zzso zzso zzso Paris, zzso by the use of the zzso chain zzso We defined the location of the zzso gene relative to zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso The genetic positions of these markers on zzso 4 are 76 and 77 zzso zzso This location was further established by zzso in zzso zzso
