We developed a sensitive zzso for oyster zzso zzso zzso based on zzso protection and molecular zzso zzso zzso derived from previously described zzso zzso and newly constructed zzso zzso clones were used to create templates for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was assessed by zzso zzso expression to that of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso cadmium for 2 weeks) and control zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were sensitive to 150 and 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso was not affected by cadmium exposure and was suitable for use as a zzso zzso For detection of zzso zzso of controls, it was necessary to increase the amount of total input zzso zzso over that of zzso samples due to lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso was induced approximately zzso in the zzso zzso
