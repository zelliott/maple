A novel species, zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate eight strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from flowers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Garden, West Java, zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The common features of zzso zzso are a zzso to zzso shaped zzso which contains one or two zzso zzso and lyse at zzso zzso generally develop directly from zzso cells but sometimes from zzso The zzso tree based on the zzso domain of nuclear large zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences strongly supports that zzso zzso zzso zzso and its closest zzso species, zzso zzso are different species by a zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso differed from zzso zzso zzso zzso by six zzso (five zzso and one zzso in their zzso region of zzso zzso and by 18 zzso (five zzso four zzso and nine zzso in their internal transcribed zzso regions of zzso zzso Four strains representative of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a zzso zzso content of zzso zzso zzso whereas that of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The low value of zzso zzso zzso in four strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly supported that these strains represent a distinct zzso
