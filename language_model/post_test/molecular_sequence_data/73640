The zzso of light, coupled to zzso can in principle be zzso to monitor the activity of a large number of individual zzso zzso To illustrate this concept, fusion proteins of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso (which we term zzso were expressed in cultured zzso zzso with the help of viral zzso zzso were targeted to synaptic zzso and, upon zzso formed light-emitting complexes with their zzso zzso which was added to the zzso zzso zzso emissions required a zzso zzso occurred from regions with high synaptic density as zzso by vital zzso of recycling synaptic zzso and were sensitive to zzso depletion and zzso zzso The method can currently detect zzso of the readily zzso pool of synaptic zzso at a zzso zzso corresponding to about two dozen zzso but has the potential for greater zzso
