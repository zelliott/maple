The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is crucial in the regulation of zzso during embryonic development and widely used as molecular marker of embryonic stem cells zzso The objective of this study was to identify and to zzso the promoter region of rabbit zzso zzso zzso to examine its expression pattern in zzso stage rabbit zzso 

The upstream region of rabbit zzso was zzso zzso and four highly zzso promoter regions zzso were zzso The highest degree of similarity on sequence level was found among the zzso zzso between rabbit and zzso Among the enhancers the zzso zzso region zzso exhibited the highest degree of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso regulator domain containing the zzso zzso zzso was responsible for stem zzso zzso Also, zzso library screen revealed the existence of a processed zzso of rabbit zzso The results of quantitative real-time zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso was abundantly present in zzso and zzso but it was gradually reduced until the zzso of the embryonic zzso thereafter a continuous increase in zzso zzso level was observed until zzso zzso By using the zzso laser system the inner cell mass zzso and zzso portions of zzso were zzso and examined separately and zzso zzso was detected in both cell zzso 

In this study we provide a comparative sequence analysis of the regulatory region of rabbit zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso gene is strictly regulated during early zzso zzso We proposed that the well zzso zzso region containing the zzso zzso is responsible for the highly zzso zzso specific gene zzso zzso we are the first to report that the rabbit zzso is not restricted to ICM cells only, but it is expressed in zzso cells as zzso This information may be well zzso to investigate further the possible zzso role and the regulation of zzso zzso
