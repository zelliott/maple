Type IV zzso are long, flexible filaments that extend from the surface of zzso bacteria and are formed by the zzso of zzso zzso This review focuses on the structural information available for each zzso zzso type zzso and type zzso highlighting the contributions crystal and nuclear magnetic resonance structures have made in understanding zzso function and zzso In addition, the type II zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso assembly is compared to that of the type IV zzso The zzso zzso adopt an zzso fold formed by the zzso packing of the zzso half of a long zzso against an zzso zzso The zzso zzso half of the same zzso as well as two zzso and zzso regions, zzso from this zzso head zzso zzso models have a zzso core formed by the signature long zzso with variable regions at the filament zzso
