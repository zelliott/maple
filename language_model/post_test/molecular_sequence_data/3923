The factors involved in regulating alternative zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso in different cell types remain zzso We have designed a G zzso zzso that retains the signals required for G zzso alternative zzso in zzso zzso transient zzso of human zzso smooth muscle cells and zzso cells, as well as in zzso zzso zzso we have provided evidence that the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso act as potent regulators of G zzso zzso expression in these zzso Both zzso and zzso control the selection of competing zzso sites and respectively promote inclusion or skipping of the small zzso zzso 3 of G zzso zzso resulting in the generation of G zzso and G zzso zzso zzso We have also provided evidence that zzso and zzso play a role in zzso site selection involving the use of a zzso zzso zzso site preceding zzso zzso Using a zzso analysis to identify putative zzso zzso sequences zzso we found multiple high score zzso motifs for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 3 of G zzso These results suggest that zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso the expression of alternative zzso of G zzso in these different cells zzso
