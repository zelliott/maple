Three bacterial zzso from air samples in Korea, designated strains zzso zzso and zzso were characterized using a zzso zzso The cells were strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of their zzso zzso gene sequences revealed a clear affiliation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso to type strains of recognized species of the zzso zzso and strain zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contents of the DNA of strains zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Major fatty acids of strains zzso and zzso were summed feature 4 zzso I and/or zzso B), zzso and zzso The fatty acid content of strain zzso mainly comprised zzso G and zzso Comparative analysis of zzso and zzso traits indicated that strains zzso and zzso represented two novel species of the zzso zzso and that strain zzso should be considered as a novel species of the zzso zzso The names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed for these zzso
