zzso zzso transfer protein zzso is a key participant in the reverse transport of cholesterol from the peripheral zzso to the zzso To understand further the role that zzso gene plays in the zzso of coronary heart disease zzso the promoter region, all 16 zzso and adjacent zzso regions of zzso gene were screened for single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients and 209 healthy volunteers by the combination of zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso molecular zzso and DNA zzso A novel zzso zzso in the zzso gene was zzso This zzso zzso was caused by a zzso conversion at zzso 296 of zzso 10 which resulted in the replacing of the zzso for zzso zzso with the zzso for zzso zzso Further studies found that there was a significant increase in the zzso zzso frequency in the zzso patients compared with that in the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the odds ratio to develop zzso was zzso for the zzso zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses also demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso carrier patients displayed significantly higher total cholesterol zzso and low density zzso cholesterol zzso zzso than zzso zzso All these results suggest that the zzso zzso in zzso gene was closely related to zzso and the identification of new zzso in the zzso gene will afford the opportunity to investigate the relationship between zzso gene and zzso
