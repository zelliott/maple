The zzso zzso zzso of a marine fish, zzso zzso was engineered to improve the zzso activity based on comparative zzso zzso The 3-D crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso was used as a zzso A triple point zzso zzso for spatial orientation of the zzso zzso zzso for removing electron density overlap between zzso and zzso and zzso for good charge relay in the active site, was zzso The initial zzso rate, the reaction time to reach 98 zzso and yield were enhanced up to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
