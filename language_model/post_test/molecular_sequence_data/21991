We have characterized two new members of the zzso zzso family in zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso Indian zzso zzso and Desert zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and Type X collagen zzso expression during skeletal development show that zzso transcripts are located in zzso zzso of zzso elements of the zzso and fin zzso Surprisingly, zzso expression was also detected in cells forming zzso bones of the head and in flat cells surrounding zzso zzso The expression of zzso in both zzso and zzso bones reflects an zzso composition of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, during fin ray zzso both zzso and zzso are detected in zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso of the zzso bone fin zzso The presence of cartilage markers suggests that the zzso fin ray possesses an intermediate zzso between cartilage and zzso
