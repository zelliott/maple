A fully automated zzso zzso has been constructed that is capable of the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and the simultaneous synthesis of 36 individual zzso The zzso was constructed from a zzso of our own design utilizing a zzso robot zzso A Macintosh II computer coordinates the movements of the robotic arm, the switching of over 40 zzso valves and the monitoring of sensors in the zzso The robot hands are used to deliver zzso from zzso zzso lines and to zzso zzso acid solutions from reservoirs to an array of reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso mixing and zzso removal are controlled from a zzso zzso board in the zzso The design features of the zzso are zzso as well as the characterization of multiple individual zzso a simple mixture of 19 zzso and a complex mixture of zzso zzso
