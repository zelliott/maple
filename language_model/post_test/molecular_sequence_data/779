A zzso zzso protein constituent of fresh latex was isolated both from the latex of regularly damaged zzso trees and from a commercially available zzso zzso The protein was zzso up to apparent zzso and was shown to be absent in the latex of zzso trees that had never been previously mechanically zzso This suggests that the protein belongs to zzso protein family, as expected for several other protein constituents of zzso zzso The protein was identified as a zzso protein zzso 5 of the zzso zzso on the basis of its partial zzso acid zzso By sequence analysis of the zzso zzso three different forms of zzso protein were identified, where the latex constituent belongs to a well-known form, allowing the molecular modeling of its spatial zzso The zzso latex zzso protein was further zzso The protein appears to be stable in the pH zzso from 2 to 10 and resistant to chemical zzso by zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and to zzso by the four zzso zzso zzso The zzso role of this protein is zzso
