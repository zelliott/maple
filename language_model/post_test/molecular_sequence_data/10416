The human zzso zzso factor Tu zzso is zzso and functions in the zzso apparatus of zzso The complete human zzso zzso sequence of zzso base pairs zzso with a 101 zzso zzso region, a zzso zzso coding region, and a zzso zzso zzso region, has been determined and zzso The predicted protein from this zzso sequence is approximately zzso zzso in size and is composed of 455 zzso acids zzso with a putative zzso zzso leader sequence of approximately 50 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shows high similarity to other zzso protein sequences from zzso zzso and bacteria, and also shows limited similarity to human zzso zzso factor 1 zzso The complete size of this zzso zzso zzso obtained by cloning and sequencing was confirmed by Northern zzso analysis, which showed a single transcript zzso of approximately zzso zzso in human zzso The zzso structure of this zzso gene has been determined for the first zzso This gene contains nine zzso with a predicted size of approximately zzso zzso zzso and has been mapped to zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequence similarity to the zzso gene has also been identified and mapped to zzso zzso
