Previously, we had characterized a 91 zzso acid zzso of the heat shock zzso factor from the zzso zzso zzso and had shown it to be highly zzso and sufficient for formation of zzso zzso zzso and Nelson, zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso Based on those data, as well as the presence of zzso zzso repeats, we zzso that the zzso domain contains a zzso zzso and that it might resemble the zzso domain found in influenza zzso Here, we further characterize the zzso domain and show that the minimal domain needs 71 zzso to remain zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the structure contains three parallel strands that are in register along the long axis of the zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso studies show that the zzso of the zzso are in close zzso this is in contrast to the zzso of the zzso zzso domain where the zzso form zzso zzso zzso zzso also confirms that the structure is zzso and unlikely to have zzso zzso Additional experiments suggest that the zzso domain has at least two zzso The first zzso has the potential to form zzso zzso though not as zzso as the complete zzso The second zzso is quite zzso forms large zzso and appears to provide stability to the complete zzso Our current model for the heat shock zzso factor zzso domain is a highly zzso zzso structure, with a potential break in the zzso region located between the two zzso
