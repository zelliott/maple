zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso gene impair normal sexual differentiation and development in zzso zzso resulting in a spectrum of external zzso zzso ranging from complete female to nearly complete zzso Identification and characterization of these zzso can provide valuable information regarding the functional importance of specific zzso acids of the zzso To screen for point zzso in the zzso gene underlying the zzso abnormalities in the zzso zzso syndrome zzso the eight zzso of the zzso gene were amplified from zzso DNA using the zzso chain reaction zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso gel zzso A computer program, zzso was used to identify optimum sequences for zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso detection sensitivity was enhanced by forming zzso between control and subject zzso products to create base zzso In seven families with complete zzso single base zzso were found in the region of the zzso gene zzso the zzso domain of the zzso The zzso that converted zzso acid zzso from zzso to His and zzso acid 864 from zzso to zzso were recreated using zzso zzso and the zzso zzso expressed in zzso 7 and zzso zzso In both cases, abnormalities of zzso binding and zzso zzso were consistent with the observed sex zzso These results together with others reported previously demonstrate that single zzso acid changes within the region zzso by zzso D to H of the zzso gene can alter zzso binding and are a common cause of complete zzso zzso The strategy used zzso employing zzso zzso gel analysis of zzso zzso products, provides a valuable aid to rapid detection of single base zzso in zzso
