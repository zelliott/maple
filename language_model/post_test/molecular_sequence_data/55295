In this study, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in goat prion protein zzso gene in zzso zzso from 13 Chinese native zzso The zzso of zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso in different zzso The establishment of association of the zzso zzso zzso with production traits was performed in Inner Mongolia white cashmere zzso and zzso zzso dairy zzso zzso Two significant associations between this zzso and zzso body mass zzso zzso zzso and average body mass zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso as well as zzso thickness of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the novel zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with total zzso in the evening zzso zzso zzso zzso and milk yield zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggested that the zzso zzso zzso was a potential DNA marker for eliminating or selecting preferred individuals in relation to production traits in goat zzso selection breeding while carrying out preventing zzso zzso
