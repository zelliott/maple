We have previously characterized a novel mouse zzso marker, defined as zzso shared zzso zzso present on both immature zzso and a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 35, a zzso specific for zzso alters T cell differentiation when added to fetal zzso organ cultures, suggesting zzso may be important for T cell development in the zzso In this study, we describe the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso using transient expression of zzso cells and selection with zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of this zzso encodes a 15 to zzso protein and the expressed protein is linked to the membrane via a zzso zzso zzso is zzso active at various levels in all zzso zzso suggesting that its role is not solely zzso zzso shares zzso acid sequence zzso to the mouse zzso zzso family, zzso growth zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus is located on zzso 15 linked to zzso on the mouse zzso We also examined the effects of zzso 35 in fetal zzso organ cultures zzso with two zzso of zzso representing defined stages of T cell zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play a role during positive selection and the transition from zzso zzso to the mature zzso and zzso zzso
