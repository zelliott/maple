We investigated the cellular responses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso Based upon a zzso survey, it was demonstrated that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in response to zzso addition of zzso To zzso their zzso functions, we cloned zzso and zzso expressed them in zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso activities against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the product from zzso was identified as zzso an important intermediate in a zzso zzso of aromatic compounds in which the aromatic ring of zzso can be further zzso by zzso zzso for zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso compounds would presumably be associated with zzso
