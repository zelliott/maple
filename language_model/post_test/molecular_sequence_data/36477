The theoretical treatment of the process of washing out of a single stranded DNA zzso after zzso with short zzso immobilized within the zzso gel layer is zzso The theory describes zzso the main body of experimental findings, obtained earlier in connection with the zzso of a new DNA sequencing method based on zzso with the zzso of immobilized zzso zzso zzso et zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular the theory explains and describes well zzso the observed dependence of the zzso off zzso zzso on the concentration of the immobilized zzso The zzso dependence on inherent zzso parameters such as the zzso and the zzso of duplex formation and on those selected by the zzso zzso time zzso the gel thickness zzso is also zzso A simple approximate expression for the calculation of zzso off zzso is zzso Some inconsistencies between calculated and observed washing zzso are zzso
