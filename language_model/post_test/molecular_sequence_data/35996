A familial zzso in zzso the gene coding for the zzso factor zzso was identified in an zzso female with zzso zzso her father, her two brothers and her zzso The zzso consists of a T to C transition in the region of the zzso gene coding for a protein motif known as the high mobility group zzso box, a protein domain known to zzso zzso specificity on the zzso zzso This point zzso results in the zzso at zzso acid position zzso of a zzso zzso for zzso a zzso aromatic zzso in almost all zzso box motifs zzso This zzso zzso was not found in 176 male zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein were tested in zzso for binding to the target site zzso zzso no differences in zzso activity were zzso These results imply that the zzso zzso either is a rare neutral sequence zzso or produces an zzso protein with slightly altered in zzso activity, the resulting sex zzso depending on the genetic background or environmental zzso
