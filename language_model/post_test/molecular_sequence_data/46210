zzso The cadmium zzso zzso rice zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to have an enhanced rate of zzso zzso zzso This trait is controlled by a single zzso zzso located at zzso zzso In this study, using zzso cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal zzso 3 zzso was identified as the gene that controls zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso activity of the gene products were also zzso zzso The zzso of zzso that zzso high zzso zzso zzso rates zzso encodes a defective zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to zzso zzso in plants and zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity in a zzso zzso that lacks the ability to transport zzso into zzso By contrast, zzso did not complement the zzso sensitivity of this zzso zzso indicating that the zzso transport function was zzso zzso We propose that the root cell zzso of zzso rice plants has more zzso available for loading into the zzso as a result of the lack of zzso transportation of zzso to the zzso This zzso results in zzso zzso to the shoots in higher zzso These data demonstrate the importance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso
