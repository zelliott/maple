We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso fragments, and tentatively identified it as a zzso CA by zzso zzso We have also characterized a zzso message whose deduced sequence of 260 zzso acids matches that of the isolated zzso This CA is clearly an zzso based on the similarity of its sequence to that of other members of the zzso gene zzso A zzso analysis suggested zzso zzso after the branching of the zzso and zzso genes and prior to the zzso that generated the zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso This marks the first characterization of the zzso and its protein product from the CA gene of a zzso
