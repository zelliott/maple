zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in stimulating insulin release in the zzso as well as zzso gastric acid zzso in the zzso zzso has been found in specific zzso cells located in the zzso layer of the small zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso expression of zzso guided by zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso gene zzso zzso region was investigated by a transgenic mouse zzso A zzso zzso gene construct linking the zzso region of the zzso gene with the zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso virus was introduced into the zzso of mice by zzso By reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was found in the stomach and zzso The zzso activity detected in the stomach was about zzso higher than that found in the zzso suggesting that zzso may be expressed in the zzso This observation is supported by zzso studies since both human and mouse zzso transcripts are detected in the stomach and small zzso In addition, distinct zzso cells were identified in both zzso in mouse by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso is expressed in human and mouse zzso
