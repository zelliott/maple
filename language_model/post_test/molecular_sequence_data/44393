Since zzso hormones play a pivotal role in zzso metamorphosis we used zzso to amplify DNA fragments corresponding to a portion of the zzso domain of the zzso hormone zzso zzso genes in several zzso zzso the obligatory zzso members of the family zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as two members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the tiger zzso zzso zzso In addition, we looked for zzso genes in the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were found in all these species including the obligatory zzso zzso The zzso fragments obtained zzso both the C and E zzso and zzso to alpha and beta zzso Their sequences appear to be normal, suggesting that there is no acceleration of evolutionary rates in the zzso genes of zzso zzso This result is not surprising for zzso which are known to respond to zzso zzso but is not in agreement with zzso and biological data showing that zzso cannot respond to zzso zzso Interestingly, by zzso analysis we observed a high expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso and muscles of zzso as well as in the liver of zzso zzso whereas zzso expression was only detected in zzso zzso but not in zzso Such a differential expression pattern of zzso and zzso may explain the zzso in zzso The cloning of zzso gene fragments from these species will allow the molecular study of their failure to undergo zzso
