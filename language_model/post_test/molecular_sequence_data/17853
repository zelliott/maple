The expression and zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in the rat facial nucleus after zzso by Northern zzso analysis and by in zzso zzso zzso zzso using a synthetic zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso extracted from the facial zzso This zzso species was strongly increased after zzso of the facial zzso By zzso increased levels of zzso zzso were observed as soon as 16 zzso after zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be localized in more than 50% of the zzso Three populations of zzso with no, moderate, or strong labeling for zzso zzso could be zzso Peak expression of zzso zzso during the first 48 zzso was followed by a decline to moderate levels at day 4 after zzso and to almost zzso levels at days 7 and zzso These data demonstrate that zzso of the facial nerve leads to an early and strong induction of zzso gene expression in zzso of the facial zzso
