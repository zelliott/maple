Analysis of sequence relationships in zzso heavy chains shows that zzso motor proteins comprise a single zzso family with three main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a third branch represented by zzso that lies between the other zzso In all branches of the family the zzso heavy chain has four copies of the zzso motif for a zzso site spaced approximately 300 zzso apart in its zzso with the zzso acid sequence zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appear more primitive in that the heavy chain usually occurs as a zzso with traces of the early evolution of its four zzso motifs by gene zzso being zzso In the zzso zzso the heavy chain occurs as zzso or zzso zzso by multiple zzso and their zzso zzso motifs are much more divergent with little trace of their origin by gene zzso The zzso zzso is more closely related to the zzso zzso in zzso but appears related to zzso zzso in function since it becomes zzso during zzso and has not been found in organisms, such as zzso and zzso that are totally without zzso or zzso
