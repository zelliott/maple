The zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the Ras zzso of zzso zzso zzso is involved in the control of cell polarity during the zzso cell zzso This protein has a consensus sequence zzso for zzso modification and is likely to be zzso at least in part, with cell zzso Using cell zzso and zzso techniques, we have investigated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found in both soluble and particulate pools, and neither its abundance nor its distribution varied through the cell zzso The particulate form of zzso could be zzso with zzso but not with zzso or zzso suggesting that it is tightly associated with zzso An increase in soluble zzso was observed in a zzso zzso strain zzso grown at the restrictive zzso In addition, zzso from a zzso zzso strain zzso has an zzso at the zzso consensus zzso was almost exclusively in the soluble zzso suggesting that membrane zzso is dependent on zzso modification at zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of zzso zzso that were found at the site of bud zzso at the tips and sides of enlarging zzso and within mating projections zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is localized to the bud site early in the cell cycle and suggest that this zzso is critical for the selection of the proper site for bud emergence and for polarized cell zzso
