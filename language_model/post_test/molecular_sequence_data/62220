zzso zzso is among the most metabolically versatile bacteria zzso It uses light, zzso compounds, or organic compounds, for zzso It acquires carbon from many types of green zzso compounds or by carbon dioxide zzso and it fixes zzso Here we describe the zzso sequence of zzso zzso which consists of a zzso zzso circular zzso with zzso predicted genes and a zzso of zzso zzso The sequence reveals genes that zzso a remarkably large number of options within a given type of zzso including three zzso five zzso ring zzso pathways and four light harvesting 2 zzso zzso zzso encodes 63 signal zzso zzso zzso and 79 response regulator receiver zzso Almost zzso of the zzso is devoted to zzso This zzso sequence is a starting point to use zzso zzso as a model to explore how organisms integrate zzso zzso in response to environmental zzso
