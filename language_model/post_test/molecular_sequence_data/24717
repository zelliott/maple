zzso of motor zzso are generated at different positions along the zzso axis of the spinal zzso One feature of the zzso organization of spinal motor zzso is a zzso expression of zzso zzso but little is known about how this aspect of motor zzso zzso identity is zzso We have used the expression profile of zzso proteins to define the source and identity of patterning signals that impose motor zzso zzso identity along the zzso axis of the spinal zzso We provide evidence that the zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso signals originating from zzso zzso and zzso zzso establish and refine the zzso zzso identity of motor zzso in the developing spinal zzso
