A clinical isolate of zzso coli from a patient in Japan, isolate zzso was found to produce a zzso zzso that zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso Resistance arising from production of a zzso could be transferred by either zzso or transformation with zzso zzso into zzso coli zzso The zzso and zzso profiles of this zzso resembled those of the zzso zzso The resistance gene of zzso which was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, proved to contain an open reading frame showing zzso DNA sequence identity with the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis also identified a gene upstream of zzso whose sequence was zzso identical to the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso and an outer membrane zzso zzso surrounding the zzso genes in zzso zzso were identified, and zzso sequence zzso elements were observed on both sides of the sequences identified zzso an zzso composite zzso these results confirm the evidence of the zzso of a zzso gene region from the zzso to a zzso Finally, we describe a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso gene derived from zzso zzso
