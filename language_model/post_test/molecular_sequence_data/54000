zzso zzso for the removal of the zzso zzso protecting group have been generated to accommodate a broad range of zzso zzso zzso which was zzso against zzso zzso 1, zzso the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso acids with almost identical zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso displayed zzso tolerance towards the zzso and accepted the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso To define the molecular basis of the broad zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso and constructed a model of the zzso zzso The model showed a relatively shallow pocket of the zzso site that zzso the zzso zzso and this is consistent with the observed zzso zzso Thus, in the zzso reaction, the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso should be outside the combining site and ignored by the zzso zzso A structural comparison of zzso with zzso zzso zzso against the structurally similar zzso zzso suggests the significance of the zzso zzso in zzso design, which zzso zzso zzso with broad zzso zzso These investigations provide new strategies for the generation of zzso zzso that accept a broad range of zzso for practical applications in organic synthetic zzso
