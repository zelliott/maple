Recently two reports zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have appeared concerning the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso clones are virtually zzso they diverge in the zzso region that encodes the zzso zzso of the zzso In order to clarify the sequence of this region, we have isolated zzso zzso clones from a rat zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso isolated and characterized by our zzso We have determined the sequence of zzso 1 and 2 of the structural gene by zzso sequencing using zzso zzso The sequence of zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso zzso structural gene along with our previous zzso sequence analysis of zzso as well as conventional zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso protein indicates that zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso These data agree with the published sequence of zzso zzso reported by zzso et zzso
