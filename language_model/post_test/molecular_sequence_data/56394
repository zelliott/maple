zzso zzso zzso zzso produces up to 5 g of zzso zzso per liter in broth culture and displays resistance to several synthetic zzso of aromatic zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster of this strain on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso revealed that as in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso genes are clustered in an zzso in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso also zzso increased resistance to the zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene revealed no significant changes when compared to the zzso sequence of a zzso strain reported zzso However, analysis of the zzso region revealed a nonsense zzso zzso in the third of three tandem zzso zzso present within a zzso leader zzso zzso chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the corresponding region confirmed the absence of this zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso predictions and sequence similarities to the zzso coli zzso zzso suggest that this zzso results in a zzso zzso zzso
