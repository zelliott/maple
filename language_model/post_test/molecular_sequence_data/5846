We cloned a novel human gene zzso a zzso zzso termed zzso which is highly zzso to the zzso sex determination gene of zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso had similarity to the zzso large zzso in domain organization throughout zzso I to III, but the sequences of domain IV lacked zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed high expression in the zzso small zzso and zzso zzso hybrid mapping localized the zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso apart from zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the approximately zzso zzso protein was zzso expressed in zzso zzso These zzso together with the genetic information in zzso suggest a unique function for zzso zzso
