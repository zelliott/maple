zzso of zzso zzso for nerve growth factor, zzso zzso factor, zzso and the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso have been studied using in zzso zzso in the rat brain 2 h and four weeks after zzso zzso zzso activity evoked by zzso stimulation and exceeding 70 s lead to a zzso and transient increase of zzso derived zzso factor, nerve growth factor, zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells after both focal and generalized zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso levels were also increased zzso in the zzso regions, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after generalized zzso The magnitude of the increases was similar throughout the development of kindling and in the fully zzso zzso No changes of zzso zzso zzso were zzso In zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso factor zzso zzso levels developed more rapidly in the zzso zzso than after stimulation in the zzso but changes in the zzso formation were only seen in few zzso zzso zzso or a bilateral zzso zzso did not alter zzso expression or zzso changes in zzso zzso levels for zzso or zzso receptors but increased the number of animals exhibiting elevated levels after the first zzso probably due to a zzso of seizure zzso Both in zzso and zzso rats seizure activity caused a marked reduction of zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso at least in zzso zzso cells, is an zzso type of response and dependent on the duration but not the severity of zzso or the stage of kindling zzso Changes in zzso zzso factor, nerve growth factor, zzso and zzso and zzso were observed zzso in the zzso zzso which suggests that seizure activity sets in motion a cascade of zzso events possibly zzso via a common zzso Since altered zzso zzso levels outside zzso were detected only for zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso gene expression in these regions seems to be regulated zzso
