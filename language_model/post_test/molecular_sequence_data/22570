An zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a soil sample and identified as a zzso zzso The strain presented remarkable zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso The crude zzso protein extract from culture zzso of the bacteria killed about zzso of the tested zzso within 24 zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso A homogeneous zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and the hypothesis of zzso zzso in the infection of zzso strain was confirmed by the experiments of killing living zzso and by the degradation of zzso zzso zzso when treated with the zzso zzso The gene for the zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed significant similarity with zzso zzso but low zzso with the other zzso zzso previously reported in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed the molecular mass of 28 zzso and the optimum activity at pH 10, 50 degrees zzso The zzso zzso can zzso several native zzso zzso including collagen and zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso of bacteria that serves as a zzso factor against zzso an important step in understanding the relationship between bacterial pathogen and host and in improving the zzso activity in biological zzso
