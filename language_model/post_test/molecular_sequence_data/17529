Previous work suggested that the major Mr 46,000 zzso protein zzso putative zzso zzso zzso found in rat liver nuclear scaffold zzso may be zzso derived from zzso zzso To definitively establish this zzso we undertook a series of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mice were zzso with human zzso C expressed in bacteria, and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso all recognized zzso A and C on zzso of zzso as well as Mr 46,000 or zzso zzso fragments as minor zzso The Mr 46,000 zzso band was the only major zzso component zzso with low zzso of zzso and it was zzso with zzso zzso zzso To zzso the possibility that the zzso Mr 46,000 protein represented a minor component which zzso with the Mr 46,000 zzso zzso and which specifically associated with zzso zzso during zzso a series of zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso Mr 46,000 zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced a limited number of zzso fragments, all of which zzso with major zzso fragments produced from the Mr 46,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Mr 46,000 zzso followed by zzso gel zzso or high performance liquid zzso acid zzso defined the zzso zzso site as the Y zzso at zzso acid 376 and localized the zzso site to the zzso region zzso acids zzso In support of this proposed zzso zzso site, specific zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso documented the presence of zzso zzso activity which zzso at zzso zzso this activity shows a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of approximately zzso Parallel experiments with mildly zzso cloned zzso C preparations showed selective zzso of an Mr zzso fragment, which zzso to a zzso breakdown product of the Mr 46,000 zzso zzso this Mr zzso zzso zzso was also zzso with zzso zzso zzso and contained the same zzso site as the Mr 46,000 zzso zzso zzso C preparations were inactive in zzso zzso but did exhibit substantial zzso binding with an apparent zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso M zzso These results indicate that the major Mr 46,000 zzso protein in zzso which represents the putative zzso thought to participate in zzso zzso is derived from zzso A or zzso C by zzso zzso activity which exposes a cryptic zzso site near the highly zzso end of zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
