zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso and chronic zzso sometimes associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and male zzso At the cell level, the disease zzso includes various zzso abnormalities of respiratory zzso and zzso zzso We have previously isolated zzso the first gene involved in these diseases in patients lacking outer zzso zzso In this study, designed to find additional genes for other zzso zzso we report the isolation of a novel human zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed as two major zzso one is expressed in zzso only, whereas the second is zzso expressed in many other zzso As zzso of zzso strains carrying zzso zzso lack the zzso central complexes, we tested the involvement of the zzso gene in the disease zzso of five patients in whom zzso or zzso display abnormal central zzso Five zzso zzso were identified and used to exclude zzso in two zzso patients, while no zzso was found in the remaining zzso However, given the genetic zzso of zzso we consider that this gene remains a good candidate to be investigated in patients with abnormal central zzso
