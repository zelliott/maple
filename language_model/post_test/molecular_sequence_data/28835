zzso zzso zzso has been prepared and zzso from zzso and developing zzso bean zzso A combination of one- and two-dimensional zzso and zzso gel zzso was used to study the complexity of sample and protein differences between the two zzso The zzso of the developing zzso is central to the zzso sorting and storage of protein and zzso reserves while the zzso seed is concerned with their zzso Sample complexity has been reduced by separation of zzso proteins into zzso peripheral membrane and integral membrane zzso zzso proteins pose specific problems in zzso and binding to passive zzso We have overcome this by collection of zzso at density zzso zzso and by zzso of plastic zzso Several major components have been identified from zzso gels by zzso sequencing and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso These include protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso In excess of 300 spots are zzso in each zzso fraction by high sensitivity zzso zzso This is the first zzso zzso analysis of plant zzso These gels reveal significant differences between zzso and developing zzso zzso loading zzso gels of zzso zzso have been run and 14 selected spots characterized by zzso time of flight tandem mass zzso zzso zzso Ten of these proteins were assigned function on the basis of identity with existing zzso database entries, or by zzso with other zzso Two zzso zzso zzso precursor and zzso zzso appear to be absent from developing zzso Most of the proteins identified are concerned with roles in protein processing and storage, and zzso metabolism which occur in the zzso Data from three of the assigned spots included unidentified peptides indicating the presence of more than one protein in these spots following zzso zzso More extensive analysis will have to await developments in zzso but the basic separation technologies to simplify sample identity for a plant zzso preparation have been zzso
