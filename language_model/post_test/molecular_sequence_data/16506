We report the first phase I trial to assess the safety and zzso of a malaria vaccine candidate, zzso zzso composed of a modified zzso B virus core protein zzso containing minimal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso coli, the zzso zzso protein forms zzso particles that were found to be highly zzso in zzso studies of mice and zzso Twenty healthy adult volunteers received a zzso or a zzso dose of zzso zzso administered zzso at 0, 2, and 6 zzso The majority of volunteers in the group receiving the zzso dose developed zzso to zzso repeats as well as to zzso zzso T cells that zzso gamma zzso were also detected after a single zzso with zzso These studies support zzso as a promising malaria vaccine candidate for further clinical testing using zzso zzso zzso and confirm the potential of modified zzso zzso particles as a delivery platform for vaccines against other human zzso
