The zzso zzso of zzso zzso are highly zzso a modification that has been implicated in resistance to host defense and in zzso In previous work, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso acid from the zzso milieu and incorporates those zzso into zzso Here we report that zzso zzso can use zzso zzso acids bearing zzso zzso groups from three to seven carbon atoms in zzso resulting in outer membrane presentation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso comprises approximately zzso of cell surface zzso when zzso zzso are added to the media at zzso zzso despite the availability of natural zzso acid in the growth zzso Although they represent the majority of cell surface zzso zzso with longer zzso groups diminish the overall level of LOS zzso culminating in complete zzso of LOS zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso LOS can be modulated with respect to the structure of the terminal zzso acid zzso and the extent to which the LOS zzso is modified by zzso the bacteria with various zzso acid zzso
