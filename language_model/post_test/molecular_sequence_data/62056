zzso operates in the zzso zzso that produces the compounds responsible for the characteristic flavor of zzso We isolated and characterized the zzso zzso clone containing a novel onion zzso zzso zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with a bulb zzso is zzso and with a root zzso is zzso The zzso gene is expressed specifically in onion roots and estimated zzso value of mature zzso protein is similar to that of root zzso zzso I, which is an zzso protein having zzso zzso The highly repetitive sequences around the zzso gene was observed from sequence and DNA gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso content of the zzso zzso region is similar to that of zzso plants and lower than that of zzso cereal plants, although onion is classified into zzso The present study shows the first evidence of the onion zzso sequences around genes differed from the cereal zzso
