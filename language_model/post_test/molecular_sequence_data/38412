Major zzso complex class II zzso molecules occupy a pivotal position in the zzso immune system, and correct regulation of their expression is therefore of critical importance for the control of the immune zzso Several regulatory factors essential for the zzso of zzso genes have been identified by zzso of the molecular defects responsible for zzso zzso a zzso zzso disease characterized by regulatory defects zzso zzso zzso Three of these factors, zzso zzso and zzso combine to form the zzso complex, a regulatory protein that binds to the X box DNA sequence present in all zzso zzso In this study we have undertaken a dissection of the structure and function of zzso the largest zzso of the zzso zzso The results define two distinct zzso serving two different essential zzso A highly zzso zzso region of zzso is required for its association with zzso and zzso for assembly of the zzso complex in zzso and in zzso and for binding of this complex to its X box target site in the zzso zzso This zzso region is, however, not sufficient for zzso of zzso zzso This requires an additional domain within the zzso region of zzso This zzso domain mediates cooperative binding between the zzso complex and zzso a zzso factor binding to the Y box sequence of zzso zzso This provides direct evidence that zzso cooperative binding between zzso and zzso plays an essential role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
