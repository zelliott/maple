zzso zzso channels generate dynamic zzso currents that are vital to the zzso functions of many zzso These proteins contain separate zzso zzso which detect changes in zzso zzso and pore zzso which conduct zzso zzso of zzso sensing and pore opening is critical to the channel function and has been modeled as a zzso interaction between the two zzso Here, we show that zzso in zzso channels requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso domain zzso failed to open the pore in the absence of zzso This result is due to loss of zzso because zzso was also required for pore opening to affect zzso domain zzso We identified a critical site for zzso zzso at the interface between the zzso domain and the pore zzso This site is actually a zzso zzso site among different zzso channels, suggesting that lipids play an important role in zzso in many zzso zzso
