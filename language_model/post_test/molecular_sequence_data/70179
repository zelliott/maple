We have analyzed three independent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that contain coding regions for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso All of the three structural genes were found to be closely linked zzso to other coding zzso The zzso regions did not exceed zzso zzso Nuclear zzso data demonstrated that at least the zzso zzso gene is transcribed in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences described here with several others reported previously for zzso zzso revealed a number of zzso peculiarities for the gene organization of this zzso zzso zzso sequences are not interrupted by zzso zzso zzso untranslated regions are rather short and zzso starts at the consensus sequences zzso or zzso zzso an unusual zzso is located about 30 zzso upstream of the start of zzso and comprises the sequence zzso which reveals protein binding activity as determined by gel zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso motif zzso is found within the relatively short 3' untranslated regions and functions zzso as the zzso termination zzso and zzso a stretch of up to 12 zzso zzso is located at the end of transcribed zzso
