The zzso are a group of zzso molecules that appear to regulate the directed movement of white blood cells in zzso and in zzso and may therefore play important roles in inflammation and zzso The genes zzso the zzso are clustered in close physical proximity to each zzso A large cluster of human zzso zzso genes resides on zzso zzso We have used this information in a zzso cloning approach to identify novel zzso genes within this zzso We constructed a zzso zzso encompassing the zzso zzso symbol zzso gene region and used zzso zzso and sequence analysis to isolate novel zzso zzso Using this approach, a gene zzso a zzso named zzso based on its zzso with zzso zzso identity at the zzso level and zzso at the predicted zzso acid zzso was zzso The zzso gene zzso symbol zzso consists of three zzso spread over zzso zzso and is separated from the zzso gene by 16 zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is expressed in lung and zzso but not in brain or zzso The zzso encodes an zzso protein and includes a predicted signal zzso of 21 zzso zzso zzso or synthetic zzso induced calcium zzso in zzso and activated T zzso zzso in zzso zzso of synthetic zzso into the zzso cavity of mice led to the zzso of both zzso and zzso T zzso but not zzso or zzso These observations provide new information concerning the arrangement of the zzso zzso gene cluster on human zzso 17 and indicate that the zzso gene product is zzso in zzso for both zzso and zzso T zzso and may therefore be implicated in both zzso and zzso zzso
