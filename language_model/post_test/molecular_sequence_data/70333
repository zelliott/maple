The human smooth muscle zzso heavy chain locus zzso was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to the middle of the p arm of zzso 16 using a zzso zzso clone containing coding sequences of the gene as zzso zzso from coding zzso when applied to Southern blots of a panel of hybrids containing different portions of human zzso 16, localized the gene to zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso when used on the DNA from a zzso hybrid clone mapping panel zzso for mouse zzso showed that the gene was located on mouse zzso zzso These results correct a recent assignment of zzso from zzso to the region of the zzso inversion zzso seen in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso and demonstrate that the conflicting data do not result from the presence of additional zzso genes on the zzso arm of the zzso Also, a new region of zzso zzso between human zzso and mouse 16 is zzso
