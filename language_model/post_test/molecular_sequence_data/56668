The zzso of eight triple zzso zzso structures comprised of identical sequence but different zzso zzso or DNA zzso strand combinations were measured by quantitative affinity zzso zzso The differences in equilibrium binding affinities reveal the importance of strand zzso For the sequences studied here, the zzso of complexes containing a zzso third strand D or R and zzso double zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decrease in order: D + zzso R + zzso R + zzso D + DR zzso R + zzso R + zzso zzso D + zzso D + zzso zzso zzso 25 degrees C, 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso and DNA zzso will be useful for targeting zzso double zzso DNA and zzso zzso hybrids if the zzso zzso strand is zzso However, zzso but not DNA, zzso will be useful for zzso binding of zzso double zzso zzso and zzso zzso hybrids if the zzso zzso strand is zzso This has implications for the design of artificial zzso targeted to specific sequences of double zzso zzso and zzso zzso
