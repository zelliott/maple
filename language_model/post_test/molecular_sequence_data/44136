A new zzso zzso was cloned by screening a gene bank from the zzso bacterial strain zzso for colonies with zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso was zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso II from strain zzso with previously published sequences showed the closest relationship to a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso was only zzso related to the main groups of zzso zzso or zzso The zzso was expressed using a zzso expression zzso and the zzso characteristics of the protein were zzso The zzso oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso spectrum of the product formed from zzso with previous reports suggested that this zzso is oxidized by different zzso zzso either by zzso or zzso ring zzso The zzso required zzso for zzso zzso In contrast to most other zzso zzso the zzso consisted of only two identical zzso
