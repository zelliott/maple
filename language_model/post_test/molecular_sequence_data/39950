The fusion proteins of enveloped viruses zzso the fusion between the viral and cellular zzso comprise two zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso located at the zzso of the enveloped zzso The crystal structure of the fusion protein core of zzso virus zzso was determined at zzso A zzso The complex is a zzso bundle in which three zzso peptides form a central highly zzso zzso and three zzso peptides pack against the zzso grooves on the surface of central zzso in an zzso zzso zzso Fusion core of zzso like those of zzso virus 5 and human respiratory zzso virus, forms typical zzso zzso The similar characterization in zzso regions, as well as the existence of zzso motif in extended regions of zzso zzso suggests a basic rule for the formation of the fusion core of viral fusion zzso
