zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to operate the zzso zzso of methane process, an important sink for the greenhouse gas methane in natural zzso In this study, we designed zzso zzso zzso zzso for each of the zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones group within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on previously reported zzso The newly designed zzso were used for the detection of the various groups of zzso in the zzso zzso environmental samples, zzso zzso zzso rice field soils, zzso field sediments and natural gas zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were detected only in a natural gas field sample among the environments examined in this study and were of the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the quantitative real-time zzso analysis using the designed zzso showed that zzso of zzso and zzso were estimated to be zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The newly designed zzso zzso zzso in this study may be useful to survey the distribution and quantitative determination of zzso
