In order to understand the molecular zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and disease development of zzso zzso zzso pathogen in wheat zzso host zzso was isolated from zzso prone susceptible stage of wheat zzso An zzso of zzso gene involved in zzso response and zzso development was isolated from zzso zzso for analyzing its role in zzso zzso The maximum expression of zzso gene was observed at 14th day and decreased zzso To investigate whether the fungus alters the expression levels of same zzso upon interaction with plants, zzso zzso cultures were treated with zzso of host zzso Such treatment induced the expression of zzso gene in time dependent zzso Host zzso treatment tends to increase the zzso in zzso cultures by lowering the zzso zzso zzso in zzso led to impose more zzso levels in the host and prolific zzso of pathogen inside host causing more damage to developing zzso In zzso characterization and zzso interaction studies further suggests that isolated gene showed similarity with zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso might further activate a downstream zzso factor zzso The results of present study clearly suggest that host zzso derived from wheat spikes provide certain zzso which activate zzso gene during zzso development of zzso zzso and affect the zzso growth and zzso In turn it also provides a plausible explanation for zzso specificity of zzso fungus in zzso
