Expansion of the zzso zzso can be divided into zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso layer transforming the zzso into the zzso zzso is completed around day 8 of zzso From that time, the size of the zzso zzso increases tremendously due mainly to the zzso of fluid rather than cell zzso In this study, we have investigated the abundance and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso on days 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 by multiplex reverse zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso During zzso expansion, the zzso of the zzso zzso exhibited zzso abundance of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and membrane and zzso expression of zzso With increasing zzso size its cells showed an extensive enlargement of the zzso membrane surface by zzso From day 14 zzso the zzso zzso zzso forms zzso structures with attaching sites to the zzso layer and shows intensive zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in the membrane as well as in the zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the arrangement of these proteins is comparable with the collecting ducts of kidney with zzso being replaced by the closely related zzso The detection of zzso sites for protein zzso A suggests a similar zzso traffic and regulation as known for zzso in the collecting ducts of the zzso The arrangement of these proteins in zzso zzso indicates at least partially the mechanism of zzso zzso
