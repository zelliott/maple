A zzso analysis of the medicinal plant zzso using the sequences of one zzso zzso zzso and three nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecular zzso was carried out by distance, zzso likelihood, and zzso zzso Three of the four New World species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso initially zzso zzso related to both Old World zzso and New World zzso In Asia, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cluster together and are sister to a zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso zzso than to four other zzso species in our study from China; zzso zzso is closer to the zzso zzso zzso than to the Asian zzso This study provides a genetic method for zzso of economically important zzso species and proposes a robust zzso hypothesis for the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we were able to distinguish zzso zzso from all other species of zzso
