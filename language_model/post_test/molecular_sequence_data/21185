zzso was zzso immobilized on zzso fiberglass zzso based on the zzso reaction between zzso and zzso for efficient zzso zzso in this zzso Prior to use, a piece of the zzso fiber was inserted into the main channel of a microchip under a zzso to form a zzso zzso Because zzso was not permanently immobilized on the channel wall, the novel zzso was zzso Two standard zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by the unique zzso to demonstrate its feasibility and zzso The interaction time between the flowing proteins and the immobilized zzso was evaluated to be less than zzso The peptides in the zzso were identified by zzso zzso to obtain zzso The results indicated that zzso performance of the zzso zzso was better than that of zzso zzso zzso
