The development of new drugs for treating zzso zzso infections in AIDS patients is hampered by the lack of long-term culture systems, and by our generally limited knowledge of this zzso Recently, however, we observed significant activity of various zzso against growth of this zzso in short-term zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso there is strong evidence that the primary target is the zzso zzso To understand the basis for zzso activity against zzso zzso and to examine the apparent zzso of this zzso to zzso we have cloned and zzso the single zzso gene from a rat zzso zzso zzso There was zzso identity at the zzso acid level to zzso from zzso zzso but only zzso identity to zzso and zzso zzso Also, eight zzso were distributed throughout the zzso zzso zzso gene in a pattern characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso previously implicated in zzso sensitivity were zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso chain reaction was used to amplify a segment of zzso zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso obtained from two patients with zzso There was considerable divergence at the DNA level between the human and rat zzso but zzso identity at the zzso zzso
