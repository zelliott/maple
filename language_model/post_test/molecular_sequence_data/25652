The zzso B domain zzso of zzso protein A, which specifically binds to the zzso portion of zzso G zzso has been investigated with the use of two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso All backbone and zzso zzso zzso of FB zzso zzso acid zzso except the zzso zzso resonance of zzso were assigned by the sequential assignment procedures by using zzso correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso data, three zzso regions, zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the free FB in zzso zzso of two of the three zzso regions, zzso and zzso in consistent with the X-ray zzso structure of the zzso FB zzso zzso (1981) zzso 20, zzso By contrast, in the zzso FB as revealed by the X-ray analysis, the zzso segment is extended and no structural information has been available in the zzso zzso We suggest that a significant zzso change is induced in the zzso region of FB when it is bound to the zzso portion of zzso
