zzso is a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human B61 has been identified as the zzso for zzso zzso In order to better understand the roles of zzso zzso zzso in zzso development, we have cloned rat and mouse B61 zzso and examined the expression pattern during rat zzso zzso analysis has revealed that there is a considerable degree of identity among zzso mouse and human B61 zzso between rat and zzso zzso between rat and human in zzso acid zzso zzso of B61 zzso expression by in zzso zzso analysis revealed tight association of B61 with zzso cells at an early stage and zzso cells in various zzso including zzso zzso zzso skin at later stage of zzso In the developing skeletal system, B61 is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso In the developing nervous system, expression of B61 is restricted in the zzso of zzso root zzso These expression profiles of B61 in zzso cells of various zzso developing skeletal system and zzso root zzso match those of zzso Our data suggest that B61 plays pivotal roles in zzso especially zzso and zzso cell zzso
