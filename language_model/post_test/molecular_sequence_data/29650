In this study we determined the complete zzso sequence of zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso coli patient isolate zzso zzso zzso is integrated as a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This integration generates identity segments of zzso and zzso sites with lengths of 11 zzso The integrated zzso zzso has a size of zzso zzso We identified 58 open reading frames zzso each with a length of zzso zzso The deduced proteins of 44 zzso showed significant zzso to other proteins present in sequence databases, whereas 14 putative proteins did zzso For 29 zzso we could deduce a putative zzso Most of these are related to the basic zzso propagation zzso The zzso zzso zzso represents a mosaic composed of genetic elements which are obviously derived from related and unrelated zzso We identified five short zzso sequences of 22 to 151 zzso in the zzso zzso sequence which have also been detected in a couple of other zzso zzso These zzso are located between functional zzso in the zzso zzso and are thought to play a role in genetic zzso Although the overall DNA sequence of zzso zzso is not highly related to other known zzso the data obtained demonstrate a typical zzso zzso zzso
