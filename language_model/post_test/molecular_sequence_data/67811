zzso zzso are unique zzso which contain zzso d as the zzso zzso The zzso diversity of zzso zzso associated with 7 zzso or zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso sponge obtained from the coast of the Republic of zzso was zzso we established a zzso primer set designed to selectively amplify the partial zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso even in DNA samples containing a large amount of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso with this primer set enabled detection of the zzso diversity of zzso zzso All the zzso and sponge samples contained zzso zzso Fourteen zzso that were highly zzso zzso with zzso marina zzso were zzso while only 2 zzso were detected with our previously developed method for detecting zzso The results also revealed that many zzso zzso of zzso zzso were associated with those zzso zzso since a zzso culture of only 1 zzso has been established thus zzso No specific relationship was found among the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso even when sample localities were zzso therefore, these zzso may provide a favorable habitat for zzso zzso rather than hosts showing any specific symbiotic zzso
