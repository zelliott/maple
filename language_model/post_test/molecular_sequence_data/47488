The expression of zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and 9 was examined in biopsy specimens removed from adult and pediatric patients with zzso colitis and Crohn's zzso The aim of this study was to determine if the expression of these zzso was altered between areas of actively inflamed zzso zzso zzso in the same patient and between patients with diseased zzso zzso a control group of zzso 

zzso activity was zzso by zzso using image zzso The identity of the zzso zzso was confirmed by using zzso by comparison with zzso standards, and by Western zzso with specific zzso 

In patients with zzso colitis zzso zzso zzso a significant increase zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity was found in inflamed areas of zzso compared with zzso zzso The levels of activity also were significantly greater zzso zzso zzso in zzso areas of the zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with levels in control patients zzso zzso zzso In Crohn's disease zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso sites were not significantly different but levels of zzso activity at both of these sites were significantly elevated compared with levels in control patients zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 was the most abundantly expressed in the inflamed zzso zzso were confirmed as the likely origin of this zzso 

The abundance and zzso of zzso zzso significantly increases in zzso colitis and Crohn's zzso zzso of these zzso zzso may therefore be of therapeutic value in the treatment of inflammatory zzso zzso
