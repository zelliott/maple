Although it is now well established that a substantial proportion of zzso primates in sub-Saharan Africa harbor zzso no study to date has examined to what extent the various species are naturally zzso In this study, we first describe the development and validation of sensitive and specific zzso zzso detection zzso representing all major known zzso zzso lineages on a panel of zzso zzso from 11 different zzso species with known infection zzso The newly developed zzso were then used to determine zzso prevalence rates in nine zzso species native to zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed widely varying prevalence rates, ranging from an apparent absence of zzso infection in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and agile zzso zzso to prevalence rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso greater zzso zzso northern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso De zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The epidemiology of naturally occurring zzso infections is thus more complex than previously appreciated and the various zzso zzso hosts seem to differ in their zzso to zzso zzso The newly developed zzso should now permit to define with greater accuracy existing zzso reservoirs and associated human zzso zzso
