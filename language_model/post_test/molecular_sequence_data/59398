We have reported a inhibitor of acid zzso in liver zzso and zzso from chickens zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 22, zzso zzso In this paper, the properties of the inhibitor were described in comparison with those of zzso zzso of zzso The zzso inhibitor migrated with the same mobility on zzso as zzso zzso and had a molecular weight of zzso The zzso map from the zzso inhibitor was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso to the acid zzso inhibitor also reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the acid zzso activities of liver zzso and zzso from chickens as strongly as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso inhibitor was identical to that of zzso zzso as far as zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of peptides obtained from the inhibitor by zzso with zzso corresponded to internal sequence of zzso zzso and so the zzso were derived by zzso after the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The findings showed that the inhibitor of the acid zzso in liver zzso and zzso from chickens was identical to zzso zzso
