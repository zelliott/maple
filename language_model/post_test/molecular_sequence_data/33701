The evolution of zzso clocks in land plants is not zzso because zzso rhythms have received little attention in plants other than zzso We have characterized two zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso clock genes zzso from the moss zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso gene family of green plants (including green algae and land zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso showed rhythms with a period of approximately 1 day, phased as are those of zzso zzso under 24 h zzso cycles or in continuous zzso However, in marked contrast to zzso zzso both genes showed zzso profiles in continuous zzso The timing of the zzso peak is determined by the time of the last light to dark transition, suggesting that the zzso in continuous light is due to dysfunction of the core zzso We generated single and double zzso for zzso and zzso and found that the double zzso zzso zzso short zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso rhythm, zzso similar changes in the rhythmically expressed genes zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels, indicating negative feedback zzso These observations indicate that the two genes are not merely structural zzso but also functional counterparts of zzso Together, our results illustrate similarities as well as divergence of the clock zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso placed species in land plant zzso
