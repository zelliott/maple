Based on the sequences of the highly zzso segments in the previously cloned zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from human fetal zzso zzso analysis of the gene has been performed with various zzso cell lines, fetal zzso fetal and adult liver and both zzso and the surrounding tissue from the same zzso The zzso gene was expressed poorly in fetal liver and in adult liver, slightly in zzso and highly in the surrounding tissue of zzso The zzso zzso the putative active domain was expressed in zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso The zzso protein expressed in zzso could zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso No zzso activity was detected with a zzso protein in zzso coli and both zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso These results suggested that correct zzso of the zzso might play a key role in its folding that may be directly related to the zzso zzso
