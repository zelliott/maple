The zzso locus control region zzso is a large DNA element that is required for high-level expression of zzso zzso genes from the zzso mouse locus or in transgenic mice carrying the human zzso zzso The zzso encompasses 6 zzso hypersensitive sites zzso that bind zzso zzso These zzso each contain a core of a few hundred base pairs zzso that has most of the functional activity and exhibits high zzso sequence zzso zzso the zzso are zzso to zzso zzso with weaker functional activity and lower zzso zzso Studies of human zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso locus show that deletion of an entire HS zzso plus zzso moderately suppresses zzso However, human zzso in which only individual HS core regions were deleted showed drastic loss of expression accompanied by changes in zzso zzso To address these disparate results, we have deleted the core region of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was similar to that of the larger zzso zzso with no apparent disruption of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the greater severity of HS core deletions in comparison to full HS deletions is not a general property of the zzso
