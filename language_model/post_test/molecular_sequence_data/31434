zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most important components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It zzso electron transfer from zzso to all known zzso thus plays central roles not only in the metabolism of zzso zzso but also in the regulation of zzso hormones in zzso In this study, a full-length zzso zzso of a zzso (named zzso was isolated from the zzso rice striped stem zzso zzso zzso by using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame, which encodes an zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso has hallmarks of typical zzso including an zzso membrane anchor and the zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso The zzso protein fused with a 6 zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso cells and zzso specific activity and the zzso values of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was investigated by real-time quantitative zzso The zzso zzso was noticeably expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the larvae and adults of zzso zzso Our initial results would provide valuable information for further study on the interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
