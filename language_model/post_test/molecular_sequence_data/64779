zzso is a zzso recognition protein known to control zzso zzso zzso and membrane fusion in sea zzso Previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on zzso zzso acid sequence is found when zzso incompatible species are zzso but not when species are zzso The present study analyzes zzso zzso and divergence in the three closely related species of zzso in Central America: zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the Caribbean, and zzso zzso from the eastern zzso The eggs of zzso zzso have evolved a strong block to zzso by zzso of its zzso zzso whereas those of the other two species have zzso As in the zzso Pacific zzso zzso the zzso species show high zzso zzso zzso in the same gene regions as in the zzso zzso zzso likelihood analysis shows that many of the zzso zzso sites are under mild positive zzso Of the fixed zzso acid zzso most have accumulated along the zzso lineage of zzso zzso We analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and zzso sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages zzso Our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso sites with zzso acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive zzso zzso positive selection zzso egg zzso provides support that zzso evolution of zzso proteins acts to maintain recognition of zzso by changing egg zzso Because both egg zzso and zzso divergence are greater between zzso species than between zzso species, the hypothesis of selection against zzso zzso cannot explain why zzso evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the American zzso Instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species zzso zzso competition, sexual selection, and sexual zzso are more promising explanations for zzso positive selection on zzso
