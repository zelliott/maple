zzso zzso zzso is an important component of the innate immune zzso it binds to zzso structures on zzso zzso resulting in complement zzso and zzso zzso with low zzso levels are at risk of zzso and severe zzso zzso therapy with zzso zzso is a promising treatment of diseases associated with zzso zzso A first-generation zzso product has been shown to be safe and well zzso and patients have benefited from zzso zzso Following is a description of the development of a zzso second-generation zzso product from zzso fraction III, with the use of a new affinity zzso for zzso zzso and the characteristics of this improved zzso 

zzso gels were comparatively screened as affinity zzso zzso was extracted from fraction III, and affinity zzso on a zzso 200 zzso zzso The zzso material underwent two virus reduction steps: zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was further zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The affinity zzso and the final zzso fraction were characterized by protein chemical, zzso and functional zzso 

In production scale, zzso 200 zzso was found to be superior to other zzso zzso and zzso was affinity zzso from fraction III with a yield of zzso The viral safety was increased by performing a zzso of the affinity zzso through zzso zzso with a minimal loss of zzso The purity of the final zzso fraction was zzso excluding the zzso zzso zzso zzso The product consisted of zzso zzso with two dominating forms, and with zzso zzso zzso and 19 zzso zzso protein zzso Only a few protein zzso were present, the major being zzso zzso formed complexes with zzso bridged by zzso zzso attached to the zzso The functional activity, assessed by zzso activity and zzso function, was intact, whereas half of the C4 zzso capacity was lost during the production zzso 

A second-generation zzso process was developed with an average yield of zzso It was possible to zzso the zzso complexes through zzso zzso with only a minor loss resulting in an increased safety profile of this zzso zzso
