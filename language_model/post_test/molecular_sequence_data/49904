The zzso modifications of the 96 zzso protein zzso A from zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso mass zzso The accurate molecular mass of the intact protein revealed a zzso modification causing an additional mass of 42 zzso The modification could be identified as zzso zzso by tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were used to detect the zzso zzso within 54 zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso to the accurate molecular mass of the intact zzso additional zzso modifications could be zzso In addition to the zzso zzso the domain structure of zzso A was determined by applying a combination of limited zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso automated tandem mass zzso and protein database zzso
