The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that is required for zzso zzso zzso Two classes of regulatory zzso R and zzso are required for zzso zzso of zzso and several additional structural zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter were identified using zzso zzso zzso reporter genes zzso into zzso zzso together with R and C1 expression zzso Complete regulation was zzso by 224 zzso of the zzso zzso Within this region at least two zzso regions are independently capable of zzso regulation by R and zzso zzso regulatory elements corresponding to two classes of sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to be important for full R and C1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of reconstructed zzso genes with zzso promoters was zzso using zzso protection, and this analysis confirmed results obtained using reporter zzso
