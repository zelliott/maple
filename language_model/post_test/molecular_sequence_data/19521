Growing evidence indicates that zzso zzso or zzso are involved in basic cell functions and zzso Here we report that zzso has a critical role in determining zzso zzso We observed decreased expression of both zzso and zzso which belong to the same zzso unit, in mouse and human models of cardiac zzso In zzso zzso of zzso or zzso inhibited cardiac zzso In contrast, suppression of zzso by zzso sequences induced zzso which was more pronounced than that after stimulation with conventional zzso of zzso In zzso zzso of zzso by a single infusion of an zzso caused marked and sustained cardiac zzso We identified specific targets of zzso zzso a zzso exchange protein regulating cardiac zzso zzso a signal zzso zzso implicated in zzso and zzso a nuclear factor involved in zzso Our data show that zzso and possibly zzso are key regulators of cardiac zzso suggesting their therapeutic application in heart zzso
