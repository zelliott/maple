zzso from zzso coli is the archetype of a family of zzso zzso found in several zzso groups and has distant zzso in zzso including zzso To facilitate investigation of its molecular zzso we developed methods for expressing an zzso form of zzso both at high levels zzso of the inner membrane zzso in zzso coli and in zzso zzso zzso In zzso coli zzso zzso transported zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with apparent zzso values of approximately zzso zzso and transport was energized primarily by the membrane potential component of the zzso motive zzso Competition experiments in zzso coli and zzso of zzso in zzso confirmed that zzso was a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso using high-level expression in zzso coli and zzso spinning zzso solid-state nuclear magnetic zzso we have for the first time been able directly to measure the binding of the zzso zzso to the protein and to assess its relative mobility within the binding site, under zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to near zzso by metal zzso affinity zzso with retention of transport function in zzso zzso was also zzso zzso transform infrared and circular zzso zzso provided further evidence that the zzso protein retained its zzso zzso and was predominantly zzso in nature, consistent with a proposed structure containing 12 zzso zzso These findings open the way to zzso the molecular mechanism of transport in this key family of membrane zzso
