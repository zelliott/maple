zzso screening of a zzso library produced from liver of the zzso wood frog, zzso zzso was used to search for zzso zzso Five zzso zzso clones representing different genes were isolated when approximately zzso plaques of a zzso library, prepared from liver of frozen frogs (24 h at zzso degrees zzso were screened with zzso total zzso zzso from control (5 degrees zzso versus zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso are reported here in detail and were found to be zzso with the genes for the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The clone zzso carried a zzso zzso sequence that was of zzso structure, containing two open reading frames zzso The first zzso potentially zzso a zzso zzso covering a partial sequence of the zzso region of the zzso The second zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso covering the whole zzso region of the zzso this was highly zzso to the zzso zzso second zzso of chicken zzso and the extended zzso of the human zzso Under control (5 degrees zzso conditions, moderate levels of zzso zzso and zzso were exclusively found in zzso When frogs were given zzso freezing zzso levels of these transcripts in liver were highly zzso zzso of these genes was also elevated in gut and lung during zzso but zzso levels in these zzso were lower than in zzso A time course zzso confirmed that the transcript levels of both zzso and zzso genes were dramatically elevated within the early hours of freezing and reached a maximum zzso increase over control levels after 8 h of freezing zzso Two other zzso zzso whole body zzso and zzso exposure, mimic individual elements of freezing stress in wood zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of both the zzso and zzso was also zzso in response to zzso in zzso zzso of total body water zzso but both were completely inhibited by zzso zzso
