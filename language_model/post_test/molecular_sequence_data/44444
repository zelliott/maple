The zzso and zzso genes of zzso sake, zzso the general zzso of the zzso zzso zzso system zzso were cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso are zzso to the corresponding known zzso of other zzso zzso sequence and zzso analysis showed that the two genes are zzso in a large transcript zzso both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was shown to be independent of the carbon zzso Four zzso zzso were constructed by zzso zzso For all zzso growth on zzso carbohydrates was zzso Surprisingly, the growth rates of zzso on zzso and zzso two carbohydrates which are not transported by the zzso were zzso This unexpected zzso suggests that the zzso zzso controls zzso and zzso zzso in zzso sake by a mechanism different from the regulation involving zzso described for other zzso zzso
