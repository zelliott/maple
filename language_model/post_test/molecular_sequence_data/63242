zzso groundwater discharge to coastal waters can be a significant source of both zzso and biologically limiting zzso zzso cycling across steep zzso in zzso oxygen and dissolved zzso nitrogen in sandy zzso zzso controls both the amount and form of nitrogen discharged to the coastal zzso We determined the effect of these zzso on zzso zzso bacteria zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a subterranean zzso using the functional gene zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso The abundance of zzso was dramatically lower in the freshwater stations compared with saline stations, while zzso abundance remained nearly constant across the study zzso This differing response to zzso altered the ratio of zzso to zzso such that bacterial zzso was 30 times more abundant than zzso zzso at the zzso marine station, but nearly 10 times less abundant at the zzso fresh and brackish zzso As the location of the brackish mixing zone within the zzso shifted from zzso in winter to zzso in summer, the location of the transition from a zzso to an zzso community also zzso demonstrating the intimate link between microbial communities and coastal zzso Analysis of zzso enrichment cultures at a range of zzso revealed that zzso persisted solely in the freshwater zzso where they actively express zzso Diversity (as measured by total zzso of zzso zzso was high at all stations and time points, in sharp contrast to zzso zzso for which only two sequence types were zzso These results offer new insights into the ecology of zzso and zzso by zzso conditions that may zzso the zzso dominance of zzso over zzso in coastal zzso
