zzso is a zzso protein of the zzso zzso We find that zzso is localized to the zzso via a zzso domain that is zzso related to the zzso domain that recruits several zzso proteins to the zzso by binding the small zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso binds to the zzso zzso via this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is lethal in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso and a screen of other zzso showing a similar genetic interaction revealed that zzso targeting of zzso also requires zzso a cargo zzso that cycles between the zzso zzso and zzso The one human protein with a zzso domain, zzso zzso is known to be on the zzso but the zzso region that contains the zzso domain has been reported to bind to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, we find that this region binds to the zzso in a zzso zzso manner, suggesting that zzso may not link the zzso to zzso and zzso
