The small zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in the zzso in a precursor zzso Upon import into the zzso it is zzso processed at a zzso bond to yield the mature form of the zzso To assess the importance of the Met zzso for recognition and processing by the zzso zzso we zzso this zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso The zzso precursor proteins were imported into isolated zzso and the products of the import reactions were zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso at the putative processing site were processed to a single zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that these zzso were processed at the zzso and the zzso bond, zzso After import of the zzso zzso four processed forms of the protein were zzso Analysis of the most abundant one, zzso with the zzso zzso demonstrated that this species was also a product of correct processing, at the zzso zzso All the correctly processed peptides were found to be associated with the zzso of zzso and remained stable within the zzso like the zzso zzso The results of this study, together with previous ones, suggest that proper recognition and processing of the zzso precursor are more affected by zzso zzso to the processing site than by the zzso on the zzso side of this zzso
