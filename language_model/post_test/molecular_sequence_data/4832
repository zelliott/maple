The complete sequence of pig switch zzso zzso zzso and the various zzso of C zzso a total of ca 8 zzso zzso of zzso are presented and comparatively zzso S zzso starts about zzso zzso downstream of the single pig zzso gene and ends zzso zzso upstream of C zzso the length of S zzso is zzso zzso Three major zzso repeats, zzso zzso and zzso comprise more than half of the entire S zzso zzso The two most frequent zzso are zzso and zzso The longest single repeated sequence is 93 base zzso The frequency of the various zzso indicates that pig S zzso is more similar to human S zzso than to mouse S zzso The sequence of zzso pig C zzso and its deduced zzso acid sequence are similar to the C zzso sequences published for other zzso and are most similar to those of zzso another zzso The membrane and zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and are actually identical to those of the zzso The degree of similarity to other zzso zzso generally decreases from the zzso to the zzso terminal zzso with the exception of C zzso 2, which shows the lowest similarity among species zzso DNA, zzso zzso As in human C zzso we identified five potential zzso zzso sites, two zzso involved in forming zzso zzso bonds, and the two additional zzso involved in the linkage of zzso zzso This is only the third species for which a S zzso sequence has been reported but the first from a species lacking the second virgin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice and humans lacks a switch region and its expression depends on the zzso of C zzso zzso with C zzso However, we found no evidence that the lack of C delta influenced the zzso structure of S zzso C zzso or C zzso zzso
