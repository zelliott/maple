Providence virus zzso is a member of the family zzso a family of small, zzso zzso viruses that exclusively zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only known zzso that replicates in tissue zzso We have zzso the zzso and characterized the viral translation products, showing that zzso has a zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso unique to zzso and of unknown zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso stop zzso producing an zzso product of 40 zzso zzso and zzso the zzso protein precursor zzso There are three zzso processing zzso one at the N zzso of zzso zzso and two more zzso and zzso at the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso identified viral translation products corresponding to all three zzso in persistently infected cells and showed that the zzso stop in zzso and zzso in zzso are functional in zzso and these results were confirmed by in zzso translation zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso is zzso most closely related to members of the families zzso and zzso rather than to members of the family zzso The unique zzso organization, zzso control systems and zzso relationship with the zzso of zzso plant viruses lead us to propose that zzso represents a novel family of small insect zzso zzso distinct from current members of the family zzso
