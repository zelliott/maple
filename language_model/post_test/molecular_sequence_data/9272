We determined the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso consisting of zzso base pairs zzso zzso genes for 13 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 22 transfer zzso and a zzso control region as those found in other zzso with the gene order identical to that of typical zzso A major zzso region between the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso was considered to be the control region zzso Within this zzso 22 copies of a zzso tandem repeat element, zzso were identified in the control region unlike previous reported zzso zzso
