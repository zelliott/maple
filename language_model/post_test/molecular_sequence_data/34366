zzso zzso rod shaped virus 2 zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso at extreme temperature zzso and acidity zzso zzso zzso encodes a Holliday junction resolving zzso zzso zzso that has been proposed as a key zzso in zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanism for zzso zzso zzso junction zzso bias, minimal requirements for zzso junction zzso and zzso specificity were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA junctions with a preference for zzso of exchange strand pairs, in contrast to zzso resolving zzso suggesting fundamental differences in zzso recognition and zzso among closely related zzso resolving zzso Unlike other viral resolving zzso such as T4 zzso zzso or zzso zzso I, that cleave zzso DNA replication zzso zzso zzso zzso is specific to zzso DNA junctions and inactive on other zzso DNA zzso In addition, a specific interaction was detected between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso body coat protein zzso Based on this zzso a model is proposed linking zzso zzso zzso resolution to viral particle zzso
