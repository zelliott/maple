We report a zzso promoter zzso array system developed for zzso studies of zzso zzso Designed after the zzso zzso it allows for the direct zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso and/or zzso interactions at a zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso large-scale zzso modifications and zzso activity identified a distinct fingerprint of responses for each zzso zzso zzso (more than zzso zzso compared with vehicle, or complete repression by zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso at the array correlated with its state of zzso which was zzso using a novel high zzso zzso zzso In support of the nuclear zzso zzso model, zzso studies provided direct evidence of very transient zzso zzso and revealed zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso and interactions with zzso influenced both large-scale zzso modeling and zzso recovery zzso These data also showed that the zzso zzso domain was insufficient for array zzso zzso quantitative observations from this zzso relevant zzso suggest zzso dynamics influence gene regulation at the promoter zzso
