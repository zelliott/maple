zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso from zzso to zzso or zzso zzso features underlying their zzso activity and their specificity are still zzso In order to get some insight into the donor zzso recognition, we used a molecular zzso approach on a portion of the zzso site of the bovine zzso Fold recognition methods identified as appropriate templates the bovine zzso and the human zzso A model of the zzso zzso binding site was built into which the zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso fits best in a zzso where the zzso is folded back under the zzso and is maintained in that special zzso through hydrogen bonds with zzso The zzso is found in van der zzso contacts with zzso and zzso The zzso is involved in a stacking interaction with zzso and forms a hydrogen bond with zzso The zzso is found in coordination both with the zzso of zzso and the zzso motif of the zzso zzso acids in contact with zzso in the model have been zzso and the corresponding soluble forms of the zzso expressed in zzso Their kinetic zzso confirm the importance of these zzso acids in donor zzso zzso
