The zzso of the transition protein 2 gene of several zzso species was zzso and the transcript level of this gene was determined by Northern zzso In all species tested so far, a Northern zzso zzso transcript level was associated with the presence of a zzso 8 zzso motif zzso 50 zzso downstream of the stop zzso zzso experiments indicate that this region is capable of binding a zzso protein factor from rat zzso These findings support our hypothesis that the low transcript level of the transition protein 2 gene in human is due to insufficient storage of the zzso as zzso zzso
