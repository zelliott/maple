We describe a novel approach for the isolation of zzso zzso in a vital Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso Our experimental strategy required introduction of an zzso DNA clone zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines, which harbor multiple zzso zzso zzso survive zzso that zzso the zzso zzso locus by virtue of the zzso biological zzso zzso zzso in zzso yield zzso clones that display the zzso zzso zzso A large collection of zzso clones was isolated from one zzso cell line and shown to consist of three types of zzso zzso zzso nonsense zzso zzso in the zzso protein coding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that affect zzso zzso acid zzso that have been zzso zzso during zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso that results in a new, functional zzso zzso zzso
