zzso zzso is central in zzso gene expression in zzso Identification of novel zzso targets in specific zzso provides a basis for their use as zzso of disease occurrence and zzso We developed an in zzso strategy to globally identify potential targets of promoter zzso in prostate cancer by screening for zzso zzso islands in zzso genes that were reported as zzso in prostate zzso A virtual archive of 338 potential targets of zzso was zzso One candidate, zzso was selected for investigation, along with zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso target in prostate zzso zzso of zzso was detected by quantitative zzso zzso in zzso primary prostate zzso and zzso adjacent zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso but in only zzso benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso normal adjacent prostate zzso which implies that zzso of zzso may be involved in the early stages of prostate cancer zzso zzso of zzso was only detected in samples that also demonstrated zzso of zzso and was also correlated with zzso score zzso or zzso zzso indicating that it has potential as a zzso zzso In addition, pharmacological zzso induced strong expression of zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso Our concept of a zzso candidate gene bank was successful in identifying a novel target of frequent zzso in zzso prostate zzso zzso of further relevant genes could contribute towards a zzso signature of this zzso
