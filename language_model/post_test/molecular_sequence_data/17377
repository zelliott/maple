The zzso zzso gene cluster zzso zzso from two strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the respective pig clusters revealed 14 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and 15 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In each zzso species, predicted gene products showed similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Red proteins of zzso zzso zzso Comparisons between the two zzso pig clusters and the red cluster from zzso zzso zzso revealed some important zzso A modified scheme for the zzso of zzso based on the zzso recently suggested for the synthesis of zzso is zzso The distribution of the pig cluster within several zzso zzso zzso is demonstrated and the presence of cryptic clusters in some strains zzso The pig cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso is flanked by zzso and zzso zzso and this zzso is demonstrated in several zzso zzso zzso whilst these genes are zzso in strains lacking the pig zzso
