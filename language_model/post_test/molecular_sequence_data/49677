The evolutionary conservation of T zzso zzso bearing zzso receptors zzso using zzso zzso is indicative of unique zzso zzso natural killer T zzso cells that express an zzso zzso zzso chain have been implicated in microbial and zzso responses, as well as in zzso Here we show that T cells that express the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso are zzso located in the gut zzso zzso of humans and mice, respectively, and are therefore genuine zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso and/or expansion of this population requires B zzso as zzso cells are absent in zzso patients and zzso In addition, we show that zzso cells are selected and/or restricted by zzso a zzso major zzso complex class zzso zzso that is markedly zzso in diverse zzso zzso zzso cells are not present in zzso mice, indicating that zzso zzso is required for their expansion in the gut zzso zzso This indicates that zzso cells are probably involved in the host response at the site of pathogen entry, and may regulate zzso zzso zzso
