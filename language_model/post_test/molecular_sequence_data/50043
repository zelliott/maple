The zzso of the high affinity zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso and binding of the zzso zzso The human zzso gene possesses two zzso the zzso promoter, which is highly zzso with that of zzso and the zzso promoter, the structure and role of which are largely zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso promoter was investigated in this zzso zzso reporter zzso revealed critical region for zzso activity located within zzso zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso as zzso factors binding to this zzso In contrast to the zzso promoter, which was zzso by zzso and zzso these zzso factors exhibited repressive function on this zzso zzso of zzso caused a marked increase in zzso from the zzso promoter and subsequently increased the zzso production of the zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of the human zzso was due to enhancement of zzso promoter activity and suggests that the two promoters have different regulatory mechanisms for zzso zzso
