The zzso zzso is a zzso primarily zzso group of short zzso element zzso zzso that have integrated throughout the human zzso In this study, we have zzso screened the draft sequence of the human zzso for zzso zzso zzso members present on zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso zzso members have integrated into human zzso The average ages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are estimated as zzso zzso and zzso million years, zzso In order to determine the contribution of the zzso zzso to human zzso diversity, zzso zzso were zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso which amplify the zzso regions containing individual zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 percent of the zzso zzso elements are zzso for zzso zzso in the human zzso Fewer than zzso percent of the zzso zzso also demonstrate insertions at zzso positions in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of these unusual zzso demonstrates that each of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains older Y, zzso and zzso zzso family members that have been altered, through various mechanisms, into zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso members are largely restricted to the human zzso The high copy number, level of zzso zzso and estimated age indicate that members of the zzso zzso elements will be useful in a wide range of genetic zzso
