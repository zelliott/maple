zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso member of the zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso mediates many zzso processes in the nervous zzso Here we present the zzso characterization and the binding properties of the least structurally defined part of this zzso its zzso tail zzso We have shown by zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering experiments that it is mostly zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We have defined by nuclear magnetic resonance the molecular details of zzso binding to two major zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso mediator, zzso Surprisingly, in addition to the two previously identified zzso binding zzso the zzso and the zzso regions, we have discovered a third one, a part of which has been previously associated with binding to another zzso zzso For the zzso interaction with zzso we have determined the precise interaction region surrounding the zzso binding site and that this zzso with the second zzso binding zzso In addition, we have shown that the zzso region of zzso has some binding affinity to zzso although the specificity of this interaction needs further zzso These data indicate that zzso belongs to the class of zzso zzso zzso zzso flexibility of zzso might play an important role in dynamic regulation of zzso zzso the ability of zzso tails to accommodate different targets has the potential to fine-tune signal zzso via cell surface zzso
