zzso of zzso zzso which were isolated from symptomatic patients and which possess a characteristic zzso zzso pattern zzso have zzso circular DNA molecules containing zzso genes and clusters of zzso reiterated zzso zzso The zzso sequence of comparable reiterated zzso elements present in zzso with zzso zzso differs from that found in zzso zzso By using the zzso chain reaction, it was demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso also contains one or few of the zzso repeated DNA zzso elements characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso with the zzso probe after in zzso zzso Because of technical difficulties, it was impossible to resolve whether single copies of the zzso zzso repetitive elements are present in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that in the zzso zzso the signal to start amplifying the zzso elements may be induced during the process of elimination of bacterial associates from their growth zzso
