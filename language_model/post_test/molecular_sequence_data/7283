A case of zzso syndrome in a male is zzso with some features of the condition in his carrier mother and her zzso It is proposed that zzso syndrome might be a zzso gene syndrome mapping to zzso zzso 

The zzso had zzso cataract zzso and dental abnormalities including zzso shaped zzso and evidence of zzso pitting zzso The region zzso also contains the tooth zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 

Using molecular genetic techniques, we have shown that there is no evidence that the zzso gene is deleted in this case of the zzso zzso
