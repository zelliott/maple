Human blood group O plasma was found to contain an zzso which zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to Gal beta zzso Gal beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and Gal beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso but not to Gal beta zzso The zzso required zzso for its activity and showed a pH optimum at zzso The reaction products were readily zzso by zzso and released zzso zzso zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso 69, 20, and zzso zzso zzso Studies on zzso zzso competition indicated that all the zzso zzso mentioned above compete for one zzso whereas the zzso can be distinguished from an zzso alpha zzso zzso which also occurs in human zzso The zzso study of the product formed by the transfer of zzso to zzso revealed that zzso had been transferred to the zzso position of the zzso zzso Although the zzso beta zzso structure is known to have the blood group P zzso activity, human plasma showed no zzso activity of Gal alpha zzso zzso which is involved in the synthesis of the major P zzso zzso zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso the zzso beta zzso beta zzso structure is zzso by the novel Gal beta zzso zzso
