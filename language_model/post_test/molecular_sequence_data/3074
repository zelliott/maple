Because of its central role in pathological zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso has become a major target for zzso zzso We report here the construction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso binding zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso are present at one pole of the zzso whereas the other pole carries domain swap zzso which prevent binding to either zzso As zzso can only bind to zzso zzso it does not lead to signal zzso Moreover, it zzso zzso and possibly other members of the zzso family, which are zzso and zzso zzso We show here that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso proliferation and tissue factor induction in zzso cell cultures, requiring only a zzso and a zzso zzso respectively, to block the activity of zzso zzso A zzso excess of zzso over zzso was also sufficient to abrogate vascular zzso as determined in the Miles zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited fetal bone zzso in an ex zzso zzso Thus, zzso blocks zzso and zzso zzso activities that are crucial in the zzso process and is therefore a promising, zzso compound in the treatment of zzso zzso
