The soluble members of the zzso protein zzso all share a relatively simple zzso structure, yet perform radically different zzso zzso modulating factor zzso a zzso protein produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new and unusual member of this zzso It affects female zzso when delivered to the zzso zzso during zzso As with other zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a specialized male mental zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso however, zzso is also expressed at low levels in the skin, liver, zzso and zzso of both zzso The zzso sequences obtained from all tissue types were highly zzso with 103 unique zzso identified which averaged zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso at the protein zzso Despite this variation, however, all zzso sequences contained a zzso approximately zzso zzso signal sequence and a pattern of eight zzso that is also found in zzso and short zzso from snake zzso as well as zzso from zzso Although they share a common zzso pattern, zzso zzso differ from other zzso proteins in: zzso zzso composition outside of the zzso zzso zzso length of the three distinguishing zzso zzso net charge at neutral zzso Whereas most zzso proteins have a net positive charge at pH zzso zzso has a high net negative charge at neutral pH zzso range of most zzso zzso zzso comparisons suggest that zzso belongs to a distinct zzso zzso within the zzso protein zzso
