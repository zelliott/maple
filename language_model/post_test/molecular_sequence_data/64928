Gene zzso followed by positive zzso selection is an important evolutionary event at the molecular level, by which a gene can gain new zzso Such an event might have occurred in the evolution of scorpion sodium channel toxin genes zzso and zzso To test this hypothesis, a robust statistical method from Yang and co-workers based on the zzso of the zzso rate ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The results provide clear statistical evidence for zzso molecular evolution of scorpion zzso and zzso zzso A good match between the positively selected sites zzso zzso and the putative zzso surface zzso zzso indicates that these sites are most likely involved in functional recognition of sodium zzso Our results also shed light on the importance of the zzso in the functional diversification of scorpion zzso and zzso
