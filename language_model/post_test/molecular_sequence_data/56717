Here we report a striking effect displayed by zzso zzso which consist of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to each other upon zzso to a DNA zzso Such a combination of zzso is found to prime DNA sequencing reactions zzso unlike either of the zzso zzso We attribute this effect in part to the increase in the affinity of an zzso for the template in the presence of an adjacent zzso All possible zzso (or zzso sequences total zzso (or zzso samples, a manageable size for a zzso zzso This approach can replace the synthesis of zzso which is the current bottleneck in time and cost of the primer walking sequencing, and can allow full automation of the closed cycle of zzso
