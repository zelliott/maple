zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso rust disease of southern zzso in the United zzso This disease is characterized by the formation of woody branch and stem zzso zzso display was used to identify pine genes whose expression is altered by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infection and to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that are expressed in zzso rust zzso Six pine zzso that appeared to be zzso expressed in zzso and healthy stems and 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso were zzso A probe that zzso specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate that zzso of the total zzso in zzso rust zzso was from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This finding was used to zzso gene expression levels in zzso when comparing them to expression levels in zzso zzso or in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso According to Northern analysis and reverse zzso zzso analysis, all six of the pine clones were expressed at lower levels in zzso than in healthy zzso Seven of the nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones that were zzso were expressed at higher levels in zzso than in zzso zzso A number of the zzso zzso proteins that are similar to those that play roles in plant development, plant defense, or zzso stress zzso
