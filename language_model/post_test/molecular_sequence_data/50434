The zzso of the zzso zzso red zzso zzso zzso presents in some respects an organization that is intermediate between those of the zzso counterparts found in zzso (the putative zzso zzso and more advanced, zzso red zzso This suggests evolutionary relationships that we investigated at the zzso zzso The present work describes the sequences of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso genes zzso the alpha and beta zzso of zzso the major component of the zzso antennae and one of the most abundant cellular proteins in these zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from both zzso and zzso present strong zzso with those previously reported for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The main difference with the corresponding zzso genes was the unexpected occurrence of an intervening sequence that split zzso into two zzso This intervening sequence presents characteristics of group II zzso but lacks several structural zzso zzso analyses showed that the two zzso genes are zzso and that the major zzso species detected zzso to a mature zzso lacking the zzso As the zzso form a group of closely related zzso in zzso and zzso the molecular events affecting the corresponding zzso such as the zzso zzso may be a clue to zzso some aspects of the molecular processes involved in the evolution of zzso zzso
