zzso proteins that are zzso truncated due to incomplete zzso or the presence of rare zzso are extended by an zzso tag during zzso rescue in a zzso process important for maintaining protein zzso In zzso coli, the zzso proteins become the target of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that degradation of model zzso proteins in zzso zzso depends primarily or exclusively on zzso in zzso In addition, we show the zzso coli zzso tag is also a target of zzso zzso zzso in zzso even though the zzso portions of the tags differ significantly between the two species, suggesting there may be no zzso protein for zzso in zzso zzso
