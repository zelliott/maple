zzso zzso plays a very important role during development and its zzso may heavily undermine the zzso potential of bovine zzso Because of limited resources of the cow zzso bovine zzso zzso both in normal development and in zzso cell nuclear transfer zzso zzso is not well zzso DNA zzso is thought to be a major factor for the establishment of zzso zzso In our study, we determined the zzso status of differential zzso regions zzso of four imprinted genes in four spontaneously aborted zzso fetuses zzso zzso abnormal zzso imprints were observed in each individual to different zzso In particular, zzso and zzso were either seriously zzso or showed zzso zzso patterns in four aborted clones we tested, but zzso and zzso exhibited relatively better maintained zzso status in zzso and zzso zzso two aborted zzso zzso and zzso exhibited severe zzso zzso imprints of four imprinted zzso Finally, zzso showed strong zzso zzso patterns of its zzso in normal zzso adult zzso but largely variable zzso levels and relatively homogeneous zzso patterns in aborted cloned zzso Our data indicate that the aborted cloned fetuses exhibited abnormal zzso zzso to different extent, in aborted zzso which partially account for the higher abortion and zzso abnormalities during bovine zzso
