The structural genes for the zzso zzso zzso 1071 zzso in zzso zzso zzso 309 were zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso 309 differed by two zzso acids from the zzso reported for zzso zzso zzso 1071 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van der zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000), while the zzso gene zzso identical peptides in these zzso However, zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso 1071 showed that the zzso zzso sequence reported previously was incorrect in two zzso zzso Also, zzso in zzso zzso zzso 309 zzso a zzso that was three zzso acids shorter than that previously reported for zzso zzso zzso 1071 zzso A zzso immunity gene zzso was located downstream of the zzso structural zzso This gene was cloned into the zzso host zzso zzso zzso zzso and was shown to zzso zzso A truncated ABC zzso gene was located upstream of the zzso structural zzso
