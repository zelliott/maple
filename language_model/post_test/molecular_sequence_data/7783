zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor and forms a novel protein family together with another member, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone isolated from zzso zzso specifies for the zzso counterpart of zzso zzso and the mode of zzso expression was studied by in zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso zzso was first expressed at stage 11 zzso zzso and was located in the neural zzso at stage 12 zzso zzso Through stage 13 to 15 zzso zzso zzso expression was restricted to the neural zzso At stage 23 zzso zzso zzso was predominantly localized in the brain and neural zzso At the zzso stage, zzso expression was again zzso observed in the brain, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the spinal cord, all of which are derivatives of the neural tube, as well as in the zzso zzso derivatives of the zzso neural zzso Comparing the mode of zzso expression between zzso and the zzso we propose that zzso plays zzso zzso roles in zzso and development of the zzso architecture of zzso zzso We also found that zzso was expressed in various adult zzso strong expression was observed in the brain, the eye and the spinal cord, all of which showed intense zzso expression at the zzso zzso
