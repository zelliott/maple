zzso X zzso was obtained as low molecular weight preparations from a late stage 2 zzso digest of human zzso The zzso zzso zzso which resulted in impaired zzso were further zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The zzso were examined by zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso more zzso bands were observed on zzso in the reduced state than in zzso zzso Both zzso contained a similar number of internal zzso in the A zzso B beta and gamma zzso which are linked by zzso zzso Thus, the partial deficiencies in zzso sites of the zzso terminal region of the gamma chain and the zzso terminal portions of the B beta chain, as well as internal zzso were considered to participate in the impairment of the zzso zzso of zzso
