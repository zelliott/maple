The zzso active sites of each of the two isolated zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli have been characterized in order to understand their zzso mechanisms and their functions in zzso In each of the folded zzso as in other proteins of the zzso family, only one of the zzso zzso of the active site sequence zzso is accessible, and its zzso group is highly zzso and has a low zzso zzso The zzso and zzso have been measured of the reactions between the active site zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso bond can be formed very rapidly between the pair of zzso zzso of each domain, but each zzso bond is very unstable and zzso rapidly with reduced zzso The very low zzso of these zzso bonds, which destabilize the protein structures, account for the efficiency with which zzso and each of the isolated zzso can introduce zzso bonds into zzso These zzso and equilibrium data go far in helping to understand the zzso mechanism of zzso and its individual zzso
