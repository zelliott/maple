The zzso virus protein U zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that probably possesses an zzso zzso membrane anchor and a zzso zzso Because of an as yet undefined zzso effect and the low concentration of zzso in host cells, it has not been possible to obtain sufficient quantities of this protein for zzso and structural zzso We describe the zzso in two forms, of zzso peptides representing the polar zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence of zzso strain zzso from position zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso with replacement of zzso with zzso This zzso affects the two zzso sites of zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso zzso in zzso zzso The peptides were zzso to zzso and characterized by zzso sequencing, mass zzso and zzso Furthermore, both peptides were zzso characterized by Western zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human zzso caused in zzso zzso of zzso but had no effect on the zzso zzso Investigation of the peptides by circular zzso showed that addition of zzso stabilized the zzso secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicated that, in the presence of zzso both peptides in solution have stable secondary structures with considerable zzso zzso
