The outer membrane zzso A zzso of zzso has been proposed to span the membrane 14 times as zzso zzso zzso thereby exposing seven zzso to the cell zzso We have employed the zzso zzso method to probe the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso First, zzso zzso were introduced at various positions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to create unique zzso zzso These zzso sites were subsequently used to insert zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Proper assembly of all zzso proteins was revealed by their heat zzso in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The accessibility of the inserted zzso was zzso zzso analysis of intact cells with zzso against the inserted zzso showed that three of seven predicted zzso are indeed cell surface zzso zzso accessibility experiments verified the cell surface exposure of two additional zzso and provided support for the proposed zzso zzso of three predicted zzso For two other predicted exposed zzso the results were not zzso These results support to a large extent the proposed zzso model of zzso Furthermore, the observation that the zzso zzso and zzso virtually abolished zzso activity indicates that these zzso might play a major role in zzso
