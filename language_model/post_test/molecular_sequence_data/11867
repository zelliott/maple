Recent clinical studies indicate that zzso is important for bone zzso Patients with zzso zzso exhibit decreased bone density, and zzso substitution increases bone density in these zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of zzso receptors and the effects of zzso on cultured human zzso zzso zzso cultures of human zzso cells were established from zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, using a probe recognizing zzso 10 of the human zzso zzso revealed a zzso transcript corresponding to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as determined by zzso protection zzso approximately one fourth of the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels found in zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso revealed a single class of receptors with approximately 2000 binding sites per cell and an association constant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the cultured cells resulted in increased zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso receptors are zzso In zzso the present study shows that cultured human zzso cells express functional zzso zzso
