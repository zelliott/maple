The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are able to grow around pH 0 at up to 65 degrees C, thus they represent the most zzso organisms zzso Several features that may contribute to the zzso survival strategy of zzso zzso were deduced from analysis of its zzso zzso zzso zzso has the smallest zzso among zzso zzso zzso growing on organic zzso and simultaneously the highest coding density among zzso An exceptionally high ratio of secondary over zzso primary transport systems demonstrates that the high zzso concentration in the surrounding medium is extensively used for transport zzso Certain genes that may be particularly supportive for the extreme lifestyle of zzso zzso appear to have been zzso into the zzso of the zzso lineage by horizontal gene transfer from zzso and zzso Finally, it is noteworthy that the zzso from zzso distant branches of the zzso apparently share an unexpectedly large pool of zzso
