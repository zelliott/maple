The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso from zzso coli has been determined by X-ray zzso at zzso A zzso This zzso zzso converts the zzso zzso into the corresponding zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso Being a zzso with zzso Da per zzso zzso zzso is the largest structurally known zzso zzso The zzso shows neither sequence nor structural similarity with other zzso zzso The zzso obeys D3 symmetry and forms the zzso zzso zzso The strict and favorably oriented local symmetry allowed for a zzso phase extension from zzso A to zzso A zzso The structure was solved with an zzso zzso bound to the zzso center such that the zzso groups at positions 1 and 2 are zzso of the zzso zzso Most zzso zzso mimics a bound zzso zzso in its open chain zzso The protein environment suggests strongly that the reaction belongs to the zzso zzso
