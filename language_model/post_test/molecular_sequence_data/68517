Both high molecular weight zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso are potent tight binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso but the molecular basis for the zzso function is not well zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso domain 2 from human and rat zzso were compared for zzso with the zzso zzso from human and rat domain 3 and from domain 2 of rat zzso and two areas of zzso differences were zzso Computer three-dimensional models were constructed on a template built using the zzso zzso data for zzso an evolutionary precursor of zzso Two zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso flank the highly zzso motif zzso to form a continuous surface for interaction with zzso zzso Three zzso zzso components of the modeled surface, were chosen for synthesis from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso This last zzso differs from the natural sequence by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were folded by air zzso of their zzso zzso and then tested for their ability to inhibit zzso and zzso The folded zzso zzso inhibited zzso with an zzso 35 zzso and unfolding reduced this zzso The folded zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso but when zzso with zzso could block the zzso by zzso indicating a probable zzso binding zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso but could inhibit zzso with an zzso of 20 zzso We have thus defined separate binding and zzso sequences on zzso which form a zzso surface for zzso zzso zzso
