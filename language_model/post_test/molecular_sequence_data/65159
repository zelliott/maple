zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso In humans, deficiencies in the zzso lead to zzso zzso a rare disease that is fatal in the first year of zzso Such inherited deficiencies can result from zzso in the zzso structural gene or from zzso that impair the acquisition of zzso Recently, a human gene of unknown function, zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hudson, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso zzso zzso are widespread in bacteria, zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso a zzso defective in the zzso zzso zzso was unable to grow on zzso and zzso compounds because of the inability to convert zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that this zzso is not due to the absence of zzso but due to an inactive form of zzso zzso The presence of active zzso in double zzso defective in zzso and in the synthesis of either zzso or zzso indicates that zzso is necessary for protection of zzso from zzso during zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso were cloned and zzso in their active zzso We demonstrated that zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso and stimulates in zzso zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso functions to protect zzso zzso from irreversible zzso
