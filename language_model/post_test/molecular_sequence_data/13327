The zzso zzso is characterized by zzso affinity for substance P and zzso zzso affinity for other substance zzso zzso including zzso B and zzso We have characterized a zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso substitution in the fifth zzso zzso This zzso zzso binds substances P with zzso affinity but loses much of its zzso discrimination zzso exhibiting 1-2 zzso binding affinity for other zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding indicate that the increased binding affinity of zzso B and zzso for the zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso is due to a zzso increase in the association rate constant without appreciable change in the zzso rate zzso The substantially increased association rate constant for the zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso is probably more flexible in accommodating the approaching zzso zzso It is proposed that a major zzso of zzso specificity for the zzso zzso zzso is the overall zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso rather than zzso interactions with the divergent zzso zzso of different zzso Furthermore, the highly zzso nature of zzso in the G protein coupled zzso family suggests that this zzso may also play an important role in the zzso zzso process in zzso
