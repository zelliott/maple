A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso which was isolated from the deep sea zzso of the Atlantic Ocean using zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso positive and zzso negative, zzso in shape, and zzso by polar zzso Growth was observed at zzso of zzso % and at temperatures of zzso zzso The isolate was capable of zzso zzso but unable to reduce nitrate to zzso or degrade zzso 80 or zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso with highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso The principal fatty acids were zzso In Feature 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The respiratory zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso (75 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso and zzso were zzso The strain was zzso zzso and zzso The combined zzso and zzso data show that strain zzso represents a novel species within a novel zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
