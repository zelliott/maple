The bacterial zzso zzso consists of a group of zzso zzso pathogens which produces abortion and zzso in animals and a chronic debilitating zzso illness in zzso zzso is a basic protein of zzso zzso that belongs to a highly zzso group of zzso proteins of unknown structure and function in zzso zzso In this study, we report the structural and zzso characterization of this zzso We found that zzso has two structural zzso a zzso zzso domain through which the protein zzso as a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain which has propensity to adopt an zzso zzso zzso This zzso unfolded domain zzso a structural zzso from unfolded to zzso in the presence of high zzso strength, zzso zzso detergents, and zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso promotes in zzso membrane zzso These results contribute to the zzso of the structural and functional properties of this protein and its zzso present in most zzso
