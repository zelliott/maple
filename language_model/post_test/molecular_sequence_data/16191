The zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso is a zzso which first appears in the zzso stage soon after tip formation and is selectively expressed on zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes an zzso sequence which is highly enriched in zzso over zzso cells in the zzso zzso We have determined 81 zzso acid zzso of zzso sequence from zzso zzso protein and shown this sequence to be identical to the predicted sequence of the zzso zzso There are several short repeat elements close to the C zzso and unequal zzso within these is proposed to account for the size zzso observed in zzso protein isolated from different zzso zzso zzso The repeats are zzso rich and show similarity to the zzso region of the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso contact sites zzso The extreme C zzso which is also zzso to contact sites A, is characteristic of proteins attached to the plasma membrane via a zzso zzso We have marked the zzso gene by zzso of an zzso zzso an zzso of the human zzso zzso A construct containing this gene and 990 base pairs of zzso region directed correct zzso and spatial zzso zzso We found the marked zzso zzso detected with the human zzso zzso to be correctly localized on the surface of zzso
