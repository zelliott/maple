Recently, we reported the partial characterization of bovine lens intrinsic membrane proteins having apparent zzso derived molecular mass of 19, 21, and 23 zzso and determined that they contained identical zzso terminal zzso acid sequences for the first 20 zzso zzso From this zzso acid sequence information, a mixed synthetic zzso was constructed and used to screen a calf lens zzso zzso zzso library in order to isolate and characterize the zzso coding for this membrane zzso Two separate zzso clones were isolated and zzso and were found to have an identical sequence of zzso bases with an open reading frame coding for a zzso of 173 zzso zzso having a molecular mass of zzso zzso The first 20 zzso acids of the translated sequence were identical to that determined by our laboratory zzso and the last seven zzso acids were identical to that recently determined by another laboratory from analysis of the extracted zzso indicating that this zzso is the authentic zzso coding for zzso
