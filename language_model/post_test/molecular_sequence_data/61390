Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene in the i locus of the zzso fish zzso zzso have zzso been zzso all being associated with zzso element zzso We have recently identified another zzso causing a complete zzso zzso in zzso carriers and named it zzso zzso comparison between the zzso gene for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene previously obtained zzso revealed three deletions of 8, 44, and 245 zzso The first two deletions reside in an zzso and are differences in the number of tandem zzso repeats that are zzso even among zzso zzso and, thus, not likely to be responsible for the zzso zzso zzso The largest deletion spans over the last 180 zzso of the second zzso and the first 65 zzso of the third zzso Because of this zzso the zzso gene lacks the branch point sequence and the zzso site for the second zzso both being considered to be necessary for normal zzso zzso zzso the zzso deletion is likely to be responsible for the zzso zzso With a zzso gene of this type, unlike ones bearing zzso element zzso the possibility of zzso zzso to the zzso would be zzso zzso fish having the zzso zzso should serve as superior recipients for the zzso gene in rescue zzso
