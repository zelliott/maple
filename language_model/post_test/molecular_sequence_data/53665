The putative zzso sensor zzso is characterized by a large, zzso domain of about 400 zzso zzso which is not found in any other known sensor zzso zzso of 12 zzso sequences from various zzso reveals that this part of the zzso is highly zzso and includes two motifs zzso A and Walker zzso that are very similar to the classical zzso sites of zzso zzso By means of zzso labeling with zzso direct evidence was obtained for the existence of an zzso site located in the zzso domain of zzso The zzso domain, zzso was zzso and zzso Although predicted to be zzso it was found to be zzso and could be zzso either by treatment with buffer of low zzso strength or zzso The zzso form, but not the zzso one, retained the ability to bind zzso Previously, it was shown that the zzso activity of a truncated zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrated that this effect was reversed in zzso containing both the truncated zzso and the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso restored signal zzso in zzso These results highlight the importance of the zzso domain for the function of zzso and provide evidence for an interaction of this domain and the zzso domain of the sensor zzso
