The nuclear zzso gene from zzso zzso is necessary for translation of a single zzso zzso that encodes zzso III of zzso c zzso We report here the cloning and zzso sequence of zzso and properties of the predicted protein product, which consists of 242 zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso confirms that the zzso coding region is translated in zzso and indicates that the zzso protein product is targeted to zzso A 117 zzso domain located in the zzso half of the zzso zzso at least part of which is shown by characterization of zzso to be critical for zzso function, exhibits zzso identity and 59% similarity to a portion of the zzso domain of zzso coli zzso zzso However, zzso zzso are not defective in zzso translation per se, as would be expected if zzso zzso a zzso zzso Instead, the zzso protein may carry out one or more activities in common with zzso zzso such as binding of zzso or zzso
