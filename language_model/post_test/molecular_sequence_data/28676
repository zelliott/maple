Nuclear zzso number 2 zzso is a positive zzso DNA binding zzso factor for gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso To further understand the mechanisms of zzso function, we used expression cloning to identify zzso interacting with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso which contains an zzso and zzso region and a nuclear zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso and is zzso zzso The zzso of interaction in zzso and in zzso between zzso and zzso were mapped by a zzso zzso system and zzso zzso In zzso cell culture, zzso expressed zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso functions as a zzso and interacts specifically with zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso is thus potentially a negative zzso of zzso zzso is identical to zzso an integral membrane protein essential for protein zzso onto the zzso These studies have identified a novel, zzso protein capable of acting as a zzso zzso and a zzso transport zzso They also suggest that zzso may function both positively and zzso in the zzso regulation of specific zzso and zzso zzso
