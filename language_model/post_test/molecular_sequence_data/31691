zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso with remarkable pharmacological activity, whose route of zzso is still fully zzso zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso regulating zzso zzso and the aim of this study is to explain the relationship between patterns of the gene expression and zzso content through studying zzso gene expression patterns combined with zzso content in various parts of zzso zzso 

Through zzso and zzso the full length of zzso was cloned and analyzed by fluorescent quantitative zzso The zzso content in zzso was analyzed by zzso 

The full-length gene sequence was 1 zzso zzso zzso 405 zzso zzso Software analysis found that the DNA sequence was zzso similarity with zzso plant zzso zzso Fluorescence quantitative analysis showed that zzso had the highest expression level in leaves, far higher than that in zzso stem and zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso was the highest in leaves, followed by the flowers and zzso zzso was not detected in zzso 

zzso analysis showed that zzso expression amount and zzso content in different parts of zzso zzso is positive correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso it suggests that zzso gene expression level has important effect on zzso of zzso
