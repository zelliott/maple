A dual affinity fusion concept has been developed in which the gene zzso the desired product is fused between two zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using sequential zzso and serum zzso affinity zzso a full-length zzso fusion protein is zzso This approach was used to recover a full-length fusion product in zzso coli containing the human zzso growth factor II zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso showed increased stability against zzso degradation in zzso coli when produced as a dual affinity fusion zzso as compared to an zzso fusion zzso After zzso zzso of the zzso fusion zzso zzso molecules with zzso and zzso binding activity were obtained without zzso zzso The results demonstrate that proteins can fold into biologically active structures, even if provided with large zzso zzso protein zzso The concept was further used to characterize the specific degradation of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
