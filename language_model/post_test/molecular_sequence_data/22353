Human zzso zzso zzso A virus zzso the zzso agent of acute zzso barely grows in cell culture and in the process accumulates attenuating and cell zzso zzso This genetic instability of zzso zzso in cell culture is a major roadblock to studying zzso zzso and producing live vaccines that are not overly attenuated for zzso To develop a robust cell culture system capable of supporting the efficient growth of zzso zzso we zzso different cell lines with in zzso zzso transcripts of zzso zzso containing the zzso resistance zzso zzso colonies grew only in zzso zzso cells and produced infectious zzso zzso was genetically stable in zzso cells for at least nine serial passages and did not accumulate attenuating or cell zzso zzso Treatment with alpha zzso zzso cured the zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso The cured cells, termed zzso cells, did not contain virus or zzso zzso and were sensitive to zzso zzso cells were more zzso than parental cells for zzso zzso infection, including a natural isolate from a human stool sample, and produced zzso infectious zzso This is the first report of a cell line that allows the genetically stable growth of human zzso zzso The viral zzso and cells described here should allow better insight into the zzso of zzso and the development of attenuated zzso The cell lines susceptible to zzso zzso growth may also be used to detect and isolate infectious virus from patient and environmental zzso
