The interaction of the intermediate filament protein zzso and its zzso zzso with zzso and zzso small zzso zzso was investigated by measuring zzso zzso fusion, and zzso While the zzso suppressed zzso fusion of zzso zzso it caused their rapid zzso in the absence of zzso at a zzso ratio of zzso to zzso of zzso the zzso complexes zzso from the reaction zzso This zzso was efficiently diminished by zzso The zzso zzso on the other hand, became leaky when interacting with the zzso of zzso even at a zzso ratio of zzso to zzso of zzso The leakage of zzso zzso was suppressed by the addition of zzso or zzso to the reaction zzso zzso zzso also caused leakage of zzso zzso at low and high salt zzso The results indicate specific and differential interactions of the zzso of zzso with various zzso charged zzso species, although there is an zzso component common to these zzso
