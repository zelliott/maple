zzso amplified zzso DNA zzso and simple sequence repeat zzso analyses were used to characterize the genetic composition of zzso plants of a zzso potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso plants was first determined by flow zzso A total of 44 zzso zzso was screened for zzso zzso The zzso that zzso were selected and zzso The zzso had less than half as many zzso carrying zzso markers compared with the zzso zzso Among 14 zzso zzso 5 were identified as zzso by marker frequency similar to zzso and 9 as zzso Five of seven zzso obtained from published potato sequences were zzso in zzso zzso was found to be zzso with two zzso at four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso at a zzso zzso zzso pairs zzso each of the five zzso zzso revealed that zzso had only the zzso contributed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had only one band per zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso displayed more than one zzso for at least one zzso zzso zzso of the zzso analysis supported the findings based on zzso zzso the same five zzso clones were characterized as zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso
