The zzso B core zzso is a widely accepted carrier particle to enhance the zzso of foreign zzso From electron zzso the zzso region between zzso acid positions 79 to 81 is known to zzso from the surface of the zzso It can be replaced by zzso sequences without interfering with the zzso capacity in many zzso Here we have introduced various zzso sequences of the envelope protein of different zzso zzso B, zzso of zzso in order to enhance their zzso and broaden the immune response against the zzso To improve zzso efficiency and zzso of the zzso zzso hybrids, six zzso zzso were fused to zzso acid zzso An adjustable zzso scheme was zzso including zzso zzso affinity zzso and particle zzso under high salt conditions, resulting in highly pure zzso zzso The hybrids reacted specifically with zzso of zzso zzso They further induced an zzso zzso zzso zzso response superior to that of zzso zzso zzso
