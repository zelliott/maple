zzso 43 zzso is a zzso surface zzso found in most zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cells, promotes zzso formation and is associated with enhanced resistance to zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein and consists of two zzso a zzso the zzso and a passenger domain, the zzso Here we have employed various molecular approaches to probe zzso aspects of zzso An entire family of zzso zzso was zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a diverse range of zzso coli zzso and found to zzso zzso proteins with different zzso Several novel zzso were identified and characterized that were unable to promote zzso zzso By employing a combination of zzso zzso zzso and domain swapping between zzso and zzso zzso we have zzso the region of the protein responsible for zzso to be located within the zzso one-third of the passenger zzso Our data suggest that zzso interactions between charged zzso residing in interacting pairs of zzso zzso may be important for the zzso zzso Based on its similarity to other related zzso we predict the passenger, zzso domain primarily to consist of an extended zzso structure in which numerous repeats or rungs are stacked in parallel orientation in an extended zzso zzso Finally, we found that in spite of their different zzso pattern all zzso zzso promoted zzso formation to zzso zzso
