The zzso Eastern Pacific zzso zzso ca zzso zzso of deep water separating the eastern from the central Pacific, is the World's zzso marine zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA in 20 reef fish zzso encountered on both sides of the barrier revealed cryptic zzso in zzso Among the other 18 species only two showed significant differentiation (as revealed by zzso networks and zzso zzso between the eastern and the central zzso zzso analyses indicated that genetic similarity in the 18 truly zzso species resulted from different combinations of ages of most recent invasion and of levels of zzso gene flow, with estimated times of initial separation ranging from approximately zzso to 1 zzso zzso There is no suggestion of simultaneous interruptions of gene flow among the zzso zzso across the zzso was previously thought to be exclusively zzso but our evidence showed two zzso from east to west and eight cases in which subsequent gene flow possibly proceeded in the same zzso Thus, the zzso is sporadically permeable to zzso originating on either zzso
