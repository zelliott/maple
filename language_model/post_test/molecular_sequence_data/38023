A simple zzso for detection of compounds that bind to the active site in the zzso domain of the essential zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso is zzso The method is based on a competition with the specific zzso inhibitor zzso With zzso coupled to zzso zzso a simple zzso procedure allows the amount of labeled zzso that bind to zzso beads in the presence of test substances to be zzso The zzso can easily be labeled by the zzso binding of zzso zzso Crude membrane extracts can be used as a source for the zzso and different kinds of labels for the zzso complexes can be zzso The zzso can be adapted to zzso zzso
