The DNA sequence of a zzso region downstream of the zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso coli has been zzso Three open reading zzso which are subsequently referred to as zzso zzso and zzso were detected in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have shown that the first of these, zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso Growth on zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of a zzso zzso long transcript which covers just zzso zzso zzso which is transcribed zzso from zzso and of a zzso zzso long transcript which covers all four zzso of the zzso D zzso More zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso is detected than that corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso amounts of the induced zzso are truncated molecules having their 3' ends after zzso and after zzso Multiple 3' zzso ends have been mapped after zzso and seem to zzso to the ends of transcripts stabilized by zzso secondary structure zzso zzso rather than zzso termination zzso A second promoter producing zzso transcripts has been mapped just in front of the zzso zzso
