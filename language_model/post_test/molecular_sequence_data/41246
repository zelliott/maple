Short DNA zzso especially those that are repetitive or zzso can be used as the seeds for synthesis of long DNA by some DNA zzso in an unusual zzso Although several zzso mechanisms have been proposed, there is no well-established model that explains highly efficient zzso under zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the zzso of zzso sequences with distinct zzso at each zzso These zzso were zzso efficiently under zzso conditions by zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and the products were longer than 10 zzso within 10 zzso of the zzso A zzso DNA with only one hairpin was also zzso zzso analysis revealed that the long products are mainly tandem repeats of the short seed zzso The zzso melting temperatures of the products were much higher than the reaction temperature, indicating that most zzso form duplexes during the zzso zzso a terminal hairpin formation and zzso extension model was proposed in detail, and the efficient zzso was zzso zzso of the hairpin at the zzso end plays an important role during the zzso
