zzso are zzso zzso complexes that mediate the folding of nascent or zzso zzso Gene zzso has been a potent force in the evolution of zzso in zzso Here we show that gene conversion has also been an important zzso We zzso a novel maximum zzso zzso method for scanning DNA sequence alignments for regions of anomalous zzso zzso such as those affected by gene zzso Our results suggest that in zzso where an ancient gene zzso producing alpha and beta zzso took place in the common zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso multiple independent gene zzso have occurred between the alpha and beta genes independently in each of these zzso zzso the zzso have repeatedly zzso the region of the gene zzso the zzso zzso This suggests that while the alpha and beta zzso in zzso share only zzso overall zzso acid sequence identity, they do not possess distinct roles in the binding of zzso zzso gene conversion between zzso related zzso may be more common than is currently zzso and could be a significant factor in slowing the functional differentiation of proteins zzso by duplicate genes long after their zzso
