zzso zzso within the zzso U2 zzso particle that are required for zzso zzso have been zzso using zzso zzso A comparison of the melting temperatures of duplexes formed between zzso and different types of zzso zzso has demonstrated that the most stable hybrids are formed with zzso made of zzso zzso incorporating the modified base zzso We have therefore used these zzso zzso to target sequences within the central domain of U2 zzso Overlapping zzso zzso complementary to the stem loop zzso region of U2 zzso zzso zzso specifically affinity selected U2 zzso from zzso nuclear zzso These zzso inhibited zzso production in an in zzso zzso zzso and caused a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Little or no zzso of zzso assembly and zzso zzso site zzso was observed for all zzso tested, indicating that the zzso were specifically zzso zzso zzso This effect was most striking with a zzso complementary to U2 zzso zzso zzso These results provide evidence for a functional requirement for U2 zzso in the zzso mechanism occurring after zzso zzso
