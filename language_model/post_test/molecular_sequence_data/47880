zzso mice injected, zzso in saline or zzso in incomplete zzso zzso with large quantities of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso c zzso zzso fail to respond to subsequent zzso with this zzso when administered in complete zzso zzso This state of tolerance can be broken by zzso with certain zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso as assessed on representative zzso zzso specific T cell zzso In this paper, the mechanism of breaking tolerance by zzso zzso was zzso The following observations were made: zzso T cell zzso derived from zzso animals required higher zzso of zzso zzso to be zzso than zzso derived from normal immune animals, suggesting that they have T cell receptors zzso of lower zzso zzso in contrast to normal immune animals whose zzso zzso are typically zzso none of the zzso derived from zzso animals expressed zzso although they were all zzso Also, the zzso zzso determining region 3 zzso regions from the zzso animals did not contain the zzso structure and length characteristics of the normal zzso zzso immune zzso and zzso adoptive transfer and zzso of zzso zzso transgenic T cells followed by zzso with zzso zzso failed to terminate the state of zzso zzso these data strongly suggest that the mechanism involved in breaking tolerance in this system is the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso rather than reversal of zzso Further support for this mechanism was the finding that after zzso T cells apparently have a lowered threshold with respect to the affinity of interaction with zzso required for zzso
