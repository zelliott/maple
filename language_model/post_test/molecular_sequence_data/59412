There are a number of zzso small nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso Many of them have been assigned functions in the zzso of cellular zzso such as zzso and 3' end zzso Here, we present the sequence of zzso zzso zzso and compare the secondary structures of the zzso zzso and zzso with those of the zzso zzso and U2, zzso The data suggest functional parallels between these two pairs of zzso in zzso zzso Using a highly sensitive method, we have identified several new zzso zzso from zzso zzso These include five zzso zzso zzso and six novel zzso One of the six novel zzso is an zzso zzso whereas the rest are not zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The discovery of these new zzso suggests that there may be yet more zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
