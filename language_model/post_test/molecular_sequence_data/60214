The global methane cycle includes both zzso and atmospheric processes and may contribute to feedback regulation of the zzso Most zzso zzso are a net sink for zzso and these zzso consume approximately 20 to 60 zzso of methane per zzso The soil sink for atmospheric methane is zzso zzso and sensitive to zzso A decrease in the capacity of this sink may have contributed to the approximately zzso zzso increase in the atmospheric methane level in this zzso The organisms responsible for methane zzso by zzso (the atmospheric methane zzso are not known, and factors that influence the activity of these organisms are poorly zzso In this study the soil zzso population was characterized by both zzso soil zzso with zzso and analyzing a total soil zzso gene zzso Comparative analyses of zzso zzso fatty acid profiles performed with representative zzso bacteria revealed that the soil sink for atmospheric methane consists of an unknown group of zzso bacteria that exhibit some similarity to type II zzso An analysis of zzso gene libraries from the same soil samples indicated that an unknown group of bacteria belonging to the alpha zzso of the class zzso was zzso these organisms were only zzso related to extant zzso zzso Studies on factors that affect the activity, population zzso and contribution to global methane flux of zzso methane zzso should be greatly facilitated by use of zzso identified in this zzso
