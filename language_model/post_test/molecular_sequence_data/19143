The dynamic changes in zzso expression levels for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene levels were assessed in a zzso response study in immature male specimens of the zzso sea zzso zzso zzso submitted to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Two different zzso for the zzso zzso and one for the IT zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned by screening an zzso zzso brain zzso zzso Genes for these receptors were expressed zzso and is nearly zzso in 26 of the examined zzso In the zzso both environmental zzso challenges zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso with zzso expression protein activity of zzso zzso gene expression and zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso levels were associated with zzso environmental zzso indicating a possible connection between zzso and these zzso In zzso zzso zzso gene expression peaked rapidly and lasted only a short time zzso in response to both zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso levels were enhanced in specimens exposed to zzso conditions, whereas they decreased under zzso zzso suggesting an zzso role related to the zzso zzso In the zzso only the expression of the zzso zzso gene was enhanced at 7 and 14 days under both experimental zzso In the liver, both zzso had increased zzso levels, with the zzso of their zzso zzso gene increasing faster than the zzso The zzso gene was not sensitive to variations of external zzso in any of the analyzed zzso Our results demonstrate the involvement of the zzso but not the zzso zzso as well as the zzso function, in the adjustments of both zzso and zzso processes after zzso zzso
