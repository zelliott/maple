zzso zzso has been used as a rapid method to evaluate the zzso interactions between a series of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso core of two membrane model zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso zzso If a zzso interaction occurs, a zzso zzso shift is observed in the zzso spectrum of the aromatic side chains when going from zzso solution to a zzso zzso The aromatic zzso of substance zzso zzso and zzso zzso all exhibited the zzso zzso shift in the presence of sodium zzso zzso while those of zzso did zzso The opposite effects were observed in the presence of zzso zzso
