Three zzso variable zzso zzso zzso recognizing the nuclear inclusion a zzso and zzso proteins of potato virus Y were obtained from two mouse derived zzso clones zzso respectively, an zzso zzso and an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The first zzso zzso was able to inhibit in zzso the zzso zzso zzso by blocking the zzso zzso zzso The amplified zzso zzso were first inserted into the zzso zzso and then zzso Several zzso zzso coli clones carrying the accurate zzso sequences were selected and the corresponding zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and transferred in zzso coli zzso The expressed zzso fragments showed an zzso activity that recognized the viral target proteins in infected zzso Their activity was comparable to the parental zzso zzso
