We report results using a zzso for DNA sequencing using samples from zzso 17, obtained from the zzso Institute Center for Genome Research zzso production zzso The device had an effective separation distance of zzso zzso and a zzso defined injection zzso of 150 zzso The zzso raw data were zzso zzso by the sequencing software zzso and compared to the corresponding zzso 377 sequence from zzso With a criteria of zzso zzso we achieved average continuous reads of zzso bases in 27 zzso with zzso linear zzso zzso at 150 zzso and 460 bases in 22 zzso with zzso zzso at 200 zzso at a temperature of 45 degrees zzso In the best case, up to zzso bases could be zzso with the same accuracy in zzso zzso In some instances, Trout allowed for accurate zzso down to a resolution R as low as R zzso zzso This may be due in part to the high zzso ratio of the zzso Unlike many results reported on zzso machines, no additional sample cleanup other than ethanol zzso was zzso In addition, DNA zzso zzso zzso discrimination against larger zzso was reduced significantly through the unique sample injection mechanism of the zzso zzso This led to increased signal strength for long fragments, which is of great importance for the high performance of the zzso
