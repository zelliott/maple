zzso zzso zzso Green zzso a nonhuman zzso species distributed throughout zzso Africa, has been shown to have high zzso rates of zzso to zzso zzso virus zzso and therefore, has been proposed as a natural zzso for zzso zzso Our laboratories have isolated zzso viruses from two East African subspecies of zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the structural proteins based on the molecular weights and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that these viruses are distinctly zzso zzso was observed in the molecular weights of the zzso zzso and zzso gene products between zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were distinguishable from zzso zzso by the apparent size difference of the major core zzso zzso All zzso and zzso zzso were found to zzso a zzso protein of approximately 40 zzso zzso in contrast to zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein was shown to be zzso by the entire zzso open reading frame, unlike zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso These data indicate that viruses from zzso zzso share common features with zzso and zzso but represent diverse zzso viruses which may vary according to subspecies and geographic zzso
