The protein S zzso situated on zzso 3, consists of two protein S zzso Here, we report the cloning and complete zzso sequence of the zzso region of the two genes designated zzso alpha and zzso zzso Both regions span approximately 1,200 zzso They show a high degree zzso of zzso with zzso caused by small zzso insertions and point zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta with the reported protein S liver zzso shows that the latter all originate from the zzso alpha zzso The zzso alpha gene therefore is marked as the major site of synthesis of liver protein S zzso zzso comparison with the bovine protein S zzso reveals that the zzso beta gene has accumulated a few more zzso than the zzso alpha gene since zzso of the ancestral protein S gene that seems to have occurred recently during zzso zzso
