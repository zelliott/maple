zzso resistance to zzso type B zzso antibiotics in zzso coli zzso is due to the presence on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso resistance zzso zzso which is almost identical to the zzso genes previously described in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso differs by three and six zzso acids from those zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Unlike the zzso elements which zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene is expressed zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso due to several zzso in the regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located within the region zzso to zzso and zzso and zzso is a hybrid promoter constituted by zzso and zzso sequences located at the end of zzso and in the zzso region, zzso These results constitute evidence for the recent in zzso transfer from zzso zzso to zzso zzso This transfer could have been zzso by zzso such as zzso or zzso from zzso pneumoniae, which also bears an zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso We speculate that the zzso sequences zzso and zzso could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of zzso which has been found in numerous strains of zzso
