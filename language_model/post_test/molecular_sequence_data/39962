zzso zzso zzso is broadly defined as the process linking the action potential to contraction in zzso muscle or, more narrowly, as the process zzso surface membrane zzso to zzso release from the zzso zzso zzso We now know that zzso zzso depends on a zzso protein complex or zzso release zzso The complex extends the zzso space within the zzso zzso zzso of the surface zzso across the zzso zzso membrane into the zzso and then across the zzso zzso membrane and into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The central element of the zzso complex is the zzso zzso calcium release channel in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has recruited a surface membrane zzso calcium channel as a zzso zzso to detect the action potential and the zzso protein zzso to detect in the environment within the zzso zzso zzso the calcium release channel is able to respond to surface zzso in a manner that depends on the zzso load within the calcium zzso zzso The molecular components of the zzso release zzso are the same in skeletal and cardiac zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso is zzso The signal from the zzso sensor to zzso zzso is chemical in the heart, depending on an influx of external zzso through the surface calcium zzso In contrast, zzso zzso links the zzso sensor and the zzso zzso in skeletal zzso zzso Our current understanding of this amazingly efficient molecular signal zzso machine has evolved over the past 50 zzso None of the proteins had been identified in the zzso indeed, there was debate about whether the molecules involved were, in fact, zzso Nevertheless, a multitude of questions about the molecular interactions and structures of the proteins and their interaction sites remain to be answered and provide a challenge for the next 50 zzso
