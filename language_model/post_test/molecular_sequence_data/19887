Studies with zzso membrane zzso have shown that two distinct and separate zzso exchange processes are present in rat zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso exchange, and zzso zzso zzso These studies proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the former as both zzso membrane zzso zzso exchange, and zzso specific zzso are present only in surface cells and are zzso in zzso rats, whereas zzso in zzso zzso encodes the latter as both zzso zzso exchange, and zzso proteins are present in zzso zzso of both surface and zzso cells and are not altered in zzso zzso Studies were, therefore, initiated to identify the function of rat zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso isolated from rat zzso colon encodes a zzso protein which has 96 and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso only in specific segments of the zzso tract zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in the stomach, zzso or in the zzso brain, heart, and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso exhibited zzso and zzso acid pH zzso zzso zzso zzso that: zzso was significantly zzso by outward zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso zzso was saturated as a function of increasing zzso zzso zzso with an apparent K zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited competitively by zzso zzso but not by zzso A high rate of zzso zzso influx at pH zzso was also present under zzso zzso zzso Our observations that zzso mediates zzso acid zzso zzso zzso are consistent with prior observations that zzso does not mediate zzso zzso exchange in rat zzso zzso We speculate that, in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may function as a modifier of other zzso transport zzso
