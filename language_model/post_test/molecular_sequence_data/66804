Common zzso zzso modes are swimming by means of rotating internal or external zzso filaments or gliding by means of retracting zzso The zzso zzso filament differs significantly from the zzso zzso zzso Its diameter is 10-14 zzso compared to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso It has zzso zzso of a zzso zzso pitch left-handed zzso compared to zzso zzso of a zzso zzso pitch right-handed zzso for plain zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso filament is zzso which is uncommon in zzso zzso and is believed to be one of the key elements for stabilizing proteins under extreme zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso zzso although highly zzso within the group, seems unrelated to the highly zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso filament shares some fundamental properties with type IV zzso zzso The zzso N zzso are largely zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso zzso follow a different mode of transport and zzso They are zzso as zzso and have a zzso signal zzso like zzso and unlike zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso like zzso is zzso zzso The filament lacks a central channel, consistent with zzso occurring at the zzso zzso zzso The diameter of type IV zzso zzso zzso is closer to that of the zzso filament, 10-14 zzso A large body of data on the zzso and molecular biology of zzso zzso has accumulated in recent zzso However, their structure and symmetry is only beginning to zzso Here, we review the structure of the zzso zzso filament in reference to the structures of type IV zzso and zzso zzso zzso with which it shares structural and functional similarities, zzso
