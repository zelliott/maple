zzso are nuclear proteins that form part of an innate immune response zzso zzso in zzso and zzso This studies aim was to zzso the evolution of zzso gene structure and protein function in the zzso 

zzso genes are present throughout the zzso and arose before the separation of animal, plant and zzso zzso Using comprehensive zzso analysis, coupled with comparisons of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that the zzso structure of zzso zzso genes was established prior to the zzso and that a single zzso duplicated in the zzso before the zzso zzso producing zzso and zzso zzso analyses of seven zzso gene families with members in zzso proximity to both zzso and zzso were compatible with a common zzso event affecting the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A further zzso of zzso occurred in the zzso lineage and was followed by zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been independently zzso by five research groups under different zzso and a comparison of the available literature revealed diverse functions, generally in regulating gene zzso For example, zzso was zzso in zzso as zzso an important growth factor and in zzso as zzso which has an essential zzso zzso In zzso zzso was named zzso in mice and was shown to regulate zzso whereas zzso was zzso as zzso in rats and promoted zzso acting as a zzso zzso when bound to a zzso zzso Both zzso zzso have evolved under comparably strict constraints of zzso selection, although a likelihood ratio test predicted that functional divergence has occurred between zzso zzso and maximum likelihood tests identified zzso positions where the rate of evolution had shifted significantly between zzso Interestingly, the highest scoring position was within a zzso validated zzso for zzso zzso 

This work offers an evolutionary framework to facilitate future studies of zzso zzso and provides insight into their multifaceted and zzso zzso zzso
