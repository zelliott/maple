Using consensus regions in gene sequences zzso the two forms of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso pathway, we designed two sets of zzso zzso to amplify zzso and zzso The zzso were evaluated by screening defined zzso zzso zzso zzso from wastewater treatment plants, and extracts from activated zzso zzso relationships of zzso genes were also zzso The zzso zzso were designed to amplify a zzso to zzso region of zzso in the six published zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso amplified a zzso region in seven of the eight published zzso zzso Together, the two sets of zzso zzso amplified zzso genes in nine species within four zzso as well as in four of the seven sludge zzso The zzso did not amplify genes of zzso zzso The zzso zzso amplified the expected zzso in all 13 sludge samples, but zzso fragments were only obtained in five zzso zzso products of the expected sizes were verified as zzso genes after zzso to DNA zzso except in one zzso The zzso zzso fragments were related to other zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso amplified the correct zzso The selected primer sites for zzso were zzso while zzso zzso targeting zzso regions of zzso seem to be difficult to zzso We also report on the existence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
