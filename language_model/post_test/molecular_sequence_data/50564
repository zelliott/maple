An zzso coronary zzso was obtained in zzso zzso dogs within 60 zzso following the zzso placement of a copper zzso into the left descending coronary zzso This zzso persisted for the 60 zzso experimental period, within which the effects of zzso zzso (10 zzso for 30 zzso alone or combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso alone achieved zzso for 20 zzso in only 2 out of the 5 dogs zzso Combination of zzso with either zzso or zzso produced this effect in all the 5 dogs zzso In dogs treated with zzso associated to either zzso or zzso the zzso weight was smaller zzso of zzso and zzso zzso than in animals given zzso zzso The plasma zzso activity, expressed as zzso activity, was greater 15 zzso after the beginning of zzso infusion, in dogs zzso with either zzso or zzso than in animals given zzso zzso zzso during zzso infusion, the apparent zzso inhibitor and zzso activities were no longer measurable in the zzso but zzso 10 zzso after the end of zzso zzso Plasma zzso time was not modified by zzso but was slightly prolonged zzso by zzso and markedly zzso by zzso on initiation of zzso zzso Plasma zzso activity was zzso higher in dogs zzso with zzso as opposed to zzso On the contrary, both compounds increased similarly plasma zzso zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso like zzso enhances the zzso effects of zzso This zzso effect occurs independently of a plasma zzso state, which was clearly produced by zzso but not zzso Its mechanism may be the significant zzso of plasma zzso activity produced by both zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
