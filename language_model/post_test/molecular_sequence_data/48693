zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is used for energy storage and is zzso and zzso in a zzso manner in plant zzso zzso zzso is the only known natural starch modification and is required for starch degradation in zzso Critical to starch energy release is the activity of zzso zzso however, the structural basis of zzso by zzso zzso is zzso Here, we describe the structure of the zzso zzso starch zzso zzso like sex zzso zzso both with and without zzso product bound at zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds zzso using an aromatic channel within an extended zzso active site and positions zzso in a zzso orientation, which we show is critical for the specific zzso zzso activity of zzso toward native zzso zzso However, unlike other starch binding zzso zzso does not possess a zzso binding module zzso Instead we identify two additional zzso binding sites located within the core zzso zzso zzso This structure is the first of a zzso zzso zzso and provides new insights into the molecular basis of this zzso and industrially relevant zzso family as well as the unique mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso and interaction with starch zzso
