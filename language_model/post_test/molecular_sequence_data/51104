The D1 zzso of the zzso II zzso reaction center is zzso as a precursor zzso which is zzso processed at the zzso zzso It has been shown in spinach that such processing removes nine zzso zzso leaving zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Plant Cell zzso 31, zzso We show here that processing on the zzso side of zzso also occurs in the zzso zzso zzso resulting in the removal of 16 zzso zzso By constructing a deletion strain of zzso zzso that lacks the three copies of the zzso gene zzso zzso we have developed a system for generating zzso zzso Using this system, we have constructed zzso of zzso zzso that are modified in the region of the zzso of the D1 zzso zzso of these zzso has revealed that zzso processing of the D1 zzso is blocked when the zzso after the zzso site is changed from zzso to zzso zzso zzso with the result that the zzso cluster is unable to assemble zzso zzso the zzso extension of 16 zzso acid zzso can be deleted with little consequence either for zzso of D1 into the zzso membrane or for assembly of D1 into a fully active zzso complex; zzso removal of only one more zzso zzso zzso results in a loss of assembly of the zzso zzso and zzso the ability of zzso zzso core complexes zzso the zzso zzso to bind and zzso zzso zzso by the secondary zzso zzso is largely unaffected in the processing zzso (the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our results are consistent with a role for processing in regulating the assembly of the zzso zzso cluster and a role for the free zzso zzso of the mature D1 zzso in the zzso of one or more zzso zzso of the zzso
