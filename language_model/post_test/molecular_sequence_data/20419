In zzso cells, zzso III forms an zzso zzso complex with a zzso family zzso and two zzso containing zzso replication protein A zzso and zzso One role for this complex is to catalyze the completion of zzso zzso reactions in which the zzso DNA molecules are zzso zzso by a double Holliday junction zzso This process, which requires the zzso DNA zzso activity of zzso III, is termed Holliday junction zzso to distinguish it from Holliday junction zzso zzso by zzso zzso that simply cleave the zzso zzso Holliday junction dissolution gives rise exclusively to zzso zzso products, which would have the effect of suppressing sister zzso exchanges and loss of zzso between zzso zzso In this chapter, we provide a detailed experimental protocol for the preparation of an zzso double Holliday junction zzso and for the zzso analysis of dissolution in zzso
