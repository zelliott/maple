Two zzso belonging to distinct classes of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and selected from biased zzso display libraries were used to investigate interactions between a specificity pocket in the zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The solution structures of zzso zzso zzso with these peptides were solved by zzso In addition to zzso zzso type II zzso core, the class I and II zzso each possesses a zzso sequence that occupies a large pocket between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses illustrate how the two classes of zzso zzso exploit a specificity pocket on the zzso differently to increase binding affinity and zzso
