zzso zzso receptors and gap junctions are two groups of proteins involved in the transmission of zzso zzso calcium zzso between zzso The extent to which zzso spread among these zzso cells depends on the amount of zzso released, which can occur through membrane channels, as well as other zzso Our previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to the amplification of zzso spread by providing sites of zzso release through zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the signal zzso events zzso this response we compared the properties of the zzso complex in zzso from a mouse strain zzso containing a naturally occurring point zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso to that of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso pharmacological and zzso imaging techniques revealed that the zzso zzso located in the zzso domain (a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release and the distance of zzso spread between zzso Similar results were obtained when using the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and a zzso zzso spanning the zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso These results support the participation of a zzso zzso of the zzso family in the initial steps zzso the opening of zzso channels following zzso stimulation and in the transmission of calcium signals among zzso
