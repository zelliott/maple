A comparison of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with those from the zzso family of zzso revealed a number of zzso zzso acid positions which have been implicated as essential in zzso zzso a zzso zzso approach with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso we identified three of these zzso zzso acid positions, zzso zzso and zzso as being important in zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso resulted in a zzso which expressed only about zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was less stable than was the parental zzso when expressed in zzso zzso Moreover, conversion of zzso or zzso to either zzso or Ala resulted in zzso devoid of zzso activity, indicating the essential nature of these two zzso acids for zzso Furthermore, zzso of the four zzso zzso present at positions 169 to zzso which are part of a zzso with zzso to the direct repeating sequences present in the zzso domain of the zzso had little overall effect on zzso activity, although the zzso products appeared to be less zzso These results are discussed relative to the mechanisms of zzso proposed for the zzso and related zzso
