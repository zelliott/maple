zzso zzso dominant zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso which leads to strokes and zzso is caused by single zzso zzso or, in a few cases, small deletions in the zzso zzso These zzso result in a gain or a loss of 1 (or, rarely, 3) zzso zzso in 1 of 34 zzso growth zzso repeats in the zzso zzso region of zzso 

To describe a patient with a novel zzso zzso in whom clinical and laboratory findings of zzso abnormalities were associated with a diagnosis of zzso Patient A patient with a history of zzso repeated transient zzso attacks, and generalized fatigue underwent muscle zzso brain magnetic resonance zzso imaging, and screening of zzso DNA and zzso 

zzso genetic analysis showed a zzso zzso (the first documented zzso deletion in a patient with zzso in zzso zzso Although the screening of zzso DNA did not show zzso zzso findings from muscle biopsy and brain magnetic resonance zzso imaging showed signs of zzso impairment zzso zzso abnormalities and increased zzso brain zzso zzso 

A patient with zzso and a zzso pair deletion leading to a zzso zzso showed clinical and laboratory evidence of zzso zzso This adds to the previously reported hypothesis of a zzso role of zzso or, less specifically, a zzso zzso effect on zzso energy zzso
