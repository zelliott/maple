zzso analysis of the zzso end of the human zzso gene revealed that a large zzso of about 25 zzso separates an upstream zzso zzso zzso 1) from the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and primer extensions showed that zzso 1 is transcribed in zzso but not in cells of the zzso zzso This is due to the differential usage of zzso separated by approximately 25 zzso in a zzso zzso One major zzso transcript was observed in zzso cells, whereas multiple initiation sites for zzso appeared to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons showed that the 3' end of the human zzso growth factor zzso gene lies approximately 350 base pairs upstream of the major initiation sites for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
