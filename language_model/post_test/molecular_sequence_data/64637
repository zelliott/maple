zzso zzso zzso zzso are a zzso of zzso controlling cellular zzso of the second zzso zzso and zzso Crystal structures of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso have been determined at medium zzso The zzso domain of zzso has the same zzso folding as that of zzso but three regions show different zzso structures, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso are involved in binding of the selective zzso the different zzso of the zzso thus the distinct shapes of the active sites, will be a zzso of inhibitor selectivity in zzso zzso binds to a zzso that comprises key zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso This zzso may be a common site for binding zzso zzso of zzso
