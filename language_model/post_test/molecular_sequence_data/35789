zzso zzso is a characteristic zzso that is found in the bend between the zzso zzso stem and the zzso zzso stem in over zzso of the zzso zzso species having zzso at position 26 zzso However, since a few zzso zzso have an unmodified G in that position, zzso is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso We have successively changed the near surroundings of zzso in this zzso until zzso became modified to zzso by a zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this way we have identified the two zzso zzso zzso zzso immediately preceding zzso as major identity elements for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, increasing the extra loop in zzso from four to the more usual five bases influenced the global structure of the zzso such that the zzso formation was drastically decreased even if the near region of zzso had the two consensus zzso We conclude that not only are the two consensus base pairs in the zzso a prerequisite for zzso zzso but also is any part of the zzso zzso that influence the zzso important for the recognition between nuclear coded zzso and the zzso
