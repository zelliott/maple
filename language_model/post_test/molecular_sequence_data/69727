The zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of influenza virus represent a T cell zzso recognized by zzso T cells zzso in association with zzso class I zzso When zzso myeloma B cells are zzso with a zzso heavy chain gene bearing this particular zzso zzso they are zzso by zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso that are zzso with this heavy chain zzso and the parental light chain zzso a soluble zzso zzso and were also zzso by the zzso zzso we present evidence that zzso cells are able to induce in zzso proliferation of zzso specific zzso whereas immobilized zzso zzso do zzso Furthermore, the zzso cells expressing the zzso heavy chain prime zzso specific zzso in adult as well as in newborn mice, while zzso cells coated with zzso synthetic zzso do zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso needs to be zzso from the zzso context in order to be presented to T cells and that only zzso generated zzso zzso is zzso
