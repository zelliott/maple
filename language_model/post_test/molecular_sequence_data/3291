In an effort to detect factors which may be under positive selection, a survey for such genes in two zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Based on an analysis of synonymous and zzso zzso we identified 19 candidate genes under positive zzso A search for zzso with known zzso structures revealed zzso coli zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as isolated from zzso coli is a zzso zzso that possesses two different but coupled zzso and is involved in the first committed step in the separate zzso pathways for zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we provide evidence indicating that one of these zzso appears to be under selective zzso Reports from previously published zzso zzso studies point to a decoupling of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these findings for a zzso zzso under positive selection are discussed in terms of the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
