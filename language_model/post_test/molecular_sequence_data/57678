The zzso chain reaction zzso has been used to amplify the long control region zzso of zzso human zzso type 16 from cervical scrape DNA obtained from a woman with no evidence of cervical disease and a woman with cervical zzso zzso grade 3 zzso zzso An zzso base pair zzso containing the entire zzso was cloned into zzso and the DNA sequence determined for both zzso and compared with the zzso zzso type 16 zzso DNA zzso zzso variation was apparent in the zzso derived from both zzso In the case of the sample derived from the woman with no cervical disease, there were three zzso zzso one zzso four zzso and three transitions zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso derived from the woman with zzso 3 showed significantly more zzso variation with two zzso zzso one zzso nine zzso and ten zzso transitions zzso conservation zzso Using computer analyses coupled with available data from DNA footprint studies, the effects of these sequence variations on established zzso factor binding sequences were zzso Cloning of the zzso derived from the woman without cervical disease into a zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter screening zzso followed by zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was a functional promoter but was zzso less active than an equivalent zzso early zzso zzso
