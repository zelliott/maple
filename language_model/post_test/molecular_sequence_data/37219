zzso metabolism is implicated to play an important role in zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso two major zzso bases of zzso have potent zzso activity with remarkably high structural and zzso specificity against zzso zzso In fact, only naturally occurring zzso and zzso are zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso and zzso induce rapid DNA zzso independent of zzso large-scale DNA zzso and exposure of zzso all common zzso features characteristic of zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso induce zzso in zzso zzso The finding that DNA fragmentation requires protein zzso which implies that an active process is involved, further supports this zzso The induction of zzso by zzso and zzso is associated with the rapid zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso However, zzso are not required for zzso induced by zzso and zzso as scavenging of zzso by a free radical spin trap has no zzso We further demonstrate that zzso induced by zzso and zzso is independent of zzso function but requires zzso zzso Together, the results suggest that zzso and zzso induce a type of zzso in zzso zzso most similar to the zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso As zzso zzso is genetically zzso this zzso should be an ideal model system for zzso zzso signaling in zzso and, importantly, for further zzso the molecular basis of zzso zzso
