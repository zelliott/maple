zzso of cultured zzso slices for five days with zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso I resulted in an approximately zzso decrease in the amount of zzso activity zzso by 10 zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso of zzso produced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso stimulation were substantially zzso zzso reduced in zzso treated zzso this effect was not obtained in slices exposed to zzso for 45 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso using zzso that recognize multiple zzso breakdown products and in zzso experiments with an zzso that detects an individual zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso I did not zzso affect evoked synaptic responses but markedly improved their recovery from a 15 zzso infusion of zzso These results indicate that zzso breakdown products provide a useful index of in zzso zzso I activity and support the hypothesis that the zzso plays a significant role in zzso
