zzso zzso C zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso thin filament that regulates zzso zzso in cardiac zzso We have zzso a novel zzso chain reaction cloning procedure to isolate zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso that has been highly zzso during zzso Southern zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso gene is a member of a zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed that the zzso gene is expressed in zzso cardiac tissue and slow skeletal muscle zzso but is not expressed in fast skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso and anterior zzso or in zzso or adult brain, zzso zzso liver, or zzso In addition, while the zzso gene is not expressed in zzso zzso zzso differentiation of these cells into zzso was shown to result in a dramatic induction of zzso gene zzso A full length zzso zzso clone was isolated from a zzso zzso library by zzso with a zzso zzso probe and structurally characterized by DNA zzso primer extension, and zzso zzso protection zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso pairs long and is composed of six zzso The zzso do not appear to divide the gene into functional zzso Analysis of the zzso region of the gene revealed the presence of a consensus zzso box 24 base pairs zzso of the zzso start zzso Despite the finding that the gene is expressed only in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, it lacks the previously described zzso and zzso zzso regulatory sequence motifs that are involved in regulating the expression of a number of other zzso zzso
