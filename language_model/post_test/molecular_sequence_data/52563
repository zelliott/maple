We recently identified zzso a previously cloned zzso and zzso zzso as a putative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed that it possesses zzso activity toward zzso despite the lack of zzso to previously described zzso zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso contains many zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which includes the region of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso it was found that its zzso bound zzso and contributed the GAP zzso This domain was predicted to fold into zzso zzso similar to the zzso of the zzso GAP domain of zzso zzso of exposed zzso zzso in this domain helped to identify zzso and zzso as good candidates for zzso zzso matched well to the zzso zzso required for enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that an zzso or zzso zzso severely impaired the zzso GAP activity without affecting its binding to zzso From deletion studies, a region adjacent to the zzso patch zzso on zzso and the zzso I and zzso zzso zzso region on zzso are involved in the zzso The results indicate that the zzso domain of zzso represents a novel GAP domain that employs an zzso patch motif similar to that of the zzso
