The pol gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned in a zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso method was used to clone the gene with no previous knowledge of the gene or protein zzso The zzso DNA zzso containing the structural gene for DNA zzso was zzso DNA zzso as deduced from the DNA zzso consisted of 877 zzso zzso had a molecular weight of zzso and was structurally zzso to the DNA zzso of the Pol I family zzso zzso which includes zzso coli DNA zzso I and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso coli strain was zzso Like zzso coli Pol I, zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso The zzso product with the molecular weight of zzso was also zzso and found to have zzso zzso To zzso this zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso expression zzso zzso with a deletion in the zzso of the pol structural gene was zzso The DNA zzso produced by zzso is more suitable for use in the zzso sequencing method than the other DNA zzso that have been used for zzso
