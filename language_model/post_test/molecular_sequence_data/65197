In a previous successful attempt to convert zzso to a zzso zzso 15 zzso of zzso were replaced with the corresponding ones in zzso This suggests a complex mechanism of zzso recognition instead of a relatively simple one that only involves three sites, zzso zzso 216 and zzso However, both zzso and zzso conversion experiments carried out according to the complex model resulted in zzso zzso with low zzso zzso zzso used in the latter studies was of zzso containing an Ala zzso at position zzso zzso however, contain a zzso zzso at this zzso The substantially decreased zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso also suggests a specific role for this site in zzso zzso Here we investigate the role of site 226 by introducing the zzso substitution into zzso zzso which were constructed according to both the simple zzso zzso and the complex model zzso zzso of specificity zzso The kinetic parameters show that the zzso substitution in the zzso zzso increased the zzso activity, while the zzso activity did not zzso In contrast, this substitution in the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso activity and a zzso specificity profile as tested on a competing zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso that zzso zzso an exclusive property of zzso among pancreatic zzso zzso
