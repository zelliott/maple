The zzso preferences of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been examined by quantitative zzso I zzso zzso Two different DNA fragments were zzso a pair of zzso duplexes from zzso with one or other of the complementary strands labeled and a corresponding pair of zzso duplexes representing fragments of the zzso membrane protein zzso gene from a zzso zzso virus zzso derived from zzso zzso The major objective was to examine molecular recognition and cooperative features associated with zzso binding of synthetic peptides to the zzso zzso At various binding sites on the zzso fragments, Hill zzso zzso ranging from zzso were zzso these results indicate modest positive zzso between binding sites for both zzso By contrast, unusually high values of zzso ranging from zzso were observed at various binding sites on the zzso zzso zzso models can be constructed to interpret the observed cooperative interactions between different DNA recognition sites in the zzso gene upon binding of the zzso zzso It is noteworthy that these models feature a novel network of zzso zzso multiple DNA zzso zzso The evidence of sequence selectivity and strong zzso discovered in this work may prove to be a general feature of zzso interactions with some zzso zzso
