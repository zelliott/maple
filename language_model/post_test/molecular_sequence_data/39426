We have identified a member of the zzso zzso alpha family of nuclear import factors as being modulated in rat liver following exposure to the zzso and liver growth agent zzso To examine the hypothetical role of this protein family as a checkpoint in zzso zzso we characterized the rat zzso alpha zzso gene family and present zzso sequences and gene structures for all six rat zzso zzso Further, we have assembled a comprehensive panel of zzso coding regions from a range of zzso which we have subjected to zzso analysis: This represents by far the most complete zzso study of zzso zzso including several evolutionary zzso not previously zzso The zzso reveals three zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene structures, shedding light on the evolutionary origins of this zzso family in zzso 

Using quantitative zzso we have zzso zzso transcript levels in 44 rat zzso zzso transcripts show a wide variation in their distribution both in absolute and relative terms, suggestive of specialized roles for each zzso We also demonstrate that zzso genes are regulated in rat liver and isolated zzso in a zzso manner for a number of chemically distinct liver growth zzso 

In light of the crucial role of nuclear import in zzso the zzso changes zzso through nuclear zzso zzso we zzso that changes in the levels of specific zzso alpha during zzso liver growth represent an important component of the cellular response to the external stimuli that trigger these zzso
