zzso zzso is a purple zzso zzso that is capable of zzso from zzso swimming cells that contain a single polar zzso into zzso swarming cells that have a polar zzso plus numerous lateral zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that the polar zzso is zzso present and that the lateral zzso are found only when the cells are grown on solidified or viscous zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso contains two sets of motor and switch zzso one set for the lateral zzso and the other for the polar zzso zzso microscopic analysis indicated that polar and lateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso switch proteins are necessary for assembly of the respective zzso In contrast, separate polar and lateral zzso and zzso motor zzso are shown to be required for zzso but are not needed for the synthesis of polar and lateral zzso zzso analysis indicates that the polar and lateral zzso zzso and zzso switch proteins are closely related and most likely arose as a gene zzso zzso However, zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso motor zzso suggests that the polar zzso may have obtained a set of motor genes through a lateral transfer zzso
