zzso couples the zzso and zzso transfer of hydride zzso from zzso to zzso to the zzso of zzso across the inner membrane in zzso and the zzso membrane in zzso Like all zzso the zzso coli zzso is composed of three zzso zzso I and III zzso from the membrane and contain the binding site for zzso and zzso zzso zzso II spans the membrane and constitutes at least partly the zzso zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso zzso I and III deduced from zzso and zzso data and a new zzso of domain II are zzso The new information obtained from the structures and the numerous zzso studies strengthen the proposition of a binding change zzso as a way to couple the reduction of zzso by zzso to zzso zzso and occurring mainly at the level of the zzso binding zzso
