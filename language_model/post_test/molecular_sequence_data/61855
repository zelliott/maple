Advances in mass zzso and the availability of zzso databases made it possible to determine the zzso or zzso content of a specific zzso zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso tandem mass zzso of an extract of 50 zzso zzso zzso yielded 28 zzso Eight were entirely novel and zzso by five not yet zzso zzso only two genes had a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Seven of the eight peptides did not show relevant sequence zzso to any known zzso zzso no evidence towards the zzso role of these zzso peptides was zzso We identified one of the eight zzso zzso in an extract of the zzso adult brain as zzso Next, specific zzso were raised to reveal the distribution pattern of zzso and other peptides from the same zzso in zzso and adult brains by means of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is abundantly present in both stages and a striking similarity was found between the distribution patterns of zzso and zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso Based on this distribution pattern, zzso might be involved in zzso in processing sensory zzso as well as in controlling the activity of the zzso
