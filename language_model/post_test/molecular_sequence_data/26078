Four overlapping zzso clones zzso zzso were isolated from a mouse liver zzso library constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso bases zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the isolated zzso matched zzso 30 to 48 of the sequence deduced on zzso zzso One zzso which had the longest 3' untranslated region, contained two sets of tandem zzso signals, zzso and zzso which were located 497 bases apart, while the remaining three clones terminated at the first zzso The entire reading frame sequence of zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with that of human zzso
