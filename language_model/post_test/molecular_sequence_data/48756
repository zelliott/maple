zzso produced by zzso are traditional food zzso and are widely used as dietary zzso Since genes involving in zzso zzso have not been reported, we describe the identification of a putative zzso gene zzso obtained by molecular analysis of an zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso strain zzso neither the zzso nor zzso expression were detected by zzso or zzso zzso respectively, whereas the introduction of the zzso together with a zzso zzso promoter into zzso caused it to produce zzso of red zzso dry zzso about zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso dry zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso
