A safe and effective group A zzso vaccine that could prevent severe zzso or zzso its symptoms in infants and young children is urgently needed in both developing and developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been well established to be of zzso importance zzso Recently, zzso zzso has emerged as the fifth globally common type of zzso of clinical zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene of various zzso zzso has demonstrated the existence of at least three zzso zzso The goal of our study was to determine the relationship of the zzso lineages to the zzso specificity of various zzso zzso We generated eight single zzso gene substitution zzso each of which bore a single zzso gene zzso zzso specificity of one of the eight zzso strains zzso lineage 1, one lineage 2 and five lineage 3 zzso and the remaining 10 genes of bovine zzso strain zzso and two zzso guinea pig zzso to each zzso and we then analyzed zzso zzso characteristics of the eight zzso strains as well as an additional zzso strain belonging to lineage 1; the nine strains were isolated in five zzso zzso to lineage 1 viruses neutralized lineage 2 and 3 strains to at least within zzso of the zzso lineage zzso zzso to lineage 2 virus neutralized lineage 3 viruses to at least twofold of the zzso lineage 2 zzso however, zzso of lineage 1 viruses was fourfold zzso and zzso to 16- to zzso zzso less zzso zzso to lineage 3 viruses neutralized the lineage 2 strain 16- to zzso less zzso the lineage 1 strains zzso and zzso 8- to zzso less zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso less efficiently than the zzso lineage 3 zzso These findings may have important implications for the development of zzso zzso vaccine candidates, as the strain with the broadest zzso zzso a prime zzso would certainly be the ideal strain for inclusion in a zzso
