A fusion zzso zzso zzso which contains an zzso extension of five zzso acids zzso and is derived from an in zzso modified form of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso has similarly been zzso The zzso and zzso proteins can be combined with the zzso I core protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso electron transport from zzso to the terminal zzso zzso zzso was found to be absolutely dependent on zzso of the zzso clusters in the zzso zzso and on the presence of the zzso zzso This implies that the zzso zzso does not bind solely to the zzso zzso but rather that its interaction with these proteins is zzso through the zzso zzso
