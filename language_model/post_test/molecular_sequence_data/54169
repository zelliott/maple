In this study, we investigated the zzso role of zzso at zzso during zzso zzso Our results showed that two zzso binding sites positively contribute to zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso we provide strong evidence that the zzso binding sites play a positive role in zzso zzso to overcome zzso zzso in the absence of zzso In addition, we found that the zzso binding sites are not only regulated by the presence or absence of zzso but also in the presence or absence of other zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso promoter zzso different DNA elements to control transcription, depending on which zzso acids are detected in the zzso
