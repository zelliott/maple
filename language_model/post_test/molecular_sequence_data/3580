zzso belongs to the zzso zzso It is zzso following zzso zzso and/or T cell zzso stimulation and is thus considered to be important for zzso zzso zzso has several structural motifs such as an zzso domain and a zzso domain and interacts with many molecules through these zzso To obtain more insights on the zzso signal zzso we sought proteins that interact with the zzso zzso domain by far Western zzso and we identified a novel human zzso zzso (a zzso zzso with zzso zzso is a protein of 118 zzso and is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain, a putative zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso through this zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein and zzso with zzso at the zzso zzso Through the zzso region, zzso also associates with zzso that is a major component of intermediate zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso along with zzso intermediate zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a zzso regulator that connects zzso to intermediate zzso
