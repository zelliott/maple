zzso oxide zzso produced by the action of the zzso NO zzso plays a crucial role in zzso toxicity to pancreatic beta cells during type 1 diabetes zzso It was the aim of this study to analyze the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso beta cell zzso zzso of different zzso of zzso oxide zzso in zzso zzso cells and rat zzso was analyzed by quantitative real-time zzso and Western zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells was similar to that found in rat brain, while two other zzso namely the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not expressed in zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso and/or zzso induced zzso but not zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression was strongly decreased by the mixture of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both on the gene and protein level in zzso cells and rat zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso followed the pattern of zzso expression reduction and, on the other hand, of the zzso zzso The data indicate that a low level of zzso oxide originating from the zzso expression of zzso in pancreatic beta cells is not zzso In particular since zzso zzso reduce this zzso This zzso suppression can compensate for NO generation by low zzso of zzso through zzso zzso Thus, this zzso zzso expression level in pancreatic beta cells represents a protective element against zzso zzso
