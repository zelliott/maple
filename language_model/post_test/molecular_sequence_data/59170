To investigate the zzso repertoire associated with zzso we have created zzso display zzso zzso libraries from two clinically active zzso patients and from the healthy identical twin of one of these zzso The libraries from the lupus zzso twins were found to both include unusually large representations of the zzso gene zzso By panning with DNA, the zzso libraries each yielded zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso which are characteristic of lupus zzso These included a zzso zzso from the affected zzso that has a targeted cluster of zzso that potentially improves binding zzso The recovered zzso zzso zzso expressed the same zzso associated with the in zzso zzso zzso response of the respective zzso zzso zzso chain zzso experiments demonstrated a case in which the in zzso creation of zzso binding activity required restrictive pairing of a heavy chain with zzso light chains similar to those in circulating zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso could not be recovered from the library from the healthy zzso or from shuffled libraries with heavy chains from the healthy zzso These repertoire analyses illustrate how inheritance and zzso processes interplay to produce zzso zzso zzso
