The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an indispensable negative regulator for the zzso family zzso zzso zzso that play pivotal roles in various cell zzso To understand the molecular basis of the zzso regulation of zzso we zzso the crystal structure of full-length zzso The zzso crystal consists of six molecules classified as active or inactive states according to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso assembles the zzso and zzso zzso differently from inactive zzso and their binding pockets are oriented outward enabling the zzso zzso In active zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are tightly stuck to the zzso of the zzso domain to stabilize the active zzso and there is a direct linkage between the zzso and the zzso zzso In inactive zzso the zzso zzso are rotated destroying the linkage to the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the active molecules reveal that the zzso domain and the zzso of the zzso domain move as a zzso These observations suggest that zzso can be regulated through zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso provides a novel built-in zzso mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
