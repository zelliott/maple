zzso zzso are important DNA sequence variations because of the high frequency in the human zzso the deleterious effects on the reading frame and protein zzso and the association with disease and disease zzso of common zzso In a recent study with a human individual with the whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso such a large number of zzso zzso is zzso intensive and requires efficient zzso However, the current zzso for zzso zzso zzso cannot be applied to unprecedented zzso zzso and cannot be performed without reference sequences or reference sequence zzso for zzso zzso 

A new zzso for de zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in the direction of zzso the zzso sequence from the zzso or zzso zzso A universal zzso is zzso here, for zzso zzso zzso zzso size determination, and de zzso zzso of the zzso sequence without zzso the zzso DNA sequence from the reference sequence or reference sequence zzso 

The result obtained by this zzso is exactly the same as that obtained by zzso and zzso Unlike these zzso this new zzso is not zzso intense for large zzso is independent of sequencing technologies and applies to zzso data derived from all existing sequencing technology zzso A read of only 29 bases is enough to reduce the false detection rate zzso to 1 in a zzso 

This zzso is unique amongst all the existing zzso in terms of performing the task of zzso zzso size determination, and zzso zzso This universal approach eliminates the requirement of a reference sequence or sequence tracing and makes this zzso unique in zzso unprecedented zzso zzso Because of the high frequency of zzso zzso in human zzso this universal zzso will greatly reduce the time required for zzso data analysis in whole zzso sequencing of an individual for the practice of personalized zzso
