zzso is an zzso protein zzso that zzso the zzso specificity of zzso and promotes the zzso of protein zzso The zzso relationships of the zzso interaction have been explored by zzso DNA and protein chemistry zzso zzso binds to zzso at an zzso zzso on the zzso side of the zzso binding zzso This interaction interferes with the recognition and zzso of zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso also protects zzso from zzso by zzso zzso zzso The major zzso binding site on zzso consists of zzso zzso 5 and zzso In addition, zzso domain 4 is required for zzso to accelerate the zzso of protein zzso Some zzso molecules contain a zzso zzso zzso attached to a zzso domain adjacent to the cell zzso This modification is not required for the zzso activity of zzso but appears to contribute to zzso zzso zzso ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso factor V zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso also can affect the rate of zzso zzso by zzso III, possibly by competing with zzso for the zzso binding site on zzso zzso understanding of these interactions could lead to new strategies for the treatment of bleeding or zzso zzso
