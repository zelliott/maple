The zzso resistance factor zzso is a critical component of innate immunity against influenza A viruses zzso in zzso Animals carrying a zzso zzso gene zzso differ from regular laboratory mice zzso in that they are highly resistant to infection with standard zzso zzso We identified an extraordinary zzso of the zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso which is unusually virulent in zzso zzso zzso was well controlled in zzso but not zzso mice provided that the animals were treated with zzso before infection, indicating that zzso exhibits normal sensitivity to growth restriction by zzso zzso multiplied much faster than standard zzso early in infection because of highly efficient viral gene expression in infected zzso Studies with zzso viruses containing defined zzso segments of both zzso and standard zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso all contributed to zzso indicating that efficient host cell entry and early gene expression renders zzso highly zzso These results reveal a surprisingly simple concept of how influenza viruses may gain zzso and illustrate that high speed of virus growth can zzso the zzso response of the infected zzso
