The zzso coli zzso encodes seven zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four of these have unknown or uncertain zzso their existence was unknown prior to the completion of the zzso coli zzso sequencing zzso The gene zzso one of these, zzso is located in a zzso zzso that encodes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a putative protein zzso zzso We have determined that zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso These reactions are sufficient to form a zzso cycle by which zzso coli can catalyze the zzso of zzso to zzso although the zzso context of this cycle is zzso The identification of zzso as zzso zzso zzso expands the range of reactions zzso by members of the zzso zzso
