An A in equilibrium with G transition in zzso III is known to differentiate zzso A and B of the cattle zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso III zzso containing the transition site was amplified by the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was then used to detect this transition and hence to zzso zzso the AT zzso in zzso A was readily distinguished from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be used to detect any single zzso zzso and thus is a powerful method of detecting genetic zzso
