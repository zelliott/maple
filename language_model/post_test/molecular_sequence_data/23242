zzso is a recently identified acute phase protein with zzso and iron regulatory zzso It has been suggested that zzso may be the key zzso of anemia of chronic zzso Our research group is interested in developing a diagnostic zzso to measure zzso in zzso 

The objectives of this study were to clone and sequence the canine zzso gene and to gather preliminary data about tissue expression of zzso in zzso 

zzso was extracted from fresh canine liver tissue and zzso was generated and zzso Standard reverse zzso zzso chain reaction techniques were used with zzso zzso based on sequence zzso between several other zzso The zzso acid zzso sequence was compared with known sequences in other zzso zzso expression of canine zzso was determined by Western zzso 

The canine zzso zzso sequence zzso a highly zzso protein of 85 zzso with 8 zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This protein was likely the precursor form zzso of a smaller zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that human zzso was more zzso with canine than with zzso zzso In dogs, as in people, zzso was expressed most strongly in the zzso Western zzso showed a clear band of approximately 9 zzso consistent with zzso zzso expression was also detected in canine kidney and lung zzso 

The results of this study establish the basis for future investigation involving canine zzso and suggest that the dog may be a suitable model for studying the role of zzso in human health and zzso
