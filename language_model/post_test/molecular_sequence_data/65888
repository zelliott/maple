zzso are functional molecules able to bind tightly and selectively to disease zzso offering great potential for applications in disease diagnosis and zzso zzso is a well-known zzso marker present in zzso zzso and is used in zzso and diagnostic zzso We report the selection of DNA zzso that bind with high affinity and selectivity an zzso zzso protein containing five repeats of the variable tandem repeat zzso zzso were selected using the zzso methodology from an initial library containing a zzso variable region for their ability to bind to the zzso form of the zzso zzso After ten rounds of in zzso selection and amplification, more than zzso of the pool of sequences consisted of zzso zzso which were zzso zzso and found to share no sequence zzso The binding properties of these zzso were zzso using zzso and surface zzso zzso The lead zzso sequence was subsequently used in the design of an zzso hybrid sandwich zzso for the identification and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Following zzso of the operating conditions, the resulting zzso zzso displayed an zzso value of 25 zzso a detection limit of 1 zzso and a linear range between 8 and 100 zzso for the zzso five tandem repeat zzso In addition, recovery studies performed in buffer conditions resulted in averaged zzso between zzso and zzso for all spiked samples, demonstrating the zzso of the zzso as a zzso in zzso zzso Our results aim towards the formation of new diagnostic zzso against this zzso marker for the early diagnosis of primary or zzso disease in breast, zzso and other zzso zzso
