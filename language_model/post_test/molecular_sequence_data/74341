The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and free zzso coupled by the zzso potential across the zzso membrane in the zzso The zzso regulation of zzso zzso activity is carried out in part through zzso zzso of a zzso zzso bridge in zzso zzso In order to investigate the function of the zzso regulatory domain and the zzso significance of zzso zzso for higher plants, we designed four zzso in the zzso regulatory domain of the zzso to create functional mimics of the permanently reduced form of the zzso While the inability to reduce the regulatory zzso results in lower photosynthesis and growth, unexpectedly, the results reported here show that inability to zzso the zzso may not be of any direct detriment to plant zzso performance or zzso
