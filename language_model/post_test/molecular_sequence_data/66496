zzso zzso are protein machines involved in protein degradation and zzso The common structural feature of zzso zzso is the formation of zzso zzso Recent work has shown that the function of all zzso zzso is based on an zzso zzso of zzso through the narrow pore at the zzso of the zzso This review gives an outline of known zzso principles of zzso machines that unfold protein zzso either before their degradation zzso zzso zzso or during their zzso from zzso zzso The place of zzso zzso within a broad zzso zzso of zzso associated with various cellular activities suggests that similar mechanisms can be used by other protein machines to induce zzso zzso in a wide variety of zzso
