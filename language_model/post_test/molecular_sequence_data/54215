zzso the zzso and zzso distribution of zzso is essential for zzso development in zzso However, the importance of such regulation is not clearly defined in zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is required for zzso An zzso zzso in the zzso gene causes arrest of embryonic cell division, leading to abortion of the zzso at an early zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso in egg cells and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso revealed that, in zzso zzso egg cells, zzso are zzso zzso although egg cell formation is nearly zzso After zzso and subsequent zzso cell division, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a significantly reduced number of zzso in its zzso cell compared with the wild type, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso proper zzso distribution of zzso leading to an arrest of embryonic cell zzso Our findings suggest that proper zzso zzso and zzso distribution are maintained by zzso and are vital for embryonic cell zzso
