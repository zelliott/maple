We show that, in zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein on several zzso contained within a zzso basic region of 25 zzso zzso located in the zzso part of the zzso zzso synthetic zzso is zzso by zzso at multiple zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also establish that zzso at zzso zzso has the ability to stimulate zzso DNA binding by zzso That stimulation is lost upon zzso by zzso To further zzso the mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso were zzso The results suggest that zzso of full-length zzso on the zzso zzso sites is highly dependent on the accessibility of the zzso sites and that a domain on zzso distinct from zzso is involved in binding zzso zzso we have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso region of zzso and adjacent to zzso zzso that interacts with zzso in zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Conventional zzso zzso zzso beta and gamma and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso were nearly equally susceptible to zzso by zzso The zzso zzso delta was much less sensitive to zzso The significance of these findings for understanding the in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso are zzso
