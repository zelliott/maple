zzso pH regulates zzso receptors through an unknown zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso pH remarkably inhibited zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso The zzso effect was zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have identified an zzso domain that is essential for zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso removal of the zzso group by zzso of zzso zzso to Ala or zzso abolished zzso of zzso currents by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso to another zzso zzso zzso produced receptors that retained partial zzso zzso In zzso zzso a single zzso of the beta zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso reduced zzso sensitivity, whereas the double zzso zzso almost completely eliminated the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso greatly reduced sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso pH can regulate the function of zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso domain consisting of zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso at the beta zzso plays a critical role in determining zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
