To date zzso zzso the precursor protein for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso has been studied extensively over a wide spectrum of zzso zzso A paucity of information exists, however, with regard to zzso in the avian class, where to date zzso from only one species, the domestic chicken, appears to have been fully zzso In the present study, we report the use of three clones of zzso to provide the complete zzso sequence of ostrich zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso acid zzso includes the zzso signal zzso of 17 zzso acid zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence in the overall arrangement of its zzso zzso to that found in other zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in ostrich zzso but some of them may not be released in the ostrich zzso zzso despite the presence of nine potential processing sites consisting of 2-4 zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of zzso acid for a zzso zzso acid at position 202 in ostrich zzso could prevent release of zzso To date the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been confirmed by direct isolation and characterization from ostrich zzso zzso In the present study, we have also identified zzso zzso and zzso in a single frozen ostrich zzso slice by means of zzso mass zzso When compared to a wide range of zzso zzso zzso ostrich zzso revealed a high level of zzso acid sequence identity zzso with chicken zzso which is the only other avian sequence zzso As with other zzso classes, considerable zzso differences were also evident between chicken and ostrich zzso which belong to different avian zzso zzso of ostrich zzso with zzso zzso counterparts is only moderate zzso whereas lower identities zzso are evident over a range of fish zzso
