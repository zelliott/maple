Previous studies of zzso binding zzso have established many crucial features that include important structural positions, zzso zzso and the geometric correlations with the binding site nature and zzso In this work, zzso frequency and zzso zzso analysis are used to explore the statistical pattern of the zzso in the zzso determining regions of human zzso In addition, Shannon's information zzso is zzso for the entire heavy and light chains and compared with zzso patterns to seek zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso are compared with reported analyses based on structural data and zzso contact point zzso based on zzso Data Bank zzso Observations derived from the present sequence analysis are consistent with previous structural based zzso In the absence of structural data, methods used in this work can be effective and efficient zzso tools used for identifying zzso that are important for zzso targeting and predicting the probable zzso acid distribution expected at these zzso The results in turn can be applied to help design or plan zzso experiments to improve the binding properties of zzso
