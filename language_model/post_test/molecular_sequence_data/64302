A novel zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso chimney sample collected from the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Japan, at a depth of zzso zzso The cells were irregular zzso zzso to zzso zzso m in zzso occurring zzso or in pairs, and stained zzso Growth was observed between 70 and 97 degrees C zzso 85 degrees zzso 220 zzso doubling time), pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso It was a strictly zzso zzso capable of growing on complex zzso zzso such as zzso extract and zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso sequence of the isolate indicated that the isolate was closely related to zzso zzso strain zzso However, no significant genetic zzso was observed between them by zzso zzso On the basis of the molecular and zzso traits of the new zzso the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
