zzso is loaded into the zzso in the minor veins of leaves before zzso Two active, zzso loading mechanisms have been zzso One involves zzso zzso transfer from the zzso into the sieve zzso cell complex, so-called zzso zzso In the putative second zzso zzso follows an entirely zzso pathway, and the zzso concentration is elevated by the synthesis of zzso and zzso in the zzso not by zzso zzso Several zzso plants have been shown to be zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso leading to zzso of zzso and leaf zzso In this study we compared the effect of zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso a species that zzso zzso and zzso To test the effectiveness of zzso zzso we measured zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso in leaf zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the pronounced zzso associated with loading zzso In contrast, no such zzso developed when zzso was zzso in zzso zzso leaving minimal zzso transport zzso Only those plants with the most severe zzso zzso accumulated more zzso than usual and these plants were normal by other criteria: growth rate, photosynthesis, and ability to clear starch during the zzso The results provide direct evidence that the mechanism of zzso loading in zzso zzso does not require active zzso zzso from the zzso and strongly supports the conclusion that the loading zzso is zzso in this zzso
