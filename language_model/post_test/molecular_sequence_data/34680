A three-dimensional zzso structure of human zzso zzso zzso was modeled on the basis of the crystal structure of rabbit zzso the first solved X-ray structure of an zzso zzso zzso and was evaluated by zzso zzso and the zzso competitive inhibitor zzso into the zzso active zzso According to a previous zzso hypothesis described in the literature, the zzso group of zzso partially mimics the steroid backbone zzso zzso group of zzso and was oriented in a favorable position for zzso with the newly identified positively charged zzso zzso 119 and zzso In addition, this model is consistent with the recent combined zzso studies already published concerning the roles zzso and zzso in the zzso of the steroid A zzso
