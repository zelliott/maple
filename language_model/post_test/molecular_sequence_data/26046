We have identified a zzso zzso zzso sequence from a zzso zzso zzso gene that is the target for a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso transcribed from an zzso of the maternal gene zzso is efficiently zzso when injected into zzso zzso The zzso sequence lies between the zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso zzso in degradation are readily zzso Both the zzso and 3' products of zzso are recovered, thus showing that the zzso activity is an zzso When a zzso region of the zzso sequence is inserted into a second zzso box zzso that is normally stable, it is sufficient to zzso an identical zzso reaction on the hybrid zzso The zzso region contains a repeated sequence motif and is cut at multiple zzso zzso of translation does not affect the rate or extent of zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso complementary to the zzso region completely blocks the zzso Because most zzso are not found on zzso during zzso zzso zzso at such sites may provide a novel zzso mechanism to regulate the amount of zzso available for zzso
