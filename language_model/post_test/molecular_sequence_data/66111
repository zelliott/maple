Finding zzso peptides by mass zzso analysis to pinpoint gene zzso responsible for particular protein products is a major challenge in zzso especially in highly zzso gene families in higher zzso We used a combination of in zzso approaches coupled to mass zzso analysis to advance the zzso insight into zzso zzso zzso composition and its zzso zzso In zzso zzso of all 409 zzso protein sequences in zzso defined the proportion of theoretical zzso peptides for each gene family and highlighted the need for low zzso zzso of zzso zzso selection for zzso to characterize low molecular weight, highly basic zzso zzso We undertook an extensive zzso survey of the zzso zzso using zzso and, when required, zzso and zzso We then used custom software to extract and filter zzso match information from zzso result files and implement high confidence criteria for calling zzso identifications based on the highest quality zzso zzso matching exclusively to certain in zzso predicted zzso or gene zzso zzso This provided an in-depth analysis of the protein composition based on zzso high quality zzso zzso matching to zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso These identified peptides from five gene families of zzso proteins not identified zzso providing experimental data on 79 of the 80 different types of zzso zzso We provide strong evidence for zzso identification of 87 different zzso proteins from these 79 zzso We also provide new information on 30 specific sites of zzso and zzso modification of zzso proteins in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso modification data provide a wealth of resources for further assessment of the role of zzso modification in influencing translation in zzso
