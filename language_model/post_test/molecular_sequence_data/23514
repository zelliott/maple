zzso inherited microbes that spread via zzso are common pathogens of insects, yet very little is known about the evolutionary duration of these zzso The few examples to date indicate very recent, and thus potentially zzso zzso A zzso strain of zzso has recently been discovered in natural populations of zzso zzso The zzso effects of this infection are zzso approximately zzso of females are zzso infected females produce very strongly zzso sex ratios, and the resulting zzso sex ratio is significantly female zzso Using data on infection prevalence and zzso transmission rates, infected zzso lineages are estimated to experience a approximately zzso selective advantage relative to zzso zzso The evolutionary history of this infection was explored by surveying patterns of zzso in both the host and zzso zzso comparing the zzso zzso gene and the host zzso zzso gene to five host nuclear zzso zzso data suggest that this zzso infection is zzso old, a conclusion supported with a simple model of zzso and zzso transmission zzso Despite a large effective population size of the host species and strong selection to evolve resistance, the zzso zzso association is likely at a stable equilibrium that is maintained by imperfect maternal transmission of the bacteria rather than partial resistance in the host zzso
