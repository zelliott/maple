The zzso zzso zzso zzso a key step in zzso metabolism converting zzso to zzso which then can get zzso through zzso and zzso cycle thus allowing the cell to use zzso as a carbon and energy zzso As in many zzso a functional zzso of zzso exists in zzso zzso The zzso organization of the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso show high degree of zzso having both zzso and an zzso zzso The former is responsible for the conversion of zzso to zzso and the latter for zzso of zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso affects zzso organization, zzso stress response, zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso cells tend to zzso extensively as compared to the zzso zzso The excessive zzso in this zzso is reflected in its irregular and zzso colony zzso zzso strain is more susceptible to zzso stress when tested in presence of zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso essential for survival in the presence of zzso has not been reported to have defects in the absence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso shows these zzso during growth in the absence of zzso Thus a functional zzso is required not only for zzso metabolism but also for normal zzso zzso colony zzso maintenance of zzso integrity and for resistance to zzso stress even in the absence of zzso
