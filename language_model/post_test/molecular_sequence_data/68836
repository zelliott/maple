Human zzso virus type 2 zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso of viral gene zzso It differs from the related zzso zzso in certain aspects of its structure and zzso zzso zzso is composed of 130 zzso acids versus 86 zzso acids for zzso zzso Apart from certain zzso regions, there is little zzso between the two zzso They also differ in their ability to zzso zzso and zzso long terminal repeat zzso gene zzso As an aid to understanding its mechanism of action, the functional zzso important for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso gene expression were zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso important for its zzso However, zzso zzso differs from zzso zzso in that about zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso was not essential for its zzso function while zzso zzso zzso zzso is reportedly a part of its zzso zzso Similarly, about zzso of the protein at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not zzso A domain critical for zzso zzso zzso was located just upstream of the zzso zzso This segment is predicted to adopt an zzso zzso and also contains zzso zzso acid zzso thus, it may resemble zzso zzso zzso zzso found in some zzso zzso A region with predicted zzso zzso character located between the zzso and zzso zzso was also important for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that were zzso of zzso zzso zzso negative zzso did not display such a zzso
