zzso maps zzso reveal underlying sequence variation and facilitate the study of zzso and genetic zzso In general, zzso are produced by analysis of zzso zzso zzso segregation in large numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso the most common human zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that does not appear to undergo zzso Thus, standard methods for zzso mapping cannot be zzso We exploited naturally occurring zzso strains to determine the zzso of the eight zzso pairs in the zzso zzso laboratory strain zzso and in a clinical zzso zzso of the maps revealed that the clinical strain had undergone a significant amount of zzso zzso consisting primarily of crossover or gene conversion zzso zzso zzso map zzso revealed that zzso and zzso of the zzso cassette in essential and zzso genes can result in whole zzso zzso zzso is often used to construct zzso deletions of targeted genes in zzso zzso the exact mechanism zzso followed by zzso loss versus gene zzso has not been zzso zzso zzso into the essential zzso gene resulted in a large proportion of zzso zzso while gene conversion events predominated when zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso can be used to generate zzso which are essential for analyzing zzso zzso and zzso zzso events in this zzso zzso
