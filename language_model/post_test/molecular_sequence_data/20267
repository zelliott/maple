The small zzso zzso regulates zzso trafficking at the level of zzso Recently, the crystal structures of zzso in complexes with two unrelated zzso have been zzso The structure of zzso in complex with a zzso internal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein 1) has been zzso In addition, the structure of zzso with the zzso zzso has also been zzso In both complexes, two zzso from the zzso mediate binding to switch I, switch II and the zzso region of zzso Comparisons of the complexes reveal significant zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Thus zzso flexibility in the zzso mediates recognition of zzso distinct zzso coiled zzso providing a rationale for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
