zzso of higher plant zzso zzso genes is regulated at the zzso zzso and zzso levels, but the vast majority of the zzso and zzso proteins involved remain to be zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso by affinity zzso and corresponding genes have been zzso A majority of these proteins belong to a family of zzso proteins characterized by the presence of an zzso zzso motif zzso zzso They diverge in their zzso zzso suggesting that they can be involved in different plant zzso regulation zzso zzso zzso of the proteins was confirmed both in zzso and in zzso and by zzso zzso experiments showed that several proteins have a preference for zzso zzso This zzso protein family contains the ubiquitous zzso motif and has no known zzso counterpart in zzso zzso zzso and functional analysis suggest a common zzso with zzso zzso proteins zzso a family of zzso regulated proteins of unknown zzso As with several plant, zzso and animal proteins that have similar structures, the expression of one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein genes is induced by low zzso
