The mechanism of action of zzso peptides is still a matter of zzso The formation of zzso zzso oxygen zzso has been suggested to be the crucial step in the zzso mechanism of a number of zzso zzso including zzso 5 and zzso zzso In the present study we have investigated the effects of zzso 5 and of a more zzso synthetic zzso zzso on the generation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso using zzso as an indicator for zzso With both zzso a substantial enhancement of zzso was zzso However, zzso zzso a zzso zzso scavenger, did not have an zzso effect on killing or on the enhancement of zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso which have been reported to induce zzso in zzso were not able to enhance the zzso fluorescence, while zzso a zzso antiseptic agent, enhanced zzso zzso to the same extent as did the zzso Fluorescence zzso showed the zzso enhancement to be a consequence of the release of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso within the zzso It is concluded that zzso do not play a role in the zzso zzso killing of zzso zzso
