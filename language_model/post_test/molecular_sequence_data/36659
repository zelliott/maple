zzso are zzso cell zzso molecules which play a key role in zzso and zzso Two zzso clones (8 and 9) corresponding to two zzso zzso genes are present in zzso zzso We report here that these transcripts share a highly zzso coding region but diverge in the zzso zzso We have determined the pattern of zzso expression at the zzso level by in zzso zzso with a zzso complementary to the zzso domain of zzso zzso clone zzso This part of the sequence is the least zzso in the zzso gene family, minimizing the risk of zzso to other zzso zzso transcripts are not zzso in the first stages of zzso zzso first appears in the neural plate and reaches its maximum level in the zzso at zzso zzso From early zzso it zzso so that a very weak signal is detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is not uniform within the zzso with some areas such as the roof of the zzso and the zzso bulbs expressing higher levels of the zzso zzso is present in several zzso derivatives such as the zzso the zzso and the zzso It is, however, virtually absent from the zzso and appears in skeletal muscles at later stages of zzso All zzso express high levels of zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso are always zzso In the brain and the heart, high levels of zzso are observed with zzso corresponding to both copies of the zzso zzso genes in their zzso zzso region, indicating that both zzso are zzso
