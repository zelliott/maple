zzso reserve storage products consisting of zzso oil and starch are accumulated in a zzso coordinated zzso The control of the zzso storage protein expression has been shown to be zzso regulated and involves a series of positive and negative regulatory as well as enhancing gene zzso We have analyzed the upstream sequence of the genes zzso the soybean zzso the protein that zzso the oil zzso We have found that soybean zzso genes possess regulatory elements in upstream domain that are similar to those found in zzso storage protein zzso
