The tumor zzso gene zzso regulates multiple cellular responses to DNA damage, but the zzso targets that specify these responses are incompletely zzso We describe a zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that it can activate zzso from a promoter containing binding sites for human zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso inhibit both zzso in cultured cells and zzso zzso in developing zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene zzso contains a zzso zzso that includes a consensus zzso binding zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso from this site in zzso and a zzso of this site is sufficient for radiation induction in zzso These results indicate that zzso is a direct zzso target of zzso zzso following DNA zzso
