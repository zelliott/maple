In the sequences released by the zzso Genome Initiative zzso we discovered a new and unexpectedly large family of orphan genes zzso genes by zzso named zzso The distribution of the zzso genes on the five zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso contains more than 200 genes of this family zzso of the whole zzso The deduced zzso proteins are characterized by a surprising zzso organization of sequence zzso The zzso domain is made of a succession of three zzso motifs which generate an important zzso These proteins are classified into three zzso based on the length and nature of their zzso domain constituted by zzso zzso All the motifs characterized have an important level of conservation in both sequence and zzso A specific signature of this large family is zzso The presence of zzso in databases and the detection of clones in zzso zzso zzso libraries indicate that most of the genes of this family are zzso The absence of similar sequences outside the plant kingdom strongly suggests that this unusually large orphan family is unique to zzso zzso the zzso the potential function and the evolution of this plant zzso and modular protein family are zzso
