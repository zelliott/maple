zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso agents of progressive zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Only zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso play a role in zzso zzso while both zzso and zzso strains have been associated with zzso Monitoring and investigation of outbreaks involving these bacteria require sensitive and accurate identification and reliable determination of the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we report the development, zzso and performance characteristics of a multiplex zzso zzso for simultaneous amplification of up to three different targets, one common to all zzso zzso zzso one found only in zzso zzso zzso zzso and one common to zzso zzso zzso Based on analysis of 94 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 126 zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity is zzso for all zzso zzso of 22 zzso of other bacterial zzso and species commonly found in the zzso respiratory tract demonstrated a specificity of zzso for all gene zzso The limit of detection for simultaneous amplification of all targets is zzso of DNA per target, corresponding to a few hundred zzso or zzso zzso mobility in zzso gels and sequence analysis indicate the zzso are highly zzso The data presented establish this multiplex zzso as a reliable method for identification of zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso zzso that may greatly simplify investigations of zzso zzso and zzso
