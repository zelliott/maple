The cellular target of zzso B zzso a nuclear export zzso has been identified as zzso zzso 1), an zzso zzso zzso for the nuclear export signal of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso still remains zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso showing extremely high resistance to zzso had a single zzso acid replacement at zzso with zzso The zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso resistance on zzso zzso zzso and zzso no longer bound zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso bound zzso zzso zzso through a zzso addition, consistent with the idea that zzso binds zzso via its zzso zzso zzso to the zzso group of zzso When zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso the only cellular protein bound zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso an zzso agent, of zzso nuclear export probably was caused by zzso binding of the zzso structure in zzso to the zzso group of zzso because the zzso zzso showed the normal rate for the export of Rev nuclear export zzso proteins in the presence of not only zzso but also zzso These results show that the single zzso zzso determines zzso sensitivity and is selectively zzso by zzso leading to zzso zzso
