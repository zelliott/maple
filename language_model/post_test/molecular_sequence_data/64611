We have studied the structure and function of Human zzso zzso zzso through a combination of zzso methods and experimental approaches, including zzso fold recognition and zzso alignment for each structural domain using the zzso program zzso zzso gene expression and zzso interaction analysis of zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso screening for proteins that interact with human zzso Our structure prediction zzso zzso into four zzso a zzso zzso zzso domain, followed by a zzso region and a zzso region, and a zzso zzso zzso Gene expression and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso progression and zzso zzso zzso with these predicted functions, our in-house zzso zzso screen for proteins that interact with human zzso provides strong evidence that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso participate in the regulation of zzso organization, zzso control and zzso A zzso model of the zzso zzso domain was used to screen the zzso open compound database in zzso and chemical compounds with zzso acceptable properties were zzso Further medicinal chemistry compound structure zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
