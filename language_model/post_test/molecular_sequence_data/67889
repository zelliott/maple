zzso alpha motifs zzso are frequently found in zzso zzso An intriguing property of many zzso is their ability to zzso forming an open-ended zzso structure whose formation has been shown to be essential for the function of the zzso What remains largely unresolved is how zzso is zzso Previously, we had determined that the stretch of zzso zzso zzso to the SAM of a zzso protein called zzso zzso a member of the zzso group zzso of gene zzso plays a key role in controlling Ph SAM zzso Ph SAM with its native zzso created shorter zzso compared to Ph SAM attached to either a random zzso or no zzso Here, we show that the SAM zzso for the human Ph zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso also controls zzso SAM zzso but does so in the opposite zzso zzso SAM with its native zzso allows longer zzso to form compared to when attached to a random zzso zzso the zzso SAM zzso to Ph SAM also resulted in extending Ph SAM zzso Moreover, in the context of full-length Ph zzso replacing the SAM zzso with zzso SAM zzso intended to create longer zzso resulted in greater repressive ability for the zzso compared to zzso zzso These findings show that zzso SAM zzso evolved to zzso a wide dynamic range of SAM zzso abilities and suggest that rationally manipulating the function of SAM containing proteins through controlling their SAM zzso may be zzso
