A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a sea zzso zzso zzso collected from the South sea in South zzso zzso zzso was found to grow zzso at 25 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso trees based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso zzso species, zzso zzso with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing sequence similarity values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso % to the type strains of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was determined to be zzso zzso and its mean zzso zzso value with the type strain of zzso zzso was 13 zzso zzso zzso The differential zzso properties, together with the zzso and genetic zzso revealed that the novel strain is separated from other zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
