In order to determine whether the zzso zzso machinery of the zzso of zzso zzso can zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene of spinach was transferred into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso using the zzso expression zzso The zzso gene contains a zzso zzso which, like other higher plant zzso zzso does not zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was expressed at high levels, based on the zzso of the zzso however, spliced products could not be detected by Northern zzso or by zzso coupled with zzso zzso of the amplified products with an zzso zzso These results indicate that the spinach zzso zzso is not spliced in transgenic zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by cellular factors may be zzso zzso the zzso zzso machinery of zzso zzso is specific for trans spliced zzso
