zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso promoter revealed the presence of a DNA region highly zzso to the recognition site for the cellular zzso factor zzso A pair of complementary zzso containing the zzso site was zzso and used in gel zzso zzso to determine the role of the zzso protein in the regulation of the zzso gene zzso Using nuclear extracts from zzso cells as well as from lung and zzso tumors, we found specific binding of the zzso protein to this zzso This binding is elevated in zzso cells, in zzso lung and zzso zzso tumors as compared to adjacent normal zzso These results suggest that zzso could be implicated in zzso gene zzso regulation through its interaction with the zzso binding site of the zzso gene zzso
