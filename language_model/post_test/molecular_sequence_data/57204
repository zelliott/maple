The zzso structure of zzso zzso gene 4 zzso proteins was investigated using protein zzso and high pressure zzso zzso Studies were carried out with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of 4A which has similar zzso and zzso activities as the zzso mixture of 4A and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso Rosenberg, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Johnson, zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the smaller protein which has only zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso and zzso proteins with zzso zzso resulted in zzso species ranging from zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso time course, however, indicated that zzso were the zzso species to accumulate in both zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso and DNA binding on zzso of the gene 4 proteins was investigated using high pressure zzso zzso at increasing protein zzso In the absence of added zzso close to 100 zzso protein zzso were required to form stable zzso beyond zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analog of zzso zzso and zzso protein assembled into stable zzso at protein zzso less than 8 zzso zzso of zzso DNA further stabilized the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso DNA, zzso were observed at protein zzso as low as zzso zzso zzso protection experiments indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso protect about zzso bases of zzso zzso
