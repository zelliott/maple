Using a combination of gel zzso and zzso exchange zzso three different zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Each zzso transcribes from only one of the four promoters of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments identified the zzso factors responsible for recognition of two of the zzso The previously identified E zzso 49 transcribes from the zzso zzso promoter, whereas a novel species, E zzso 28, recognizes the zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the third zzso which transcribes from the zzso zzso promoter, is the previously identified E zzso zzso This level of zzso complexity supports the idea that zzso zzso zzso may play a central role in the regulation and coordination of gene expression in this zzso and zzso complex zzso
