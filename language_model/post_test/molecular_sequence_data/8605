In this report, we demonstrate that zzso B, a ubiquitous zzso factor, plays an essential role in zzso inflammatory zzso production in the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso Compared to the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso a stronger zzso of zzso B zzso zzso at early phase of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso B by zzso and zzso appears to be zzso by different signal zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso increased zzso expression in these cells for zzso II, zzso zzso oxide zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso This expression was attenuated along with the zzso of zzso B zzso
