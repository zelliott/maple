It has previously been reported that multiple copies of the zzso gene integrated into the zzso of zzso zzso are zzso at zzso II sites zzso during the zzso life cycle of the zzso while zzso genes integrated as single copies are not zzso Furthermore, zzso is correlated with zzso of the zzso We report here the zzso state of zzso zzso of the major part of the promoter region of the zzso gene integrated into the zzso of the multiple copy strain zzso during the zzso stage of the life zzso zzso zzso is sequence dependent, but the sequence specificity is complex and is different from the sequence specificity known for zzso and plants zzso and zzso The pattern of DNA zzso reported here is very different from that measured after zzso in zzso or in zzso zzso After the sexual cycle in those two zzso all the zzso of multiple stretches of DNA are heavily zzso This indicates that the still unknown zzso in zzso has a different specificity in the sexual and the zzso stages of the life cycle or that there are different zzso The pattern of zzso reported here is also different from the pattern of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso , the only pattern published until now in plants that has DNA zzso at zzso which are not in the zzso sequences zzso and zzso
