zzso of zzso zzso DNA via reverse zzso is thought to involve two separate template zzso zzso zzso DNA, a major product of in zzso reactions using zzso zzso is zzso prior to the first template zzso zzso zzso DNA, which is found zzso to near full-length zzso DNA in infected cells, is believed to be zzso before the second template zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso infection model, we report here the detection in acutely infected cells of a novel zzso zzso zzso DNA with a discrete length of approximately 650 base pairs, zzso at or near the left hand end of the right-hand zzso region of the zzso long terminal zzso The zzso of this zzso zzso DNA possesses the primer binding site sequence and appears to be zzso prior to the completion of the synthesis of its complementary zzso In contrast, the zzso of the zzso zzso DNA lacks the primer binding site sequence after zzso zzso We propose that a transient free zzso zzso DNA is released from its template by displacement synthesis and subsequently used as template for the synthesis of its complementary zzso The proposed transient free zzso zzso DNA may also mediate the second template zzso
