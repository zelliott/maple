zzso zzso is a 450 zzso adhesive zzso It is present in high zzso in the zzso zzso and can readily be zzso following zzso zzso where local zzso can be increased by zzso orders of zzso zzso is also zzso by a variety of other cells and is incorporated into their zzso zzso zzso is a zzso with a number of functional zzso at least four of which might serve as zzso recognizing zzso The zzso zzso binding domain interacts with zzso other zzso and zzso and likely recognizes specific cell surface zzso The central zzso zzso region, 210 zzso zzso and 70 zzso reduced, contains a zzso motif zzso which is apparently responsible for binding to zzso IV zzso with high zzso Immediately adjacent to the calcium binding region of zzso which zzso considerable molecular relaxation in the absence of zzso is an zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to bind to zzso of the alpha v beta 3 and alpha zzso beta 3 zzso The zzso region of zzso also contains at least one binding zzso for a cell zzso There are 2 well characterized genes for zzso and truncated forms of zzso have been detected which have zzso effects on zzso Finally, zzso can interact with zzso and zzso perhaps on cellular surfaces, which might serve as secondary zzso mechanisms for zzso binding and subsequent mediation of cell zzso
