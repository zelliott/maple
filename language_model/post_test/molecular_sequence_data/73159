The export of zzso coding for the structural genes of the human zzso virus type I depends on the interaction of the Rev protein with a highly structured viral zzso zzso the zzso element zzso To gain information about the structure of the zzso and the zzso of the in zzso zzso interaction, we have analyzed the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso within living zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso probing with or without zzso The in zzso structure in the absence of Rev is generally similar to the previously established solution zzso In addition, we observe a single zzso zzso zzso zzso located within the Rev zzso binding site, in zzso as well as in zzso The important zzso interaction between zzso 129 and 106 is required for the zzso confirming its biological zzso zzso of zzso Rev leads to a protection of this region and to modifications of the zzso zzso the zzso site becomes further zzso and Stem zzso is zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso protein leads to the same protections without zzso of Stem zzso Taken together with other zzso the data suggest that Rev captures the unusual zzso of the zzso site, followed by additional changes in the structure of the zzso
