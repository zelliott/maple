zzso inconsistencies between zzso zzso between different releases of probe set identifiers by commercial zzso platform solutions have been zzso Such inconsistencies lead to misleading or ambiguous interpretation of published gene expression zzso 

We report here similar inconsistencies in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso data, demonstrating that this is not an isolated zzso Moreover, the online information source zzso does not provide information required to track such zzso zzso even correctly zzso zzso when zzso after zzso was updated to a new zzso zzso release, will generate differing results without any feedback on the origin of the zzso 

The importance of unequivocal zzso of zzso experiments can not be zzso zzso greatly diminish the usefulness of the zzso Novel methods in the analysis of zzso profiles often rely on large disparate zzso stemming from multiple zzso The zzso and zzso power of such approaches rapidly diminishes if only zzso zzso can be used for zzso We present here the information that needs to be provided together with the raw zzso data, and the information required together with the zzso interpretation of such data to avoid inconsistencies and tracking zzso
