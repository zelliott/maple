The zzso protein zzso is a microbial surface component recognizing adhesive zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso that mediates bacterial cell binding to soluble zzso and zzso In scientific literature it is well established that the gene zzso for the zzso protein zzso is present in the vast majority of zzso zzso clinical zzso The present study aimed at investigating a group of new zzso forms of zzso gene identified in zzso zzso clinical strains isolated from zzso orthopedic zzso A zzso screening for the zzso zzso conducted on over two hundred zzso zzso clinical zzso from zzso infections revealed the detection of six strains exhibiting an altered zzso size, shorter than zzso In order to zzso the sequence changes present in these gene zzso the trait comprised between the zzso was analyzed in all six zzso bearing the modification and in four zzso exhibiting the regular zzso zzso A similar form of the zzso zzso lacking a DNA trait of 180 zzso was confirmed in all six zzso independently of their zzso zzso Interestingly, only three of these zzso all with type IV zzso of the accessory genes regulator zzso zzso showed exactly the same sequence and, thus, the same pattern of point zzso with respect to reference zzso From zzso translation, the corresponding zzso protein was found to lack an entire zzso segment of 60 zzso zzso From zzso sequence translation, this modification was found to zzso the disappearance of an entire zzso domain, whose functional significance needs to be further zzso
