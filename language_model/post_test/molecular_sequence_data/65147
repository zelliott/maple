zzso zzso zzso converts zzso a precursor for zzso zzso to zzso The protein comprises two functional zzso a zzso domain that removes a zzso group from zzso and a zzso zzso domain that reduces the zzso to carbon zzso As a first step toward deciphering the zzso mechanism of the zzso we have determined the crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso from zzso solved to zzso zzso The structure comprises two zzso As expected, domain 1 shares the same zzso fold as the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but, unexpectedly, the structural similarity between the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso extends to the C zzso of both zzso The active site contains a zzso of zzso that is positioned between zzso and zzso and that appears to mimic the zzso zzso We propose a zzso mechanism for the zzso reaction in which zzso zzso the zzso water zzso and zzso zzso the zzso group of zzso The structure also provides clues as to how, in the native zzso the zzso domain transfers its product to the zzso zzso
