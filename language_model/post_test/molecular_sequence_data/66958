The obvious difference in muscle growth and meat quality traits exists between Chinese indigenous pig and exotic zzso In order to study the reason of these zzso differences and search the potential gene related to growth and meat quality traits, zzso zzso differential display technique was used to detect the difference with zzso of zzso muscle tissue from maturity pigs of zzso in zzso Province and Large zzso One of the newly discovered expressed sequence tag zzso was analyzed by using zzso zzso The results zzso zzso nearly 2000 zzso fragments were detected with 30 primer pairs, and 6 zzso expressed zzso in the zzso muscle zzso from the two breeds were isolated and zzso The differential fragments were cloned and zzso The all sequences were recorded in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso was obtained with in zzso zzso system, the zzso analysis revealed that it existed as an 83 zzso complete open reading frame, and the zzso sequences were verified by zzso The analysis of in zzso expression profile showed that zzso is expressed in various growth stages and in most zzso and zzso such as soft zzso skin, skeletal muscle and zzso but with zzso expression zzso
