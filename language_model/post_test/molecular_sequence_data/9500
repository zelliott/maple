A zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso in size; was identified in the zzso isolate of zzso zzso Complete sequence of the zzso revealed a zzso segment zzso the 3' zzso zzso that is predicted to zzso a single large protein zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identities to the proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Like zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso comprises four zzso zzso including a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso These molecular characteristics suggest that this zzso represents a new zzso that we tentatively designate zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso clustered together into one zzso distinct from that of zzso and zzso indicating the existence of two lineages in the family zzso zzso of biological properties between zzso and zzso zzso strains did not reveal differences in colony zzso or zzso zzso under laboratory zzso
