zzso zzso catalyze the conversion of zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso units during the zzso of zzso An zzso implicated in the generation of zzso zzso was previously zzso to zzso from bovine liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present report describes the molecular cloning and functional expression of the lung zzso The cloned zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the isolated liver zzso showed this species to be a truncated form lacking a zzso zzso domain of the deduced zzso acid zzso The coding zzso insert was cloned into a zzso expression zzso and expressed in zzso insect zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso activity, measured as release of zzso from a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acid zzso Furthermore, incubation of the expressed protein with the appropriate zzso zzso resulted in conversion of approximately zzso of the zzso units into zzso zzso Northern analysis implicated two zzso transcripts in both bovine lung and liver zzso a dominant approximately zzso zzso zzso and a minor approximately zzso zzso Mouse zzso cells showed only the approximately zzso zzso A comparison of the cloned zzso with the zzso catalyzing an analogous reaction in zzso zzso revealed no apparent zzso acid sequence zzso
