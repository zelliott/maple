The zzso gene encodes a nuclear protein that has high zzso with zzso zzso is rarely zzso in human zzso The presence of a zzso regulatory zzso within the first zzso of zzso was recently zzso This zzso exerts zzso activity on zzso zzso by zzso We searched for possible zzso in this negative regulatory region in 45 zzso and 43 breast cancer patients and in 34 healthy zzso The study was carried out using the zzso method, and the zzso zzso detected were zzso The expression of zzso was analyzed by quantitative zzso and loss of zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso In several samples, we identified an zzso zzso that zzso to a deletion of 73 zzso in tumor zzso and normal counterparts, localized between zzso and zzso from the zzso start site of zzso zzso Among the 88 tumor samples, 35 zzso showed at least 1 zzso with the cited zzso versus 7 of the 34 zzso healthy donors zzso zzso zzso When we classified the patients according to the number of variations into zzso or zzso groups, the significance was clearer zzso zzso zzso No zzso was detected in the zzso zzso There was a positive quantitative correlation between the expression of zzso and the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that this zzso zzso is common in breast and zzso zzso and that it could alter the expression of the zzso gene with an additive zzso
