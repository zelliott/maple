zzso DNA sequences and zzso are useful tools for zzso as well as population genetic analyses of zzso zzso zzso tend to be less variable than nuclear zzso and therefore they may not be as powerful as nuclear zzso for zzso population zzso However, zzso zzso may be useful for zzso analysis between closely related zzso when more conventional zzso such as ITS or zzso sequence data, are not variable enough to resolve zzso relationships in all zzso To determine the limits of zzso zzso as tools in zzso zzso we need to understand their zzso Thus, we examined and compared zzso relationships of species within the zzso zzso using both zzso sequence data and variation at seven zzso zzso zzso Neither ITS nor zzso sequences were variable enough to resolve relationships within some sections of the zzso yet zzso zzso zzso were too variable to provide any useful zzso zzso zzso zzso was apparent, caused by base zzso within the zzso base zzso in the zzso regions, zzso in the zzso regions, multiple zzso within a fragment, and zzso zzso of repeat length resulting in zzso of identical base composition that were not identical by zzso
