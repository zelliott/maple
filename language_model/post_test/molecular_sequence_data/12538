A human zzso zzso zzso zzso library was screened for sequences zzso proteins related to human zzso inhibitor 6 zzso and two plaques were identified that displayed weak zzso at high zzso Isolation and characterization of the DNA zzso revealed two novel sequences zzso proteins composed of 376 and 374 zzso acids with predicted molecular masses of approximately 42 zzso The novel proteins displayed all of the structural features unique to the zzso family of zzso zzso including the apparent absence of a zzso zzso signal zzso The degree of zzso acid sequence identity between the novel zzso and zzso zzso significantly exceeds that of any other combination of known zzso zzso The two novel zzso zzso by the two novel zzso sequences have been designated as zzso inhibitor 8 zzso and zzso inhibitor 9 zzso The putative zzso center zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were identified as zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to be unique in that it is the first human zzso identified with an zzso zzso in the zzso center zzso zzso In addition, the zzso center loop of zzso exhibits zzso identity with zzso found in the zzso center loop of the zzso virus zzso zzso Two zzso transcripts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by Northern analysis in equal and greatest abundance in liver and zzso while the zzso zzso was in excess over the zzso zzso in skeletal muscle and zzso Two zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso were detected in equal and greatest abundance in lung and zzso and were zzso detected in all other zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in baby zzso kidney and zzso cells, zzso zzso analyses using rabbit zzso zzso indicated the presence of zzso in the zzso fraction of zzso zzso cells that formed an zzso zzso complex with human zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from the zzso cell zzso by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso Q fast protein liquid zzso and migrated as a single band in zzso gel zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit the zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and did not form an zzso complex when incubated with zzso The zzso zzso zzso that interact with zzso and zzso are zzso
