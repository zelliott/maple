Novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins have been identified in gut brush border zzso of the Aedes zzso aegypti zzso larvae by combining zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by protein identification using mass zzso and database zzso Three alkaline zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Other zzso binding proteins identified include the putative zzso raft proteins zzso and zzso zzso B zzso and zzso These identified proteins might play important roles in zzso the toxicity of zzso due to their location in the gut brush border zzso zzso protein was not identified, although zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso as a putative zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso larvae zzso zzso Zhang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso toxin of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 47, zzso Other identified proteins in this study that might have lesser roles include zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso zzso processing zzso and zzso which are likely zzso from zzso and are not brush border membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso was also identified as a protein that binds zzso Identification of these zzso proteins will lead to a better understanding of the mode of action of this toxin in zzso
