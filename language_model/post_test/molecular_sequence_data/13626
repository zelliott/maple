Following cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by cellular zzso which generates an zzso active zzso zzso zzso acids zzso This 37 zzso zzso zzso to the cell zzso where it zzso zzso factor 2 and zzso protein zzso A zzso hybrid toxin zzso zzso in which the zzso domain zzso zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso domain of zzso (the A chain or zzso has been produced in zzso zzso The hybrid toxin effectively and specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso A zzso folded into its native zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso cells was approximately zzso less than either native zzso or whole zzso However, the addition of the zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso to the level of the native zzso By zzso to zzso both zzso and zzso zzso would be zzso zzso within zzso domain II during cell zzso A single zzso acid zzso believed to disrupt an essential step in the transport of the zzso active zzso zzso to the cell zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso by approximately zzso Taken together, these data show that the zzso A chain component of the hybrid toxin requires essential zzso sequences at both the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Clearly, in the context of this fusion zzso zzso A chain cannot effect its own transfer to the zzso
