To construct a zzso zzso of zzso interference zzso of zzso triggering zzso expressed on zzso zzso gene and to explore the effect of zzso on the inflammatory response caused by zzso zzso 

Four target sequences were selected according to zzso zzso zzso zzso and then 4 pairs of zzso DNA zzso according to these target sequences and one pair of negative control zzso DNA zzso were designed and zzso These fragments were zzso into zzso zzso After being identified by zzso and sequencing, these plasmids were zzso into zzso cells to package zzso zzso The zzso zzso particles were zzso into Raw zzso cells and zzso expression in the zzso cells was zzso by real-time zzso and zzso Different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered in the zzso cells, and the cells were zzso with zzso for 12 zzso zzso expression was determined by real-time zzso and zzso at the time zzso 

zzso and sequencing confirmed that zzso zzso had the correct structure and could express high zzso of zzso After being zzso into zzso cells, zzso expression was knocked down significantly by all of these zzso zzso at both protein and zzso levels, and the zzso had the most efficient zzso zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and this increase was partly zzso in the zzso zzso cell models of zzso depending on the zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso of zzso was constructed zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso can inhibit the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso model caused by zzso zzso zzso
