Although zzso is a common clinical condition, treatment for this disabling condition remains limited and largely zzso Recently, it has been reported that zzso of zzso zzso with increased zzso vessel growth zzso However, the effect of zzso zzso on zzso has yet to be zzso Here we investigated the impact of local transfer of naked zzso DNA zzso human zzso zzso on two animal models of zzso one in the rabbit ear and the other in the mouse zzso In a rabbit model, following local zzso gene transfer, zzso expression was significantly zzso This gene transfer led to a decrease in thickness and volume of zzso improvement of zzso function demonstrated by serial zzso and finally, zzso of the zzso changes of the skin, the final consequences of zzso The favorable effect of zzso on zzso was zzso in a mouse tail zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with the proliferation marker zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso induced new zzso vessel zzso This study, we believe for the first time, documents that gene transfer of zzso resolves zzso through direct zzso of zzso This novel therapeutic strategy may merit clinical investigation in patients with zzso
