The ability to predict the zzso stability of proteins based on their corresponding sequence is a problem of great fundamental and practical zzso Here we report an approach for calculating the zzso contribution to protein stability based on the use of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in its linear response approximation version for zzso with a zzso constant, zzso and an effective zzso for zzso interactions zzso The method is applied to the test cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cold shock proteins with series of zzso and zzso It is found that the optimal values of these zzso zzso lead to very promising results, both for the relative stability and the absolute folding zzso Consideration of the specific values of the optimal zzso zzso leads to an exciting conceptual description of the reorganization effect during the folding zzso Although this description should be examined by further microscopic studies, the practical use of the current approach seems to offer a powerful tool for protein design and for studies of the zzso of protein zzso
