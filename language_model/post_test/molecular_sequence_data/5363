We have previously described the induction of zzso zzso major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso T cells zzso recognizing the zzso acid repeat region of the human zzso 1 zzso variable number of tandem repeats region zzso a zzso greatly increased in expression in breast cancer and proposed as a target for zzso In that study, zzso could detect zzso peptides associated with the zzso of all nine strains zzso and we now report the different zzso presented by five different zzso class I zzso The zzso were defined in zzso zzso using zzso zzso blasts or zzso class zzso L cells as zzso in addition, zzso binding zzso and T cell proliferation studies were zzso Within the zzso acid zzso nine potential zzso could be zzso The zzso for the four zzso class I molecules zzso (three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were closely zzso all containing the zzso acids zzso For zzso three zzso were identified, all containing zzso Most of the zzso did not contain a consensus motif for the particular zzso class I zzso and bound with low zzso compared with known zzso zzso zzso T cell proliferation also occurred to the same zzso class zzso zzso Finally, when conventional anchor zzso were introduced into the zzso zzso binding increased, whereas zzso recognition was either retained zzso or lost zzso depending on the zzso
