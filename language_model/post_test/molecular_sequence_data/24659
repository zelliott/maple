zzso form a family of zzso required for the initiation and execution zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimuli lead to zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso which in turn activate the common executioner zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Whereas crystal structures of several active zzso have been reported, no three-dimensional structure of an zzso zzso zzso is available so zzso We have determined the zzso crystal structure of zzso human zzso zzso and have zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso The overall fold of the zzso zzso resembles that of the active zzso zzso Each zzso is organized in two structured zzso connected by partially flexible zzso which zzso occupy and block the central zzso a typical feature of active zzso This zzso is incompatible with a functional zzso binding zzso zzso After zzso zzso within the flexible zzso the newly formed chain zzso leave the cavity and fold outward to form stable zzso These zzso changes are associated with the formation of an intact zzso zzso zzso this mechanism represents a formerly unknown type of zzso zzso zzso
