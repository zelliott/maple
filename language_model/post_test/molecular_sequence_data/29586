zzso are a group of zzso proteins that directly modify the mechanical properties of plant cell walls, leading to zzso cell zzso Within the completely zzso zzso zzso we identified 38 zzso sequences that fall into three discrete zzso Based on zzso analysis and shared zzso patterns, we propose a new, systematic nomenclature of zzso zzso Further zzso analysis, including zzso sequences found here in zzso pine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and moss zzso zzso indicate that the three plant zzso zzso arose and began diversifying very early in, if not before, colonization of land by zzso zzso related zzso sequences were also identified in the social zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso proteins have a very deep evolutionary zzso
