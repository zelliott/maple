Plant zzso zzso transfer proteins zzso are zzso by zzso families and possess zzso functions that remain zzso Our objective was to characterize the complete zzso gene family in rice and zzso and to perform wheat zzso database mining for zzso gene zzso 

In this study, we carried out a zzso analysis of zzso gene families in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and identified 52 rice zzso genes and 49 zzso zzso zzso Here we present a complete overview of the genes and deduced protein zzso zzso zzso repeats, which represent 26 out of the 52 rice zzso genes and 18 out of the 49 zzso zzso genes identified, support the complexity of the zzso gene families in these zzso zzso analysis revealed that rice and zzso zzso are clustered in nine different zzso In addition, we performed comparative analysis of rice zzso genes and wheat zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso in the zzso zzso We identified 156 putative wheat zzso zzso among which 91 were found in the zzso zzso zzso The 122 wheat zzso zzso were organized in eight types and 33 zzso Based on the observation that seven of these zzso were present in zzso rice and zzso we conclude that the major functional diversification within the zzso family predated the zzso zzso In contrast, there is no type zzso zzso in zzso and type IX zzso were only identified in zzso The reason for the larger number of zzso genes in wheat may simply be due to the zzso state of wheat but may also reflect extensive zzso of gene clusters as observed on rice zzso 11 and 12 and zzso zzso zzso 

Our current study provides fundamental information on the organization of the rice, zzso and wheat zzso gene zzso The zzso of zzso types provide new insights on zzso rice and wheat zzso gene families and will strongly support further transcript profiling or functional analyses of zzso zzso Until such time as specific zzso functions are zzso it seems relevant to categorize plant zzso on the basis of sequence similarity and/or zzso zzso
