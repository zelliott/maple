Members of the zzso family mature by a budding process in the zzso zzso The site of maturation is thought to be largely determined by the zzso of the two spike zzso zzso and zzso in this zzso Here we show that the signal for zzso the zzso virus (a zzso spike protein complex to the zzso complex resides in the zzso tail of zzso We constructed zzso proteins in which the zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso tail zzso of zzso virus zzso were exchanged with the corresponding zzso of either zzso zzso virus G protein zzso zzso chicken zzso or zzso all proteins readily transported to the plasma zzso The zzso were expressed in zzso or zzso cells by using either the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus system or the zzso Forest virus zzso The fate of the zzso proteins was monitored by indirect zzso and their zzso were compared by double labeling with markers specific for the zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso and zzso (including the 10 zzso zzso on either side of the zzso of zzso played no apparent role in targeting zzso proteins to the zzso zzso Instead, all zzso containing the CT of zzso were efficiently targeted to the zzso complex and zzso with zzso II, a zzso zzso zzso replacing the CT of zzso with that from zzso G resulted in the efficient transport of the zzso protein to the cell zzso Progressive deletions of the zzso tail suggested that the zzso retention signal maps to a region encompassing approximately zzso 10 to 50, counting from the proposed border between the zzso and the zzso Both zzso and zzso were found to be zzso as shown by incorporation of zzso into the viral zzso By zzso analyses of zzso zzso the sites for zzso were mapped to two closely spaced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso either or both of these zzso to zzso had no effect on the targeting of the zzso protein to the zzso zzso
