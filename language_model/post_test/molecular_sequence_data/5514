In this study, a large number of zzso zzso were generated and several zzso modified zzso zzso zzso to refine the previously proposed binding site model for zzso to its zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso studies, the functionality of zzso receptors was evaluated by assessing their ability to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso although deficient in binding in the concentration range of zzso used, remain functional albeit zzso less efficient than the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso production by zzso The zzso zzso is, apart from being deficient in zzso zzso also severely impaired in functional zzso While zzso and zzso seem to be important in forming the binding pocket for zzso zzso might play a role in forming or stabilizing the active zzso of the zzso zzso rather than directly participating in the formation of the binding pocket for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso have low affinity to zzso zzso but substantially increased affinity to the zzso zzso zzso This, together with the finding that an zzso substitution of zzso in TM III results in a tenfold decrease in affinity for zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso interacts with zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso in TM zzso a conservative zzso of zzso to zzso did not alter the affinity for zzso Thus, the interaction between zzso of zzso and zzso is likely to be of an zzso zzso
