zzso disease viruses zzso have a high rate of zzso and spontaneous zzso can be zzso isolated in the zzso In this study, plaque zzso zzso zzso vaccine strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso in Baby zzso zzso cell zzso in the presence of zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso raised in guinea pigs against the zzso and zzso whole virus particles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After serial passages under selective immune pressure, the viruses starts growing in the presence of zzso zzso and showed certain characteristics like an increased resistance to zzso by zzso and reduction in plaque counts on zzso in plaque zzso zzso of these viruses with zzso zzso revealed selection of three complete and one partial zzso zzso resistant zzso viruses based on the zzso value in zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected at several zzso acid zzso in the structural zzso zzso zzso Many of the zzso zzso to be positively selected sites in other zzso of this virus were also prone to substitution under immune selection pressure in zzso zzso The present work extends the finding that selection exerted by host zzso also plays a major role in the rapid evolution of zzso zzso as observed in other zzso
