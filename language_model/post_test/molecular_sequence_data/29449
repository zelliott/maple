zzso possess an unusual form of zzso lacking the light zzso The variable domain of these heavy chain zzso zzso is not zzso while the zzso domain of all other zzso forms a zzso with the variable domain of the light chain zzso held together by a zzso zzso Here, we analyzed the zzso properties of four zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two human consensus zzso zzso with different zzso zzso to gain insight into factors determining stability and zzso of zzso zzso We show by zzso unfolding zzso that the free energies of unfolding of zzso fragments are characterized by Delta zzso values between zzso and zzso zzso and thus lie in the upper range of values for zzso fragments from zzso and human zzso Nevertheless, the zzso fragments studied here did not reach the high values between zzso and zzso zzso of the human consensus zzso zzso with which they share the highest degree of sequence zzso zzso unfolding of the zzso fragments that were studied proved to be zzso and the binding affinity after cooling was fully zzso The melting temperatures were determined to be between zzso and zzso degrees zzso In contrast, the studied zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso at zzso degrees zzso In zzso the zzso zzso fragments are characterized by a favorable but not unusually high zzso Their hallmark is the ability to zzso melt without zzso probably zzso by the surface zzso characterizing the zzso zzso which allow them to regain binding activity after heat zzso
