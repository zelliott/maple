zzso and zzso zzso isolated from zzso water were zzso by the sequences of a large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as according to the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and single component zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene sequences zzso the small zzso of zzso zzso between the strains showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clustered similarly in zzso zzso zzso B, whereas in zzso zzso strains strong genetic zzso became zzso zzso zzso strains from zzso C and F were shown to possess the zzso zzso which was also detected in the majority of zzso zzso zzso B strains which use the zzso zzso for zzso zzso Six strains forming a separate zzso cluster were described as the first zzso possessing the Mop type zzso Two strains of this cluster possessed the genes for both single and zzso zzso and two had genetic zzso in the zzso zzso leading to the deletion of the zzso zzso Our data suggest that few central routes for the degradation of zzso compounds may emerge in bacteria as a result of the combination of genetically diverse zzso zzso
