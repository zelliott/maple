A zzso zzso zzso was identified from infected roots of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso It encodes a zzso protein related to the bacterial universal stress protein family zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is highly similar to the bacterial zzso of zzso zzso zzso which have been proposed to function as a molecular zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso was transcribed in all plant zzso and progressively during all stages of zzso Its transcripts increased significantly at 7 days after zzso which is 2 days later than the onset of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed more strongly in mature roots than in young roots regardless of zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso may have other functions in plant processes besides zzso
