The complete zzso sequence of the zzso of a bovine zzso zzso zzso has been determined using molecular cloning and DNA sequencing zzso Excluding the zzso tract the zzso was zzso zzso long and contained a zzso zzso region which at zzso zzso was longer than that of most zzso The single large open reading frame zzso a potential zzso of zzso zzso acids which showed considerable zzso with other zzso This zzso has allowed us to predict the possible zzso sites of the zzso and to identify other features of structural and functional significance which might help us to understand the constraints involved in the evolutionary divergence of these zzso
