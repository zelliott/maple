The zzso zzso specifying a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso was shown by zzso sequence analysis to result from substitution of zzso zzso in the wild type by Ala zzso in zzso This zzso was confirmed by chemical determination of the zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso lies at the zzso end of a 16 zzso sequence that is highly zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso and has the following consensus zzso zzso There was little zzso in the zzso for zzso zzso The zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso was increased zzso when zzso was the zzso zzso but only zzso when zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the wild type and zzso zzso were the zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso lower affinity for zzso as judged by the ability of zzso to inhibit the reaction in the presence of 10 zzso zzso Wild type zzso zzso is subject to product zzso by zzso but zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso It has been previously proposed that a zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and serves as a bridge to the zzso of zzso and zzso at the active zzso The zzso zzso appears to alter this zzso zzso zzso
