zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso zzso for the establishment and maintenance of the zzso junction zzso zzso of zzso by zzso a zzso derived zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso receptors on the zzso side of the zzso The zzso of zzso comprises three zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso related to those in zzso zzso the receptors for zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The structure reveals a zzso domain similar to zzso of zzso proteins but with a divergent zzso zzso An zzso zzso present in the crystal structure implicates surface zzso zzso that may function in zzso or zzso interactions to mediate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors at the zzso
