We have zzso the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify a transcribed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene at zzso zzso to investigate whether this locus is subjected to zzso in zzso zzso The zzso was amplified from zzso from 6 zzso zzso one zzso and corresponding samples of adjacent kidney or liver from individuals who were constitutionally zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso products revealed that both zzso were transcribed in all samples where both were present at the zzso level, indicating that the zzso locus is not subjected to zzso in zzso zzso or zzso
