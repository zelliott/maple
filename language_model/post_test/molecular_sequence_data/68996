zzso in the human zzso gene are linked to familial zzso zzso and to the progression of sporadic zzso and gastric zzso To gain insight into zzso function, zzso proteins were identified by zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso a zzso protein that was zzso and identified by sequencing as zzso a protein that binds to the cell zzso zzso zzso An zzso specific to zzso also recognized the zzso protein in the zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in cell zzso
