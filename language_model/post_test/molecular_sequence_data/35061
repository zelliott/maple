zzso zzso is an excellent model system for studying zzso zzso zzso in woody zzso plants due to the high amount of seed oil, which is important for food and industrial zzso zzso is the major form of stored lipids in seeds and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the final and critical step of zzso zzso Here, two novel zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were cloned from developing zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso had little sequence zzso to zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso restored zzso zzso confirming their biological zzso zzso of the two genes in zzso zzso led to zzso synthesis and an increase in total seed oil in transgenic plants, with zzso appearing to contribute to zzso synthesis at a greater zzso zzso of the expression patterns revealed that both zzso and zzso were expressed in the examined zzso and had similar zzso expression patterns with higher expression in zzso than in leaves and zzso The expression patterns of both zzso and zzso correlated with oil zzso in developing zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are both responsible for zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso
