zzso is a zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso The zzso genes which zzso zzso resistance to the zzso producer zzso zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso which are hypothesized to pump out zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has no zzso zzso zzso has several genes zzso to zzso It was found that the disruption of zzso a gene zzso to zzso resulted in hypersensitivity to zzso Resistance to other drugs such as zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso D, zzso and several zzso zzso were not changed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated in the presence of zzso have a single base substitution from A to G in the zzso binding zzso Northern zzso analysis and determination of the expression of zzso zzso fusion gene revealed that the zzso of the zzso gene was dependent on zzso function zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells in the presence of a low concentration of zzso induced increased resistance to zzso about two- to zzso although the mechanism of this induction has not yet been zzso It has been reported that a commercially available zzso is a mixture of several components and also contains zzso zzso A was zzso by reverse phase zzso liquid zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso A as those with crude zzso indicating that zzso substances were not responsible for the results obtained in this zzso
