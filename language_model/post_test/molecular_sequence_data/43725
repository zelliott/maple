The region of the zzso zzso encompassing the D7 divergent domain is organized within zzso in a patchwork of short conservative zzso features zzso with more rapidly evolving zzso It contains the attachment site of protein zzso zzso coli zzso which binds zzso in the first stages of zzso zzso suggesting a crucial importance of this region in zzso zzso and zzso A better understanding of its roles requires a good knowledge of its mode of structural variation during the course of zzso With this aim, we zzso the D7 region for 24 new zzso species belonging to zzso zzso zzso and eight other zzso zzso zzso Their comparison allowed us to propose refinements in previous zzso folding zzso A detailed analysis of the pattern of variation at each position both within the D7 region and along the zzso sequence by reference to previous zzso binding experiments gives new insight into the zzso zzso We identified in the D7 region and zzso respectively, six and five positions presenting a pattern of variation compatible with experimental results, three of which show zzso variations which support their possible involvement in the zzso zzso
