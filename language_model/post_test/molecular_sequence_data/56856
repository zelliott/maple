As part of an attempt to understand the zzso expression of zzso a major basic protein of bovine seminal zzso zzso we have characterized the bovine zzso zzso The compact gene of approximate size of zzso zzso is organized in four zzso and three zzso Regulatory sequences involved in regulation of zzso could not be identified by simple sequence zzso A putative promoter element zzso is located 29 zzso upstream of zzso zzso
