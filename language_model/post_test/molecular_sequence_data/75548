In previous studies it has been established that in zzso coli the three known zzso of zzso nitrate zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso From the zzso sequence of the zzso region of the zzso we conclude that, in addition to the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso contains two other open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso that zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to each of the genes in the zzso showed that expression of all four genes was similarly zzso The reading frames of zzso and zzso were verified, and the zzso sequence for the zzso fusion protein was zzso The zzso zzso therefore contains four genes designated and ordered as zzso
