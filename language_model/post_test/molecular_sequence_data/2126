The complete zzso sequence of a zzso pairs zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso able to complement an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso gap gene consists of a zzso open reading frame zzso with an zzso start zzso and ending with a zzso stop zzso zzso from the start zzso is a strong zzso sequence typical of zzso zzso Only one putative zzso zzso recognition signal zzso and zzso zzso is found zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso In zzso zzso of this signal is in agreement with the study of gene expression from different zzso of the original zzso 57 zzso downstream from the zzso stop zzso is a structure resembling zzso zzso termination zzso Although zzso zzso zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso coli, it contains several rare zzso for zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso presents several differences with the zzso acid sequence previously determined from the protein and is in better agreement with published zzso zzso
