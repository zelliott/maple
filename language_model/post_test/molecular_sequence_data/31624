zzso zzso is a zzso syndrome and one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and zzso The zzso mechanisms of zzso remain poorly zzso Recently, circulating zzso are considered as potential useful zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso expressed plasma zzso in zzso zzso compared with normal zzso 

zzso plasma zzso expression profiles were detected by zzso zzso zzso expressions between zzso and control group were zzso Next, four zzso expressed plasma zzso were chosen to validate their expression in other large scale samples by real-time zzso 

In terms of sequencing results, we identified that 51 zzso were zzso zzso Four zzso expressed plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected to validate the sequencing zzso zzso data confirmed the reliability of sequencing zzso The further statistical analysis showed that maternal plasma zzso and zzso are significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso is significantly zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso showed that there were zzso expressed maternal plasma zzso in patients with zzso These plasma zzso might be used as notable zzso for diagnosis of zzso
