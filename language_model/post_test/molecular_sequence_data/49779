An zzso vaccine for zzso was produced by designing zzso synthetic zzso zzso and selecting them for functional zzso The vaccine targets the binding site on zzso for the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso by active zzso The zzso target site on zzso heavy chain was selected from among the zzso acid sequences for the C zzso 2, C zzso 3, and C zzso 4 zzso These were zzso by zzso mapping studies for zzso to zzso and functional zzso A zzso modified from positions zzso of a loop region of C zzso 3 and subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that blocked zzso zzso zzso It was zzso by linkage to a zzso T helper site to produce a wholly synthetic zzso zzso This zzso was shown to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso release by zzso zzso inhibit passive zzso zzso and do not signal zzso zzso dogs experienced significant reductions in total serum zzso
