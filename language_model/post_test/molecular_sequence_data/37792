A secondary structure sequence is a symbolic string composed of three kinds of letters, indicating the zzso zzso and zzso (including zzso zzso A graphic representation for this abstract symbolic sequence is proposed here, called the S zzso The S curve is the unique representation for a given secondary structure sequence in the sense that the sequence and the S curve can be uniquely determined from the zzso zzso the S curve contains all the information that the secondary structure sequence zzso Different geometrical properties of the S curve are studied in details, which reflect the basic characteristics of the secondary structure zzso The S zzso are used to display, analyze, and compare the secondary structure zzso zzso application examples are zzso One advantage of the S curve methodology is that the main patterns of a given secondary structure sequence can be zzso quickly in a zzso zzso This is particularly useful in the cases in which longer sequences are involved and structures of proteins are zzso
