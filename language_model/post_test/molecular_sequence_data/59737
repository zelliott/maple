We have cloned and zzso the zzso properties of two closely linked zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso These genes zzso a structural zzso and a putative zzso regulator of the virus, zzso The zzso gene is transcribed prior to and after DNA replication from a site located within the zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso Its zzso product, a zzso zzso zzso is zzso at a site containing consensus zzso zzso signals and mapping 87 zzso downstream of the translation termination zzso for zzso During the later stages of infection, two additional zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also transcribed through the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso that encodes zzso is initiated from three relatively closely spaced sites located upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is apparently transcribed from the promoter sequences of another gene located further upstream of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso transcripts have two zzso zzso The first site is the same as the one used to generate the zzso zzso zzso The second is located 4 zzso downstream of the zzso translation termination zzso zzso expression zzso show that the zzso gene sequences immediately upstream of the zzso zzso can direct expression of a reporter gene when the latter is zzso with the gene zzso the early zzso zzso zzso Thus, these sequences behave as a zzso zzso gene zzso
