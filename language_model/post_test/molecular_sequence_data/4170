We have used real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso to zzso the expression of the four tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso genes in mouse zzso during development and in the zzso Among the four zzso zzso zzso shows the most restricted pattern of zzso with highest zzso levels in brain, heart and zzso These data indicate that in the brain, zzso transcripts are temporally regulated during development, becoming more abundant than those of the other zzso after zzso Cloning of the zzso gene confirmed a zzso organization resembling that of zzso and zzso and like all zzso zzso is located within an zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protection analysis and zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso identified multiple zzso starts for zzso from brain and heart zzso The promoter region of zzso was functional in transient zzso analysis in mouse zzso zzso where it directed zzso expression that was zzso by zzso The zzso promoter contains consensus motifs for zzso and an zzso zzso box upstream of an zzso element that is in close proximity to a zzso start zzso zzso of the zzso box caused a zzso increase in reporter zzso More significantly, zzso of the zzso motif or zzso element almost completely abolished reporter zzso This first functional characterization of the zzso promoter shows it to be distinct from other members of the zzso family and provides insights into potential mechanisms controlling the tight zzso expression pattern of the zzso
