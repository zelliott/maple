zzso is a complex process that occurs in successive zzso zzso and zzso zzso and involves a highly regulated selective zzso zzso However, this process has not been well zzso at the gene expression level due to the absence of zzso cell zzso We previously demonstrated that the rat skeletal zzso gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also specifically expressed in zzso and zzso male germ cells from zzso zzso To zzso the promoter elements that regulate the zzso of the zzso zzso m gene zzso zzso we developed transgenic mice for a construct containing zzso zzso from the zzso promoter linked to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso and zzso amplification of zzso expression showed zzso activity in the zzso with a pattern during zzso development that was identical to the zzso zzso The zzso was also active in skeletal muscle but not in the adult heart in all the transgenic lines zzso zzso these studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso promoter contains sufficient sequences to specify temporally regulated zzso expression as well as zzso zzso
