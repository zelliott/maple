The enteric pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso causes food poisoning resulting in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion protein A zzso promotes zzso by functional motifs that trigger either mechanisms of inflammation or bacterial zzso During infection of zzso zzso cells, zzso was found to be responsible for the early zzso of zzso an zzso that is required for zzso zzso at a specific recognition motif that divided the protein into its two functional zzso and activated zzso in a manner necessary for zzso Other zzso zzso sites identified in zzso zzso appeared to be restricted to zzso zzso zzso which indicates that this may be a general strategy used by this pathogen for processing of its zzso zzso
