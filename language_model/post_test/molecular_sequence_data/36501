This article describes a new approach for determining the role of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso protein zzso in signal zzso zzso zzso was applied to zzso zzso cultured zzso from zzso rats, first to zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against G alpha protein zzso and 48 h later to record zzso responses to the zzso release zzso zzso The effectiveness and specificity of action of six types of AS were determined by their effects on the in zzso translation of alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso The specificity of AS could be enhanced by replacing zzso by zzso bases within the center core of AS and by maximizing the number of zzso against zzso zzso within the zzso of zzso A total of 59 out of 240 cells could be investigated using the sequential patch clamp procedure in the absence of zzso The typical decrease of the zzso calcium current in response to 10 zzso zzso was diminished or abolished by zzso in correlation with the zzso of in zzso translation of the alpha o zzso The typical increase of the zzso zzso current in response to zzso was abolished by AS directed against alpha zzso but not alpha o zzso Control experiments showed that culture conditions or loss of zzso affinity for zzso were not responsible for the loss of zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso receptors are linked via alpha o to calcium channels and via alpha zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
