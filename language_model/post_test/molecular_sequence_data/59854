zzso degradation within isolated rat liver zzso was studied in zzso with the aid of three zzso zzso specifically zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were used to minimize insulin zzso during zzso preparation, whereas the manipulation of zzso processing of insulin in zzso by zzso zzso (to zzso and zzso (to zzso permitted the study of degradation zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and kinetic analysis of zzso isolated from both zzso and zzso compartments allowed the determination of major zzso sites and the probable sequence of zzso zzso It was found that zzso is the ultimate zzso degradation product of all zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are able to degrade insulin to the level of its constituent zzso zzso zzso was also the only zzso product able to cross the zzso zzso zzso insulin degradation proceeds via two zzso zzso routes after zzso zzso of the zzso One zzso results from an initial zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso probably at zzso whereas the major route results from a zzso at zzso zzso zzso removes the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is subsequently zzso by an zzso activity to produce first the zzso zzso and then zzso The isolation of intact zzso zzso from the degradation of zzso suggests that further degradation of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso proceeds via zzso zzso zzso The zzso is then processed by several zzso one of which occurs at zzso
