A zzso procedure for zzso zzso from pig brain has been developed consisting of ammonium zzso zzso and zzso extraction of the crude zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso From zzso zzso pig brain, zzso zzso zzso was isolated with a yield of zzso and a purity of about zzso For sequence determination, the protein was zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some of the isolated peptides were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The blocked zzso was analyzed by mass zzso and by zzso acid analysis of a zzso zzso while the zzso was found in a zzso and a zzso zzso and confirmed by a zzso Y zzso The sequence contains 197 zzso acids with a zzso of zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso It has been compared to those of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso coli, as well as to proteins from sequence data banks that show zzso The sequence is discussed in the light of the known spatial structure of zzso zzso zzso
