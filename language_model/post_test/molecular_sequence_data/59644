We have characterized a human zzso clone carrying two zzso for the zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso which were zzso arranged on human zzso zzso zzso One is a processed zzso that showed a zzso zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso and possessed none of the zzso existing in the functional zzso zzso This zzso presumably arose by reverse zzso of a zzso zzso followed by integration of the zzso into the zzso The other is a zzso and 3' truncated zzso that showed a zzso zzso to a 3' region of the zzso 4 and to a zzso region of the zzso 5 of the zzso gene and did not have the zzso sequence between the zzso 4 and zzso Both zzso had the same zzso deletion as compared with the human functional zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso gene family, including the functional zzso gene and another zzso zzso located on a different zzso revealed that the truncated zzso exhibits the closest evolutionary relationship with the processed zzso suggesting that the truncated zzso was generated by zzso of the processed zzso after zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso zzso revealed that these zzso are located on the long arm of zzso 4, zzso
