zzso due to the zzso species zzso zzso has recently proved to be an important public health problem, with human cases reported in countries of the five continents, including severe symptoms and pathology, with singular zzso zzso and presenting human endemic areas ranging from zzso to zzso One of the singular zzso characteristics of human zzso is the link of the zzso areas to very high altitude regions, at least in South zzso The Northern zzso zzso located at very high altitude zzso zzso presents the highest zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso of the internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso of the nuclear zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso and the intermediate snail host zzso zzso suggest that both were recently introduced from zzso Studies were undertaken to understand how the liver fluke and its zzso snail host adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of the high altitude and succeeded in giving rise to high infection zzso In experimental infections of zzso zzso carried out with liver fluke zzso from zzso sheep and zzso the following aspects were zzso zzso development inside the egg, zzso of zzso zzso period, shedding period, zzso of zzso zzso number of zzso shed by individual zzso survival of zzso at the beginning of the shedding process, survival of infected snails after the end of the shedding period and longevity of shedding and zzso zzso When comparing the development characteristics of European zzso zzso and zzso zzso a longer zzso shedding period and a higher zzso production were observed, both aspects related to a greater survival capacity of the infected zzso snails from the zzso These differences would appear to zzso transmission and may be interpreted as strategies associated with adaptation to high altitude zzso
