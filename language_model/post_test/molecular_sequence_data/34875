zzso maintenance of zzso levels including prompt availability of zzso for translation in response to changing protein demands might be partly enabled by a system of zzso controls involving zzso zzso blocking zzso This article proposes a specific version of that control zzso zzso a zzso zzso folding from zzso of an zzso of one gene might and leading to an agent that zzso zzso of a zzso zzso Thus zzso of the first gene would automatically repress translation of the zzso On the basis of a zzso search, we suggest a possible example, zzso that zzso gene zzso might inhibit zzso gene zzso Part of an zzso from zzso folds to form a large, stable zzso and reverse complement of the hairpin stem (with approximately 280 zzso matches a zzso of an zzso in zzso This would be part of an efficient system to drive initiated zzso to its zzso zzso speaking, it replaces two control knobs with zzso Since repeats, some with many thousands of copies, occur throughout the zzso with complex zzso care must be taken before asserting that the presence of any repeat in any gene is zzso Our zzso example involves repeats, so experimental zzso is needed and zzso However, if it is found that the zzso zzso zzso of one gene folds into a hairpin that is processed into an agent that zzso a zzso zzso then the same type of control unit might be found extensively among zzso families of genes of many zzso
