In the zzso era, the prediction of protein function is one of the most demanding tasks in the study of zzso zzso learning methods, such as the support zzso machines zzso greatly help to improve the zzso of protein zzso In this work, we integrated zzso protein sequence zzso acid zzso and associated zzso properties into the study of zzso proteins zzso We developed the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso proteins that play an important role in the control of many cell zzso Each zzso predicts whether a protein belongs to zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso tests were performed on the protein data sets in which the sequences identity was zzso zzso Test results show that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso predictions are approximately zzso approximately zzso approximately zzso zzso The predictions were also performed on the ambiguous and negative data zzso The results demonstrate that the predicted scores of proteins in the ambiguous data set by zzso and zzso zzso models were distributed around zero, while most proteins in the negative data set were predicted as negative scores by all three zzso The score zzso agree well with the prior knowledge of those proteins and show the effectiveness of sequence associated zzso properties in the protein function zzso The software is available from the author upon zzso
