DNA isolated from the zzso zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to construct a zzso zzso DNA library employing the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for selection of zzso zzso The zzso library was transformed into an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient in the conversion of the zzso zzso intermediate zzso A to zzso One zzso zzso zzso was zzso DNA fragments from this zzso recovered by marker rescue, contained part of the zzso zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a piece of the original zzso insert zzso Transformation of these rescued DNA fragments into zzso zzso zzso resulted in production of zzso levels of zzso and abundant formation of zzso The gene responsible for this zzso zzso was identified by Northern zzso analysis and transformation with zzso DNA zzso The approximate locations of zzso initiation and zzso sites of zzso were determined by an zzso protection zzso and zzso sequence zzso The predicted zzso acid zzso deduced from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was compared with the zzso and zzso data zzso The search revealed striking similarity with zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso
