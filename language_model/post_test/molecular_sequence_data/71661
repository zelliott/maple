zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and was originally believed to be a zzso zzso In this study we have localized the zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso and present a zzso map indicating that the gene spans more than zzso zzso in the human zzso Furthermore, we show that message levels and zzso activity of rat liver zzso zzso are regulated in response to dietary zzso levels and that this regulation is coordinate with zzso zzso A zzso the zzso zzso of cholesterol zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is a zzso protein which requires the zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso for zzso to the zzso
