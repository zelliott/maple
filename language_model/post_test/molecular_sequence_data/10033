Low density zzso zzso zzso gene is regulated at the zzso level by the zzso level of zzso in animal zzso We have recently identified a 20 zzso long region zzso to zzso designated zzso 1 zzso participating in zzso expression of the human LDL zzso gene in the absence of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Chang, zzso Underwood, zzso zzso zzso and Kumar, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the minimal zzso sequence and to define the critical zzso required for function, a series of single zzso zzso were introduced in the zzso zzso zzso independent zzso were analyzed by zzso into zzso zzso These studies zzso the regulatory region to 14 zzso and demonstrate the requirement for essential zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso studies suggest that the zzso increase in reporter gene expression is possibly zzso through interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified zzso factors of approximately 50 and 125 zzso which we have zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the critical zzso zzso zzso decreased the formation of the specific zzso complex with the zzso sequence and abolished its binding to the zzso We conclude that direct interaction of the zzso factor with these zzso of the zzso element potentially contributes to zzso induction of LDL zzso gene zzso
