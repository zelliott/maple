We have previously shown that the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso is localized within a large zzso DNA cassette zzso the zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso inserted in the zzso By sequence determination of the entire DNA, we identified two novel genes zzso cassette zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso having a partial zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso The open reading frames were found to catalyze precise zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso integration of the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso when introduced into the cells as a zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso driven by a novel set of zzso represents a new family of zzso zzso zzso
