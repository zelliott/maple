We report the development of a new sensitive zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso using zzso derived from the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso to detect an zzso spread of prostate zzso zzso In 60 patients with a zzso prostate cancer, zzso and zzso zzso detected circulating prostate cells in 40 and 20 patients, zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease patients, zzso zzso zzso detected cells in 28 of 33 patients zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso detected cells in 17 of 33 zzso In patients with zzso cancer spread zzso and zzso zzso before radical zzso zzso zzso zzso detected circulating zzso zzso cells in 6 of 17 patients zzso which suggests that an zzso spread of prostate cells may occur early in prostate cancer zzso Altogether, these results suggest that the detection of zzso cells in blood may predict the development of cancer in patients without clinically apparent prostate zzso Nevertheless, the potential application and the clinical significance of detection of zzso prostate cells through the use of zzso zzso zzso need an extensive zzso zzso
