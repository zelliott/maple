Previous sequence analyses of the lycopene zzso gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso revealed that translation of its protein product in zzso coli began at the zzso start zzso We found, however, that this zzso could also be produced in zzso coli without the zzso start zzso zzso zzso of experiments using zzso Y zzso revealed that a zzso zzso zzso located zzso and 24 zzso downstream of the zzso could act as a potential start zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso zzso replaced from alternative zzso start zzso also displayed its potential as a start zzso although the strength as a translation initiation zzso was considerably zzso This finding suggests that zzso zzso especially one base pairing with the zzso zzso in zzso might be also able to function as start zzso in translation zzso Furthermore, zzso acid sequence alignment of lycopene zzso from different sources suggested that a Val zzso located within the zzso of these zzso might be used as an alternative translation initiation zzso In particular, presence of a zzso zzso located zzso and 12 zzso upstream of potential start zzso supports this assumption in view of the fact that zzso zzso or zzso can function as part of the zzso sequence zzso
