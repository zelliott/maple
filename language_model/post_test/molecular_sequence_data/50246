T4 zzso V zzso the zzso of the zzso bond of a zzso zzso in a DNA duplex and the zzso of the zzso by zzso We have previously identified a zzso site for the first reaction zzso zzso zzso by systematic zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 1992 in zzso and by zzso zzso zzso et zzso Science, zzso zzso zzso The results showed that replacement of zzso with either zzso or zzso acid completely abolished the zzso zzso We describe the investigation of the second reaction zzso zzso zzso using zzso two zzso of T4 zzso V plus a DNA mini duplex containing an zzso zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso abolished the second reaction, but replacement with zzso acid did zzso The pH zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the wild type were found to be zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso in position 23 may act as a general base in the zzso reaction of the zzso
