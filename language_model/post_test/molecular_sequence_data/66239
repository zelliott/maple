zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso into zzso acid, which is then converted to the zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso We studied the zzso expression of the zzso in rabbit zzso and its effects on the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso rabbits express greater amounts of zzso zzso and protein compared with zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso and zzso in the rabbit zzso was also reduced with zzso zzso synthesis was zzso in zzso zzso but decreased in zzso of zzso zzso 8- zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso synthesis decreased with age in zzso arteries from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The maximum zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso decreased in the order of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the maximum relaxation to AA (3 zzso zzso zzso decreased with age in the order of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso to sodium zzso was not significantly altered by zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso expression and activity are zzso with aging in zzso This decrease is paralleled by the reduced synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso relaxations to zzso and zzso
