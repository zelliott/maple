zzso is a putative component of zzso initiating zzso To further explore its zzso distribution in plant and animal cells, we have raised a zzso zzso zzso directed towards a zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of cell protein extracts with zzso reveals a zzso band of zzso 49 zzso in zzso and a 58 zzso band in zzso Although these zzso are comparable in size to forms of zzso detected previously in zzso and plant protein extracts by other zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso gives zzso patterns not previously zzso It zzso specifically with the zzso in zzso cells and with the zzso body complex in zzso Other zzso zzso label zzso zzso Because of the similarities in the size of the zzso recognized by our and other zzso zzso and a restricted zzso with known zzso zzso in zzso distant organisms, we propose that zzso recognizes a novel zzso zzso zzso
