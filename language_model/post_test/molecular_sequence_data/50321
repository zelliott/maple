zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to bovine serum zzso zzso was studied as a model to investigate protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were typically in the range of 40 to 300 zzso depending on the experimental zzso The addition of zzso or zzso did not change the zzso constant, indicating that zzso does not compete for the metal binding sites on zzso From zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso and zzso it was concluded that the presence of the zzso zzso is required for the observed zzso The zzso group in zzso accounted for the zzso mechanism because zzso was efficient in zzso zzso fluorescence, whereas zzso had no zzso zzso A large zzso isotope effect on the zzso constant of zzso and zzso with zzso strongly suggests an active role of the zzso functionality in the zzso zzso
