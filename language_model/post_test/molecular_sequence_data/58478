Most zzso proteins are nuclear zzso zzso as larger precursor proteins in the zzso zzso imported into the zzso and routed to one of six different zzso zzso across the outer and inner envelope zzso into the zzso is the major means for entry of proteins destined for the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Recent investigations have identified several unique protein components of the envelope zzso zzso These include two zzso proteins that appear to participate in the early events of import and probably regulate precursor recognition and advancement into the zzso zzso of imported precursor proteins to the zzso membrane and zzso zzso is accomplished by four distinct zzso two are zzso to bacterial and zzso zzso protein transport systems, one appears unique, and the last may be a spontaneous zzso Thus zzso protein targeting is a unique and surprisingly complex zzso The presence of zzso proteins in the envelope zzso machinery indicates a different precursor recognition process than is present in zzso zzso for zzso protein zzso are in part derived from the zzso zzso but are more unusual and diverse than zzso
