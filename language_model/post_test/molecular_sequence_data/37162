The zzso virus zzso zzso protein is a zzso regulator of viral gene zzso Like many zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso predominantly zzso viral zzso cargo from the nucleus to the zzso where it is subsequently zzso This activity likely involves a region of the protein that has zzso to the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene product, the first member of this class of regulators to be zzso However, zzso also contains a repetitive segment rich in zzso and zzso zzso that is zzso for its effects on zzso transport and zzso This portion of zzso comprised of zzso zzso repeats, shows zzso to the zzso domain of zzso a zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso by zzso that zzso zzso of the cellular zzso zzso To evaluate the intrinsic ability of zzso to regulate zzso we expressed and zzso several zzso protein derivatives and examined their activity in a variety of zzso zzso The full-length zzso protein bound zzso associated physically with zzso and prevented zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain significantly compromised all of these zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso domain was itself sufficient to inhibit zzso zzso and interact with the zzso Relative to its zzso counterpart, the zzso zzso segment bound zzso with reduced affinity and responded differently to zzso competitor zzso Thus, zzso represents the first zzso gene product expressed during the zzso cycle that can prevent zzso zzso In addition, the zzso repeat segment appears to be a zzso zzso motif capable of zzso with zzso and modulating zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso important for the control of translation and the cellular zzso zzso
