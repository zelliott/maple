The zzso mouse B cell zzso line, zzso expresses mixed zzso E alpha zzso beta d and classical zzso class II molecules on its surface, but normal surface I-A expression is not zzso Northern zzso analysis showed comparable amounts of A alpha zzso in zzso as compared to another zzso expressing B cell lymphoma, zzso which predominantly expresses I-A and zzso zzso analysis of zzso A alpha zzso revealed a single zzso difference in the signal sequence that would result in a zzso for zzso substitution at position - zzso In zzso translation of zzso A alpha zzso gave results suggesting that the signal zzso zzso prevented zzso of the A alpha protein across the rough zzso zzso which would provide an explanation for the lack of I-A expression in zzso I-A expression was restored by zzso a functional A alpha d gene into zzso Although I-A was expressed at high levels in some zzso in all cases significant levels of mixed zzso were still zzso zzso studies performed using zzso zzso and E alpha zzso beta zzso T cell zzso confirmed the levels of expression of zzso and E alpha zzso beta d respectively on the zzso and showed that these molecules were zzso An interesting observation from this study is the continued expression of significant levels of E alpha zzso beta d in spite of competition from restored expression of zzso
