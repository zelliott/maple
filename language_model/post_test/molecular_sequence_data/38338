Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso is thought to have several putative roles at steps prior to integration, such as reverse zzso and nuclear transport of the zzso complex zzso Here, we investigated new functional aspects of zzso IN in the context of the viral replication cycle through point zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso some of which are located at possible zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso of these zzso or zzso zzso had no effect on reverse zzso and nuclear transport of zzso but had a slight effect on zzso Of note, zzso in the zzso zzso motif zzso acids 186 to zzso proposed previously as a putative nuclear zzso signal zzso of zzso zzso did not affect the zzso property of zzso IN as shown by using a green fluorescent protein fusion protein expression zzso Instead, these zzso zzso resulted in an almost complete lack of viral gene expression due to the failure to complete reverse zzso This zzso was zzso by zzso zzso IN in zzso suggesting a zzso function of the zzso motif of IN in reverse zzso zzso at the zzso zzso 143 zzso resulted in partial impairment of completion of reverse zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Similar effects were obtained by introducing a stop zzso in the zzso gene zzso and additive effects of both zzso zzso plus zzso were zzso In addition, these zzso did not produce zzso terminal repeat DNA, a surrogate marker for nuclear entry, in zzso Thus, the possible impairment of zzso might occur during the nuclear transport of the zzso Taken together, our results identified new functional aspects of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso motif might have a role in efficient reverse zzso in both dividing and zzso cells but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso might be an important zzso for maintaining efficient zzso DNA formation in zzso zzso
