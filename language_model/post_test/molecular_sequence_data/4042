In order to identify T cell zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso responses to overlapping zzso peptides encompassing the whole zzso in zzso UK controls, Pakistani zzso patients and tuberculosis patients in both the United Kingdom and zzso This zzso has been described as zzso zzso although it has a hypothetical zzso in zzso zzso Human peripheral blood zzso cells were zzso with zzso for 5 days and zzso measured in zzso by zzso Some peptides were recognized more frequently by T cells from zzso zzso patients than those from UK controls, suggesting that such T cell zzso might have diagnostic potential, while other peptides induced greater responses among UK control zzso zzso cell lines confirmed that these zzso detected specific T cell recognition of these zzso However, many tuberculosis patients also recognized these potentially specific peptides suggesting that there could be a true zzso present in zzso zzso
