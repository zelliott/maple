Although much is known about the pathology of zzso zzso against zzso current understanding of its natural ecology is zzso This study evaluated the zzso of zzso in relation to its interaction with zzso zzso relationships between 44 reference and zzso zzso determined using zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso revealed a high degree of zzso similar to that found in zzso An zzso zzso in zzso zzso model was developed to screen the ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso differences up to zzso were observed between zzso and correlation between strain zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso presence of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and the abilities of zzso strains to zzso grow in zzso media and affect root growth differed between the zzso but only zzso production correlated significantly with ability to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso produced no effect on zzso zzso levels, regardless of the zzso Similarly, root zzso of zzso zzso impaired in plant zzso was not significantly higher compared with zzso This is the first systematic and zzso evaluation of zzso interaction with zzso
