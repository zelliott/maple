During the past few years zzso have been recognized as a widespread and significant component of marine zzso zzso and, more recently, the presence of novel zzso zzso lineages has been reported in coastal marine zzso zzso We investigated the relative zzso vertical distribution, zzso zzso and spatial zzso of zzso in zzso sediments collected from several stations in the Atlantic zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the relative abundance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso sediments zzso m zzso ranged from about zzso to zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso were constructed from 10 depth intervals obtained from zzso zzso collected at depths of zzso zzso and 4,500 zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences revealed the presence of a complex zzso population structure, whose members could be grouped into discrete zzso lineages within the two zzso zzso and zzso Comparative zzso zzso gel zzso profile analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments revealed a significant zzso zzso in the composition of the zzso zzso
