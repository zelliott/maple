zzso the identity and distribution of molecular changes leading to the evolution of modern crop species provides major insights into the timing and nature of historical forces involved in rapid zzso zzso In this study, we employed an integrated candidate gene strategy to identify zzso involved in the evolution of flowering time during early zzso and modern improvement of the sunflower zzso zzso zzso zzso of many genes with known functions in flowering time were isolated and zzso Then, zzso with previously mapped quantitative trait zzso zzso zzso or protein sequence differences between wild and zzso zzso and molecular evolutionary signatures of selective sweeps were applied as zzso criteria for narrowing down an original pool of 30 zzso This process led to the discovery that five zzso in the flowering locus zzso flower 1 gene family experienced selective sweeps during the evolution of cultivated sunflower and may be the zzso zzso underlying flowering time zzso Our findings suggest that gene zzso fosters evolutionary innovation and that natural variation in both coding and regulatory sequences of these zzso responded to a complex history of artificial selection on flowering time during the evolution of cultivated zzso
