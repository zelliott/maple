The location of zzso zzso protein gene of zzso zzso strain on its zzso zzso was confirmed by southern zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The crystal protein containing the component of zzso toxic protein was zzso The crystal protein exhibiting the zzso activity against larvae of Aedes aegypti was shown by zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA of zzso zzso strain was completely zzso with zzso restriction zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and transformed into the recipient cells of zzso coli zzso From zzso zzso four clones with zzso restriction zzso zzso highly zzso to the zzso zzso probe were obtained by in zzso zzso and southern zzso The zzso zzso restriction zzso insert was obtained in clone zzso and clone zzso and zzso zzso restriction zzso insert in clone zzso and zzso For zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was inserted in zzso in opposite zzso It contained zzso zzso protein gene zzso I) identified by restriction zzso map zzso The zzso zzso zzso insert in other two clones zzso and zzso zzso a part of the type II zzso protein gene which can be used as a probe for cloning of the type II zzso protein zzso
