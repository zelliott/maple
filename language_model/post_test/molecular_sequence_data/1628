The ability of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to cleave a variety of zzso was zzso We identified its gene on a cloned zzso DNA zzso by sequence similarity zzso zzso to the putative zzso protein zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to be identical to the zzso from the same strain recently described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso 2003, 46, zzso However, the zzso of the zzso expressed zzso showed several discrepancies to the referred zzso First, the zzso zzso zzso gene was found to have zzso identity with zzso from zzso coli in contrast to the zzso reported, therefore it was assigned to as zzso protein instead of zzso Second, we observed only low activity of the zzso towards zzso zzso instead of the zzso previously zzso Instead, we measured highest activity zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso as a zzso compared with the zzso of low degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso Altogether, the zzso showed high affinity to terminal zzso zzso linkages between zzso zzso The zzso values obtained for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso values for the conversion to zzso were calculated to be 5, 21 and 17 zzso per zzso of zzso zzso Growth of zzso zzso was supported by zzso of low degree of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas we observed no growth with highly zzso zzso zzso zzso
