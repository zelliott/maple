zzso virus open reading frame 10 zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso virus protein zzso can zzso zzso promoters from both zzso A protein sequence comparison procedure termed zzso cluster analysis was used to identify a motif centered at zzso near the zzso zzso of zzso that strongly resembles the sequence of the zzso domain surrounding zzso of zzso With a series of zzso fusion zzso we mapped the zzso zzso domain to the zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso fusion proteins demonstrated the importance of an aromatic or bulky zzso zzso acid at this position, as shown previously for zzso of zzso zzso by the native zzso protein was abolished when zzso was replaced by zzso Similar zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso of other zzso zzso cluster analysis correctly predicted zzso zzso of zzso and zzso that share critical characteristics of a distinctive zzso of zzso zzso zzso
