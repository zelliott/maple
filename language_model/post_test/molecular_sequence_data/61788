zzso are zzso zzso inherited zzso which are known for infecting the zzso zzso of many zzso Their prevalence in the large group of zzso however, is not known, except for zzso detection in the zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso in zzso zzso on microscopic sections of zzso zzso specimens indicated that zzso bacteria were restricted to zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso designed to detect zzso zzso genes of zzso were positive with specimens from all of five geographically independent zzso zzso breeding stocks and with three zzso species from another order zzso Family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, negative results were obtained with the two sexually zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso could be zzso from all zzso hosts with the exception of zzso zzso The zzso distances of the zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences reflected the zzso distances of the host organisms but the sequences of zzso were relatively closely zzso indicating that zzso infections took place after the zzso had zzso Our study confirms a zzso branch zzso zzso of zzso colonizing zzso and indicates that this group is a sister group of zzso A, the latter zzso a high diversity of host organisms within the group of zzso
