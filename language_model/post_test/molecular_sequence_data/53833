zzso zzso which detect various chemicals in zzso fluid, are localized to the zzso zzso surface zzso We hypothesized that expression of genes involved in respiratory function is zzso in the zzso By differential display, we looked for genes zzso expressed in zzso zzso and cerebral cortical zzso zzso clones of interest were isolated, and sequence analysis revealed that one of these clones zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso was composed of 374 zzso acid zzso and the predicted secondary structure displays a signal zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso domain in the center of the zzso An analysis of consensus sequences identified several zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso is high in the brain, and low in zzso liver and zzso No zzso protein sequence was found in database zzso Whereas the biological function of this protein is presently unknown, its structural features and high expression in the brain suggest that zzso may function as a novel zzso zzso in neural cells of the zzso
