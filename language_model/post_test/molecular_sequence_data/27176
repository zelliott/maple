zzso zzso are long zzso proteins or zzso complexes that provide specificity to the membrane fusion process by linking zzso zzso to target zzso Transport protein particle zzso is a zzso zzso zzso complex that acts as a zzso exchange factor and is present in two cellular zzso a 7 zzso zzso I complex required for zzso zzso and a 10 zzso zzso II complex that mediates zzso zzso In this work, we have identified zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso as a novel binding partner of the zzso zzso Loss of zzso or any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso leads to defects in the zzso recycling of zzso We show that zzso a zzso family member similar to the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso complex in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso the association of zzso with the rest of the zzso complex and alters the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These data support a model in which zzso acts with zzso and zzso to promote the assembly and/or stability of the zzso complex and regulate its activity in zzso trafficking zzso
