zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that interacts with zzso zzso its zzso by protein zzso C zzso and promotes zzso of the zzso zzso Likewise, a 22 zzso zzso derived from the zzso regulatory domain of zzso has been shown to interact with zzso zzso in a zzso manner and zzso its zzso by zzso zzso structural studies of zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso were initiated to characterize this zzso Analysis of nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange rates, zzso zzso zzso constants, and chemical shift index data show that, like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso remains a zzso in the zzso zzso complex, and each zzso has four zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso 4, zzso four zzso zzso 1, zzso loop 2, zzso loop 3, zzso loop 4, zzso and two zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso 2, zzso which forms a short zzso zzso However, in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso 4 is longer by five zzso than in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso exchange rates in zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are significantly slower than those of zzso zzso zzso Together, these observations plus zzso zzso correlations between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso support the notion that the zzso zzso binds in a region of zzso zzso which includes zzso in zzso 2, zzso 3, loop 2, and the zzso loop, and that binding of the zzso zzso interacts with and zzso the extension of zzso zzso
