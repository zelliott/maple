We have isolated and cloned a zzso that codes for one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso to the major induced zzso in zzso Analysis and comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence with the established consensus sequences suggested that this zzso represents a novel kind of zzso with an incomplete zzso zzso active site zzso zzso of zzso and its expression indicated that the zzso is significantly expressed in liver only after zzso zzso treatment, but zzso are zzso expressed at high levels in zzso and zzso The reported zzso sequence is highly zzso to the recently cloned brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but subtle differences throughout the zzso and distinct differences close to the resulting zzso suggest that they are different zzso regulated in different zzso A full-length zzso clone was expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells and the expressed zzso was zzso The zzso zzso activity zzso was induced zzso zzso to 1 zzso per zzso of cell zzso which was estimated to zzso to a specific activity of 250 zzso per zzso of zzso zzso Both the specific activity and the zzso chain length specificity were very similar to those of the zzso rat liver zzso
