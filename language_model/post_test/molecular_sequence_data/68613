A zzso cell model zzso expressing the zzso zzso in which to study the function and regulation of this zzso has yet to be zzso We examined zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso fusion cell line that zzso in a zzso state but can be induced to differentiate into zzso cells following zzso zzso treatment with 10 zzso zzso acid in low zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species in differentiated zzso cells, which was not detected in zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in differentiated zzso cells correlated with the appearance of functional responses zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in differentiated but not in zzso zzso In order to verify that the large zzso zzso zzso species in zzso cells truly corresponded to the mouse zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from differentiated zzso cells was used to clone the corresponding mouse brain zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained a single open reading frame that displayed high zzso zzso predicted zzso acid zzso zzso to the human and rat zzso zzso zzso When zzso into zzso zzso cells, this zzso was found to direct expression of a zzso zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that upon differentiation zzso cells express zzso zzso functional zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells will provide a useful cellular model system for investigating aspects of zzso differentiation leading to the development of sensitivity to zzso zzso
