We isolated a zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso By analysis of the protein coding region, zzso was shown to zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso that were interrupted by seven zzso Also, the precursor zzso protein was revealed to have an zzso zzso targeting signal of 35 zzso acid zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso which supports the fact that zzso encodes the zzso form of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso is present as a single copy in the zzso
