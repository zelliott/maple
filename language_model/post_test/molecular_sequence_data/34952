Three regulators, zzso zzso and a zzso zzso have been previously found to control expression of the zzso cluster for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe an additional regulatory zzso zzso zzso a zzso from the zzso zzso Its role in zzso regulation was confirmed by its disruption that dramatically affected zzso zzso However, zzso from the zzso promoter, directing expression of 22 zzso zzso zzso was not substantially affected in the zzso zzso A new promoter, zzso directing zzso of four putative zzso tailoring zzso was found to be dependent on zzso Moreover, analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed the presence of three zzso repeat sequences corresponding to putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso is directed by a single promoter, zzso which is induced after entry into stationary zzso zzso from zzso was absent in a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, and zzso was shown to bind specifically to the zzso zzso These results indicate a complex network of regulation of the zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso are involved in regulation of the core zzso zzso zzso and zzso in regulation of putative zzso tailoring zzso
