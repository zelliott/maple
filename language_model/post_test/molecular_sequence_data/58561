zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to form zzso which is the last common intermediate in the synthesis of the three aromatic zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso Despite the overall zzso reaction, zzso has an absolute requirement for reduced zzso In the fungus zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso activity able to generate reduced zzso zzso in the presence of zzso is an intrinsic feature of a zzso zzso In all bacterial and plant species investigated to date, zzso zzso lack an zzso activity and are zzso 8-10 zzso smaller than the zzso zzso zzso (on the basis of zzso The cloning of zzso zzso zzso and subsequent characterization of the zzso zzso expressed zzso indicates that, surprisingly, the zzso probably resides within a region zzso amongst both zzso and zzso zzso and is not related to zzso sequences which contribute to the larger molecular mass of the zzso zzso zzso This information directed this work towards the smaller zzso zzso zzso the sequence of which was known, although the protein has not been extensively characterized zzso Here the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso is reported in more detail and it is shown that the protein is also zzso With this knowledge, zzso zzso could be used as a genetic system for studying the zzso consequences of zzso The zzso relationship amongst known zzso is zzso
