zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso function in zzso of zzso In the present work, we investigated whether zzso is involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso detected in zzso as well as zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies also revealed the presence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed the same zzso zzso zzso anchored membrane zzso as the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso induced zzso proliferation in zzso cells, while the interference of zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso hence reducing the number of zzso zzso zzso with zzso by direct binding apparently involving the zzso region of zzso in the zzso zzso also zzso with each other, whereas the binding of zzso to zzso was not zzso Moreover, zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by chemical zzso We also showed that the highly zzso zzso domain of zzso was required for the zzso of zzso and indispensable for the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso plays important roles in zzso division and maintenance of zzso zzso in zzso cells, possibly in a concerted manner with zzso and zzso
