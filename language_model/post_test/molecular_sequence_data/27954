The zzso stress protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell proliferation and zzso responses in seven B10 zzso mouse strains with different zzso zzso To analyze T cell zzso on this zzso seven peptides corresponding to six predicted T cell zzso and one defined B cell zzso were zzso Mice were either zzso with the whole zzso and the specificity of the response was zzso in respect of the six zzso or mice were zzso with seven of the peptides and tested for zzso responses to the whole zzso The results showed that three peptides carried zzso to which mice responded following injection of the whole zzso and that zzso with two additional peptides could prime for in zzso stimulation with the native zzso The latter result indicates the feasibility of generating T cell responses to zzso zzso on proteins by zzso with zzso The zzso T cell responses were distinctly influenced by the zzso zzso of mouse zzso However, two peptides were recognized by several zzso mouse zzso and one zzso could be presented by both I-A and zzso zzso zzso with several peptides induced a zzso T cell zzso response to the zzso zzso protein isolated from zzso zzso The amount of zzso was influenced by the extent of sequence zzso between zzso and zzso coli proteins and the major zzso complex class II zzso used to present the zzso
