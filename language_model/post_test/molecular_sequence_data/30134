The repeating units of zzso zzso and zzso satellites have been zzso All three show properties that are characteristic of curved zzso zzso their migration in zzso gels is slower than predicted from their zzso and zzso they appear as curved molecules when zzso by electron zzso All three satellite repeats contain runs of zzso greater than or equal to 3 zzso that are likely to be responsible for their zzso From analysis of 20 different satellite DNA zzso we conclude that, in satellite DNA, zzso zzso show a high tendency to cluster in groups of three or zzso
