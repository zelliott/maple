The zzso factor zzso has emerged as one of the key regulators of zzso zzso In mice, it is zzso for primitive stages of blood cell development but essentially required for definitive zzso Using a conditional zzso strategy, recent studies have indicated that zzso is required for zzso of mouse zzso stem zzso Here, we describe and characterize the zzso zzso in a lower zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified in a collection of zzso zzso zzso exhibiting a failure of zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso predicts a zzso zzso zzso in the middle of the DNA recognition zzso of repeat 3 of the highly zzso DNA binding zzso In keeping with the findings in the zzso primitive zzso is not affected in the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, definitive zzso fails, resulting in the loss of all blood cells by day 20 of zzso Thus, the zzso fish lack zzso and other white and red blood zzso nonetheless, they survive for 2-3 zzso but show stunted zzso Because the zzso fish survive into early adulthood, it was possible to directly show that their definitive zzso is permanently zzso Our results, therefore, suggest that the key role of zzso in definitive zzso is similar to that in zzso and must have become established early in zzso zzso
