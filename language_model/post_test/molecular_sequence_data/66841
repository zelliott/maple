zzso caused by the bacteria zzso zzso contribute to diverse zzso in a variety of human zzso We previously used a systemic model of zzso zzso infection in mice to map three quantitative trait zzso that influence in zzso zzso differences between the zzso and zzso zzso strains of zzso One of these quantitative trait zzso zzso influences an zzso zzso difference in primary embryonic zzso isolated from these zzso Here we use fine structure mapping in zzso zzso carrying DNA from the susceptible parent to zzso the effect of zzso to a zzso zzso of zzso DNA that contains zzso and zzso two members of the zzso zzso family of zzso This class of proteins has been widely implicated in resistance to zzso pathogens in zzso We analyzed expression of zzso and zzso in parental and zzso embryonic zzso treated with zzso and found that relatively resistant zzso express more zzso than relatively susceptible zzso However, we also found that abolishing the expression of either zzso or zzso increases zzso of embryonic zzso to zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that, although a difference in zzso expression is likely responsible for the effect of zzso on zzso to zzso zzso both genes play a role in zzso resistance to zzso zzso
