zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is capable of utilizing zzso with chain lengths ranging from that of zzso zzso to that of zzso zzso as a sole carbon zzso Two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso have been shown to be involved in the degradation of zzso with chain lengths of from 10 to 20 C atoms in this zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso screening method and the screening of a zzso zzso library to identify genes involved in the degradation of zzso with C chain lengths longer than 20, which are solid at 30 degrees C, the optimal growth temperature for zzso zzso strain zzso zzso A library consisting of approximately zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and screened for zzso unable to grow on zzso zzso while simultaneously showing zzso growth characteristics on zzso zzso For 23 such zzso isolated, the genes zzso by zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies of one of these zzso designated zzso and zzso a putative zzso zzso confirmed its involvement in the zzso metabolism of zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso represents the first cloned gene shown to be involved in the bacterial degradation of zzso zzso of 32 zzso and zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso were also identified in other zzso zzso zzso zzso
