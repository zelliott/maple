Multiple sclerosis is an zzso inflammatory zzso disease of the central nervous zzso Disease mechanisms in multiple sclerosis at the molecular level remain poorly understood and no reliable zzso disease markers are available zzso The goal of the present study is the construction of a protein database of two-dimensional gel zzso zzso separated zzso fluid zzso proteins from multiple sclerosis zzso By means of liquid zzso tandem mass zzso 65 different proteins were identified from 300 zzso zzso of these proteins have not been reported previously on zzso gels of zzso Here we report on the identification of these proteins and discuss their potential relation to multiple zzso
