Modeling simulations have been performed on the four regular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to characterize the similarities and differences in zzso and zzso behavior as well as in calcium binding in order to progress in the understanding of the zzso properties of the parent zzso of industrial interest, namely zzso zzso and zzso This required the evaluation of the accessible zzso space for the zzso zzso of the four zzso using the flexible zzso protocol of the zzso molecular mechanics zzso The results were used to access the zzso statistics of representative zzso zzso as well as for the determination of the regular zzso zzso and their zzso zzso The surfaces of all regular zzso likely to occur for each zzso were explored for zzso binding using the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso chains exhibit a high specificity for calcium zzso and have zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso chains do not display any zzso for calcium zzso The results gathered from molecular modeling lead to a clear understanding of the different structural features that are displayed by the four zzso zzso
