The expression and distribution of zzso factor zzso small zzso proteins in kidney tissue was zzso Various zzso zzso were raised against zzso zzso 1 and zzso 6 and their specificity was zzso Using indirect zzso analysis of intact zzso zzso proteins were found to be predominantly expressed in kidney zzso as compared to zzso This result was further supported by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso human kidney zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso 1 and zzso 6 were detected in zzso human zzso and zzso zzso however, zzso 1 was more abundant than zzso 6 in these kidney zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and early zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso of zzso dog and human kidney using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso negative selection zzso We demonstrated that zzso 6 is associated with zzso and with zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso of human kidney zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and quantitative enhanced zzso Western zzso analysis, the zzso of the zzso 6 distribution in membrane and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was made and its predominance in membrane zzso was zzso By zzso with the functional role of zzso 1 in zzso protein zzso we suggest that zzso 6 may play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso and protein zzso by kidney zzso zzso
