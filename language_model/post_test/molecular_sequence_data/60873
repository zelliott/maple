Human zzso are composed of tandem zzso of zzso repeats with many zzso repeats at the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso repeats between zzso can be used to study zzso instability, but the difficulty in identifying zzso sequences close to the start of zzso zzso has hampered such zzso A zzso end, including a zzso and adjacent zzso that is zzso for its presence or absence in unrelated individuals has been zzso The zzso DNA shows strong zzso zzso to zzso including two expressed sequence zzso that are usually located in zzso regions of human zzso but not adjacent to zzso Since this zzso end zzso it has relocated at least zzso In zzso it forms the zzso of approximately zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of relocation is unknown but must have involved the zzso DNA rather than the zzso itself, as copies on zzso and zzso share the same zzso zzso The zzso patterns of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso repeat sequences revealed extensive zzso variation, such that 47 different zzso were observed among the 50 zzso zzso zzso related zzso differ by small changes in copy number at blocks of adjacent like repeats, as seen at the zzso zzso zzso Such differences are compatible with a model in which the majority of zzso arise by zzso mechanisms, in individuals zzso for a single copy of the zzso zzso
