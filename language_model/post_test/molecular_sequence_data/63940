We produced a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and tested its value as an zzso for zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was 58, 48, and zzso identical to those of zzso L zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso from patients infected with zzso zzso strongly reacted with the zzso protein and that zzso from patients infected with zzso zzso zzso reacted with the zzso zzso zzso against the zzso protein stained proteins zzso at about 37 and 28 zzso in zzso zzso adult zzso crude zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was located in the zzso zzso cells of the adult zzso and in zzso zzso The specificity and sensitivity of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso adult zzso crude extracts were assessed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso using serum samples from humans infected with different zzso including 50 patients with zzso and negative zzso The sensitivities of the zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso adult zzso crude extracts were 96 and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso adult zzso crude extracts were zzso and zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso zzso zzso zzso could provide a highly sensitive and specific zzso for diagnosis of zzso
