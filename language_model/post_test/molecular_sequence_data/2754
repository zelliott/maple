zzso secondary structure analysis was performed to understand the translation function of the zzso zzso leader, a zzso zzso zzso region found on all late viral zzso The zzso leader zzso the translation of viral zzso at late but not early times after infection and eliminates the normal requirement for the zzso initiation factor zzso or cap binding protein zzso Secondary structures were determined by probing zzso or 3' zzso zzso leader zzso under zzso conditions with various single zzso zzso and the information was used to generate a potential model zzso The resulting structure is attractive since it may explain the unusual translation behavior zzso by the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the first leader segment is predominantly zzso a property consistent with the ability to enhance translation and provide independence from cap binding protein zzso In contrast, the remaining two leader segments form a moderately stable zzso structure, except for a large hairpin zzso To confirm these findings, the secondary structure of the zzso leader was also zzso when it was attached to a large segment of a zzso zzso and was found to be very similar to that of the individual leader zzso These findings suggest several possible mechanisms to account for the translation activity of the zzso zzso
