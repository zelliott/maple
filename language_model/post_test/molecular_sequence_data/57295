This paper outlines a zzso approach for population zzso that offers several advantages over conventional Southern zzso methods for revealing zzso zzso zzso in nuclear zzso zzso are constructed from clones isolated from a nuclear DNA library, and these zzso subsequently are employed in in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso products are then screened directly for zzso by using zzso zzso zzso applications for this zzso approach, including potential strengths and weaknesses, are exemplified by two zzso data sets generated to estimate zzso zzso gene flow in the green turtle zzso zzso and zzso geographic population genetic structure in the American oyster zzso zzso zzso zzso of amplified products from 14 or 15 independent primer pairs in each species revealed zzso at several zzso that proved highly zzso in the population genetic zzso In general, the zzso zzso produced by this zzso approach will provide useful genetic markers for population studies, particularly in situations where simpler and less expensive zzso methods have failed, for whatever reason, to provide adequate zzso
