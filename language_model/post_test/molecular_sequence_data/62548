We have examined the zzso zzso properties of human zzso 2 zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso proteins as zzso with enhanced green zzso protein zzso We determined that zzso is exclusively a zzso protein with a single zzso zzso signal within the zzso zzso In addition, we noted that both zzso and zzso are excluded from zzso zzso protein zzso replication zzso in zzso zzso Surprisingly, we observed that cells in which zzso (but not zzso is zzso expressed prior to or shortly after infection with zzso did not express late zzso zzso Further investigation suggested this might be due to a failure to express zzso protein zzso from the zzso region, despite expression of another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a highly zzso region in the C zzso of zzso responsible for these zzso Thus our data suggest that zzso may play a role in modulating zzso of proteins from the zzso zzso
