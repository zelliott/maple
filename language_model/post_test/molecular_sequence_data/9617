zzso liver zzso is a zzso protein whose zzso zzso to zzso as the zzso For zzso zzso of the zzso possesses a signal zzso at the zzso zzso a zzso zzso sequence of 8 zzso acid zzso and the following zzso region of 17 zzso acid zzso The zzso signal zzso is replaced by zzso on a zzso leaflet of zzso zzso To characterize the zzso signal zzso for zzso zzso we constructed a series of deletion and zzso zzso zzso altering length of the zzso zzso sequence by zzso zzso zzso deletion and Ala zzso of the sequence showed that the sequence of zzso zzso were compatible for zzso zzso For zzso transfer to the zzso the optimum length of zzso sequence would be 8, being consistent with natural zzso The zzso sequence may play a role for leading the zzso correctly to the active site of putative zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso is more permissible than zzso Nevertheless, the length of the zzso sequence may influence efficiency of zzso modification by its positive or negative zzso
