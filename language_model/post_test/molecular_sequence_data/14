The efficiency of protein synthesis is often regulated zzso by sequences within the zzso To investigate the reactions of protein translation, we established a system that allowed real-time monitoring of protein synthesis using a zzso translation mixture and a 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso that zzso a fusion zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso tag, a portion of zzso D as a zzso and the zzso arrest zzso we could follow the binding of the zzso tag, while it was displayed on the zzso zzso to a zzso QCM over zzso Thus, we could follow a single turnover of protein synthesis as a change in zzso This approach allowed us to evaluate the effects of different antibiotics and zzso sequences on the different steps of zzso From the results of this study, we have determined that both the formation of the initiation complex from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the accommodation of the second zzso to the initiation complex are zzso steps in protein zzso
