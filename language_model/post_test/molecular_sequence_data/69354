zzso zzso zzso zzso exists as a large number of distinct strains differing in biological properties and with different zzso in citrus producing zzso Strategies such as zzso or cross protection, aimed at controlling severe zzso of the zzso require procedures to identify virus strains accurately and zzso To fill the need for a zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the use of restriction analysis of the zzso coat protein gene amplified using the zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' amplified a DNA copy of the zzso coat protein gene zzso 670 base zzso when used in a reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out using zzso prepared from field and indicator plants, or from zzso zzso prepared from crude zzso zzso of intact zzso All 51 zzso zzso tested produced an amplified product of the same size, regardless of country of origin or biological zzso zzso of the amplified coat protein genes with the restriction zzso zzso or zzso revealed sequence variation in the zzso zzso zzso provided the best discrimination between zzso defining seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups, some of which circumscribed sets of zzso with similar biological zzso Limited analysis of field zzso using this method showed that individual trees could contain zzso of zzso zzso as assessed by the recovery of several zzso types from individual zzso Single zzso transmissions of zzso usually, but not always, generated apparently pure single strains judged by the recovery of single zzso zzso
