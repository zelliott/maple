The zzso loop of zzso zzso plays an important role in the interaction of the viral envelope with cellular zzso and/or with other cell surface zzso To clarify this interaction we used a panel of zzso zzso zzso against zzso loop and synthetic zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso derived from the zzso regions of the zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A linear zzso zzso zzso was also zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso The binding abilities of the zzso and zzso peptides to various types of cells were investigated by using flow zzso zzso the principal region of the zzso loop involved in cell surface binding was analyzed by using zzso against the tip zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso loop in flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso peptides of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso can bind to various types of cells irrespective of their zzso and/or zzso expression in a zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso can scarcely bind to the zzso Using zzso whose zzso cover the entire zzso loop we found that zzso zzso can react with zzso but not zzso zzso and the zzso blocked zzso binding suggesting that the zzso of the zzso loop interacts directly with cell surface zzso
