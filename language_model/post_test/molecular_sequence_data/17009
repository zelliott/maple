Several naturally occurring peptides and zzso which include the zzso zzso 10, zzso and zzso A have been found to be potent zzso agents, causing cell death at zzso or low zzso zzso These compounds inhibit zzso growth, zzso the dynamics of zzso and induce the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso rings and zzso These peptides exhibit mutual competitive zzso in binding to zzso while zzso zzso the binding of zzso and zzso to zzso Despite the abundance of zzso information, the details of their molecular interactions with zzso are not zzso In this study, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular zzso studies, a common binding site for zzso 1, zzso 52, zzso 10, zzso and zzso A on zzso has been zzso Application of these same methods to zzso indicated no interaction between zzso and any of the zzso On the basis of the zzso results, a model for the mechanism of zzso disruption and formation of zzso zzso structures is zzso Both the active site and mechanism of zzso zzso predictions are in good agreement with experimental zzso
