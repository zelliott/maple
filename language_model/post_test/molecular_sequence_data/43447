The integral membrane protein zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli has been zzso unfolded in a zzso zzso system by varying the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso was monitored by circular zzso zzso and ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso When unfolding is monitored by measuring changes in zzso at zzso zzso two distinct zzso zzso are observed, indicative of a stable zzso When CD is used as a zzso probe, the resulting zzso curve contains only one major transition, which zzso to the first unfolding phase observed by zzso zzso The unfolding behavior of several zzso proteins in which the zzso zzso were selectively replaced made it possible to assign the first unfolding phase to a zzso event in a zzso domain and the second phase to zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso The zzso zzso fit well to a model which assumes two cooperative transitions and a linear relationship between unfolding free energy and zzso zzso zzso back to zero zzso indicates an unfolding free energy of 6 zzso for the zzso domain and 16 zzso for the zzso zzso The high apparent stability of the zzso domain could explain the high degree of tolerance to zzso acid zzso seen for zzso and other membrane zzso The approach described in this paper may be zzso to other membrane protein zzso
