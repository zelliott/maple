Most proteins within living organisms contain sugar zzso Recent zzso in cell biology have revealed that many of these sugar chains play important roles as signals for zzso recognition phenomena in zzso zzso In order to zzso the biological information included in the sugar chains and link them with biology, a novel scientific field called zzso has been zzso This review will give an outline of the zzso techniques for the structural study of the sugar chains of zzso the structural characteristics of the sugar chains and the zzso mechanism to produce such zzso Based on this knowledge, functional aspects of the sugar chains of zzso and of those in the immune system will be described to help others understand this new scientific zzso
