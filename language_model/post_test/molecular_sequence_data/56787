The Rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso procedure was used in order to investigate the zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This methodology revealed that in male kidney sequences typical of an zzso 1 zzso In the prostate though, instead of zzso 1, several sequences indicative of alternative zzso events and possibly differential promoter usage were zzso Furthermore, both in prostate and zzso transcripts having upstream of zzso 2, zzso 4 sequences were also zzso This implies that either the zzso gene is a zzso zzso gene having zzso 4 sequences both upstream and downstream of zzso 2 or that trans zzso of zzso zzso zzso primary transcripts occurs in these zzso
