zzso syndrome zzso is a predominantly zzso zzso disorder zzso by a distinctive zzso zzso zzso zzso breathing abnormalities and zzso zzso zzso is genetically heterogeneous, involving genes required for formation and function of zzso zzso Here we investigate the genetic basis of zzso in 12 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing in all subjects showed that six of them carried rare compound zzso zzso in zzso or zzso known zzso zzso In addition, three individuals zzso zzso were compound zzso for the same rare zzso in zzso zzso All three subjects showed a severe neurological zzso and variable presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso were not detected among 385 zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to zzso to the zzso transition zone, and to interact with several zzso gene products in a complex involved in the formation of the diffusion barrier between the zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also shown to affect barrier integrity, resulting in a reduction of zzso formation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso in zzso cause zzso reinforcing the relationship between this condition and the disruption of the barrier at the zzso transition zzso
