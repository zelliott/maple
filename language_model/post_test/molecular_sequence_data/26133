The zzso gene of zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library, constructed in the zzso zzso by zzso with a 170 zzso zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso This zzso includes a consensus sequence found in almost all species in which the zzso zzso zzso gene has been zzso The complete zzso sequence of the cloned zzso gene from zzso was determined and the zzso start sites zzso In the predicted zzso acid sequence there are regions of strong zzso to the equivalent genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso commune and Homo zzso Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of two zzso The precise length and location of these zzso was determined by sequencing the zzso zzso and comparing it with the zzso zzso zzso zzso regions showed obvious zzso to the consensus zzso and zzso boxes, and the zzso signal zzso The zzso gene is the second zzso gene that has been cloned and zzso This is the first time that zzso have been reported in zzso
