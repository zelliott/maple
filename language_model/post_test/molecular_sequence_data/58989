Nuclear receptors zzso are zzso zzso factors that mediate complex effects on development, differentiation and zzso They regulate the zzso of their target genes through binding to zzso DNA sequences as zzso or zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso by zzso are still poorly zzso although zzso factors zzso appear to be involved in zzso the zzso functions of zzso zzso has been identified previously as a protein that interacts specifically with the zzso binding domain of several nuclear zzso both in zzso and in zzso The characteristics of these interactions have led us to suggest that zzso might be a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso function zzso Using a zzso screening in zzso we have now identified two zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso that are mouse zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso Using zzso alpha as a bait in a second zzso zzso we have isolated zzso zzso proteins that are also very likely to be involved in zzso structure and function, as well as a protein structurally and functionally related to zzso zzso zzso zzso which was named zzso zzso Here we discuss how the function of members of the zzso family in the control of zzso could be exerted at the level of the structure of the zzso zzso
