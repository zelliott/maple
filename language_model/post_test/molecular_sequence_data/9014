zzso is known to repress the translation of zzso zzso zzso transcript which encodes a protein belonging to the group of S zzso for small) basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This repression is called zzso repression of translation zzso It is zzso through the zzso upstream open reading frame zzso found in the zzso zzso The zzso is reported for 4 other genes belonging to the group of S zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso closely related to zzso and carries a putative zzso in its zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso exhibits zzso zzso by its zzso in a manner similar to genes belonging to the S zzso group of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso transgenic expression of zzso lacking its zzso region containing the zzso leads to production of tobacco plants with thicker leaves composed of enlarged cells with zzso times higher zzso content compared to wild type zzso Our finding provides a novel strategy to generate plants with high zzso zzso
