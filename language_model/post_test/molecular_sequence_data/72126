We describe the zzso zzso and zzso mapping of the chicken zzso gene together with the construction of two counter zzso zzso zzso derived cell zzso One of these cell lines contains a zzso integrated gene zzso a zzso active zzso zzso and thus allows efficient manipulation of targeted zzso by zzso zzso These cell lines will enhance the utility of the zzso zzso cell line as a system for the genetic analysis of cell autonomous functions in zzso and as a tool for zzso zzso zzso
