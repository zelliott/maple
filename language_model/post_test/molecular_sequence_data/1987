zzso genetic zzso of DNA repair genes are good candidates for cancer zzso zzso We studied two genes coding for proteins removing small DNA zzso by direct repair zzso or zzso DNA bases by base zzso repair zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the functional zzso zzso zzso did not show any statistically significant association with lung cancer risk in our zzso analysis, but due to the relatively small number of individuals, strong conclusions on cancer risk association or lack zzso cannot be zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has not revealed any novel zzso but did find an alternatively spliced zzso missing zzso zzso Our search for zzso within the zzso region of zzso revealed three novel sequence zzso The functional significance of the previously published zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The less frequent sequence zzso of the zzso was associated with a modest zzso but statistically zzso increase of zzso zzso activity in the studied cell zzso This work points to the importance of studying the zzso elements of zzso as they may contain functional zzso with the potential for modulating risk of various diseases, including zzso
