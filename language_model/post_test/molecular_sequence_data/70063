Two zzso chain reaction tests for the detection of zzso viral zzso zzso in the principal North American insect zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso specific test used the highly expressed zzso protein 1 gene as the target gene and two amplification zzso First a zzso base pair product was amplified using an outer primer pair, then a second amplification using a zzso or internal primer pair produced a zzso base pair zzso This zzso zzso test was found to be very sensitive detecting an equivalent to 1 zzso unit of zzso viral zzso extracted from infected biting zzso The zzso specific test used a multiplex zzso approach in which five different primer pairs were used zzso Each pair was based on the variable outer zzso protein zzso gene of the five US zzso generating specific product which were easily identified by size zzso The sensitivity of the multiplex zzso was less sensitive than the zzso but sufficient for use with field collected zzso These tests provide valuable tools for zzso studies of zzso zzso
