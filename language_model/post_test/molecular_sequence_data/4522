We characterized the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso extension and zzso fusion analyses revealed that zzso has one strong and two weak zzso all of which are regulated positively by zzso and zzso by zzso The weak promoters became zzso when separated from the upstream region including the strong promoter that zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed with cells harboring the zzso zzso zzso which was enhanced by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso
