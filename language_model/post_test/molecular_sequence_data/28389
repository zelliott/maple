The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso derived from cloning a total DNA digest of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The DNA codes for a zzso a protein showing sequence similarity to the zzso protein of zzso zzso and an unidentified open reading zzso zzso experiments with a probe carrying DNA from within the zzso gene suggests a zzso location for the coding sequences in strain zzso and in zzso a zzso zzso of zzso in which the zzso is not zzso A zzso comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso indicates that it is a Class A zzso and that its sequence can be aligned with those of the characterized zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with only a few insertions or zzso The corresponding DNA sequence is, however, characteristically zzso suggesting that it is not a recently zzso zzso
