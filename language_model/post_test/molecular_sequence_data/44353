zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso has been reported to be regulated by three zzso family zzso the positive regulators zzso and zzso and the negative regulator zzso We show here that a fourth member of the zzso zzso family, the zzso zzso zzso also zzso regulates expression of some, but not all, nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression increases in a zzso delta zzso zzso with zzso regulation of these genes is the observation that zzso forms specific zzso complexes with zzso zzso and zzso promoter fragments in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso function is zzso however, only when a repressive nitrogen source such as zzso is zzso zzso delta zzso exhibit no zzso zzso with a poor nitrogen source such as zzso Our experiments also demonstrate that zzso factor gene expression is highly regulated by the zzso factors themselves in an zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso and zzso dependent and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso bind to zzso promoter zzso In turn, zzso expression is zzso dependent and zzso regulated but is not zzso regulated like zzso zzso expression is largely zzso independent, modestly zzso dependent, and most highly regulated by zzso Paradoxically, the high-level zzso expression observed in a zzso disruption zzso is highly sensitive to nitrogen zzso zzso
