A transient DNA replication zzso was used to identify genes located within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso zzso that influenced replication of a reporter zzso containing an zzso origin of zzso when zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso The viral zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were found to be essential for zzso The zzso region was zzso and open reading frames were zzso zzso zzso using zzso from this region identified a gene called late expression factor 2 zzso as the essential replication zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and exhibits zzso zzso acid sequence identity with its zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping using both Northern zzso and zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso was expressed at both early and late times zzso as a transcript of about zzso zzso The early transcript initiated approximately 30 zzso downstream of a zzso box, whereas the late transcript initiated from within a late promoter consensus zzso In addition, we identified three genes zzso for DNA replication including two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso which is the functional analog of the zzso zzso gene that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
