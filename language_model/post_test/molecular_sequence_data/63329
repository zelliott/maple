Human zzso zzso zzso zzso and its engineered zzso form zzso zzso zzso upon interaction with lipids in zzso We now report the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso which combines with zzso to form similar zzso zzso and may prove to be superior to human zzso zzso zzso for rapid zzso of zzso zzso receptors into zzso zzso bound zzso zzso We characterized zzso by zzso zzso native zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso difference zzso and zzso zzso We used electron zzso to determine the zzso and orientation of zzso zzso zzso prepared under various conditions and correlated stability and signaling efficiency of zzso in zzso with either one or two zzso We discovered that the specific activity of G protein zzso for single zzso zzso in individual zzso was nearly identical with that of two zzso per zzso under conditions where zzso and orientation could be zzso by electron zzso zzso zzso stability of zzso in zzso was superior to that of zzso in various commonly used zzso We conclude that the zzso system using engineered zzso zzso zzso is a zzso membrane zzso system for zzso receptors and discuss strategies for rapid incorporation of expressed membrane proteins into zzso
