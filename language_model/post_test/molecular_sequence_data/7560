A genetic cross was constructed from two parental zzso strains of mice, zzso and zzso which differ markedly in their plasma zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso values were measured in 184 zzso progeny on a normal zzso diet and on an zzso zzso zzso markers were typed at 126 zzso spanning all zzso except the zzso zzso analysis revealed significant linkage or suggestive linkage of zzso levels with markers on a number of zzso zzso 1 markers were linked to levels of total cholesterol zzso zzso and high density zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso 5 markers were linked to levels of total cholesterol zzso zzso and HDL cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso 7 markers were linked to levels of total plasma zzso zzso zzso and free fatty acids zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were linked to the zzso gene zzso score zzso and were highly correlated with plasma HDL cholesterol levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression influences HDL cholesterol zzso zzso studies suggested that structural differences in the zzso zzso of the two strains may contribute to differences in clearance of the zzso
