The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso Using the zzso against this zzso zzso zzso material was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were isolated from bovine brain and characterized to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso precursor proteins and zzso receptors 1 and 2 are expressed in all zzso species examined to date and are highly zzso Among many biological roles suggested for the zzso system, the possible zzso role of zzso in zzso and zzso analgesia has been most widely zzso zzso zzso peptides were found to exhibit analgesia and also zzso the zzso activity of zzso when administered zzso but zzso the zzso induced analgesia when administered zzso zzso peptides including zzso peptides were found to delay the rate of acid sensing zzso channels zzso zzso resulting in enhancing acid gated zzso raising the possibility that zzso also may have a pain zzso role through zzso The genes for zzso as well as zzso preferred zzso for zzso are highly zzso expressed in the rat zzso with the highest levels localized to the superficial layers of the zzso spinal zzso These two genes are also present in the zzso root zzso zzso though at low levels in normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso in spinal zzso and zzso of rats with peripheral zzso In addition, zzso zzso in the primary zzso was increased by peripheral zzso The findings from the early studies on the zzso and zzso modulating activities suggested a role for zzso in pain zzso and this possibility is further supported by the distribution of zzso and its zzso and the regulation of the zzso system in zzso
