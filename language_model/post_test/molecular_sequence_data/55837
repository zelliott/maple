zzso zzso and zzso peptides are zzso growth factors for small cell lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can therefore find clinical application in the treatment of this highly zzso zzso Six peptides belonging to a new class of zzso zzso zzso have been selected according to their characteristics evidenced on Swiss zzso zzso high binding affinity to zzso zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso of the zzso stimulus induced by zzso long-lasting effect and specificity for zzso zzso The six peptides were able to bind zzso receptors on zzso cells and to inhibit the growth of two zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso they did not inhibit the growth of tumor cell lines devoid of zzso zzso Two of them were tested in zzso on zzso cells transplanted into nude zzso The zzso carrying a Cab zzso zzso zzso proved to be completely zzso The second zzso with a zzso zzso zzso showed a moderate activity zzso of tumor growth zzso without any zzso The low zzso of this compound prevented the use of the higher doses in zzso
