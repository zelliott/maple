Among the zzso zzso induced in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells by the zzso II poison zzso there was a zzso exchange between the zzso gene and an unrelated zzso accompanied by a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso in both parental sequences were hot spots for zzso DNA zzso in zzso and the novel junctions formed were precisely as expected for a mechanism involving zzso exchange of zzso II zzso followed by zzso of the breaks and correction of zzso in the cohesive zzso The results are consistent with a role for direct zzso exchange in the production of zzso zzso by zzso zzso although more complex models involving zzso breakage and repair could produce zzso exchanges of similar zzso
