The 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene intervening sequence was into a human zzso zzso zzso gene which lacked an zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of the products of in zzso zzso in a zzso cell extract indicates that the intervening sequence is accurately removed to generate a mature sized zzso identical to that obtained from an zzso zzso Analysis of the transcripts obtained in zzso and in zzso shows that the U in the zzso zzso sequence is partially modified to zzso Total zzso isolated from cells infected with zzso zzso viruses carrying the zzso zzso genes is active in suppression of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso genes and a zzso zzso zzso gene containing the termination zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso functions as a zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of zzso zzso obtained from infected cells zzso however, that cells infected with the zzso gene accumulate less mature zzso than cells infected with the zzso zzso zzso
