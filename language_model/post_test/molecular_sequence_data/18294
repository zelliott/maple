The zzso and zzso exhibited by reaction of zzso B1 zzso with DNA as well as the efficiency of reaction are remarkable and suggests that a specific orientation of bound zzso zzso formation of the transition state leading to zzso zzso zzso We have compared zzso B1 and B2 with zzso zzso and zzso as to their binding with calf zzso DNA, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso B1 and B2 contain a zzso ring fused to the zzso ring of the zzso They have similar DNA association zzso and zzso with zzso as demonstrated by zzso analysis of association with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso mobility, and flow zzso using zzso oriented calf zzso zzso The less zzso zzso ring of zzso zzso and zzso reduces DNA binding affinity by approximately 1 order of zzso Nevertheless, binding studies with zzso and zzso suggest that zzso zzso and zzso also bind zzso by zzso To establish the existence of a relationship between the association of these zzso with DNA and zzso formation induced by zzso zzso we compared the yield of zzso zzso zzso from zzso B1 zzso and from zzso zzso zzso at three zzso of calf zzso zzso As DNA concentration is zzso two observations are made: zzso the number of zzso formed by either zzso B1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso is reduced with a zzso increase in formation of the respective zzso and zzso the ratio of zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso to those formed by an equivalent concentration of zzso B1 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
