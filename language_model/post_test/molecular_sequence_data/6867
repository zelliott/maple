The solution structure of a zzso form of zzso zzso has been solved using zzso zzso zzso The chemically zzso zzso analog zzso zzso zzso zzso has the same activity as that of native zzso Thirty structures were generated using the hybrid distance geometry and simulated zzso protocol using the program zzso The structure is zzso except for zzso zzso 4-6 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution about the average structure for zzso zzso is zzso A for the backbone atoms and zzso A for all heavy zzso The structure consists of a series of turns and zzso followed by a zzso beta sheet and a zzso alpha zzso The structure of the zzso is largely similar to the native zzso zzso structures previously determined by both zzso and X-ray zzso The major difference is that, in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso are zzso whereas they are zzso in the two zzso zzso The best fit zzso of the backbone atoms of zzso zzso of the zzso structure on the zzso zzso structures showed zzso differences of zzso and zzso A zzso The turn zzso zzso which is zzso linked to the zzso region, adopts a zzso in the zzso similar to that seen in the zzso X-ray structure zzso difference zzso zzso and different from that seen in the zzso zzso structure zzso difference zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
