zzso express zzso which are the zzso that zzso zzso resulting in cell zzso and release of zzso zzso have acquired stringent zzso zzso which have been attributed to cell wall binding zzso zzso Although it has been realized that zzso of zzso that zzso zzso bacteria target cell wall zzso structures, molecular mechanisms that zzso selectivity are not zzso A range of zzso derived from the secondary cell wall zzso of zzso zzso has been chemically zzso The compounds contain an zzso backbone that is modified by various patterns of zzso and zzso branching zzso The library of compounds could readily be prepared by employing a core zzso modified by the zzso protecting groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at key branching zzso zzso zzso for the binding the cell wall binding zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso were determined by surface zzso resonance zzso It was found that the pattern of zzso greatly influenced binding zzso and in particular a compound having a zzso zzso at zzso of the zzso zzso zzso bound in the low zzso zzso It is known that secondary cell wall zzso of various zzso may have both common and variable structural features and in particular differences in the pattern of zzso have been zzso zzso it is proposed that specificity of zzso for specific zzso is achieved by selective binding to a uniquely zzso core zzso
