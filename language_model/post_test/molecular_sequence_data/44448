The gene zzso the zzso and zzso transport protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned with the aid of the inverse zzso technique and used to complement the zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso was shown by the zzso of zzso zzso in whole cells and membrane zzso zzso transport via zzso in membrane zzso is driven by the zzso motive zzso The system has specificity for zzso and zzso but not for zzso acids or zzso The zzso gene consists of zzso zzso which translates into a zzso zzso zzso shows zzso identity to the zzso and zzso transport protein of zzso zzso and is also zzso to various zzso zzso of zzso origin, but the similarity between these proteins is confined mainly to the zzso zzso
