A viral zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso in the chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso has been shown by zzso transformation to be responsible for zzso zzso In addition to reduced zzso the zzso strain harboring this virus exhibits a diverse array of zzso termed zzso traits, which distinguish it from an zzso zzso zzso We have investigated one of these traits, suppressed zzso zzso transcript zzso Two different and opposing regulatory pathways appear to govern zzso transcript levels in the zzso zzso a zzso zzso was found to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and calcium second zzso zzso A second zzso limiting transcript zzso was shown to require ongoing protein zzso Additionally, changes in the level of zzso transcript zzso were found to be related to zzso of promoter activity and this activity was shown to be suppressed in the zzso zzso We conclude that this zzso virus interferes with zzso of an zzso signal that is required for stimulation of zzso zzso The zzso of such signal zzso pathways by zzso viruses may account for the zzso symptoms associated with zzso zzso
