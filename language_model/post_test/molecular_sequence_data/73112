The zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso is the consensus zzso targeting sequence 1 zzso and is sufficient to direct a zzso to zzso in zzso in plants, animals, and zzso However, there are also two sites on zzso zzso zzso from zzso bean zzso zzso zzso that bind the zzso zzso zzso the sequence of the last 12 zzso acids of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso It was hypothesized that one of these sites interacts with information other than the zzso To explore the sequence requirements for each zzso binding site, we tested the peptides zzso and zzso and found that they bound to the zzso site, but not to the zzso zzso When the zzso site was blocked with zzso zzso bound to the zzso site with a zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso In an attempt to disrupt zzso zzso two the upstream, positively charged zzso were replaced with zzso charged zzso to make the zzso zzso zzso did not bind to either site on the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso binds to the zzso site and that the zzso positively charged domain binds to the zzso zzso
