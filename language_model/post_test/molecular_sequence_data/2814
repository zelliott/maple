zzso DNA clones representing approximately zzso zzso of potato zzso virus zzso were generated, zzso and partially zzso Within one of the zzso clones an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso protein was identified and further zzso zzso acid sequence comparison of this protein showed significant zzso zzso with the barley yellow dwarf virus zzso coat zzso This and other observations suggested that this gene encodes the zzso coat zzso Other similarities were observed between zzso and zzso sequences in this region of their zzso including an zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso the zzso putative coat zzso
