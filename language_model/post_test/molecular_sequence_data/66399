zzso zzso zzso kidney disease zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso kidney and zzso disease 1) gene on zzso zzso The longest continuous open reading frame comprises 66 zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso integral membrane protein zzso of unknown zzso Various alternatively spliced transcripts may additionally result in different zzso Overall, the large size of zzso its complex pattern of zzso multiple zzso and lack of knowledge of the zzso zzso functions pose significant challenges to zzso diagnostic zzso zzso zzso particularly if residing in regulatory elements or zzso outside the zzso consensus sites, are often difficult to assess without further functional analyses and cannot be zzso classified as zzso zzso on the transcript level, however, are hampered as zzso is not widely expressed in blood zzso We thus determined the functional significance of the novel zzso site zzso zzso in zzso 2 by zzso analyses by zzso The zzso zzso was shown to cause skipping of zzso zzso Thus, given the zzso results together with 400 control zzso negative for this change, segregation of the zzso with the zzso and a significant lowering of the strength of the zzso site by zzso the zzso zzso is most likely zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that defines the consequences of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso the relevance of functional analyses in determining the zzso of changes of unknown zzso
