The zzso satellite repeat previously identified in zzso zzso zzso was thought to be present in zzso zzso and absent in zzso zzso However, we show here that zzso is also found in zzso zzso and is not useful for screening hybrid individuals bred in aquaculture or occurring naturally in the zzso zzso is a family of predominantly zzso zzso repeated zzso and zzso clones revealed zzso to species and little zzso zzso Analysis of zzso sequence divergence between zzso species of the Northeast Pacific revealed that evolutionary distances correlate well with zzso and zzso species zzso Analysis of the structure of the tandem repeats revealed two regions of high sequence conservation that may contain zzso zzso factor binding sites, a surprise for an apparently zzso tandem zzso We speculate that these regions might be involved in zzso zzso perhaps zzso via zzso activity and zzso zzso The repeats show substantial differences in their zzso zzso even between individuals of the same species, indicating a dynamic organization of repeats, perhaps zzso via sequence zzso
