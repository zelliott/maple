The zzso zzso of the zzso expressed on the surface of zzso zzso cells is a suitable target for zzso Indeed, treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce long-lasting clinical zzso However, some of the treated patients zzso with a tumor expressing zzso with point zzso in the zzso recognized by the particular zzso zzso zzso The alternative approach of active zzso with tumor Id can cure the disease in mice with established tumors and is now being studied in clinical zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that active zzso with the zzso would evoke a zzso immune response that would cover zzso tumor zzso As a test system, we chose the tumor from a patient who had achieved a complete zzso after therapy with zzso zzso but subsequently relapsed with a zzso tumor zzso no longer binding the treatment zzso Mice were zzso with proteins and genetic vaccines derived from the original zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Id zzso variable zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the Id, and zzso an zzso zzso the zzso All zzso mice developed a specific immune response detecting zzso Id proteins from the original tumor and from all tumor zzso We conclude that active zzso with tumor Id can induce a zzso immune response and therefore may prevent the escape of zzso tumor zzso
