The zzso zzso binding region of zzso zzso zzso protein strain zzso zzso zzso has recently been the target for the design of a synthetic zzso vaccine effective against multiple strains of zzso zzso zzso We have successfully cloned and zzso expressed a zzso zzso zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso of the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and have determined the solution secondary structure of this zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The oxidized zzso zzso exists as a major zzso and minor zzso species in solution, arising from zzso around the zzso zzso zzso The pattern of zzso temperature zzso and zzso zzso observed for the trans zzso demonstrate the presence of a type I zzso and a type II zzso spanning zzso and zzso zzso This is in agreement with the zzso solution structure of the trans zzso of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso which showed a type I and a type II zzso in these same regions of the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kay, zzso zzso Hodges, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso Campbell, zzso zzso zzso zzso Hodges, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso The pattern of zzso temperature zzso and zzso zzso observed for the zzso zzso also demonstrate a type II zzso spanning zzso but suggest a second zzso spanning zzso Thus, the zzso zzso may also possess a zzso motif (like the trans zzso but with different spacing between the turns and a different placement of the first turn in the zzso The discovery of a zzso motif in the trans (and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an extremely important result since the double turn has been implicated as a structural requirement for the recognition of both zzso and zzso These results pave the way for future zzso zzso studies of the labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso studies integral to the design of an effective synthetic zzso zzso
