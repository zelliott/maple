zzso of zzso substance zzso by zzso cells of the fetal zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso ducts in the male zzso is a crucial event that contributes to proper sex zzso The zinc finger zzso factor zzso and nuclear zzso zzso are early markers of zzso cells that have been shown to regulate zzso zzso The fact that the zzso and zzso binding sites are adjacent to one another in the zzso promoter raised the possibility that both factors might zzso cooperate to regulate zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of both factors resulted in a strong synergistic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was the result of a direct zzso interaction zzso through the zinc finger region of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso on a variety of different zzso targets did not absolutely require zzso binding to zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso was also observed with other zzso family zzso Thus, these data not only provide a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the zzso expression of the zzso gene but also reveal a potentially novel mechanism for the regulation of zzso genes in zzso where zzso and zzso factors are zzso
