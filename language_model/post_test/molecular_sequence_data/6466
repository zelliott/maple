Changes which lead to excessive zzso production or to loss of cell cycle zzso by proteins such as zzso may release breast zzso cells from the constraints of cell zzso In order to establish the frequency of zzso gene zzso and its relation with genetic damage to the zzso and zzso D1 zzso we have studied these gene abnormalities in zzso human primary breast zzso and in six breast cancer cell zzso Two breast cancer cell lines and one primary zzso showed a zzso deletion of zzso 2 of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and subsequent sequencing analysis, one zzso showed an zzso at zzso 67 zzso Pro to zzso Another zzso showed a zzso at zzso 98 (without zzso acid zzso with an additional zzso at zzso zzso This zzso was also found in 13 other zzso samples, but has no effect on zzso zzso From these data we conclude that the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso in primary breast cancer is a rare event and is not likely to be involved in human breast zzso zzso and zzso
