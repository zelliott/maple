The largest zzso of zzso zzso II shows a striking difference in the degree of zzso depending on its functional state: initiating and zzso zzso are zzso and highly zzso zzso zzso mostly occurs at the zzso domain zzso which consists of a repetitive zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we have selected for zzso proteins that interact with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso A prominent zzso designated zzso specifically interacts with the zzso not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso It contains a zzso zzso domain, similar to that found in the zzso protein family of zzso zzso factors, which is required for interaction with the zzso Most zzso the zzso region of zzso includes a zzso zzso - trans zzso domain characteristic of zzso zzso a protein family implicated in protein zzso assembly and zzso zzso is a nuclear protein with a characteristic distribution in large zzso shaped nuclear zzso and zzso perfectly with the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Recent independent investigations have provided complementary data, such as an association of the zzso form of zzso zzso II with the nuclear zzso impaired zzso in a zzso deletion background and zzso of in zzso zzso by zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that factors directly or indirectly involved in zzso are associated with the zzso zzso zzso from where they might zzso to the nascent transcripts to ensure efficient zzso zzso with zzso
