Sister zzso cohesion relies on zzso a complex zzso a zzso ring and a peripheral zzso zzso which is found as two related zzso zzso and zzso in zzso There is a division of labor between the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required at zzso and zzso at zzso zzso of zzso has dramatic consequences for zzso function and zzso integrity, but the mechanism by which zzso mediates cohesion at zzso is not well zzso Here we dissect the individual contribution of zzso and the ring zzso to zzso cohesion and show that zzso rely heavily on zzso and to a lesser extent on the ring for zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso is highly enriched at zzso is decreased at zzso when cohesion is zzso and is increased when cohesion zzso zzso of zzso alone was sufficient to induce cohesion at zzso independent of the zzso ring and dependent on its unique (not found in zzso zzso domain, which we show binds to zzso DNA through an zzso zzso We suggest that a specialized cohesion mechanism may be required to accommodate the high level of DNA zzso repair at zzso
