The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso which belongs to zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of this gene has been shown to correlate with poor clinical prognosis for certain cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso which directed against zzso specifically zzso proliferation of tumor cells zzso zzso hence allows it to be a candidate for targeted zzso In order to overcome several drawbacks of zzso zzso we cloned its zzso and zzso genes and constructed the zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by the affinity zzso zzso it was characterized by zzso Western zzso cell zzso and zzso All these zzso showed the binding activity to zzso domain zzso of zzso Based on those properties of zzso we further constructed the zzso fusion zzso with a zzso form and the zzso product was expressed in zzso zzso In a series of subsequent analysis this fusion protein showed identical zzso binding site and activity with the parent zzso These zzso engineered zzso have promised to be further modified as a tumor targeting drugs, with a view of application in the diagnosis and treatment of human breast zzso
