Both the zzso and zzso of the major zzso groups have remained uncertain, despite intensive research on both zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso is zzso and consists of two zzso groups, the zzso and zzso whereas molecular zzso analyses suggest that zzso are zzso and that zzso are zzso zzso Both the zzso of zzso and the placement of zzso within zzso are in conflict with the zzso fossil zzso former because zzso stem zzso are similar to modern zzso in possessing zzso zzso suggesting that zzso are derived from zzso the latter because although fossil zzso are known from the Early zzso zzso zzso do not appear until the latest zzso Here we apply a different data source, the presence versus absence of specific zzso that zzso approximately 22 zzso zzso regulatory zzso the problem of zzso zzso We show that zzso are zzso with respect to zzso and zzso are zzso with respect to the zzso zzso conclusions that are consistent with the fossil zzso Further, zzso resolve as the sister group of the zzso rooting the zzso tree, and revealing the polarity of the zzso change within this diverse lineage of zzso
