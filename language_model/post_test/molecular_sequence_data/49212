The main objectives of this study were zzso to determine if gut zzso zzso are responsible for the capacity of zzso to emit nitrous oxide zzso and zzso to characterize the zzso bacteria of the earthworm zzso The production of zzso in the gut of garden soil zzso zzso zzso was mostly associated with the gut contents rather than the gut zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso and zzso were transient products when supplemental nitrate was reduced to zzso by gut content zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were essentially not produced by zzso soil zzso The most probable numbers of zzso zzso and microbes that used nitrate as a terminal electron zzso were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher in the earthworm gut than in the soil from which the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the gut and soil displayed similar zzso zzso A total of 136 zzso zzso that reduced either nitrate or zzso were obtained from high serial zzso of gut zzso Of the 25 representative zzso zzso that were chosen for zzso 22 zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with their closest cultured relatives, which in most cases was a soil zzso most zzso were affiliated with the gamma zzso of the class zzso or with the zzso bacteria with low DNA zzso zzso and 5 zzso were zzso and reduced nitrate to zzso or zzso The initial zzso production rates of zzso were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than those of the zzso zzso However, most zzso nitrate zzso produced zzso and might therefore indirectly stimulate the production of zzso via zzso zzso in the zzso The results of this study suggest that most of the zzso zzso by zzso is due to the zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso bacteria in the gut zzso
