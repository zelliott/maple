Basic zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso expressing potent zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso have been identified in human zzso and zzso cell lines, suggesting that zzso expression is involved in the zzso growth patterns associated with these zzso In the present study, the influence of zzso on additional parameters of zzso cell zzso was evaluated utilizing three distinct methods to suppress zzso expression or activity including zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso or an inhibitor of the zzso action of zzso zzso The addition of 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso primer to the human zzso cell line zzso resulted in a zzso zzso in colony formation in soft zzso This effect was zzso and specific, as sense strand primer was ineffective in suppressing zzso In addition to exhibiting fewer zzso zzso treatment significantly altered colony zzso zzso zzso cell growth in culture was suppressed in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a newly identified zzso of zzso binding and activity, suppressed zzso cell growth in soft zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso may regulate zzso growth and progression independent of its role in tumor zzso and that zzso release or zzso may be required for these zzso
