zzso sugar zzso form a family of zzso related membrane proteins of the zzso apparatus and the zzso zzso The first zzso sequences have been identified within the last 2 zzso However, information about the secondary and zzso structure for these molecules has been limited to theoretical zzso In the present study, an zzso approach was used to investigate the membrane zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso studies were carried out to analyze the orientation of the introduced zzso in zzso zzso Both an zzso introduced zzso sequence and a zzso zzso tag were found to be oriented toward the zzso zzso obtained with zzso acid zzso zzso that contained the zzso zzso in potential zzso loop structures were in good correlation with the presence of 10 zzso zzso This building concept seems to be preserved also in other zzso and zzso zzso sugar zzso Moreover, the functional analysis of the generated zzso demonstrated that insertions in or very close to zzso regions zzso the transport process, whereas those in zzso loop structures have no zzso effect on the zzso This study points the way toward understanding zzso relationships of zzso sugar zzso
