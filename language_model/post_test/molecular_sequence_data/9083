zzso factor H binding protein zzso is a promising vaccine zzso zzso zzso can bind to zzso and elicit zzso zzso activity zzso The zzso also can block binding of the human complement zzso factor H zzso Without bound zzso the zzso would be expected to have increased zzso to zzso Here we describe zzso activity of two zzso zzso with overlapping zzso in relation to their different effects on zzso binding and zzso zzso 

Both zzso recognized prevalent zzso sequence zzso in zzso group zzso Using zzso display and zzso zzso binding of one of the zzso zzso 1, zzso to zzso was eliminated by a single zzso acid zzso zzso and was decreased by zzso but not by zzso or zzso The zzso 1 zzso overlapped that of previously described zzso zzso zzso whose binding to zzso was eliminated by zzso or zzso zzso and was decreased by zzso but not by zzso Although zzso 1 and zzso appeared to have overlapping zzso only zzso 1 inhibited binding of zzso to zzso and had human zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso binding and lacked human zzso zzso zzso To control for zzso effects of different mouse zzso zzso on complement zzso we created zzso zzso in which the mouse zzso or zzso 1 zzso were paired with human zzso constant zzso While both zzso zzso showed similar binding to zzso only zzso 1, which inhibited zzso zzso had human zzso zzso zzso 

The lack of human zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso appeared to result from an inability to inhibit binding of zzso These results underscore the importance of zzso of zzso binding for zzso zzso zzso zzso
