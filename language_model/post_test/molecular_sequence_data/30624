A zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso small nuclear zzso particle zzso protein was isolated by zzso with a human zzso small nuclear zzso particle zzso protein zzso Southern zzso and in zzso zzso showed that this zzso zzso gene is unique in the zzso zzso residing at zzso position zzso zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso While the zzso zzso is always more abundant, the ratio of these two transcripts is zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso sequences indicated that these two zzso zzso an identical protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso proteins predicted from zzso human, and zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso acid identity in the most zzso 214 zzso zzso which include a sequence motif common to many proteins which bind zzso The zzso half is less well zzso but is highly charged and contains distinctive zzso regions in all three zzso These zzso regions contain stretches of zzso zzso like those found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which have been identified as regulators of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
