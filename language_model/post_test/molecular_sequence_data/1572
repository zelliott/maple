The crystal structure of a potato zzso zzso was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a zzso R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso using X-ray zzso data in the resolution range zzso zzso This is the first report of the three-dimensional structure of a plant zzso zzso zzso in a crystal form that belongs to space group zzso which is different to that of most other zzso zzso The main structural difference between zzso and the other zzso is in the central zzso region and appears to be caused by crystal zzso The surface properties of zzso molecules were compared with those of animal zzso which provided an explanation for the unique zzso state of zzso
