Sixteen zzso zzso including two described here, were used to construct a high-resolution map of the zzso region encompassing the regulator of the complement zzso zzso gene zzso The RCA genes are a group of related genes coding for plasma and membrane associated proteins that collectively control zzso of the complement component zzso We provide here the location of two new genes within the RCA gene zzso These genes are zzso that maps 15 zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso and a gene located 4 zzso downstream of zzso which seems to code for the 72 zzso Mr component of the signal recognition particle zzso Neither of these two genes is related structurally or functionally to the RCA zzso In addition, our map shows the zzso orientation of the zzso linkage group, which is: zzso zzso and outlines an zzso with a significant zzso zzso difference which suggests the presence of a zzso zzso of zzso
