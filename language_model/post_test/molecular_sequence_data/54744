zzso zzso are available for detecting bacterial genes required for almost every reaction of the biological nitrogen cycle, the one notable exception being zzso zzso for the zzso of the zzso nitrate zzso zzso zzso nitrate zzso Using an zzso approach, we report the first successful design of three forward zzso zzso and one reverse primer that, in three separate zzso can amplify zzso DNA from all five groups of zzso All 140 zzso sequences currently listed in the zzso (National Center for Biotechnology zzso database are predicted to be amplified by one or more of these primer zzso We demonstrate that two pairs of these zzso also amplify zzso products of the predicted sizes from DNA isolated from human zzso confirming their ability to direct the amplification of zzso fragments from mixed zzso Analysis of the resulting zzso by zzso sequencing will enable a good estimate to be made of both the range and relative abundance of zzso bacteria in any community, subject only to any unavoidable bias inherent in a zzso approach to molecular characterization of a highly diverse zzso
