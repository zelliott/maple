zzso proteins of zzso tuberculosis are implicated in its disease zzso and so are considered as potential diagnostic and vaccine zzso The search for these has been slow, even though the entire zzso sequence of zzso tuberculosis is now zzso of the zzso protein spots resolved by zzso gel zzso 114 zzso proteins have been identified, but for only 13 has the primary structure been partly zzso For comparison, in this top down mass zzso zzso approach the zzso proteins were zzso from cell culture zzso zzso and examined directly by zzso zzso zzso zzso transform zzso The zzso zzso of three zzso showed 93, zzso and zzso molecular weight zzso values, for a total of zzso different zzso However, only approximately zzso of these values matched zzso zzso the DNA predicted zzso values, but these identifications were zzso Of nine molecular zzso characterized by zzso only one protein match was confirmed, and its zzso molecular zzso were overlapped by those of another zzso zzso identified a total of ten proteins by sequence tag search, of which three were unidentified zzso The low success of zzso matching was due to unusually extensive zzso zzso including loss of a signal zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso and zzso Although in zzso the latter is relatively rare, a 9 zzso protein showed 7 zzso attachments and two 20 zzso proteins each had 20 zzso For zzso electron capture zzso was especially zzso
