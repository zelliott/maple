The zzso zzso zzso is a strong zzso zzso factor that regulates the expression of many zzso It was shown for the human zzso zzso that the binding of hormone causes distinct zzso changes in the zzso binding domain zzso and that these changes in zzso zzso are crucial for events after DNA zzso We now show that zzso changes in the zzso of the human zzso are a prerequisite for zzso Under the appropriate conditions zzso binds to its response element and activates zzso only in the presence of zzso zzso of the zzso causes changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso induce distinct zzso changes, the differences between the zzso lying in the zzso end of the zzso zzso the experimental conditions results in a zzso that can bind to DNA and activate zzso in a zzso zzso Under these conditions the zzso has a zzso active zzso in the absence of zzso Taken together, our data indicate that the zzso change induced by zzso is required for converting a zzso to the zzso active zzso
