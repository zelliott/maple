We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was isolated by screening of a zzso library with a zzso probe, based on the partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso stretch of DNA covering the zzso gene was zzso The gene contains an open reading frame of 555 zzso zzso amounting to a calculated molecular mass of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence with the zzso zzso sequences of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso clearly establishes the zzso of all four zzso Compared to the soluble zzso from zzso coli, the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and both plant species, which are located in the zzso have a short zzso zzso In the plant zzso zzso the extension is probably involved in zzso to the zzso since it contains the potential zzso targeting zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso zzso but their zzso zzso does not conform to any of the known zzso targeting zzso
