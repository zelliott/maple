zzso zzso is an zzso zzso box gene required for normal development of the third and fourth whorls of the zzso In previously described zzso zzso the third zzso zzso are replaced by zzso and the fourth zzso is replaced by another zzso zzso We describe two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso retaining partial AG zzso Both produce flowers with zzso in the third zzso and indeterminate floral zzso however, zzso flowers contain zzso in the fourth zzso and zzso produces zzso The zzso zzso results in partial loss of the C zzso of the K domain, a putative coiled zzso and zzso contains a zzso zzso that causes a single zzso acid change in this same region of the K zzso Two models that might explain how these changes in AG result in the separation of different AG activities are zzso
