The demonstration of intermittent zzso in patients with multiple sclerosis prompted a molecular analysis of brain tissue for expression of zzso zzso A sensitive method was developed based on the zzso chain zzso zzso sets were used that could amplify all zzso or two particular zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso The procedure was successful in detecting expression of zzso in brain and zzso zzso in most patients with multiple zzso However, expression was zzso also in a similar proportion of patients with other neural diseases, and patients with other zzso The data indicate that there can be zzso expression of zzso in brain zzso but the possibility that this becomes amplified in multiple sclerosis was not revealed by this zzso
