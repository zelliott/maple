The mouse zzso encodes a zzso gene zzso in its large T protein and a zzso zzso in its middle T zzso We have used zzso zzso to selectively zzso the former function without affecting the zzso Two zzso viruses were constructed to zzso altered large T proteins that fail to bind the zzso zzso gene product zzso along with normal small and middle T zzso The zzso zzso proved to be defective in zzso of primary rat zzso zzso by a variety of zzso Yet they proved capable of transforming both primary and established zzso in zzso Most importantly, the inability of these zzso to bind zzso had little effect on their ability to induce tumors in zzso We conclude that induction of multiple tumor types in this system does not depend on large zzso interactions but rather on middle zzso zzso In addition, the ability of this virus to zzso cells in culture is not essential to its ability to induce tumors in the zzso
