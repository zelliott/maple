zzso plays a regulatory role in aerial zzso formation in zzso zzso and is distributed widely among zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso severely reduced formation of aerial zzso indicating that zzso is important in zzso zzso In addition, the disruption caused zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce much less zzso and to produce zzso at a later stage of growth, indicating that zzso also regulates secondary zzso zzso zzso mapping showed that zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the act gene zzso was greatly reduced in the zzso zzso The zzso in secondary zzso formation was suppressed or overcome by a zzso in zzso zzso an zzso strain derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso strain due to the zzso zzso still produced a large amount of zzso Extra copies of zzso in strains zzso and zzso did not change zzso zzso or secondary zzso zzso However, the spores in these strains remained white even after prolonged zzso Since only spore pigmentation was affected, all known zzso zzso except zzso responsible for the zzso spore zzso formation, were assumed to function zzso zzso zzso mapping showed that zzso of zzso one of the promoters in the zzso zzso was reduced in zzso zzso zzso containing extra copies of zzso zzso zzso into several other zzso species, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also abolished spore zzso zzso An increase in the amount of zzso appeared to disturb the maturation of zzso
