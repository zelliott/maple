A family of zzso descent has a zzso form of zzso characterized by unusually high levels of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso who is zzso for the zzso has zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping suggested the presence of a zzso zzso zzso deletion removing the whole of the zzso zzso zzso molecular analysis was performed by directly sequencing a specifically amplified region of zzso zzso A zzso zzso deletion was precisely defined which results in the loss of the zzso beta promoter region and the entire zzso zzso The deletion extends from zzso zzso zzso to the zzso cap site to an zzso repeat element downstream of the zzso gene and is very similar to the zzso zzso deletion of Dutch beta zzso In common with four other zzso both these deletions remove the zzso promoter region of the beta gene and all are associated with unusually elevated levels of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
