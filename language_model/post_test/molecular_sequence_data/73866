The reconstruction of zzso history is predicated on being able to accurately establish hypotheses of character zzso which involves sequence alignment for studies based on molecular sequence zzso In an empirical study investigating zzso sequence zzso we zzso zzso trees for 43 species of the zzso and 3 of zzso based on complete zzso zzso zzso using six different zzso zzso manual alignment based on the secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso and automated zzso alignment zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and SAM computer zzso Trees were constructed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of the multiple sequence alignment procedures yielded the same basic structure for the estimate of the zzso relationship among the zzso which presumably represents the underlying zzso zzso However, the placement of many of the zzso was sensitive to the alignment procedure zzso and the different alignments produced trees that were on average more dissimilar from each other than did the different zzso methods zzso The multiple alignments from the different procedures varied greatly in zzso but aligned sequence length was not a good predictor of the similarity of the resulting zzso zzso We also systematically varied the gap weights (the relative cost of inserting a new gap into a sequence or extending an zzso zzso for the zzso program, and this produced alignments that were at least as different from each other as those produced by the different alignment zzso Furthermore, there was no combination of gap weights that produced the same tree as that from the structure zzso in spite of the fact that many of the alignments were similar in length to the structure zzso We also investigated the zzso information content of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso and conclude that the zzso regions are the most zzso We therefore conclude that many of the literature disagreements concerning the zzso of the zzso are probably based on differences in sequence alignment strategies rather than differences in data or zzso zzso
