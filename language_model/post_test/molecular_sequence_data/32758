The plasma zzso the most external cellular structure, is at the forefront between the plant cell and its zzso zzso it is naturally adapted to function in detection of external signals, their zzso throughout the cell, and finally, in cell zzso zzso lipids and the zzso once regarded as simple and zzso structures, have recently been recognized as significant players in signal zzso zzso involved in signal detection and zzso are zzso in specific zzso at the plasma zzso Their zzso allows to bring together and orient the downstream and upstream members of zzso zzso The cortical zzso provides a structural framework for rapid signal zzso from the cell periphery into the zzso It leads to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cellular metabolism which results in zzso of newly zzso proteins and/or secondary zzso which, in turn, have to be distributed to the appropriate cell zzso And again, in plant cells, the zzso zzso that govern polar cellular transport are delivered to their target zzso by interaction with zzso zzso In search for factors that could govern subsequent steps of the cell response delineated above we focused on an evolutionary zzso protein family, the zzso that bind in a zzso manner to membrane zzso zzso were proposed to regulate dynamic changes in membrane architecture and to zzso the interface between zzso zzso and the zzso Certain proteins from this family were also identified as zzso zzso making them ideal zzso in cell membrane and zzso zzso
