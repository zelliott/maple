zzso switching is presaged by the zzso zzso of the heavy chain class gene zzso to which zzso will zzso As a result, zzso or zzso transcripts from the zzso gene accumulate in the zzso Previous studies demonstrated that transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso switching to zzso in cultures of zzso zzso zzso B cells and increased the stability of C alpha zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso B cells express a 45 zzso zzso I alpha zzso that specifically binds to zzso alpha zzso Following addition of zzso the binding activity of this protein is significantly zzso The identification of a zzso zzso zzso protein that interacts with zzso transcripts supports the idea that these transcripts are involved in zzso and raises the possibility that zzso interactions play a role in regulating zzso zzso
