The zzso zzso is an arid region, situated along the west coast of southern zzso zzso this region is part of the Greater Cape zzso and is considered one of the Earth's 25 zzso zzso Of about 5,000 species occurring in this region, more than zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso dominate the zzso zzso both in terms of species numbers zzso species in zzso zzso and density of zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso within the zzso representing zzso species almost exclusively endemic to southern Africa, has diversified very recently and very zzso The estimated age for this radiation lies between zzso and zzso million years zzso ago, yielding a zzso diversification rate of zzso per million zzso Both the number of species involved and the tempo of evolution far surpass those of any previously zzso zzso or island plant zzso zzso of the group is closely associated with the origin of several zzso features and one anatomical zzso Because zzso zzso lacking these features occur over a very similar distribution area, we propose that these characteristics are key innovations that facilitated this zzso
