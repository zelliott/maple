zzso and zzso zzso the two most important members of the family zzso are known to zzso zzso of the human complement regulators named zzso inhibitor of complement zzso zzso and zzso virus complement control protein zzso respectively, to zzso the host complement zzso zzso consistent with the host zzso of these zzso zzso has been shown to be more human zzso than zzso and in this study we show that zzso is more bovine zzso than zzso Based on zzso and zzso studies, we suggest that the major zzso for the switch in species selectivity of zzso and zzso is the presence of zzso charged zzso in the central complement control zzso which help enhance their interaction with factor I and zzso the zzso zzso form of zzso Thus, our results provide a molecular basis for the species selectivity in zzso complement zzso
