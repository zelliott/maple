The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso zzso zzso in the zzso salvage zzso The zzso gene is included in a zzso zzso zzso segment of DNA and is transcribed into a 1 zzso zzso zzso has determined a zzso zzso open reading frame capable of zzso a protein of 251 zzso zzso The zzso genes for three zzso zzso zzso having different sensibilities to zzso zzso but identical levels of resistance to zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Single zzso changes located in different regions of the gene were found in each zzso Two in zzso deletions of the zzso gene have been integrated at the zzso zzso giving strains with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities, in extracts of strains where the zzso gene is zzso or deleted, indicate that the zzso zzso protein possesses only zzso zzso
