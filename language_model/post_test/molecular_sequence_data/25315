Based on sequence relationships the zzso fatty zzso proteins zzso of zzso origin are divided into at least three distinct types, namely the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso within the same type correlate with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are found in several zzso species and for bovine liver zzso specific shifts in zzso points upon zzso with fatty acids are zzso zzso of zzso zzso are not known and the occurrence of zzso zzso so far is confined to bovine heart zzso A bovine zzso growth inhibitor zzso is zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from bovine zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid complexes are in the range of 1 zzso and zzso zzso are usually found, but the neutral zzso of zzso zzso from bovine liver binds 2 fatty zzso On zzso levels zzso and zzso zzso are differently zzso Though mainly zzso in either case, zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso demonstrate the association of zzso zzso in liver cells with zzso and outer zzso zzso and with zzso whereas in heart cells cardiac zzso is confined to zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso is associated with neither zzso nor zzso zzso and is expressed in a strictly zzso spatial and zzso zzso The specific role proposed for zzso is to arrest growth of zzso zzso cells when they become committed to differentiation in the zzso zzso
