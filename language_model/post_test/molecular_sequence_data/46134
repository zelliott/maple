zzso migration zzso factor zzso is an inflammatory zzso associated with the zzso process and zzso plaque zzso zzso was shown to be highly expressed in advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso with a blocking zzso induced a zzso of established zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso We showed that zzso induced the expression of zzso genes in zzso We also showed that zzso induced tube formation of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso II zzso zzso could specifically zzso zzso expression in zzso Using a zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that the zzso response element in the zzso of the zzso gene played a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso Small hairpin zzso zzso targeting zzso a component of zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso both efficiently inhibited zzso zzso The consistent result of zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed that zzso II specifically increased zzso zzso in zzso Our results suggest that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso expression which contributes to zzso plaque zzso in human zzso zzso
