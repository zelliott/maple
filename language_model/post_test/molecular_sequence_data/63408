zzso has been identified as a novel regulatory protein of high level zzso resistance zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso has similarity to the zzso motif of zzso zzso and zzso modeling predicts that the zzso domain contains four zzso zzso These data have led to the hypothesis that zzso functions as both a zzso sensor and zzso of zzso availability to regulate zzso zzso To characterize the zzso promoter and identify the promoter elements to which zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso were zzso A zzso region was identified that was essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso that targeted this region were used to identify two zzso repeat zzso each with the sequence zzso on the zzso promoter that were required for zzso zzso To study zzso binding to this region, we zzso zzso with a zzso zzso tag in zzso coli zzso extracted the protein with zzso and subsequently zzso it via zzso acid and gel zzso zzso to apparent zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso and zzso binding to zzso promoter DNA was analyzed using zzso mobility shift zzso Both zzso repeat sequences were required for zzso zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso binds specifically to the zzso promoter, irrespective of zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso induction of zzso expression by zzso occurs after DNA zzso
