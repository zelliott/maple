The in zzso rate and specificity of zzso in type I collagen depends on the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso an intact zzso domain is also required for normal zzso zzso Although zzso predictions and zzso studies suggested that a type I zzso could be induced in zzso zzso zzso computer modeling did not identify ordered zzso Nevertheless, X-ray analysis and electron zzso studies have shown that the zzso is in one of the most highly ordered zzso zzso This study was undertaken to determine if the zzso of the zzso to its zzso zzso domain could induce the zzso to take up a specific zzso With use of molecular modeling suite of programs, a zzso zzso structure was built on the basis of high-resolution X-ray zzso coordinates and then replaced with the actual bovine collagen zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Energy zzso produced a modified zzso zzso The bovine zzso zzso sequence was similarly minimized and zzso to this zzso The zzso induced an ordered zzso with a stabilizing hydrogen bond in the zzso and, importantly, a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the binding zzso This zzso structure placed zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso in the correct locations for zzso zzso The modeling has been extended to the zzso zzso domain and finally to the construction of the zzso zzso packing zzso Each zzso domain can form linkages with two zzso aligned zzso zzso zzso The zzso and the order of staggering of the three chains in the zzso play crucial roles in the packing and zzso zzso patterns and the relative zzso zzso of adjacent molecules in the zzso The models confirm the high order in the zzso zzso overlap zzso
