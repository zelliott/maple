zzso zzso at the zzso zzso I) locus in zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined using DNA sequence zzso Two distinct zzso lineages were detected in zzso resulting from three zzso acid replacement zzso in the first zzso domain of the zzso The common Pan I zzso group, zzso zzso of the samples, was less zzso zzso zzso zzso than the uncommon group zzso zzso zzso and zzso diversity in both was higher than for two zzso lineages in the related Atlantic cod, zzso zzso zzso analyses of Pan I sequences from these two species did not clearly resolve zzso among zzso groups, in part because of zzso that has occurred between the two zzso zzso Conventional tests of neutrality comparing zzso within and between zzso regions of the Pan I locus in zzso zzso and Atlantic cod did not detect the effects of zzso This result is likely attributed to low levels of synonymous divergence among zzso lineages and a lack of zzso equilibrium zzso from zzso mismatch frequency zzso However, the ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso per site zzso exceeded unity in two zzso zzso of the protein and the influence of positive selection at multiple zzso sites was strongly zzso through the use of zzso zzso In addition, the frequency spectrum of linked neutral variation showed indirect effects of zzso zzso in zzso resulting from a selective sweep of the common zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso classes may have prevented complete loss of the older, more zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso sweeps driven by positive selection is the principle mode of evolution at the Pan I locus in zzso zzso
