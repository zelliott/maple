zzso zzso a zzso is an oral zzso zzso zzso with numerous zzso on the cell zzso zzso have been considered to be an important zzso factor in this zzso We analyzed the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso and found that seven independent zzso had zzso insertions within the same restriction zzso Cloning and sequencing of the disrupted region from one of the zzso revealed two adjacent open reading frames zzso which seemed to zzso a zzso signal zzso zzso We also found that six of the zzso had insertions in a zzso zzso a zzso of the genes zzso sensor zzso and that the zzso in the remaining one disrupted the gene immediately zzso zzso a zzso of the response regulator genes in other zzso These findings suggest that this zzso regulatory system is involved in zzso of zzso zzso
