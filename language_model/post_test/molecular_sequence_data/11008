zzso acid zzso an zzso zzso from zzso of zzso regulates seed maturation and stress responses in zzso The zzso seed zzso of zzso identify genes involved in synthesis and perception of zzso Two zzso of a new zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso had normal sensitivity to zzso and detached leaves of zzso zzso showed markedly higher rates of water loss than those of wild zzso The zzso content of developing zzso zzso was zzso lower than that of wild type, indicating a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were not deficient in zzso and extracts of zzso zzso efficiently converted the zzso zzso product, zzso to zzso suggesting a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence is similar to bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso reaction that is closely analogous to the zzso zzso reaction of zzso zzso Southern blots indicated a family of four to six related genes in zzso The zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and roots and is strongly induced in leaves by water zzso A family of zzso genes evidently controls the first committed step of zzso zzso These genes are likely to play a key role in the zzso and environmental control of zzso synthesis in zzso
