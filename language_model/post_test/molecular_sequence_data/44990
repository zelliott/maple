zzso zzso zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and has a key role in zzso zzso to the vascular zzso The plasma protein zzso has also been shown to interact with zzso We have investigated the effect of zzso binding to zzso cells on cell zzso The inclusion of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso to the culture medium of zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso incorporation after 8 zzso Cell proliferation in cultures containing zzso was also confirmed by direct cell zzso The zzso response in zzso was zzso by an zzso zzso zzso which maps to the first zzso domain of zzso A zzso truncated form of zzso containing the first two zzso zzso and a zzso with zzso acid sequence corresponding to zzso zzso was also able to block the zzso action of zzso on zzso 200 zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso incorporation by zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso but not control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effects were achieved with zzso fragments X and zzso and with a synthetic zzso with an zzso acid sequence matching zzso gamma chain zzso These results indicate that interaction between discrete sequences within zzso and zzso result in cellular zzso
