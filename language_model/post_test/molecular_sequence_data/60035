zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key step in zzso coli zzso zzso by converting zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso mechanism involves an unusual radical zzso of zzso involving an essential C alpha radical of zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which may form zzso zzso required for zzso We undertook this study to understand the structural basis for zzso 

The first structure of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso A resolution shows an unusual zzso structure, with a zzso beta finger carrying zzso and zzso inserted into the zzso of the zzso Several zzso near the zzso zzso can be ascribed roles in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are positioned near zzso and may bind zzso and zzso partially zzso zzso Both zzso zzso are accessible to each other zzso to their zzso relationship at the tip of the beta zzso Finally, two zzso that may serve as binding sites for zzso and zzso have been zzso 

zzso has striking structural zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso includes eight of the ten strands in the unusual zzso zzso barrel as well as the beta finger, which carries key zzso zzso in both zzso This provides the first structural proof that zzso and zzso are related by divergent evolution from a common zzso
