zzso of zzso with heavy metals has become a worldwide zzso We describe zzso the analysis of lake zzso contaminated with high zzso of copper as a consequence of mine milling disposal over a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso were found to vary with depth and ranged from 200 to zzso zzso Analysis of the microbial community with zzso identified a minimum of 20 operational zzso units zzso zzso analysis along a depth profile detected as many as nine shared zzso across 15 zzso suggesting a conservation of community structure over this zzso Only two zzso zzso and zzso were detected among 50 zzso zzso zzso cultivated on zzso one of which zzso zzso was characterized by the zzso of copper, identified by electron zzso zzso in growing zzso zzso electron zzso showed changes to the outer envelope of the cells when grown in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso zzso were also resistant to zzso zzso and zzso showing two patterns of zzso resistant to these three metals in which either resistance to zzso or Ni was expressed in an isolate but never zzso
