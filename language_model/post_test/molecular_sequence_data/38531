zzso syndrome Type I zzso is an zzso dominant disorder that has previously been associated with zzso in the zzso gene on the zzso zzso In this study, we used an Iranian zzso family with seven affected individuals in three zzso The zzso characteristics of the family include zzso deafness, zzso zzso zzso skin patches of the upper zzso zzso white zzso zzso white eyebrows, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso we report a previously unidentified zzso substitution in zzso II zzso at position zzso that results in a change of zzso to zzso zzso in this zzso This change was not observed in 100 zzso of healthy unrelated zzso This zzso is within the zzso paired domain region, a structure that is highly zzso and implicated in DNA zzso This is the first identification of a zzso zzso for this zzso in the Iranian zzso This also provides additional confirmation for the involvement of this gene in the zzso of zzso
