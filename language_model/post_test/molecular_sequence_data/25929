A zzso zzso by the zzso gene of the extreme zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli by cloning the gene downstream from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters of the expression zzso zzso zzso of up to 55 times was obtained by growing the cells at 42 degrees C, and the zzso made up to zzso of the zzso protein zzso The zzso was located in the zzso fraction in zzso zzso The temperature and pH zzso were determined to be 70 degrees C and pH zzso to 6, zzso The zzso was stable for at least 72 h if incubated at 60 degrees C, with zzso of 8 to 9 h at 70 degrees C and 2 to 3 zzso at 80 degrees zzso The zzso had high activity on zzso and zzso zzso and some activity on zzso cellulose and zzso zzso The gene was probably expressed from its own promoter in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli seemed to initiate at a zzso zzso and not at an zzso zzso as previously zzso
