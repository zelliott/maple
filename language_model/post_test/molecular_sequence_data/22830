In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the degradation of the zzso compounds of the cell wall is considered to be the principal component responsible for fruit zzso Many genes zzso zzso acting on the different zzso of the zzso zzso have been shown to be highly expressed during the late zzso of softening, with zzso being the most zzso Nevertheless, it is known that softening starts well before the zzso zzso rise which occurs zzso with the zzso expression of the zzso zzso The cloning and characterization of zzso an zzso zzso gene zzso expressed in zzso zzso are presented zzso zzso belongs to the group of zzso zzso at their zzso a zzso similar to the cellulose binding domain of microbial zzso This zzso is also expressed during zzso of both leaves and zzso The effect of zzso zzso treatments on zzso zzso is zzso in young fruits and negative in zzso ones, while it is positive in zzso zzso Thus, the expression of zzso seems to be more dependent on the type of separation process rather than being influenced by a direct hormone zzso The ability of the zzso regulatory sequences to drive zzso in cells undergoing separation events is also maintained in tomato, where about 3 zzso of the gene promoter could drive the expression of zzso in zzso fruits and in the fruit zzso zzso
