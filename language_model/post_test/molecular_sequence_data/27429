zzso disease virus zzso is a highly zzso zzso that zzso the rapid onset of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso as its deletion zzso the ability of the virus to induce zzso It has been shown previously that zzso zzso is linked to its interaction with zzso binding protein 1 zzso a property also shared by other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso this study examined whether zzso also shares the properties of these viral zzso in interacting with other binding partners such as zzso protein 70 zzso a molecular zzso protein linked to multiple cellular functions including zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis demonstrated that zzso infection induced nuclear zzso of zzso and its zzso with zzso zzso evidence of zzso interaction was obtained by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso To demonstrate further the zzso interaction in zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated expressing an zzso tandem affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the infectious zzso clone of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso affinity zzso zzso from zzso induced by the zzso virus, using zzso zzso tandem mass zzso analysis, further confirmed the zzso interaction in the transformed zzso Given the well-documented evidence of the zzso properties of zzso and its interaction with a number of other known viral zzso demonstration of the interaction of zzso and zzso is significant in zzso zzso
