zzso molecular zzso are often used to interpret evolutionary history with respect to zzso zzso Where more than one interpretation is possible, it is desirable but difficult to assess the alternatives in an objective zzso The present work demonstrates a zzso method for testing molecular clock zzso and zzso scenarios based on zzso We assessed the zzso of several previously published zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as model zzso Our data set comprised zzso zzso of partial zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences (both genes evolved in a zzso manner across zzso from nearly all the species and subspecies in the three zzso We tested several zzso of a molecular clock, which resulted in competing zzso settings for the evolution of zzso Although only one scenario was in complete accordance with zzso data, statistical testing did not reject the zzso zzso encountered with the present approach may be overcome by more comprehensive analyses in zzso
