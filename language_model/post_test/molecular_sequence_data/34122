zzso comprises gene expression regulatory mechanisms that rely upon the activity of small zzso zzso zzso and in most cases zzso binding zzso In zzso the zzso protein zzso is a key player in zzso zzso because it promotes zzso interactions and influences zzso zzso or zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the large number of detected small zzso transcripts and the zzso effects of zzso zzso lead to the hypothesis that zzso mechanisms are important in this soil zzso to adjust gene expression both in zzso conditions and as a zzso zzso within zzso root zzso In this study, zzso modeling of zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso experiments of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso indicates that zzso ( zzso ) encodes an zzso zzso that can be functionally exchanged by its zzso from zzso zzso A zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso expression by means of zzso reporter zzso strongly suggests that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso its expression at the zzso level, a phenomenon that was evident in the natural host zzso zzso as well as in the zzso host zzso zzso
