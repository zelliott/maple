zzso zzso zzso is a zzso tissue disorder characterized by loose skin and variable internal organ involvement, resulting from paucity of elastic zzso Elsewhere, zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been reported in three families with zzso dominant zzso and a family with zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently reported to have a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso from five patients with zzso zzso One patient was found to express both normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The larger transcript contains an internal zzso of zzso zzso which resulted in the synthesis and zzso of a zzso zzso protein with four additional tandem zzso zzso growth zzso zzso The zzso arose from a zzso tandem gene duplication, encompassing the sequence from zzso 4 to zzso zzso No zzso or zzso zzso were detected in the other zzso The results demonstrate that a zzso zzso in zzso can cause zzso zzso and also suggest that zzso and zzso gene zzso are not the exclusive cause of the zzso
