In zzso insects, blood intake triggers a prompt response zzso by zzso which regulates a variety of zzso zzso Here we report a quantitative zzso analysis of the zzso response in the central nervous system of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso The concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursor 1 zzso significantly changes in response to blood zzso We also performed a zzso analysis of other zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso We identified zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso This is the first report suggesting a role for zzso involving the peptides processed from this precursor in the hormonal control of the production and/or release of zzso Our results contribute to the understanding of the zzso neuroendocrine response in zzso and provide important information for zzso and pharmacological studies aimed to the design of next-generation zzso such as zzso
