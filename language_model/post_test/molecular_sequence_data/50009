The presence of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been investigated, using zzso zzso of proteins from zzso zzso zzso extracted with the alkaline buffer zzso zzso pH 11, were found to contain a zzso protein that binds zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso characterization with zzso specific for human zzso II identified the zzso protein as the zzso of bovine and human zzso zzso zzso studies showed the presence of zzso zzso II in the zzso region of round zzso and in the zzso region of late zzso and zzso in agreement with the previously described zzso of zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso II, a protein of the zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso which probably plays a role in the zzso events that occur during zzso and the early events of zzso
