The zzso sequence of the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a wealth of data on proteins from a zzso In this paper, sequences of 115 proteins from zzso zzso are compared with their zzso from zzso zzso zzso Although the growth temperatures of the zzso are about 50 degrees C below that of zzso zzso their zzso zzso contents are nearly zzso The properties most correlated with the proteins of the zzso include higher zzso volume, higher zzso zzso more charged zzso acids (especially zzso zzso and zzso and fewer zzso polar zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These are recurring themes, with all trends applying to zzso of the proteins for which complete sequences were zzso Nearly all of the zzso acid replacements most significantly correlated with the temperature change are the same relatively conservative changes observed in all zzso but in the case of the zzso comparison there is a directional zzso We identify 26 specific pairs of zzso acids with a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso preferred direction of zzso
