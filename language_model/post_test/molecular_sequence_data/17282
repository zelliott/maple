In this study, the zzso involved in zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso degradation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso bacteria produced high levels of zzso zzso One zzso protein displayed similarity with a zzso zzso beta zzso and a second zzso protein displayed similarity with an zzso zzso The genes zzso these proteins were zzso and sequence analysis revealed two distinct zzso containing clustered zzso genes with strong similarities to corresponding genes found in zzso zzso zzso In the first zzso two genes potentially zzso a terminal zzso zzso designated zzso were followed by a gene coding for an zzso alcohol zzso zzso The second locus contained five genes zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso another zzso component zzso and an zzso zzso zzso was found to be capable of converting several zzso including zzso to the corresponding zzso The activity of zzso was greatly enhanced upon zzso of genes zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso alpha zzso resulted in a zzso strain that had lost the ability to grow on zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli functioned as a zzso zzso zzso also used zzso and zzso as zzso Our results indicated that a single zzso zzso was responsible for the initial attack of a range of zzso including zzso in strain zzso Furthermore, the conversion of zzso to zzso was zzso by a zzso zzso unrelated to known zzso zzso
