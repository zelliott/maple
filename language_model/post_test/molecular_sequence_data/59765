Crystal structures of zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso and 100 K have been refined to zzso of zzso and zzso against data to zzso A and zzso A resolution, zzso zzso changes of up to 9 A relative to the zzso zzso occur in zzso that bind to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds directly to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso but is only zzso zzso which approaches, but does not occupy the sixth coordination site of zzso hydrogen bonds to zzso of zzso The nitrogen atom of zzso is approximately zzso A from zzso of zzso reflecting a strong zzso interaction between the zzso nitrogen atom and the zzso zzso The spatial relationships between zzso zzso and zzso suggest an interaction between the zzso oxygen atom of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso hydrogen bonds to the zzso group of zzso and approaches bound zzso The zzso group of zzso coordinates to the zzso while its zzso group interacts with backbone zzso groups 299 to zzso and the zzso of zzso The zzso group of zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso (from a zzso related by zzso zzso A mechanism is proposed for the zzso reaction governed by the zzso in which zzso and zzso are essential zzso zzso
