zzso of many organisms adapt to zzso stress by accumulating compatible organic zzso In zzso canine kidney zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line widely used as a culture model for the study of zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso zzso genes responsible for the zzso of organic zzso We have recently cloned from these cells a partial zzso corresponding to a member of the zzso 4 zzso zzso family, zzso zzso and demonstrated its induction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ferraris, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An association between zzso and potential regulatory zzso such as the zzso zzso growth zzso protein and the cell zzso zzso beta zzso has been zzso Here, using beta zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso probe, we demonstrate expression and zzso induction of beta zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and protein occurs in 2 h and is zzso at 6 zzso consistent with a regulatory role in the adaptation to zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso of organic zzso markedly zzso the zzso induction of the zzso a feature shared with genes involved in zzso stress zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso and beta zzso are expressed in association at the cell zzso Our findings suggest the existence of a cluster of integral membrane proteins that includes but may not be limited to zzso and the zzso zzso beta zzso which may play a role in the adaptation of kidney cells to zzso stress, possibly at the regulatory zzso
