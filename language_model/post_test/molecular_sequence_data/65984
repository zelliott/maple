A zzso zzso zzso was used to probe the existence of folded structure in zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and native zzso were subjected to zzso and zzso analyses which revealed the zzso of zzso fragments of similar size, indicating survival of similar sections of folded structure burying zzso bonds away from zzso in the two zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the zzso of zzso fragments from the two samples were either zzso or located very close to each other, and predominantly on the surface of the zzso structure of native zzso The zzso to zzso of very nearly the same sites in the two samples suggests that zzso elements of structure survive within zzso zzso The finding that zzso zzso can involve interactions among molecules retaining elements of zzso structure, suggests that complete chain unfolding may not be a necessary prerequisite for all zzso
