Using zzso analysis, a novel zzso of zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso and several other proteins from both zzso and zzso These zzso zzso contain an absolutely zzso zzso and occur either as zzso forms such as the bacterial zzso zzso or fused to other zzso such as a zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain is predicted to be a zzso domain that receives sulfur zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso on its zzso zzso and delivers it for the formation of diverse zzso zzso The identification of this domain may clarify the mechanism of zzso of various zzso including zzso zzso zzso that are compromised in human type II zzso
