A member of the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso possesses high specificity against the major insect zzso corn zzso and belongs to a class of zzso toxins and regulators of biological pathways distinct from classical zzso zzso The zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso reveals structurally zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso likely representing the entire class of zzso toxins and zzso evolutionary relationships between families of zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso trapped zzso complex identifies the zzso binding zzso within the zzso zzso domain and provides a structural basis for understanding the targeting and zzso of the medically and environmentally important zzso zzso These structures zzso provide specific experimental results to help resolve zzso regarding the specific mechanism of zzso of zzso by implicating ground state zzso and zzso product zzso as the major driving forces for zzso
