Genes zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso are widely distributed among zzso Several years ago, the three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso of both zzso coli and zzso zzso were determined, revealing a novel zzso zzso However, a function for zzso had remained zzso with an early study of the zzso zzso zzso failing to detect zzso zzso Our group recently determined that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso To reconcile those results, we assessed the abilities of both the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso proteins to bind DNA to which zzso zzso zzso can zzso 

Both the zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso proteins bound to tested zzso zzso was not well zzso with zzso indicating some sequence preferences for those two zzso zzso of binding characteristics determined that both zzso zzso bind as zzso Different DNA sequence preferences were observed between zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso acid differences in the putative zzso zzso of these zzso 

Three distinct members of the zzso bacterial protein family have now been demonstrated to bind zzso Members of this protein family are zzso by a broad range of bacteria, including many zzso species, and results of our studies suggest that all such proteins have zzso zzso The functions of zzso family members in each bacterial species are zzso unknown, but given the ubiquity of these zzso proteins among zzso further investigations are zzso
