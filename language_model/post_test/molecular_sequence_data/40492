A forward genetic screen of mice treated with the zzso zzso identified a zzso mouse with chronic motor zzso This zzso named zzso zzso carries a zzso zzso an zzso substitution in the zzso segment of the zzso zzso channel zzso The gene zzso encodes the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso which is abundantly expressed in the large zzso terminals of basket cells that make powerful zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso clamp recordings from zzso slices revealed an increased frequency and zzso of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso currents and reduced action potential firing frequency in zzso cells, suggesting that an increase in zzso release from basket cells is involved in the motor zzso in zzso zzso In line with zzso analyses showing a significant reduction in the expression of zzso channels in the basket cell terminals of zzso mice, expression of zzso and zzso channels containing the zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells revealed subtle changes in zzso properties but a dramatic decrease in the amount of functional zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso or transgenic zzso with zzso zzso zzso partially rescued the motor zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that independent of known zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be important molecular zzso underlying human zzso zzso zzso
