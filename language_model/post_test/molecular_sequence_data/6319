Part of the zzso I zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso from zzso using zzso zzso on the highly zzso regions of sequence from other zzso The entire zzso gene was obtained by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso library in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso probe from the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a deduced protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with no zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence has about zzso identity with most zzso zzso zzso The gene is located as a single copy on zzso 5 and Northern analysis identified a transcript of zzso zzso
