The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso and zzso B zzso were cloned from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The protective immunity zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on mice and chickens was zzso The results showed that mice zzso with zzso of zzso zzso were protected zzso survival zzso against challenge infection with 10 or 20 zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, mice zzso with zzso were not zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso were protected zzso survival zzso against lethal challenge infection with strains zzso and zzso whereas those zzso with zzso were zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso from different strains of zzso zzso exhibited zzso sequence identity to each other, suggesting that zzso might serve as a zzso zzso This is the first report of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso cross protection on zzso
