zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso uses multiple zzso for incorporation of zzso but not as stop zzso It is also characterized by having a zzso domain and a regionally differential expression zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso this protein is considered to have a zzso zzso In the present study, the structure of the zzso zzso protein gene was zzso The gene consisted of five zzso and the zzso region contained a zzso box, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of motifs like zzso zzso zzso supports the suggestion that this protein is involved in cellular zzso Since the presence of zzso suggests that this protein is related to the antidote effect of zzso against heavy metal zzso the availability of this motif was examined using bovine kidney cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso markedly increased 6 h after administration of zzso M zzso and zzso in both cell zzso No significant zzso was observed in zzso zzso protein zzso whereas its zzso expression was high, indicating that this protein is zzso zzso Thus, it is still possible that this protein acts as an antidote, even though it is not zzso by heavy zzso
