zzso zzso synthesis increases in response to zzso The zzso cell line zzso zzso produces low zzso levels of zzso zzso which increase markedly with zzso To define the sequences necessary for this response, we linked fragments of the human zzso gene to a zzso zzso introduced these plasmids into zzso zzso cells and zzso for zzso activity after growth in zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso promoter zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso activity with zzso We tested several zzso gene fragments upstream of this zzso promoter zzso and found that a zzso zzso zzso II 3' zzso had a zzso increase in activity with zzso regardless of zzso This zzso had a similar level of activity when linked to a zzso virus 40 zzso zzso of this zzso retained activity, including a zzso zzso zzso I zzso that had a zzso increase in activity with zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso from this zzso zzso resulted in a loss of zzso The zzso upstream portion of the zzso zzso showed an zzso increase in activity with zzso However, deletion of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso 21 or 22 in this zzso zzso resulted in loss of zzso Our studies indicate that the zzso response of the human zzso gene to zzso is zzso in part by promoter sequences and to a greater degree by an zzso element located in a zzso portion of the 3' zzso sequence of the zzso
