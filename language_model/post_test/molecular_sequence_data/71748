zzso zzso zzso channels bind zzso zzso and zzso to generate inward zzso We have examined the architecture of the inner pore of zzso channels by zzso attaching a constrained number (from one to four) of positively charged zzso of different sizes to the zzso Our results indicate that the inner pore is formed solely by the second zzso segment and is unprecedentedly zzso At a position critical for inward zzso zzso the pore is sufficiently wide to bind three zzso zzso or zzso molecules zzso zzso recordings directly demonstrate that partially modified channels exhibit distinct zzso zzso Such a wide inner pore may greatly facilitate zzso zzso and zzso binding of multiple pore zzso to generate strong inward zzso
