The zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso protein is a versatile zzso that interacts with zzso DNA, and a number of zzso factors, implicating it in transcription, zzso and translation zzso The underlying mechanism of zzso stimulation by zzso K is not well zzso To explore the possibility of a putative zzso activity of zzso K, we produced zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso domain was fused to various zzso K fragments in zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal that the K nuclear shuttling zzso domain, a well-known signal for nuclear import and export, is also responsible for the zzso activity of zzso K zzso zzso alpha and beta proteins are involved in the regulation of the zzso activity of the zzso domain via their competition for the nuclear pore zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 353 to zzso or zzso acid or a series of truncated zzso of zzso acids zzso of zzso K suggest the zzso activity of zzso is primarily dependent on its zzso acid composition and intact zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is not required for the activity of the zzso domain, but that zzso of zzso zzso might affect its activity in a zzso zzso We thus demonstrate the existence of a strong zzso domain in zzso K and define the regulatory mechanism involved in its zzso interaction within the zzso domain in zzso
