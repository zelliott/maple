Multiple human zzso zzso zzso have been zzso These zzso are the products of multiple genes that can be classified into at least four evolutionary zzso The genes zzso each class appear to be clustered on distinct zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in drug resistance and, conversely, zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso to zzso Some zzso genes are expressed at varying levels in different individuals, and there is a frequent zzso of the zzso class zzso zzso in all the racial groups studied so zzso This zzso is due to a deletion of the zzso 1 zzso The Alpha class genes are located on the short arm of zzso 6 and are closely linked, with less than 2 zzso separating some zzso There is evidence for the existence of several zzso in this zzso A complete Alpha class gene has 7 zzso and extends over 13 zzso The zzso zzso region of the gene zzso the zzso type 1 zzso has been cloned and zzso This region contains a number of putative promoter and zzso elements that are similar to those found in rat and mouse Alpha class zzso
