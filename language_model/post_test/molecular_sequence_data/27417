zzso zzso and zzso used as zzso agents and zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso which exhibits genetic zzso zzso patients and the population to which the patients zzso is important for effective treatment and reducing zzso There is a need for faster methods for zzso Hence the present study was planned to test the application of zzso technique for analysis of the three common zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in DNA from healthy Indian volunteers as well as to apply the method on zzso samples obtained from children with acute zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 120 healthy volunteers and 25 patients were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was the template for most of the zzso but additionally the zzso zzso for zzso detection was used as the template in case of patients with zzso The results of zzso reaction were confirmed by direct zzso 

The zzso zzso could be reliably identified by zzso analysis in multiplex reactions both in zzso DNA samples and zzso The overall frequency of the three common zzso was observed to be zzso per zzso arising from zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso method for zzso zzso analysis works faster with the potential for high zzso By simultaneously interrogating the zzso at multiple sites, the method can provide future opportunity to zzso though zzso has not been done in the present zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso per cent of the study population and no zzso was zzso Our results indicated that zzso was the most common zzso in Indian population, while zzso associated with the absence of zzso activity of zzso was very zzso
