zzso is a zzso zzso gene required for heart and visceral zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in lack of formation of the zzso heart, the zzso zzso We have isolated an zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso which appears by sequence zzso and expression pattern to be a zzso of zzso The expression pattern of zzso both during development and in adult zzso partially zzso with that of another zzso zzso zzso We have found that embryonic expression of both zzso and zzso is induced at a time when cardiac zzso is zzso zzso is expressed in early cardiac zzso before the expression of a marker of cardiac zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso In adult zzso zzso is expressed in the heart and several visceral zzso As the zzso factor Twist is thought to regulate zzso expression in zzso we have compared the expression of zzso and zzso during embryonic development in zzso There appears to be no overlap in expression patterns of the two zzso from the zzso stages zzso the first time at which the zzso can be zzso by in zzso zzso The overlapping expression patterns of zzso and zzso in conjunction with evidence presented here that other zzso are expressed in adult mouse and zzso heart suggests that zzso may be represented by a family of genes in zzso
