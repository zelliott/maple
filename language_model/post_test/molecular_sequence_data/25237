The zzso zzso of the gene coding for alpha zzso results in a serum zzso of this protein leading to early onset zzso and liver zzso The zzso gene has a zzso point zzso in zzso V together with a point zzso in zzso III which is also present in some normal zzso zzso There has thus far been no system to study the effects of zzso point zzso in tissue zzso We constructed plasmids containing alpha zzso zzso zzso altered at either zzso III or zzso V zzso sites and linked to zzso virus 40 promoter zzso Such zzso with the zzso V zzso were zzso into monkey zzso cells followed by analysis of expression of alpha zzso gene zzso zzso cells normally zzso virtually no alpha zzso zzso or zzso alpha zzso zzso is transcribed at high levels in cells zzso with either M or Z zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells within 48 h of zzso zzso alpha zzso protein to specific regions of the zzso This zzso zzso is also observed with human zzso zzso cells, which zzso alpha zzso at high levels, and with human zzso zzso cells zzso with an M zzso The cloned zzso altered alpha zzso genes provide a system for zzso contributions of distinct point zzso to the pathological effects of the zzso zzso
