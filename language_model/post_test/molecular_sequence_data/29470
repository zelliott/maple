The zzso zzso gene is required for leaf hair zzso branching and is also involved in polarized expansion underlying organ zzso Here we show that the AN gene encodes a zzso binding zzso A zzso zzso zzso related zzso AN is expressed at low levels in all zzso and the AN protein is localized in the zzso In an zzso zzso the organization of the zzso zzso is normal but the distribution of zzso is zzso A role of AN in the control of the zzso zzso is further supported by the finding that AN genetically and physically interacts with zzso a zzso motor zzso involved in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso protein function in plants is directly associated with the zzso zzso
