The zinc finger protein zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso was originally identified by virtue of its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso and its participation in embryonic zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene in mice is zzso lethal in the zzso genetic background, where it blocks cell cycle zzso but not in the zzso zzso We have now identified a second, highly zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso a protein with similar structural and zzso properties as well as zzso distribution as zzso and whose zzso in zzso zzso also zzso with impaired zzso zzso zzso the zzso transcript becomes significantly zzso in zzso mice only in zzso the genetic background where the zzso are viable, suggesting that the functional zzso of the two zzso genes may be zzso
