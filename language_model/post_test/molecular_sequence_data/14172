zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso reduces zzso to zzso A systematic approach involving an initial sequence zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso screening and zzso zzso of the screened zzso was used to study the molecular zzso of the zzso specificity of zzso A zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso in the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso was identified as an important zzso affecting the zzso specificity of zzso Further insights into the function of the zzso zzso were obtained by substituting it with other zzso zzso or polar zzso zzso Substituting zzso with the zzso charged zzso acids zzso and zzso altered the zzso specificity of zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso is the zzso for zzso and zzso is the zzso for zzso In contrast, the zzso containing positively charged zzso acids zzso zzso or zzso at position 156 showed a higher efficiency with zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data, in addition to those of molecular dynamics and zzso zzso zzso studies, suggest that the zzso specificity of zzso can be modulated by manipulating the zzso acid zzso at position zzso
