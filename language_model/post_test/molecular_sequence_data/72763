zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso consisting of 68 zzso acids with an zzso acid zzso sequence and 12 zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that cell culture plates coated with the zzso produced fusion protein of zzso zzso zzso can facilitate human zzso cell attachment via zzso interaction within 15 zzso In this study, we further characterized the effect of zzso fusion protein on zzso cells by creating two other related fusion zzso zzso and zzso The former was a single zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso acid zzso of zzso was replaced by zzso acid, and the latter was an zzso zzso in which a zzso of protein zzso A zzso site was inserted between zzso and zzso These two zzso proteins together with a zzso of zzso and native form of zzso were used to study effects on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso as zzso as the native zzso while the two other zzso were zzso Furthermore, when zzso zzso cells attached on the zzso plate, they became a flattened zzso zzso From the results of zzso of cell attachment on fusion zzso plates, we concluded that: zzso the zzso fusion protein is equally functional in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of cell attachment, which is through the interaction of zzso and zzso on the cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein is unable to bind with zzso and results in loss of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso may disrupt a proper zzso of zzso and also results in loss of zzso zzso the zzso produced fusion protein zzso can be properly used as an zzso agent and an zzso zzso
