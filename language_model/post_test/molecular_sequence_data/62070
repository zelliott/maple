A zzso and zzso zzso is a family of zzso proteins and all family members have a zzso structure containing a zinc zzso domain and a zzso domain that may serve as an zzso zzso Here we reported two novel zzso transcripts of zzso named zzso beta and zzso zzso to be involved in the development and functional activities of zzso zzso zzso gamma was isolated from a zzso human fetal brain zzso library, using an zzso zzso to Adam as a probe, and is zzso zzso to human zzso zzso zzso except that it lacks a zzso of 91 zzso near the zzso thus it could not form obvious zzso zzso zzso beta was discovered while the diversity at the zzso domain zzso was zzso zzso beta has a different sequence in the 91 zzso and thus zzso different zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso gamma are mainly expressed in brain like zzso zzso zzso experiments in mouse brain also detected the two zzso consistent with observation of Northern analysis of human zzso Furthermore, results of zzso amplification of zzso gamma in mouse brains of different zzso stages revealed a zzso regulated expression zzso zzso gamma is expressed in embryonic and infant brain, and disappeared after the 10th zzso zzso This temporally changing expression pattern of zzso gamma suggests that zzso gamma likely plays an important role in brain zzso
