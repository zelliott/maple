Loss of zzso zzso for zzso markers is a frequently occurring event in some tumors, reflecting the role of zzso loss in the development of these zzso We have determined zzso in 38 cases of zzso tumor for the 2 known zzso on zzso arm zzso and for a newly detected locus on zzso arm zzso Only 7 of the 38 tumors studied showed reduction to zzso of zzso zzso In 4 of these tumors, reduced expression of zzso and zzso genes located at zzso and implicated in zzso zzso was zzso However, this was also found in 2 of 7 tumors showing zzso exclusively of zzso markers and in 15 of the remaining 24 tumors in which there was no zzso for zzso zzso This suggests that events not involving zzso zzso or zzso zzso are the most common mechanisms for zzso at the zzso zzso tumor zzso We also noted that zzso zzso involving zzso zzso occurred in addition to reduced expression of the zzso locus genes in 2 tumors, suggesting a possible interaction between these 2 zzso In addition, zzso for zzso markers was observed in 6 zzso In one case this was zzso with reduction of zzso and zzso gene zzso and in 3 other cases it occurred in addition to zzso zzso This indicates that an additional locus on zzso is likely to be involved in zzso zzso
