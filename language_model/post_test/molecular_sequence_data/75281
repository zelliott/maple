zzso that replicate autonomously in mouse L cells were constructed by inserting random zzso DNA fragments from zzso cells into a zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso gene with a truncated zzso zzso zzso resistance was used as a selective zzso The presence of free plasmids in the DNA of zzso was demonstrated by zzso with a specific zzso probe, by electron microscopic zzso of circular DNA, and by recovering these plasmids by zzso coli zzso zzso different DNA fragments were zzso They were characterized as zzso autonomously replicating sequences by zzso restriction zzso sensitivity, by zzso zzso by copy number determination, and by segregation zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of nine plasmids revealed a zzso element of 12 zzso zzso in five out of nine autonomously replicating zzso
