A method was developed to differentiate between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction combined with a restriction zzso zzso zzso This fast and simple zzso applied to pure culture zzso was developed using the zzso DNA zzso as previously proposed by other zzso zzso from international collections were used to zzso the method which was then applied to the identification of strains isolated from food zzso zzso were specific for the zzso zzso zzso Only zzso zzso gave the same size zzso product, but it was easily differentiated from strains in the zzso zzso group by using restriction analysis, based on zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and good zzso were obtained using pure zzso suggesting the possibility of using the method described to identify the zzso zzso group directly in food zzso
