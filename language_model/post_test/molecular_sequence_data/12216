The collagen triple zzso is a unique protein motif defined by the zzso of three zzso chains in a zzso II zzso It is a major domain of all collagen proteins and is also reported to exist in proteins with host defense function and in several membrane zzso The zzso domain has distinctive zzso zzso requires a high proportion of the zzso modified zzso acid zzso and water to stabilize its zzso and zzso The crystal structure of a zzso zzso determined to zzso zzso showed that these two features may be zzso 

A detailed analysis of the zzso structure of the zzso zzso is zzso The water molecules around the zzso and zzso groups show distinctive zzso There are repetitive patterns of water bridges that link oxygen atoms within a single zzso chain, between different chains and between different triple zzso Overall, the water molecules are organized in a zzso structure that surrounds and zzso triple zzso in the crystal zzso zzso groups play a crucial role in the zzso 

The roles of zzso and zzso are strongly interrelated in the structure of the collagen triple zzso The specific, repetitive water bridges observed in this structure buttress the zzso zzso The extensively ordered zzso structure offers a good model for the interpretation of the experimental results on collagen stability and zzso
