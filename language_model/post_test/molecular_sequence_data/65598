In this study we report the complete sequence and zzso organization of the zzso I zzso coronavirus zzso strain zzso Furthermore, a reverse genetic system was established for this zzso strain by cloning a full-length zzso copy into zzso zzso This clone served as basis for the generation of zzso zzso zzso that was shown to bear the same features in zzso as the parental zzso Using this system, accessory zzso genes in the zzso zzso were replaced by green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso In addition, we showed that zzso zzso blood zzso and zzso cells can be easily detected after infection with zzso Thus, our established reverse genetic system provides a suitable tool to study the molecular biology of zzso I zzso
