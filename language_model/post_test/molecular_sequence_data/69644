Class I regulatory complex zzso located in the zzso region of zzso class I gene contains zzso enhancing zzso called zzso zzso This zzso A region contains zzso zzso zzso sites, one of which has a zzso perfect zzso zzso The second zzso zzso site, juxtaposed to the perfect zzso contains an imperfect zzso zzso In zzso nuclear zzso we have identified at least four zzso protein zzso three shared the repeated zzso B zzso as their binding zzso The perfect zzso sequence facilities the binding of a complex termed zzso while the imperfect zzso provides the binding sites for two other complexes, zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso complexes exhibited binding zzso with other zzso zzso motifs and recognized both the perfect and imperfect zzso zzso whereas the zzso complex was specific for the perfect zzso sequence which is unique to the class I zzso A DNA segment outside the repeated zzso B enhancers probably binds the fourth complex, zzso These complexes, except for the perfect zzso complex, differ from those described for the zzso class I zzso The binding characteristics of these factors suggest that the mechanism controlling the class I zzso may be quite zzso
