Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoting zzso in mice were shown to be zzso zzso natural zzso that react with zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that human zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from a patient with multiple sclerosis targets zzso structures similar to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the variable regions revealed that the zzso zzso are also zzso by zzso zzso These similarities of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso promoting zzso suggest that this human zzso is a natural zzso This may imply that the engineering of human zzso for therapy of zzso diseases is zzso
