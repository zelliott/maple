zzso zzso zzso zzso to the human and mouse zzso zzso expressed specifically in the rat zzso was cloned by zzso zzso The zzso mapped to zzso 16 in the rat zzso is made up of 6 zzso and the zzso boundaries obey to the zzso zzso The gene contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso 323 zzso acid sequences with theoretical molecular weight of zzso zzso and zzso point of zzso One zzso island is located in the gene from site zzso to zzso A typical promoter is also predicted from site zzso to zzso According to the zzso analysis of the putative protein zzso by the rat zzso no zzso region and no signal peptides are found in the zzso zzso zzso results show that the zzso gene is expressed specifically in the zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso occurs in a development zzso zzso According to the zzso results, no expression of zzso is detected until the rat is 30 d old after zzso The amount of zzso zzso increases from zzso to zzso rat and then keeps stable after zzso In conclusion, this study proves the conservation of zzso in zzso animals and predicts its important role in zzso
