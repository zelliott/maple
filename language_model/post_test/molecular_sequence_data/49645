The zzso zzso was isolated and characterized from three different infectious clones of zzso C virus zzso One zzso was from a zzso that normally responds to therapy zzso and the other two were from more resistant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the differences among these zzso are generally minor, all three zzso have distinct zzso zzso is less selective for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less zzso and zzso zzso DNA more rapidly and binds DNA more tightly than the other two zzso Unlike related zzso different zzso acid sequences stimulate zzso zzso by zzso zzso at different maximum rates and with different apparent zzso This zzso acid stimulation profile is zzso among the zzso but it does not result entirely from differential zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequences of the three proteins differ by up to zzso one zzso zzso acid that is critical for zzso action was zzso zzso zzso 450 is a zzso in zzso and zzso and is an zzso in zzso A zzso zzso with an zzso zzso for zzso 450 zzso DNA more rapidly and binds DNA more tightly than the parent zzso
