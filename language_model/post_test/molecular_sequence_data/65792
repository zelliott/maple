zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso exchange factors zzso is fundamental to zzso zzso signaling zzso Two main zzso families use either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso region 2 zzso zzso zzso How zzso zzso distinguish between the zzso zzso and zzso is not zzso To determine how these zzso specifically recognize the two zzso zzso we studied the zzso acid sequences in zzso and zzso that are crucial for zzso by zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso related zzso zzso Two elements in the zzso regions of zzso and zzso were found to be essential for specific interactions with zzso and zzso One element consists of divergent zzso acid zzso in the switch 1 regions of the zzso zzso these zzso were also found to be important for zzso recognition by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings were unexpected because the same zzso were shown previously to interact with zzso zzso rather than zzso The other element comprises divergent zzso in the zzso strand that are known to mediate specific recognition by zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso zzso of four of these zzso were sufficient for zzso to be specifically activated by zzso Thus, zzso and zzso specifically recognize zzso and zzso through their switch 1 as well as zzso regions and the mode of recognition via switch 1 appears to be zzso among diverse zzso zzso zzso
