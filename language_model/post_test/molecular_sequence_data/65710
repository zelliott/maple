Natural selection is expected to eliminate genetic zzso from zzso zzso We have discovered a globally distributed zzso in the primarily zzso species zzso zzso that has been maintained despite its negative consequences for zzso zzso zzso for a naturally occurring deletion of the zzso acting gene zzso arrest if their zzso parent carries an incompatible zzso of a second, zzso zzso zzso The two interacting zzso are tightly linked, with incompatible zzso occurring in linkage zzso in two common zzso These zzso exhibit elevated sequence zzso and population genetic analyses of this region indicate that natural selection is preserving both zzso in the zzso Our data suggest that long-term maintenance of a balanced zzso has permitted the zzso to persist despite gene flow across the rest of the zzso
