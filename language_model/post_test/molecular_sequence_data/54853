zzso zzso coli zzso is a food-borne pathogen that can cause severe health complications and zzso a much lower infectious dose than other zzso coli zzso Despite having an intact zzso zzso zzso the majority of zzso strains are zzso zzso negative under tested zzso zzso activity potentially assists with survival fitness by enhancing acid tolerance during passage through the stomach or by aiding with colonization in either human or animal zzso Previously, in the zzso zzso zzso strain, a point zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified, resulting in a substitution of an amber stop zzso for zzso This single zzso zzso zzso is observed in the majority of zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a negative zzso zzso in zzso We demonstrate that the lack of zzso activity in zzso is not solely due to the amber zzso in zzso Our analysis has identified two additional zzso in zzso affecting zzso acid positions 38 and zzso in both cases determining whether the zzso zzso acid is zzso or zzso zzso analysis based on zzso protein sequences from a variety of zzso bacteria demonstrates that the zzso at position 38 is highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso reveal that the zzso substitution enhances zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso substitution does zzso zzso sequence typing analysis for a variety of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso combined with the zzso sequence reveals that except for a subset of the zzso zzso neither the in zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso sequence is zzso zzso
