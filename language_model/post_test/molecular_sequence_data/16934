The zzso cycle of zzso occurs in a membrane compartment called an zzso zzso is a member of a family of proteins zzso and zzso onto the inclusion membrane by zzso zzso proteins from different species of zzso show little sequence zzso We report that the zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Both proteins zzso to form zzso When artificially expressed by the host cell, they zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso completely zzso zzso inclusion zzso Using truncated forms of zzso from zzso zzso we show that expression of the zzso zzso domain of the protein at the surface of the zzso zzso is sufficient to disrupt the bacterial zzso zzso On the other hand, development of a zzso zzso strain that does not express zzso is not inhibited by artificial zzso zzso showing that the disruptive effect observed with the zzso strain requires direct interactions between zzso molecules at the inclusion and on the zzso zzso Finally, we modeled zzso zzso in parallel four zzso zzso based on the structure of the zzso complex, a zzso structure involved in membrane fusion in zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were highly stable in this zzso In conclusion, we show that the property of zzso proteins to assemble into zzso structures is zzso between zzso species, and we propose that these proteins may have zzso with the zzso machinery for a role in membrane zzso
