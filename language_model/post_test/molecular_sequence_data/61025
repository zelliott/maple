zzso is a zzso in rats but generally tests negative in standard zzso zzso However, zzso a potent zzso zzso of zzso and zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso cause extensive single strand breaks in DNA in a manner that is dependent on the formation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso therefore, investigated whether zzso zzso have the potential to behave as zzso The shuttle zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso was treated with zzso and zzso in both human zzso cells and zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso frequency increased zzso and zzso in human zzso and bacterial zzso cells, zzso Base zzso were the major type of zzso and they occurred predominantly at zzso sites in both cell zzso A high frequency of deletions zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso The most common types of zzso in zzso cells were zzso to zzso transitions zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the major zzso were zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso transitions zzso The zzso zzso were similar to those reported for zzso zzso suggesting that zzso generated from zzso zzso not only plays a role in zzso but also provides a basis for their zzso and zzso
