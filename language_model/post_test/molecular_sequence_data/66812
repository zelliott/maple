zzso zzso zzso have a multitude of roles in the cell, many of which remain to be zzso However, it is difficult to detect novel zzso in zzso zzso To advance biological knowledge, zzso methods that can accurately detect zzso in zzso zzso are therefore zzso The increasing number of zzso sequences provides a rich zzso for zzso comparative sequence analysis and detection of novel zzso 

Here, zzso a program for predicting secondary structures common to two zzso sequences on the basis of minimizing folding free energy change, is zzso as a zzso zzso detection zzso The zzso optimal total free energy change, which scores the structural alignment and the free energy change of folding into a common structure for two zzso zzso is shown to be an effective measure for distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso To make the zzso as a zzso the total free energy change of an input sequence pair can either be compared with the total free energy changes of a set of control sequence pairs, or be used in combination with sequence length and zzso zzso as input to a zzso support zzso zzso The latter method is much faster, but slightly less sensitive at a given zzso Additionally, the zzso support zzso machine method is shown to be sensitive and specific on zzso zzso screens of two different zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso in which many zzso are zzso The zzso zzso experiments are also compared with two other zzso detection programs, zzso and zzso 

The zzso support zzso machine method is more sensitive for known zzso in the test zzso screens than zzso and zzso Additionally, both zzso methods are more sensitive than zzso and zzso at low sequence pair zzso zzso can be used as a comparable or more accurate tool than zzso or zzso in zzso screens, especially for zzso zzso zzso provides a method for discovering zzso in zzso zzso that other methods may not zzso zzso improvements in zzso zzso have also been zzso
