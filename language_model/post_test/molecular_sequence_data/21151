zzso sequencing has identified the causes of several zzso diseases, although it has rarely been used in a clinical setting to diagnose the genetic cause of an idiopathic disorder in a single zzso We performed zzso sequencing on a pedigree with several members affected with attention zzso disorder zzso in an effort to identify candidate zzso zzso to this complex zzso While we did identify some rare zzso that might zzso to zzso we have not yet proven the causality for any of zzso However, over the course of the study, one subject was discovered to have idiopathic zzso anemia zzso which was suspected to be genetic in zzso Analysis of this zzso zzso readily identified two rare zzso zzso in zzso gene as the most likely cause of the zzso although these two zzso had not been documented before in a single zzso We further confirmed the zzso by functional zzso testing, consistent with a diagnosis of red blood cell zzso zzso zzso Our study implies that zzso and zzso sequencing will certainly reveal additional rare variation zzso for even well-studied classical zzso diseases, while also revealing zzso that might play a role in complex zzso Furthermore, our study has clinical and ethical implications for zzso and zzso sequencing in a research setting; how to handle unrelated findings of clinical significance, in the context of originally planned complex disease research, remains a largely uncharted area for clinicians and zzso
