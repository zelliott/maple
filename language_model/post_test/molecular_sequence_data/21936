An zzso repeat in the zzso DNA of carrot zzso type zzso zzso has been zzso in the context of its zzso and downstream zzso zzso The zzso zzso repeat encodes zzso and zzso but the zzso reading frame does not zzso a stop zzso at a position predicted by alignment with other plant zzso zzso zzso extends into both of the downstream zzso sequences as unique zzso extensions of 224 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern and zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso In three additional zzso of carrot, zzso and zzso are zzso but are present as single copies within the zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene has a zzso extension like zzso but in zzso zzso and zzso the zzso genes lack zzso extensions and have stop zzso and 3' zzso like those of other plant zzso zzso The zzso extensions are transcribed in zzso and zzso and result in longer primary transcripts than those from zzso and zzso Western zzso of zzso proteins from all zzso detected zzso products of the predicted zzso size in all zzso irrespective of the presence of a zzso extension in the reading zzso
