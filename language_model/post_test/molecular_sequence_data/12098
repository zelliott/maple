We have identified a novel zzso zzso named zzso obtained from a zzso library of zzso prepared from zzso cells that had been zzso exposed to zzso a potent zzso zzso The amount of transcript increased with zzso treatment of zzso cells and the transcript was highly expressed in mouse zzso As the zzso mouse zzso which has a zzso in germ cell zzso barely expressed the transcript, the message was expected to be expressed specifically in zzso The zzso was detected at significant levels in the zzso from mice aged 16 days after birth, suggesting that its expression started at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence contained a zzso open reading frame, and the expected zzso acid sequence had a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the fusion protein including zzso zzso revealed an approximately zzso band of a translation product in zzso and in cultured cells zzso with zzso zzso in the expression zzso on zzso zzso The protein was localized to the zzso region of round and zzso zzso However, it was not detected at a more advanced stage of zzso zzso just before their release from zzso zzso This protein may play an important role in zzso
