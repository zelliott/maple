zzso of major zzso zzso class I complexes on target cells by killer cell zzso receptors zzso blocks natural killer zzso and T cell zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso requires the zzso association of zzso with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso genetic model, we first define a requirement for the zzso family protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We then investigate how zzso zzso interrupts zzso zzso cell zzso zzso Specifically, we show that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling chain, the zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso of zzso inactive zzso zzso as a dominant zzso restores the zzso zzso of these signaling events and reverses zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso These results suggest sequential roles for zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso following zzso recognition by zzso zzso
