The zzso zzso of many zzso including growth factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso released from cells, a process termed zzso zzso necrosis zzso converting zzso zzso is a zzso that sheds tumor necrosis zzso and other zzso To study the regulation of zzso zzso we examined the effects of stimulation of cells on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso distribution of zzso on the surface of zzso cells, and stimulation of zzso cells with zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso for zzso Surface zzso experiments confirmed and extended this zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso without increasing the turnover of total zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso were not detected in the medium of cells that had zzso zzso and zzso was not zzso when zzso was zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that zzso zzso was zzso in response to zzso Surprisingly, a zzso inhibitor prevented the zzso turnover of zzso Thus, zzso activates shedding and causes the zzso of a major zzso suggesting that induced shedding may be regulated by a mechanism that decreases the amount of active zzso on the cell zzso
