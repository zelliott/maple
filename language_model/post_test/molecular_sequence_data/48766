zzso virus zzso is one of the most prevalent viral pathogens infecting laboratory mice and zzso To date, mature zzso zzso have been used as zzso for zzso zzso To develop zzso that are more specific and easier to prepare for diagnosis, we examined the zzso sites in the zzso protein zzso of zzso with zzso from zzso zzso mice and a zzso array membrane containing overlapping zzso peptides covering the entire zzso We found zzso linear sequences in two regions, zzso acids zzso and zzso of the zzso From these zzso zzso we applied two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to positions zzso and zzso of the zzso respectively, as zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso using these peptides revealed that they were specific to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso using these peptides were able to distinguish between zzso and zzso mouse zzso to the same extent as a commercial zzso zzso These results indicate that these peptides are useful for the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso
