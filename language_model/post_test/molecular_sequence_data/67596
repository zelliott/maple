zzso zzso strain zzso is a widely used model zzso However, little is known about its genetic origins, as it was created in the 1970s from crossing zzso strains of uncertain zzso To obtain insights into its ancestry and zzso we zzso the zzso of its zzso zzso a zzso model of zzso zzso The combination of two next-generation sequencing zzso technologies zzso and zzso zzso yielded an zzso zzso zzso assembly at an zzso zzso length of 262 zzso Although sequencing was substantially more precise and sensitive than zzso zzso zzso both zzso platforms produced a number of false zzso At a zzso average coverage, only 74 per cent of called differences to the zzso reference zzso were confirmed by both zzso The consensus zzso zzso differs in zzso positions from zzso predicting altered zzso acid sequence in 799 zzso including factors of zzso and stress zzso The zzso zzso zzso is virtually identical (less than equal to zzso variations per zzso to zzso and thus originates in the same zzso zzso regions distribute zzso over the zzso with zzso XVI the most zzso and zzso zzso the least zzso zzso Several of these clusters are shared with zzso another widely used zzso model, indicating that these strains share a second zzso Thus, the zzso zzso pictures details of complex genetic relationships between the model strains that date back to the early days of experimental zzso zzso Moreover, this study zzso the necessity of combining multiple zzso and zzso techniques for achieving accurate zzso calling in zzso zzso
