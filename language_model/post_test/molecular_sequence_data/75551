Most zzso produce gas zzso zzso The zzso species zzso zzso and some zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso produce large amounts of zzso which have a zzso zzso Most other zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other recently characterized zzso zzso strains possess zzso with a zzso zzso The number of intact particles in the latter zzso is only 10 to zzso of that of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso envelope proteins zzso by zzso on zzso zzso gels showed that the zzso of the highly efficient zzso strains migrated faster than the zzso of the zzso zzso The relative molecular mass of the zzso was estimated to be 19 zzso zzso for zzso strains zzso and 20 zzso for zzso strains zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the first 40 zzso acids of the zzso parts of zzso and zzso indicated that the two proteins differed in two defined zzso zzso in relation to zzso had zzso and zzso always replaced by zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that at least two different zzso genes exist in zzso zzso zzso This was directly demonstrated by zzso experiments with zzso DNA zzso A zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso Only a zzso zzso zzso to the same zzso zzso when both zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were zzso These findings support the assumption that zzso is expressed by a zzso zzso gene and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso
