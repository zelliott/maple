The synthesis of a zzso for the zzso converting zzso using the continuous flow zzso solid phase method has been zzso The zzso group, employed to protect zzso side chain, was cleanly removed during the synthesis in the presence of zzso based protecting groups to enable the introduction of the zzso zzso The zzso was obtained in zzso yield after reverse phase zzso zzso
