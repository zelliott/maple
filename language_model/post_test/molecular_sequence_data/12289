The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified, zzso and zzso The zzso and translation gene was zzso in zzso coli, resulting in high-level (up to zzso of total zzso production of zzso that could be zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso produced by zzso coli had kinetic and stability properties similar to those of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed high similarity with those of zzso that belong to zzso zzso family 1, implicating a zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by an zzso or a zzso led to a high reduction in specific activity zzso or zzso respectively), indicating that this zzso is the active site zzso involved in zzso above 100 degrees zzso
