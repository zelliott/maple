We have found that synthetic peptides derived from the two zzso growth zzso zzso of factor zzso are zzso of tissue factor dependent factor X zzso zzso was most pronounced for a constrained sequence of zzso acids corresponding to positions zzso of factor zzso zzso The biological activity appeared to be localized to the zzso zzso zzso within the larger zzso The zzso zzso was also an inhibitor of tissue factor induced zzso of zzso using zzso tissue factor or tissue factor expressed on the surface of living zzso However, it did not interfere with intrinsic zzso zzso of factor X zzso was zzso with an zzso value of 350 zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso zzso with respect to factor X and suggested that the zzso sequence interferes with the factor zzso zzso X complex formation and zzso A zzso analog of the putative zzso was also a zzso inhibitor of factor X zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso but the zzso zzso alone was without zzso Our results suggest a direct role for the second zzso growth zzso domain of factor zzso and in particular its loop I, in the formation and function of the factor zzso zzso X zzso
