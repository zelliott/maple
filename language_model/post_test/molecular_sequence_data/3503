The zzso zzso against zzso zzso was raised and its zzso properties were zzso In the Western zzso zzso the zzso zzso recognized a specific protein band of approximately 50 zzso 5 zzso in human zzso extract and approximately 72 zzso 5 zzso in human zzso zzso The myeloma zzso control did not recognize these specific protein zzso In the zzso studies, the zzso zzso and not the myeloma zzso predominantly reacted with the zzso regions of zzso human zzso In the zzso reaction zzso the zzso zzso showed a significant zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The myeloma zzso did not affect the zzso zzso There was no apparent effect of zzso on zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso if humanized by genetic engineering technology, may provide a useful zzso zzso
