Roughly zzso of zzso zzso in melanoma families zzso affect zzso and zzso We investigated the association between zzso zzso and the occurrence of pancreatic cancer in zzso and in sporadic pancreatic cancer zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 66 zzso cases and 54 controls were zzso The zzso locus was zzso 

As compared with the general population, the risk of pancreatic cancer zzso was increased zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while mean ages at onset were 61 and 77 years, zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso increased risk of cancer at any site was observed among first-degree relatives of zzso cases as compared with zzso The zzso founder zzso was detected in zzso of zzso cases but the rate increased to zzso when tumor zzso in either branch of families was taken into zzso One zzso PC patient with a melanoma in a first-degree relative zzso a zzso deletion of the second zzso including zzso zzso 

The presence of a deletion including zzso zzso in two PC patients points to the involvement of zzso in the development of PC and may suggest that the increased risk of PC in zzso is caused by impairment of both zzso
