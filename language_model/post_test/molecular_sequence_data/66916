zzso zzso zzso is a discrete protein domain that binds zzso protein zzso a molecular zzso involved in diverse cell zzso including zzso protein degradation zzso Here we characterize a human zzso zzso zzso that is highly zzso in zzso which we have renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso and zzso protection experiments suggest that zzso is an integral membrane protein of the zzso zzso and nuclear envelope with both its zzso and zzso facing the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso deletion derivatives of zzso in zzso cells revealed that a single zzso sequence located near the zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments confirmed that zzso binds zzso via its zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso indicated that zzso exists in a complex with other zzso factors involved in zzso zzso of zzso enhanced the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso reduction of zzso expression almost completely blocked zzso zzso protein levels were increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease and control subjects revealed that zzso accumulates zzso in zzso undergoing zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso These results suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso and in Alzheimer's zzso
