The zzso protein zzso family comprises proteins predicted to be structurally related to the zzso transport protein zzso zzso The function of zzso is not yet fully established, but recent data suggest that they are involved in zzso zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the zzso coli zzso in two crystal zzso one at zzso A resolution in the presence of zzso and the other at zzso A resolution in the presence of zinc and zzso The structures revealed five zzso sites per zzso Of these, the zinc zzso bound at sites I and II are coordinated in zzso zzso to the side chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three water molecules at the putative zzso zzso Of these four zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso bind the central zinc zzso I) together with two water zzso The side chain of zzso also binds to the zinc zzso at site zzso zzso zzso bind at site I only, replacing one of the water molecules coordinated to the zinc zzso The zzso four zzso acid sequence motif zzso constitutes the signature sequence of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso form direct hydrogen bonds to each other over the zzso interface at the area, which in zzso constitutes the rear part of its zzso zzso The putative zzso channel of zzso is consequently zzso and broader than its counterpart in zzso
