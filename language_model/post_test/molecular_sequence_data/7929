We have investigated two regions of the viral zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso as potential targets for zzso zzso An zzso targeted to the zzso region of the viral zzso was shown to block the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso reverse zzso in zzso This arrest of reverse zzso was independent of the presence of zzso H activity associated with the reverse zzso zzso A second zzso targeted to a site adjacent to the primer binding site inhibited reverse zzso in an zzso zzso zzso These two zzso were zzso linked to a zzso carrier and tested for their ability to inhibit zzso infection in cell zzso Both zzso inhibited virus production in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that they inhibited zzso DNA synthesis in infected zzso In contrast, an zzso zzso targeted to the zzso sequence did not inhibit zzso DNA synthesis but inhibited viral production at a later step of virus zzso These experiments show that zzso zzso targeted to two regions of zzso viral zzso can inhibit the first step of viral zzso reverse zzso prevent the synthesis of zzso DNA in cell zzso
