zzso and orchestrating the genetic program involved in embryonic zzso of brain structures is a major function played by zzso containing zzso Recently, analysis of conditional mouse zzso has pointed out additional roles in supporting adult brain functional zzso During a search for novel zzso genes in the public released zzso sequences derived by the Human and Mouse zzso projects, we were able to identify the mouse zzso of the zzso brain specific zzso zzso We named it zzso and characterized its expression in embryonic and zzso mouse zzso Interestingly, zzso shows an expression pattern restricted to a few specific developing brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body and zzso nucleus are the only brain structures where we detected zzso zzso activity, which is maintained also after zzso In particular, zzso might be considered an important molecular marker for early embryonic stages of zzso development, being specifically expressed in this neural structure from zzso zzso
