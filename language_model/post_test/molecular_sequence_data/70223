The zzso sequence of the gene zzso chicken zzso protein zzso was zzso The gene contains eight zzso and seven zzso which spread over zzso zzso The zzso initiation sites were located on four consecutive zzso zzso which are at the zzso zzso of a short zzso tract of eight zzso flanked by G + zzso zzso Neither a zzso zzso nor a zzso box was found in the zzso zzso Instead, a short A + zzso stretch was found at the position where the zzso box is expected to zzso There is an intensive nuclear protein binding motif repeated four times in the region zzso to zzso This motif is common to many zzso protein genes and may play an important role in the control of zzso protein gene zzso
