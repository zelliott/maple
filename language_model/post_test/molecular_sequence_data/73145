The viral zzso of 5 zzso C virus zzso zzso patients was analyzed and compared with that in zzso from zzso zzso The patients were followed zzso with regard to changes in zzso region 1 zzso of zzso using a direct DNA sequencing zzso For the zzso patients, viral zzso sequence zzso was markedly lower than in zzso zzso zzso For 1 zzso patient and 1 AIDS patient, no variation in the major zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso could be observed, while another zzso patient exhibited transient variations and zzso acid zzso despite the lack of functioning zzso immune zzso The study supports the general hypothesis of zzso immune selection as the main force of sequence variation in the zzso region but suggests that other selection mechanisms may contribute to zzso of the composition of the viral zzso
