Active human promoters produce zzso transcripts zzso Why these zzso are coupled to zzso whereas their neighboring zzso zzso are not, is zzso Here zzso sequencing demonstrates that zzso generally initiate in the zzso direction closely upstream of the zzso start sites zzso of their associated zzso zzso zzso share features with zzso zzso including stalled zzso zzso II zzso and the production of small zzso zzso zzso motif analyses around zzso 3' ends reveal zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso zzso signals are functional but linked to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso signals are zzso in zzso versus zzso regions, thus allowing for more efficient zzso progress in the sense direction from gene zzso We conclude that zzso sequence distribution around human gene promoters serves to provide a directional zzso output from an otherwise zzso zzso zzso
