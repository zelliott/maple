Common nomenclature describing the geometry of zzso acid structures was established at a 1988 zzso Workshop on DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1989) The zzso Journal 8, zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso & zzso 6, zzso Dickerson, zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso & zzso 6, zzso Dickerson, zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso We have subsequently developed and incorporated sophisticated mathematics in a computer program to calculate the parameters described by the zzso The program zzso all the local parameters relating complementary bases and neighboring base and base pairs in both Cartesian and zzso coordinate zzso In addition, the main mathematical property requested by the zzso zzso the magnitude of the parameters be independent of strand or direction of zzso accomplished without the use of a midway coordinate frame for the zzso zzso The mathematics preserve the physical zzso used in defining the zzso in particular, the zzso parameters are true zzso based on a simple physical model zzso at constant angular zzso for a unit amount of time), not zzso angles or angles between zzso and planes as is the case with other zzso As a result, the mathematical equations are zzso with the property that a 5 degrees tilt is the same as a 5 degrees roll or a 5 degrees twist, except that the zzso take place about different zzso In other approaches, a 5 degrees tilt can mean a different amount of net rotation from a 5 degrees roll or a 5 degrees zzso In addition, a great deal of flexibility is built into the program so that the user has control over the analysis, including the input format, the coordinate frame used for the base pairing relationship, the point about which the zzso are performed, and which geometric relationships are zzso While there is a great deal of flexibility, the program is easy to zzso zzso queries and user accessible files make the options in the program very convenient to tailor to individual zzso In addition, there is also a program that zzso bond zzso zzso angles, and zzso angles along the zzso acid zzso and within the sugar and base zzso Another program zzso the identities of the bond zzso zzso angles, and zzso angles that the user would like to zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
