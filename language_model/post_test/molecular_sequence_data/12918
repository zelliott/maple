Our laboratory has previously shown that zzso zzso administration of zzso suppresses brain and liver zzso zzso activity zzso a growth regulatory zzso in zzso zzso This investigation zzso in zzso rats, the relative participation of brain zzso zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso effects, by comparing tissue zzso responses to zzso given alone zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso of zzso alone significantly decreased brain and liver zzso activity 4 h after injection, and the effect was completely blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso The blockade of zzso zzso zzso interactions by either zzso (at doses zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone was accompanied by increased levels of zzso zzso zzso The results obtained demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in central as well as in peripheral zzso by interacting with brain zzso zzso but not with zzso or zzso receptors or zzso zzso zzso Also, they indicate that zzso zzso systems have a zzso zzso influence on zzso activity which is zzso at least in part, by zzso and zzso zzso
