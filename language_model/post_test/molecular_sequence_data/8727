zzso zzso receptors zzso are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate gene zzso in response to zzso zzso and fatty zzso zzso also play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso It is zzso however, what naturally occurring compounds activate each of the zzso zzso To address this issue, a screening zzso was established using zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso to several members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was employed to compare the zzso of zzso family members by known zzso zzso including zzso zzso and fatty zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso by fatty acids was partially inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso which prevents zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso and 2, zzso and 2, and zzso zzso while a number of other zzso had no zzso We also screened a variety of zzso acids zzso for the ability to activate zzso zzso but not other zzso was a strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was zzso In addition, zzso was able to induce differentiation of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso are zzso activated by naturally occurring zzso and related zzso
