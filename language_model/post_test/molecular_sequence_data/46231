DNA sequence data enable not only the zzso of zzso relationships but also provide an efficient method for zzso identifications under the terms DNA zzso or DNA zzso In this study, we have zzso partial sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes from 63 specimens of 8 species of zzso to assess whether DNA zzso can efficiently distinguish these zzso zzso from zzso regions of four other species of this family were gathered from zzso Comparisons of within and between species levels of sequence divergence showed that genetic variation between species exceeds variation within zzso When using zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso zzso all species fell into zzso zzso zzso with high zzso zzso These evidenced that these zzso species can be efficiently identified by DNA zzso zzso relationships of zzso were also examined using the two zzso zzso The results are almost consistent with zzso zzso which was proposed on the basis of shell zzso and the zzso characteristics of zzso
