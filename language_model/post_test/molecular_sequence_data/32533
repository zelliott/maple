zzso zzso 1 zzso is an essential zzso of zzso and folate metabolism in the zzso zzso zzso The present work is focused on the degradation of zzso during growth phase in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein was zzso in the stationary phase of growth at the time when the zzso were undergoing zzso Fluorescence zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein extending to the zzso in these stationary phase zzso zzso that degradation of the protein was not by the usual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A probable destruction box of nine zzso acids zzso and possible zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso zzso to be the site for zzso zzso This suggests that zzso degradation during the stationary phase of growth is zzso by the zzso This leads to lower levels of zzso which favors zzso and subsequently results in a highly zzso stage of the zzso zzso this finding has importance to identify new target zzso like the zzso for therapeutic zzso
