Fusion of the zzso envelope with the target cell membrane is a critical step of the zzso entry into the target zzso Several peptides based on the zzso of zzso zzso have been used in clinical trials as possible zzso fusion zzso Among these are zzso and zzso (also known as zzso Despite recent works, a detailed molecular picture of the zzso mechanism of these molecules is still zzso These peptides are usually depicted as zzso by zzso with the structure of the sequence of the zzso protein with which they are zzso However, structures like these would be highly unstable in solution and thus would not explain, by themselves, the ability that the two fusion zzso have to become zzso by water and also interact effectively with cell zzso To this effect, extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the structure and zzso behavior of zzso and zzso in water, as well as shorter zzso peptides zzso and zzso which show no zzso zzso We found that the studied zzso have no stable structure in solution in the time scale zzso Additionally, the zzso accessible area varies significantly during the zzso Our findings suggest that these peptides may assume not only one, but several possible sets of structures in solution, some of which more adequate to interact with the zzso whereas others might be better suited to interact with cell zzso Interestingly, and in accordance with published experimental studies, we verified that zzso displays considerably larger zzso structure than zzso Taking into account a recent study with design peptides with increased zzso it is possible that this feature may be related to the increased zzso efficiency of zzso relative to that of zzso
