zzso of a new type of slowly growing zzso were repeatedly isolated from zzso from a patient with pulmonary zzso This zzso zzso grew at 22, 31, 37, and 41 degrees C, possessed zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, and zzso zzso It did not produce zzso acid or have nitrate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and acid zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso The zzso is susceptible to zzso and resistant to zzso and zzso A zzso acid analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The results of comparative zzso zzso sequencing placed this zzso at an intermediate position between the rapidly and slowly growing zzso On the basis of the pattern of zzso activities and zzso properties, the results of fatty acid zzso and the unique zzso zzso zzso we propose that this zzso represents a new species, for which we propose the name zzso zzso The type strain is strain zzso a culture of this strain has been deposited in the Deutsche zzso von zzso und zzso as strain zzso zzso
