Novel zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso which were isolated from the zzso pocket of an adult patient with zzso disease and zzso dental zzso respectively, were studied zzso and zzso The zzso and differential zzso characteristics of these organisms are also described in this zzso These organisms were zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria that were zzso in most of the conventional zzso tests and closely resembled members of zzso oral zzso zzso On the other hand, protein profiles of whole cells in zzso and Western zzso reaction analysis distinguished these zzso from strains of the previously described zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso from the novel zzso was 50 and 51 zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso to other zzso oral zzso species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was less than zzso These organisms also exhibited a very low level of zzso with the DNA of zzso zzso the type species of the zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso sequence comparisons revealed that these organisms represent a novel lineage distinct from all previously described zzso of zzso zzso zzso On the basis of our results, it is suggested that strains zzso and zzso should be classified in a new zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
