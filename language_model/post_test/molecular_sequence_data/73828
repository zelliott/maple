A zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technique for amplifying a zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso growth hormone has been zzso Using this technique, a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dwarf zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was used to isolate the zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene has been zzso The zzso gene spans zzso zzso from the first zzso to zzso zzso and contains six zzso and five zzso similar to the zzso genes of zzso tilapia, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso contain zzso and satellite zzso The zzso found in the fifth zzso of the zzso gene are also present in the corresponding zzso of tilapia, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis revealed that the zzso gene is a zzso gene in the zzso The promoter region of the zzso zzso gene contains zzso sequences that are likely to be involved in the zzso expression of the zzso A zzso tree of zzso zzso sequences of all known zzso zzso genes has been zzso using the distance zzso zzso The zzso of this tree reflects the major zzso groupings of zzso The zzso patterns and repetitive sequences of zzso genes can serve as useful natural markers for the zzso and zzso studies of zzso
