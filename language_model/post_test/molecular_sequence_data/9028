zzso zzso zzso and zzso direct cardiac zzso gene zzso zzso zzso between zzso and their zzso targets determines zzso effects, but the functional consequences of human zzso sequence zzso are zzso 

To identify and investigate zzso in human zzso in order to better understand how and to what extent zzso sequence variation can impact zzso targeting and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso individual zzso for zzso sequence zzso identified a rare zzso of zzso zzso in the 3' end, well outside the seed region thought to determine target zzso In zzso zzso reporter analysis showed that the 3' zzso zzso altered suppression of a subset of artificial and natural zzso zzso zzso transgenic expression was used to compare consequences of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso induced heart failure in mice, but zzso zzso zzso recruitment of a subset of zzso target zzso to zzso zzso zzso complexes, altering zzso cardiac zzso and protein zzso and favorably zzso cardiac zzso In zzso analysis of zzso target site zzso and modeling of binding energies revealed abnormal zzso duplex zzso induced by the zzso zzso 

A naturally occurring zzso zzso outside the critical seed sequence zzso zzso targeting and zzso zzso This first description of in zzso effects from a natural human zzso zzso outside the seed sequence supports comprehensive studies of individual zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso
