A zzso DNA zzso zzso identifies distinguishable restriction zzso patterns from different zzso zzso zzso Analysis of these DNA fingerprint patterns from zzso cultivated over several years and from progeny of a zzso zzso cross showed the fingerprints to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments from the parents of the cross possessed sufficient zzso and number to generate 14 unique fingerprint patterns in 16 independent zzso zzso The zzso insert contains a zzso zzso repeated sequence found in zzso regions of multiple zzso zzso site variations both within and outside of the zzso repeat contribute to the fingerprint zzso zzso analysis can serve to type zzso zzso clones and can detect zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
