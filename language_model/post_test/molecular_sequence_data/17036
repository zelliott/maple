The human diseases zzso and zzso are caused by the bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and both species are regarded as potential zzso zzso We used zzso zzso DNA zzso to compare the zzso of several clinical and environmental zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a closely related but zzso zzso Open reading frames zzso deleted between the three species were associated with diverse cellular functions, including nitrogen and iron zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso zzso whereas deletions in zzso zzso were more zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso zzso may have zzso from zzso zzso and each other via distinct zzso The zzso of independent zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso with a large-scale zzso of less than zzso between zzso and at least three distinct molecular zzso could be zzso An analysis of zzso zzso regions suggests that DNA loss has played an important role in the evolutionary radiation of zzso zzso in the natural zzso Our results raise several hypotheses concerning the possible mechanisms underlying the diverse biological properties exhibited by members of the zzso zzso
