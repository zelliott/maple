The mechanisms that cause aging are not well zzso The zzso stress hypothesis proposes that the changes associated with aging are a consequence of random zzso damage to zzso We hypothesized that zzso of specific proteins is critical in controlling the rate of the aging zzso zzso an zzso probe for zzso modified zzso we show that zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso acid cycle, is a specific target during aging of the zzso The zzso damage detected zzso was paralleled by a loss of zzso activity of zzso an zzso activity that is critical in energy zzso Experimental zzso which decrease zzso activity should therefore cause a decrease in zzso This expected decrease was observed when flies were exposed to zzso which zzso zzso and when they were given zzso an inhibitor of zzso The identification of a specific target of zzso damage during aging allows for the assessment of the zzso age of a specific individual and provides a method for the evaluation of treatments designed to affect the aging zzso
