The zzso predominantly zzso red zzso strain zzso isolated from a brine pool in the Sinai peninsula zzso was characterized zzso On the basis of its polar zzso zzso the zzso sequences of its two zzso zzso zzso the DNA zzso content zzso zzso and its growth zzso the isolate could be assigned to the zzso zzso However, zzso analysis of the two zzso zzso genes detected in this zzso and low zzso zzso values with related zzso species showed that strain zzso is sufficiently different from the recognized zzso species to warrant its designation as a new zzso A new species, zzso zzso is therefore proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
