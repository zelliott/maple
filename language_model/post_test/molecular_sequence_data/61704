The molecular mechanisms underlying niche adaptation in bacteria are not fully zzso zzso infection by the pathogen group A zzso zzso takes place at either the throat or the skin of its human host, and zzso strains differ in tissue site zzso Many zzso strains bind host zzso via the zzso group A zzso M protein zzso present on the cell surface; zzso of genes zzso either zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso leads to loss of zzso at the zzso Unlike zzso which is present in only a subset of zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso is present in all zzso zzso In this study, the evolution of the zzso genes known to be involved in skin infection was zzso Most genetic diversity within zzso genes was localized to a region zzso the zzso domain zzso The gene zzso zzso displayed strong linkage zzso zzso zzso zzso with a distinct zzso cluster of the zzso zzso zzso Yet, zzso zzso of distant zzso showed a history of zzso zzso and high intrinsic levels of zzso were found among zzso strains having different tissue zzso The data suggest that zzso adaptations arise from zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso Additional analysis of zzso genes showed that approximately zzso of the zzso underwent strong diversifying zzso zzso acquisition of one zzso lineage from a zzso zzso donor species was also zzso Together, the data suggest that new zzso can be acquired through zzso zzso between zzso zzso while constrained functions can be zzso in this way, zzso genes may provide a rich and ready source for new zzso and thereby play a zzso role in the emergence of new niche adaptations in zzso
