zzso in addition to their structural role in the zzso zzso possess a number of functional binding zzso In this study, the binding to collagen of a zzso zzso is used as a model to define the molecular features involved in zzso interactions with other zzso Here we report the zzso stability of an overlapping set of zzso peptides that includes the zzso recognized by a zzso zzso to type III zzso Although the sequences of these peptides are very closely zzso by a translation of a single zzso along the collagen chain, substantial variations in the melting temperatures were zzso These variations in zzso stability could not be readily explained by differences in zzso acid content, or in numbers of charged or zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso which are adjacent to the zzso have a strong influence in reducing the zzso stability of zzso zzso Further studies, which were carried out on a set of zzso zzso peptides containing different zzso guest zzso confirm the zzso effect of such zzso The presence of zzso triplets may play an important role in specific functions of type III collagen by modulating the local zzso structure or zzso
