The signaling mechanisms that specify, guide and coordinate cell behavior during embryonic zzso are poorly zzso We report that a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cell polarity gene zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso extension, a critical zzso process required for the zzso of zzso structures in zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is expressed broadly in early development and subsequently in the nervous system, causes severely shortened trunk zzso a similar zzso results from zzso zzso translation using a zzso zzso zzso zzso with Keller zzso further demonstrate that zzso can regulate zzso extension in both zzso zzso and neural zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is not zzso The zzso zzso resembles those obtained with several other molecules with roles in zzso polarity zzso including zzso and zzso and zzso Unlike these zzso however, zzso has little effect on conventional zzso signaling in either zzso or fly zzso Thus our results strongly support the emerging hypothesis that a zzso analog of the zzso polarity zzso zzso zzso extension zzso
