Two zzso proteins were found to be prominently expressed in the human colon zzso zzso cell zzso Cloning and sequencing of one, a zzso zzso identified it as the human zzso of zzso a protein containing two zzso binding zzso and previously found only in the zzso cells of the rat and zzso zzso zzso The other, a zzso zzso is zzso containing a single zzso binding domain, previously found in a number of different cell types including human zzso zzso Despite the marked similarities in the zzso binding zzso of these two zzso their cellular distribution patterns are zzso different and vary with cellular zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso is mostly zzso and concentrated at the zzso zzso whereas zzso tends to be concentrated in large zzso inclusions mostly at the zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, each zzso is distributed to specific zzso of zzso with zzso concentrated in the leading edge and zzso more zzso Such different zzso of zzso and zzso within zzso cells implies different targeting mechanisms, zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso suggests a role in cell zzso which is also supported by the ability of immobilized zzso zzso to stimulate zzso of zzso zzso
