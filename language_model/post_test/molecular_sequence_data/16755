zzso virus is an zzso that replicates alternately in the zzso zzso and human zzso We investigated sequences of dengue type 3 virus in naturally infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and in eight patients from the same outbreak and reported that the extent of sequence variation seen with the mosquitoes was generally lower than that seen with the patients zzso diversity, zzso versus zzso and zzso versus zzso for the envelope zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This was further verified with five zzso infected mosquitoes zzso diversity, zzso and zzso for the E and C zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structures of the E sequences of the mosquitoes and of the patients revealed that the sequences of the major zzso were the same, suggesting that the major zzso was zzso These findings support our hypothesis that mosquitoes contribute to the evolutionary conservation of dengue virus by maintaining a more zzso viral population and a dominant zzso during zzso
