We and others have identified zzso as a direct zzso target of the zzso zzso zzso specific fusion zzso zzso We hypothesized zzso growth factor zzso 4 zzso may act as an zzso of zzso contributing to zzso zzso zzso However, we demonstrate that enhanced expression of zzso does not contribute to inhibited zzso enhanced zzso or transformation downstream of zzso in primary mouse zzso Therefore we were unable to identify any contribution of up regulation of wild type zzso to zzso driven zzso zzso a zzso active zzso of zzso can enhance primary zzso proliferation and zzso indicating zzso zzso of zzso could contribute to the development and progression of zzso We zzso the zzso zzso from five zzso cell lines and identified no zzso zzso nor any association with any human single zzso zzso within the zzso coding zzso
