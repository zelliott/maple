zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso gene are linked to the zzso transformation of zzso zzso and represent an early step in the development of zzso zzso zzso percent of all zzso result in the expression of a truncated zzso protein lacking the zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso protein may have a tumor zzso function as its absence appears to be linked to the development of zzso zzso Recently, we discovered and characterized a protein called zzso which binds specifically to the zzso region of the zzso zzso We show now that zzso and the other known members of the zzso family zzso and zzso also bind directly to zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso analyses reveal a distinct zzso pattern during zzso as well as an association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso The previously described zzso of the zzso protein at the leading edge of membrane zzso contact zzso fibers that contain zzso or zzso
