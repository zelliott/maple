zzso of metal zzso is vital for zzso bacteria facing drastic metal concentration changes in various locations within the host during zzso zzso receptors zzso one of the zzso components of zzso cassette zzso have been shown to be essential in this zzso zzso zzso expresses two characterized zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso functions of zzso and zzso respectively, have been well zzso Here we describe zzso as a third putative zzso zzso zzso The analysis of a zzso tree built from the sequence alignment of 68 proteins reveals a zzso of members displaying an unusual genetic zzso zzso The zzso gene belongs to a zzso transcript spanning the zzso to zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two adjacent repeats of imperfect zzso consensus sequence were identified upstream of the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and structural studies of zzso zzso were performed to identify the metal specificity of the zzso Using zzso mass zzso in native conditions, we found that zzso was bound to zzso zzso zzso of the effect of 10 zzso zzso on the zzso stability of zzso revealed that zzso had the most pronounced stabilizing zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been solved to zzso A zzso One zzso zzso is bound to each zzso zzso in a symmetrical active site composed of three His and one zzso The structure almost perfectly superimposed on the known zzso zzso The presence of a flexible zzso loop close to the zzso site is specific to those specialized in zzso zzso Taken together, these functional and structural data provide new perspectives related to the zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
