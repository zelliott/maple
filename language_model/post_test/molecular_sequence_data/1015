zzso immunity to zzso relies on the specific sensing of zzso molecules by host recognition zzso Whereas studies in animals have largely focused on the recognition of zzso zzso molecules by the zzso zzso zzso zzso few studies have been carried out in plants, and it is not understood how these molecules are zzso or zzso The rice zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that provides immunity against strains of the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso We identified four zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with similarity to a membrane fusion zzso an zzso cassette zzso and an outer membrane zzso respectively, of bacterial type I zzso zzso The fourth zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso analysis of three naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso strains no longer recognized by zzso revealed zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso for zzso of a double zzso zzso confirming the function of zzso in type I zzso These results indicate that bacterial type I zzso is necessary for zzso recognition and immunity and further suggest that type I zzso and modification of zzso molecules play an important role in triggering the innate immune response in zzso
