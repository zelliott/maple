A zzso tentatively designated zzso zzso belonging to the zzso group zzso zzso was previously isolated from carpet shell clams in zzso zzso zzso In the present study, based on molecular data, a potential zzso zzso zzso was identified from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso associated with whale carcasses zzso zzso zzso collected at shelf depths in the northwest Pacific zzso zzso Small zzso zzso DNA sequences zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso from Spain and Japan were almost identical zzso one substitution and one zzso zzso On the other hand, differences of 10 and 8 zzso were found in two internal transcribed zzso regions of zzso DNA, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between these two zzso respectively, indicating that they are genetically different at the population zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso occurs worldwide and can associate with (and possibly zzso various types of zzso Further, a zzso method to specifically detect the zzso zzso cells in the host was also zzso
