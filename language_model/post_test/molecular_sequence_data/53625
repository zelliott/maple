Crystal formation by zzso zzso is a well-known but rare complication of zzso zzso We have designed an in zzso model of zzso by zzso to mice zzso clones producing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso a singular zzso that formed zzso both in the zzso plasma cells and as zzso and zzso deposits in the kidney zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso of deposits was reminiscent of those in zzso zzso A zzso clone that only differed from zzso by a zzso acid deletion in the zzso zzso increased its zzso level by zzso and produced an abundant bona fide serum zzso zzso in mice, without crystal formation within zzso zzso it yielded no zzso deposits but only zzso zzso in zzso zzso of kidney zzso reminiscent of those seen in the human zzso syndrome, without other zzso zzso A limited variation in the zzso domain thus proved able to increase zzso to abrogate zzso and to modify patterns of zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso sequences were related to previously reported zzso zzso all including a zzso chain and zzso zzso zzso Two additional zzso of zzso with identical zzso and zzso zzso but having switched to zzso also lost crystal formation, further showing this feature of zzso to result from a unique zzso zzso of the complete zzso relying on V and C domain primary structures of both zzso
