Strong zzso zzso of a synthetic zzso probe of 17 zzso originally used to clone zzso I of the zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso to a single band was observed on Southern blots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Mac zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso Six pooled gene banks prepared from zzso zzso zzso contained regions that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso which is specifically directed toward the putative zzso site zzso of zzso zzso Two of these gene banks were transformed into zzso coli and screened for colonies zzso to probe zzso Several clones were recovered, and one type of zzso was identified from each gene zzso The two zzso plasmids were called zzso and zzso A restriction map of the plasmids showed that the overlapping region contained an 80 zzso zzso zzso binding to probe zzso The two clones together permitted sequencing of the entire gene for zzso c zzso zzso I from zzso zzso zzso Further systematic sequencing of approximately 1000 zzso upstream and downstream each of the zzso zzso I) gene revealed the presence of two genes zzso zzso II zzso zzso and III zzso zzso due to conspicuous similarities to zzso genes from other zzso c zzso zzso Yet, no indications of genes zzso additional zzso of the zzso were found within the region zzso
