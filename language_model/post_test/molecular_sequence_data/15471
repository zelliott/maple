A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a water sample collected from a spring located inside Nature Valley, zzso County, Taiwan, and was characterized using a zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strain formed a zzso branch at the periphery of the evolutionary radiation occupied by the zzso zzso in the class zzso The closest zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso zzso commune zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso fatty acids were 18 : zzso zzso zzso 16 : 0 zzso zzso and summed feature 3 (16 : zzso and/or zzso : 0 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the strain with respect to recognized species of the zzso zzso was less than 70 zzso The isolate was also distinguishable from members of the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso It is evident from the zzso zzso and zzso data, therefore, that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
