We have obtained the 470 zzso zzso zzso zzso of wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as those of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all as the zzso zzso prepared via zzso zzso The maximum observed chemical shift range induced by folding is zzso zzso Using a zzso shielding zzso reaction field approach, we have zzso the zzso field contributions to the zzso zzso For zzso which do not have F atoms in contact with neighboring groups, we find an approximately 1 zzso mean square zzso in shift from experiment, with the zzso structure of zzso being in very close zzso with zzso
