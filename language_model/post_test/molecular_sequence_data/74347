The presence and function of several proteins zzso into floral zzso has been described in recent zzso Here we report the presence of at least eight distinct proteins zzso into the floral zzso of the tropical tree zzso zzso zzso Steps were initiated to identify and characterize these proteins in order to determine potential zzso The zzso sequence of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso at 43 zzso contained similarity with members of the plant zzso zzso gene zzso Based upon this zzso a full-length zzso was isolated and predicted to zzso a mature protein of 339 zzso acids with a molecular mass of 37 zzso Both raw zzso and zzso expressed zzso displayed zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso flowers produce an zzso white colored zzso containing zzso zzso particles approximately 5 zzso in diameter and zzso zzso analysis also identified the zzso of free fatty acids within the zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso lipids with the zzso release of free fatty zzso Potential functions of zzso in relation to zzso attraction and prevention of microbial growth within zzso are briefly zzso
