zzso zzso II of zzso zzso contains two distinct zzso zzso alpha and zzso which must be zzso by separate genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Glover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso alpha zzso has been isolated by screening a zzso zzso library with zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso This gene zzso zzso contains an zzso open reading frame of zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene product appears to be zzso related to other known protein zzso but exhibits highest similarity to the zzso gene product and its zzso in other zzso Gene replacement techniques have been used to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains lacking a functional zzso gene appear to be zzso wild type, presumably because of the presence of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso gene appears to be single copy in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso whose existence is known from zzso studies and protein sequencing, cannot be detected by zzso zzso
