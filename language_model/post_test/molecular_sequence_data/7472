During the initial stages of B zzso differentiation heavy chain variable zzso diversity zzso and joining zzso gene segments recombine to form a functional heavy chain variable region zzso zzso Evidence for genetic zzso of the human zzso gene segments has been obtained from mature rearranged zzso zzso We conducted an analysis of the published rearranged zzso gene sequences and found that the zzso zzso present in the two published zzso zzso region sequences were rare zzso zzso in the rearranged zzso As an attempt to explain this zzso a zzso zzso of DNA containing all the six heavy chain zzso region genes and the most 3' zzso gene segment, zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction from 39 individuals and analyzed for restriction zzso length zzso Five new zzso region zzso were found and zzso These new zzso contained the coding segment zzso that were frequent in zzso zzso Surprisingly, a high number of zzso zzso in the zzso sequence was found between the new and the two previously published zzso zzso that the zzso had been separated early in zzso In this respect the zzso locus resembles zzso zzso
