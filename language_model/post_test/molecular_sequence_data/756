zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso contain a zzso motif called a zzso zzso Upon binding of the zzso box to zzso on zzso zzso is recruited and the zzso is zzso zzso a zzso box cannot be sufficient for destruction, as most zzso box proteins are zzso Using zzso egg zzso we identify two sequence elements in zzso zzso that promote their zzso a specialized zzso box that zzso exceptionally efficient zzso binding and a basic zzso acid 4 zzso downstream of the zzso box, which recruits zzso to the zzso zzso We also identify two mechanisms that couple zzso zzso to the zzso form of zzso ensuring that this zzso zzso is active only in S phase or after DNA zzso Thus, zzso recognizes an unusual zzso which is assembled specifically on zzso via the binding of a specialized zzso box to zzso
