zzso body size zzso in animals zzso to zzso rule occur on many zzso but zzso their underlying genetic basis remains a zzso In zzso zzso the gene zzso accounts for approximately zzso of the natural wing size variation zzso zzso zzso zzso Song zzso zzso zzso Carroll X, Johnson zzso zzso zzso Lee zzso zzso zzso Hoffmann zzso zzso A zzso varying promoter zzso associated with zzso variation in wing size in zzso zzso zzso zzso We present here functional evidence that zzso is a negative regulator of wing zzso A significant negative zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was detected in synchronized third zzso zzso In addition, we clarified the evolutionary history of the three most common zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso and showed that the zzso zzso zzso whose frequency increases with latitude, is associated with larger wing zzso size and higher average cell number in male zzso Finally, we showed that the overall linkage zzso zzso was low in the zzso promoter and that the zzso zzso that defines the zzso zzso was in strong zzso with two other upstream zzso Our results provide strong support that zzso is a candidate for zzso adaptation in zzso zzso
