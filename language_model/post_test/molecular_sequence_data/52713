The development of zzso zzso technologies that can support stable zzso integration and persistent gene expression in zzso is zzso Here we describe the successful use of zzso technology for the zzso zzso of foreign genes into the zzso of adult zzso using naked zzso We show that the Sleeping Beauty zzso can efficiently insert zzso DNA into the mouse zzso in approximately zzso of zzso mouse liver zzso zzso zzso resulted in long-term expression zzso zzso of human blood zzso factor IX at levels that were therapeutic in a mouse model of zzso zzso Our results establish zzso zzso as a new genetic tool for zzso and provide new strategies to improve existing zzso and viral zzso for human gene therapy zzso
