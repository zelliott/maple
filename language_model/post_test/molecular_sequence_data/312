zzso zzso zzso zzso described here combines several zzso zzso are separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and transferred to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins are then partially zzso and zzso with a specific zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The detected proteins are then processed by zzso zzso and identified by zzso zzso A zzso factor, bound by a specific zzso element, is thus characterized without aligning with protein spots on a zzso In this study, we systematically zzso conditions for zzso and zzso zzso By zzso the SW signal using a zzso counter, the optimal conditions for SW were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso for membrane zzso serial dilution of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso proteins on the zzso and an zzso stripping buffer to remove radiation from the zzso By the zzso of the zzso yields using zzso analysis, the zzso conditions for zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso 3-16 and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso With the use of the zzso zzso technique and zzso zzso combined with zzso a zzso model protein was successfully characterized from a bacterial zzso and native zzso beta was identified from 100 zzso of zzso nuclear extract without any previous zzso
