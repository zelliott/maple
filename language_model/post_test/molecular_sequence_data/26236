For chemical affinity labeling of the zzso zzso several zzso fragments containing zzso mustard were zzso in zzso Tested in the zzso skin zzso the derivatives roughly preserved the biological activity of the corresponding natural zzso zzso peptides with prolonged biological activity containing zzso mustard in place of zzso zzso or zzso are zzso of alpha zzso suggesting an irreversible binding to zzso zzso on the part of the zzso zzso where the zzso sequence is zzso
