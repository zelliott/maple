The zzso zzso acid beta zzso protein (A zzso that deposits as zzso in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso is zzso as an internal sequence within a larger zzso protein known as the zzso protein precursor zzso In cultured cells, the zzso is normally zzso within the A beta to generate a large zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso Neither of these derivatives can produce zzso because neither contains the entire A zzso Our study was designed to determine whether the soluble zzso derivatives in human brain end within the A beta as described in cell culture or whether zzso brain produces potentially zzso soluble derivatives that contain the entire A zzso We find that both zzso and control brain contain zzso soluble derivatives that end at position 15 of the A zzso We have been unable to detect any soluble derivatives that contain the entire A beta in either the zzso or control zzso
