The major protein present in the isolated outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified, zzso and zzso zzso electron zzso using zzso serum, and cell zzso experiments confirmed the zzso of zzso to the outer zzso zzso was determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso to have a molecular mass of 42 zzso when heat zzso whereas native zzso formed a number of zzso forms with molecular masses of 71, 76, and 83 zzso A temperature of 60 degrees C was required to convert the native protein to the zzso zzso A number of zzso and chemical agents that are capable of breaking zzso and hydrogen bonds of proteins did not convert native zzso to the zzso zzso The native forms of the protein were resistant to the combined action of zzso K, zzso and zzso whereas the zzso form of zzso was zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined to be zzso and database searches did not identify any zzso with known protein zzso zzso acid compositional analysis showed the protein to be rich in zzso and zzso with these zzso acids accounting for 28 and zzso respectively, of the total zzso zzso zzso raised against the major outer membrane protein of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not zzso with zzso and zzso raised against zzso did not react with any cellular components of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A major outer membrane protein similar in molecular mass to zzso was identified in eight clinical zzso of zzso zzso The major outer membrane protein produced by four of the clinical zzso reacted zzso by Western zzso with zzso serum, whereas proteins of the other strains did zzso
