zzso injury that occurs as a result of zzso and subsequent zzso is characterized by zzso cell injury, zzso formation, and the influx of inflammatory zzso Two zzso zzso zzso which may play a critical role in cellular injury and zzso zzso that occurs in the setting of zzso injury are tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso alpha zzso zzso To determine if zzso of ambient oxygen tensions in zzso alters the expression of zzso zzso from activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured in various combinations of ambient oxygen zzso then the zzso fluid and cell zzso zzso for the presence of zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrated that conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso independently resulted in the increased expression of both zzso and zzso alpha zzso and protein from zzso zzso zzso as compared with cells cultured in room zzso The specific culture condition of zzso zzso 6 zzso followed by zzso zzso 18 zzso produced the greatest increases in both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that when following a period of zzso zzso oxygen stress results in exaggerated zzso zzso A period of at least zzso to 6 h of zzso prior to zzso exposure was found to be the minimal time required for zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso increases in zzso and zzso alpha zzso by zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso in ambient oxygen tension can regulate the expression of zzso and zzso alpha from activated zzso and that zzso zzso production may represent an important mechanism by which inflammation occurs in the clinical settings of zzso injury and zzso
