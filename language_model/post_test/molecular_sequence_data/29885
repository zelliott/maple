zzso I is a type I zzso zzso characteristic of the rough portions of the zzso zzso where it is thought to play a role in the zzso zzso of nascent zzso A rat zzso I zzso was used to isolate four overlapping zzso clones from a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and DNA sequencing showed that these zzso spanning approximately 21 zzso of zzso DNA, include the entire zzso I zzso as well as 15 zzso zzso of upstream zzso Southern zzso analysis of DNA from a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids demonstrated that the zzso I gene is located on mouse zzso zzso The zzso I gene contains 10 zzso seven of which zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso 8 encodes the zzso domain and small portions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 9 and 10 zzso the remainder of the zzso domain, and the latter includes the zzso portion of the zzso Six closely spaced zzso start sites located 3 to 24 base pairs upstream from the initiation zzso were identified by primer extension analysis and zzso zzso The sequence of a zzso region upstream of the cap sites was determined and found to contain three zzso potential zzso sites beginning at zzso zzso and zzso base pairs zzso two zzso sequences at zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso box at zzso zzso The possible roles of these elements in regulating expression of the zzso gene in all cells and in differentiated cell types characterized by a well developed rough zzso zzso is zzso
