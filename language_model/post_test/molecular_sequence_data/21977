We previously identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso Am J zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso 2001) a zzso zzso segment of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter, located at zzso to zzso as necessary for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Using deletion and zzso analysis and expression of zzso reporter zzso we report in the present study that zzso of the zzso site located within this segment of the promoter leads to a marked ( approximately zzso decrease in zzso promoter zzso Double zzso located in the zzso site and in a second downstream zzso region zzso to zzso did not cause a further decrease in promoter zzso zzso shift and zzso zzso verified the importance of the zzso zzso Exposure of cells to zzso A resulted in increased expression of the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the presence of the zzso site was found to be essential for the positive response of the promoter to zzso We conclude that the consensus zzso site located in the rat zzso zzso promoter is necessary and sufficient for zzso expression of the zzso zzso as well as for its response to zzso
