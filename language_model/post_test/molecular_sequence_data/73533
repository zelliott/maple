zzso zzso zzso is produced during normal cellular zzso and incorporation into DNA causes zzso zzso zzso possess an zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso thereby preventing the occurrence of zzso There are highly zzso zzso acid sequences in zzso and zzso proteins containing this and related zzso zzso To zzso the significance of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were introduced by zzso directed zzso of the cloned zzso for human zzso and the activity and stability of zzso forms of the zzso were zzso When zzso was replaced by other zzso zzso all of the zzso isolated carried the zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from one of the negative zzso carried the zzso for zzso Using the same zzso the analysis was extended to other zzso within the zzso zzso At the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites, all the positive zzso isolated carried zzso for zzso acids identical to those of the wild type zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso region are essential to exert zzso zzso
