The structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso has been zzso zzso analysis, together with zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso experiments were employed to zzso the zzso zzso correlations were determined by zzso and zzso zzso correlation zzso The zzso is composed of zzso repeating units with the following zzso zzso see zzso zzso of low intensity from an zzso zzso zzso were present in the zzso zzso and spectral analysis indicates that they originate from the penultimate zzso in the zzso zzso the biological repeating unit has a zzso zzso zzso at its reducing zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemical shifts of the zzso and zzso forms of zzso are also zzso The repeating unit of the zzso coli zzso zzso is identical to that of the zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso
