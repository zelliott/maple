The solution structures of zzso a zzso restricted zzso with the sequence zzso and its four zzso zzso were examined by a combined approach including the zzso zzso in zzso and water as well as independent energy zzso It was concluded that several low energy zzso of zzso backbone satisfy the zzso data obtained in this study as well as in previous studies by other zzso These possible solution zzso of zzso in both zzso and water share virtually the same type of zzso backbone structure, with the zzso zzso in a zzso close to a zzso and the zzso zzso in a zzso close to zzso zzso zzso They differ in the space arrangements of the flexible zzso zzso The solution structures of the zzso zzso of zzso are zzso For zzso with an zzso at the C alpha atom in the zzso zzso the zzso backbone zzso resemble those of zzso itself, whereas for zzso with an zzso at the C alpha zzso the backbone zzso is somewhat zzso This observation is in line with the high biological zzso and zzso displayed by the former compounds but not by the latter zzso It was noted also that as far as the zzso backbone zzso are concerned, some of the possible zzso zzso in water are similar to the previously suggested model for the zzso zzso of zzso becoming virtually identical to this zzso by rotating the side chains of the zzso and the zzso zzso
