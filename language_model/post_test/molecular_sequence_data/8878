The zzso virus zzso nuclear zzso 2 zzso plays a key role in the zzso growth transformation by initiating and maintaining the proliferation of infected zzso upon zzso infection in zzso Most studies about zzso have focused on its functions yet little is known for its zzso zzso 

zzso region for zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso gene was zzso in 25 zzso gastric zzso zzso 56 zzso zzso zzso and 32 throat zzso zzso from healthy donors in Northern zzso Three variations zzso zzso zzso were detected in all of the samples zzso zzso zzso could be classified into four distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on the deletion status of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso samples, zzso zzso was observed more in zzso samples and zzso zzso was only detected in the zzso zzso Variation analysis in zzso functional zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were only detected in zzso samples which located in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso were the dominant zzso of the zzso gene in Northern zzso The zzso zzso may be associated with the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso were prone harbor to more zzso than the other two groups in the functional zzso
