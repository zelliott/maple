We selected Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso strains of human zzso 71 zzso belonging to zzso B5 zzso and C2 zzso by serial passage in zzso cells at a high zzso of zzso During the course of zzso cell passage, virus growth improved significantly, with increasing virus zzso and the presence of zzso effect zzso A study of virus growth zzso revealed that the zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso grew efficiently in zzso cells with maximum zzso zzso higher than zzso parental zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso single zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has an zzso acid substitution of zzso in zzso and zzso has an zzso acid substitution of zzso in zzso An isolate of zzso C4 zzso failed to adapt to zzso cells during serial zzso zzso zzso zzso populations of zzso containing the zzso zzso or zzso in zzso were generated by zzso zzso Both zzso resulted in the ability of the virus to replicate efficiently in zzso cells, indicating that zzso acid position 149 in zzso is critical for the adaptation of zzso to growth in zzso zzso
