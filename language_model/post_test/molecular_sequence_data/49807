zzso factors operate in the context of zzso signaling to induce gene expression in discrete compartments along the zzso axis of the developing zzso nervous zzso In zzso zzso repression of zzso genes is achieved through the function of zzso zzso a zzso zzso In this study, we show that a second zzso zzso zzso limits zzso caused by loss of zzso function and although this zzso family member can rescue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can antagonize repression zzso by zzso and this zzso is dependent on a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso changes in gene expression caused by reduced zzso function help predict the shape of a zzso activity zzso that defines compartments along the zzso zzso In addition, zzso has a second and unique role in the zzso of zzso zzso indicating that it controls multiple aspects of brain zzso
