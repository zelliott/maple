zzso are members of a large zzso of transport proteins (the zzso zzso that zzso zzso to zzso a wide range of zzso across biological zzso Using a zzso approach, and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso two zzso zzso fragments zzso and zzso with a significant sequence similarity to zzso zzso were amplified from barley zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso and used as zzso to screen a barley root zzso zzso A single full-length clone zzso coding for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of this barley sequence with zzso zzso and human zzso and zzso zzso sequences showed that the barley zzso has zzso 37% and 38% zzso acid zzso identity, respectively, with these zzso and zzso structural zzso zzso protection analysis showed that zzso zzso is expressed at low levels in both barley roots and zzso Southern zzso analyses indicated that there is a small zzso family related to zzso in zzso zzso functions for these barley zzso are zzso
