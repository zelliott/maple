zzso is a regulatory locus that activates the production of several zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso library, screened with a probe adjacent to the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso This zzso was shown to carry the zzso locus by restoration of zzso production in zzso zzso The zzso locus was mapped to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis of the cloned zzso revealed the presence of two zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso a response regulator and a zzso protein zzso respectively, with high zzso to other bacterial zzso regulatory zzso
