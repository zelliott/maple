zzso and zzso in human zzso imprinted domain are two key candidate genes responsible for zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to increase understanding of these genes in zzso their zzso are characterized in this zzso By the zzso panel, zzso zzso and zzso genes were assigned to zzso zzso 2, closely linked with zzso and with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso By real-time quantitative zzso and zzso method, tissue and zzso expression of both genes were determined using F1 pigs of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso than in other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although both genes showed the highest expression levels in the lung and kidney of one-month pigs zzso zzso zzso Imprinting analysis demonstrated that in zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso heart, zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, skeletal muscle, stomach, small zzso and zzso and zzso expressed in lung and zzso while zzso was zzso expressed in the 12 zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso of zzso is conservative in zzso but has tissue specificity in zzso and zzso of zzso is controversial in zzso zzso
