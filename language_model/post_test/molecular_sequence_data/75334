zzso zzso directed against a synthetic zzso of the zzso zzso site of the zzso protein zzso of rat liver were used to screen a zzso zzso zzso expression library of human zzso An zzso specific clone was zzso It consists of the complete coding sequence of zzso base pairs and the 3' zzso region of 40 base zzso The sequence of zzso zzso acids was deduced from the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso regions are almost identical to the reported partial zzso sequences of rat liver zzso The zzso protein zzso is zzso to the human zzso with the exception of 3 zzso acid insertions and a zzso extension of 10 zzso acids within the human zzso The only two zzso sites at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso to the two zzso sites in human zzso Since there are additional zzso sites in zzso zzso one can assume that they are located in the cluster of 5 zzso within the zzso zzso The sequence comparison of these two zzso proteins from zzso distant zzso such as man and zzso indicates that the structure and probably the function of the zzso zzso of the small zzso zzso has been highly zzso The expression of the zzso gene has been investigated in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso During all stages of zzso development the level of zzso zzso appeared to be zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA suggests that multiple genes exist for the zzso zzso
