The synthesis of a functional nitrous oxide zzso requires an assembly apparatus for the zzso of the prosthetic zzso Part of the system is zzso by maturation genes located in zzso zzso immediately downstream of the structural gene for the zzso We have studied the zzso organization and regulation of this region and found a zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to a putative ABC zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso and a component of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated in response to zzso and nitrate zzso The zzso regulator zzso was required for zzso zzso in addition, zzso a regulator of the zzso family, enhanced expression under zzso zzso This establishes a likely signal zzso sequence of NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also observed for the zzso zzso zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso protein zzso and a member of the zzso zzso family zzso The zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso exhibits sequence similarity to zzso zzso It was fused to the zzso coli zzso protein and zzso in soluble zzso The fusion protein was zzso and shown to have zzso zzso zzso is the first maturation factor for which a zzso function has been demonstrated in zzso
