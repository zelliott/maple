The zzso protein zzso mediates the association of the molecular zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso specifically recognizes the zzso zzso of zzso while the zzso domain binds the zzso zzso of zzso Both sequences end with the motif zzso The crystal structures of the zzso complexes show the peptides in an extended zzso spanning a groove in the zzso zzso zzso binding is zzso by zzso interactions with the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso acting as a zzso anchor, and by zzso interactions with zzso upstream of zzso The zzso contacts with the zzso are critical for zzso These results explain how zzso zzso participate in the ordered assembly of zzso zzso zzso
