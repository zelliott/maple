Mice with a disruption of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso R alpha zzso zzso were found to be significantly more sensitive than their zzso counterparts to induction of the zzso disease zzso Specifically, when given a selected dose of zzso zzso zzso R alpha zzso mice developed severe zzso and zzso leading to zzso mortality within 72 zzso In contrast, zzso mice failed to develop overt zzso manifestations and zzso zzso examination revealed zzso in zzso and zzso which were significantly more pronounced in the zzso than in the zzso mice, as confirmed by flow zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso affected mainly zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells in zzso all of which were exclusively observed in zzso R alpha zzso zzso Blood levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were slightly more elevated in zzso R alpha zzso mice, but insufficiently so to explain increased disease zzso Thus, even more elevated zzso levels in zzso mice receiving high doses of zzso zzso were not associated with morbidity or zzso Blood levels of zzso were barely zzso in zzso zzso mice, but were relatively high in the zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso R alpha zzso mice was associated with impaired zzso oxide zzso production, as indicated by significantly lower plasma zzso levels and by more transient expression of zzso zzso NO zzso zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso mice with the NO zzso inhibitor zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso morbidity and zzso The data indicate that zzso R alpha zzso mice produce less NO and are therefore more sensitive than zzso mice to the deleterious effect of zzso zzso
