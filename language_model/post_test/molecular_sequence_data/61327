zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso first binds to the plasma membrane of zzso cells and is subsequently zzso zzso zzso appears in small zzso near the cell surface and later in larger, zzso structures identified as the zzso zzso To determine if membrane zzso directs the movement of zzso to the zzso apparatus, an zzso zzso containing enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was used to follow trafficking of zzso and zzso in stable zzso The zzso was expressed strongly on the cell surface and also in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was functional in zzso binding of and responses to zzso zzso presented to the zzso as complexes with soluble zzso first zzso with zzso on the cell zzso However, within zzso zzso the zzso distributed to zzso zzso that did not contain zzso indicating that zzso did not accompany zzso during zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is transferred out of zzso at the plasma membrane and zzso within the cell independently of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso were zzso in association with zzso suggesting that zzso clearance occurs via a zzso distinct from that which leads to signaling via zzso zzso
