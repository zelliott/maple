zzso approaches that target the total DNA pool recovered from permanently zzso marine zzso have revealed an extraordinary diversity of zzso and zzso zzso However, the presence of gene sequences contained within the zzso DNA pool is still largely zzso We have investigated the preservation, origin and genetic imprint of zzso DNA recovered from permanently zzso zzso sediments of the Black zzso Despite high zzso activities, huge amounts of total zzso DNA were found in both the surface and subsurface zzso zzso suggesting reduced availability of the zzso DNA pool to zzso zzso The reduced degradation of the total zzso DNA was confirmed by its low zzso rate and the high zzso in the deeper zzso zzso The copy numbers of zzso and zzso zzso contained within the zzso DNA pool in both the surface and subsurface zzso layers was very high, indicating that permanently zzso sediments of the deep Black Sea are hot spots of preserved zzso gene zzso The zzso DNA recovered from these zzso layers also contained highly diversified zzso zzso zzso These were not only representative of the major zzso zzso but also of new very divergent zzso branching as independent zzso at the base of the zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso DNA pool is a major archive of zzso zzso gene zzso and they highlight the importance of zzso molecular zzso approaches with molecular analyses of the zzso DNA pool, for a better assessment of microbial diversity and zzso changes in marine zzso zzso
