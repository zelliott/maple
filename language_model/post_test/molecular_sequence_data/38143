We previously cloned zzso which is responsible for the cellular zzso of organic zzso as an zzso zzso in the liver under zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the mechanism for the expression of human zzso The cap site hunting method revealed that the zzso starts at zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the initiation zzso zzso zzso with a series of truncated zzso regions indicated that the region from zzso to zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso Moreover, carrying out a gel shift zzso indicated that zzso binds to the sequence between zzso and zzso zzso zzso it was demonstrated that human zzso is under the control of zzso promoter and zzso binding sites may be involved in the zzso
