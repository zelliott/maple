The zzso zzso zzso system is an important defense mechanism in zzso and zzso of zzso to active zzso zzso involves a zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso and characterization of a small zzso protein zzso from the tobacco zzso zzso zzso which can stimulate zzso zzso zzso search showed that zzso zzso is similar to a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other small zzso proteins with unknown zzso However, we showed that zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso activity, but zzso zzso zzso in zzso When small amount zzso zzso of zzso native zzso or zzso was added to zzso plasma samples and incubated for 20 zzso low PO activity was observed in both zzso But significantly higher PO activity was observed in the zzso than in the zzso when more proteins zzso zzso were added and incubated for 20 zzso However, when the plasma samples were incubated with proteins for 30 zzso high PO activity was observed in both the zzso and zzso groups regardless of the amount of proteins zzso Moreover, when PO in the plasma was zzso with zzso zzso addition of zzso did not have an effect on PO activity, and zzso mixture did not stimulate PO activity to a higher level than did zzso These results suggest that zzso helps activate zzso more rapidly at the initial zzso zzso zzso was specifically expressed in fat body and its zzso level decreased when larvae were injected with saline or zzso However, zzso protein concentration in zzso did not change significantly in larvae injected with saline or zzso
