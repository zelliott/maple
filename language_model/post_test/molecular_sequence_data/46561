We constructed zzso zzso viruses zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso envelope protein from a human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso isolate using an zzso influenza virus zzso zzso gene zzso zzso tests with zzso against both zzso influenza virus and zzso localized zzso zzso molecules zzso influenza virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso but the zzso could not be seen on the outer surfaces of infected cells though weak zzso was detected regarding zzso zzso zzso with these findings, Western zzso confirmed the expression of a zzso of about zzso protein representing zzso zzso zzso in the infected zzso These zzso markedly primed zzso zzso T zzso zzso specific for zzso as well as zzso protein of the influenza virus, but failed to elicit zzso zzso despite stimulating production of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso could strongly lyse target cells expressing the whole zzso envelope gene of zzso zzso Thus, the influenza virus zzso zzso cassette zzso system used in the present study appeared to be a useful tool for constructing vaccine candidates which will predominantly prime zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso of various infectious zzso
