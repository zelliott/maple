The zzso gene of zzso zzso is required for initiation of zzso zzso of zzso is detected under conditions which are known to induce initiation of zzso namely zzso for nitrogen and zzso and the presence of zzso and zzso alpha 2 gene zzso In this paper we show that zzso is also subject to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is achieved either upon nitrogen zzso or upon zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso elevated zzso of zzso is also sufficient for the translation of zzso zzso Four different conditions were found to cause expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso elevated zzso levels due to the presence of zzso on a zzso zzso elevated zzso provided by a zzso zzso zzso arrest due to zzso zzso zzso arrest following mild zzso treatment of zzso zzso Using these conditions, we obtained evidence that zzso is required not only for zzso and efficient translation of zzso but also for either the zzso of zzso protein or for the zzso of another factor that, either alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso
