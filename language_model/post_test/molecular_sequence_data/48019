zzso zzso of rotary zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso II reveal a zzso zzso zzso with a central particle surrounded by 8-10 smaller peripheral zzso zzso particles are attached to the central particle by thin arms or zzso Movement of peripheral particles to contact each other for zzso is likely to involve these zzso It has generally been accepted that the segment zzso of the zzso constitutes the zzso zzso In the present study we test this assumption by generating a zzso lacking the proposed zzso The zzso has zzso and zzso properties similar to those of the wild type, and a thin zzso is occasionally observed in zzso from either zzso The results indicate that the deleted sequence does not zzso to the zzso zzso This conclusion, combined with observations from two recent studies which identify the zzso domain involved in zzso zzso down the location of the zzso domain within the sequence zzso
