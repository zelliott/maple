To investigate zzso interactions in zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso to identify proteins that could interact with the zzso zzso These zzso identified a zzso zzso which we have named zzso that appears to bind with a high degree of specificity to the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso activates reporter gene expression only when expressed in tandem with a zzso bait zzso binding is not zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso contained a zzso zzso region that includes a zzso zzso Because many zzso domain proteins appear to function as zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso and protein degradation may play a role in regulating zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso may be a candidate for the recently proposed general inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso
