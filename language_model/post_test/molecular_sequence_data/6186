The capacity of a zzso form of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to be taken up by cultured zzso was zzso Like its zzso made of zzso zzso it was rapidly zzso and distributed throughout the zzso and even the cell zzso The amount of zzso zzso in cells after incubation in culture medium was zzso times that of the zzso zzso With a zzso zzso attached to the zzso to increase its zzso the zzso zzso was zzso 8 times better than the zzso The greater efficiency of the zzso is probably due to the resistance to zzso degradation zzso by the zzso zzso as the sequence contains two sites sensitive to zzso zzso The zzso might be the basis for development of system for delivering a variety of molecules into zzso
