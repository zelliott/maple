The structure of the zzso zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso at about 4 A zzso Here we describe the structure and location of proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso Different structural proteins seem to have specialist roles in controlling virus zzso The zzso extended zzso appears to zzso the formation of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso and acts as a molecular zzso defining the size of the virus and cementing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso form the zzso base, interlocking with zzso of zzso and interacting with the membrane protein zzso The architectural similarities with zzso and one of the largest known virus particles zzso support the notion that the mechanism of assembly of zzso is zzso and applies across the major viral lineage formed by these zzso
