zzso zzso zzso is a late zzso acquisition among zzso that is found only in zzso zzso is a minor component of zzso zzso representing approximately zzso of the zzso Regulatory elements in the zzso gene were identified by zzso the zzso zzso cell line with zzso zzso zzso Only a few hundred base pairs upstream of the coding sequence were necessary for high-level activity of the mouse zzso zzso More zzso recognition sites may exist, because zzso activity, indicative of negative regulatory zzso was detected upstream of base pair zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso basic zzso genes was greater in zzso cells than in zzso zzso or zzso glioblastoma, demonstrating their superiority for functional analysis of zzso gene regulatory zzso
