zzso containing either zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso at various locations were oxidized by the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso The yields of zzso degradation and zzso formation were measured as a function of zzso sequence and zzso In general little change of the final yields of zzso degradation is observed whereas the final yields of zzso formation progressively decrease on going from pH zzso to zzso The pH profiles vary with the structure of the respective zzso zzso zzso formation occurred when zzso and zzso were present within the same peptides zzso and particularly when zzso was located at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and methanol did neither promote nor inhibit both the degradation of zzso and the formation of zzso excluding free zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso as responsible zzso oxygen zzso The observations are rationalized by zzso a zzso conversion of an efficiently zzso yielding zzso into another zzso which still degrades peptides but does not form zzso zzso The first might be a zzso zzso or zzso species which converts into a zzso or zzso zzso zzso
