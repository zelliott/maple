zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso labeled with zzso zzso during affinity zzso zzso After zzso affinity labeled zzso was zzso with zzso under limit conditions and the labeled peptides were zzso by zzso high performance liquid zzso into one major and two minor zzso zzso analysis of the dominant labeled zzso indicated the facile zzso of label during zzso degradation but identified two zzso both derived from the extreme zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The 17 zzso of one zzso were fully zzso in all zzso zzso This zzso contained five zzso zzso acids and was considered as the more favored interaction site for tamoxifen zzso A corresponding region of the zzso zzso has recently been identified as one of three major contact sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison of zzso acid physical characteristics in the zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso receptors demonstrated an excellent structural correlation between the two regions and delineated elements in the zzso zzso which may be directly involved in zzso zzso
