zzso zzso zzso zzso release, zzso zzso class II zzso and zzso the zzso repertoire presented by class zzso zzso zzso function may have profound effects on zzso presentation events in the zzso and periphery that are critical for maintenance of zzso The associations of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso disease and type 1 diabetes zzso have been appreciated for a long zzso The explanation for these associations, however, remains zzso We previously found that zzso is a poor zzso for zzso In this study, to further characterize zzso interaction, we introduced point zzso into zzso on the proposed zzso interface to restore the sensitivity of zzso to zzso The effects of zzso were investigated by measuring the zzso zzso and exchange rate in zzso zzso and zzso expression on the cell surface, and the presentation of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso T cell zzso We found that the three zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso decreased the intrinsic stability of zzso II zzso More interestingly, the zzso zzso restored zzso sensitivity to zzso likely due to improved interaction with zzso Our data also suggest that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso resistance to zzso changes the fate of this zzso from a cryptic to an zzso zzso Our findings zzso the structural basis for reduced zzso interaction and have implications for mechanisms underlying disease associations of zzso
