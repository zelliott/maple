zzso acquired genes typically function as autonomous units zzso new abilities when introduced into different zzso However, we reasoned that proteins zzso in an zzso might zzso the functionality of a zzso acquired gene product if it operates on an ancestral zzso Here, we determine how the zzso acquired zzso gene product activates the ancestral zzso zzso system in zzso zzso but not in the closely related zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein binds to the zzso zzso protein zzso protecting it from zzso by the zzso zzso This results in zzso of zzso zzso including those zzso zzso B zzso We now report that the zzso coli zzso protein can activate the zzso system in zzso even though it cannot do it in zzso coli, suggesting that these two species differ in an additional component controlling zzso zzso We establish that the zzso coli zzso displays higher zzso activity towards zzso than the zzso zzso and we identified a zzso zzso responsible for this zzso Replacement of the zzso coli zzso gene with the zzso zzso was sufficient to render zzso coli resistant to zzso B under zzso zzso Our findings provide a singular example zzso quantitative differences in the zzso activities of zzso ancestral proteins dictate the ability of a zzso acquired gene product to zzso zzso zzso And they suggest that zzso acquired genes can zzso selection at ancestral zzso
