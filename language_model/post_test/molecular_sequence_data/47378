The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed step in zzso zzso in the enteric zzso zzso is mainly regulated by conditional protein zzso it is stable and, consequently, more abundant in zzso cells but unstable and less abundant in normally growing zzso Both the Lon and zzso zzso zzso contribute to zzso turnover in zzso Here we report that the addition of two positively charged zzso zzso to the third and fourth positions at the zzso N zzso resulted in complete stabilization of the zzso By contrast, the addition of an zzso zzso zzso tag did not affect zzso This result confirms the importance of the zzso sequence for zzso of zzso This region of the protein also contains a zzso flanked by zzso zzso a motif that has been suggested to be important for zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso of this motif did not affect the turnover of zzso zzso zzso expressing the stabilized zzso zzso protein display substantial defects in zzso zzso
