zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso were studied both in zzso and by computer zzso The local zzso for the formation of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso were defined by using different pairs of synthetic zzso duplexes, each of which contained a single potentially zzso zzso zzso mustard was found to zzso zzso to zzso at a zzso The structural basis for the formation of this zzso zzso was studied by molecular dynamics and quantum zzso zzso dynamics indicated that the geometrical proximity of the binding sites also favored a zzso zzso linkage over a zzso zzso linkage in a zzso zzso While the zzso of zzso and zzso mustard zzso DNA were found to be very close, a zzso structure was more flexible and may therefore be in a considerably higher zzso zzso
