The zzso zzso preference of zzso zzso as expressed by the zzso ratio, differs by up to zzso zzso of the major zzso of this preference are made by zzso primary and zzso structures to zzso zzso In zzso Y from zzso it is predicted that zzso constitutes such a zzso reducing the zzso zzso zzso preference of this zzso The predictions are tested by the construction and kinetic characterization of ten zzso zzso of zzso zzso All of these zzso exhibit changes in their zzso zzso zzso Generally, small decreases in activity zzso are observed with zzso containing zzso zzso side zzso With zzso containing zzso zzso side zzso zzso zzso the activity generally increases slightly, zzso in the case of zzso The most dramatic effects of the zzso zzso are observed with zzso containing basic zzso side zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso with zzso has increased zzso exclusively as a result of increased zzso zzso Similar results have previously been obtained by zzso substitution at position 178 of zzso zzso The construction and kinetic characterization of position 178 + 312 double zzso demonstrate that the kinetic effects of zzso at these two positions are not zzso The zzso zzso zzso preference of one double zzso zzso + zzso has changed zzso as compared to the wild type zzso and the overall zzso zzso preference of this zzso closely resembles that of zzso zzso from zzso
