A zzso strain was selected from the microbial zzso of the zzso Institute of Science and Technology, zzso India, which could produce a high yield of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial 28 S zzso sequencing and zzso characteristics indicate that it belong to the species zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso production of zzso zzso zzso 10-3 zzso dry cell zzso was obtained in a medium containing 10 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso ammonium zzso with 20 zzso of zzso as the zzso The optimum temperature for zzso production was 30 degrees C at pH zzso with a shaking speed of 200 zzso At 96 zzso the zzso activity was zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso accepts a broad zzso range, and the maximum zzso activity zzso zzso 10-3 zzso dry cell zzso was obtained with 50 zzso of zzso In the literature, no reports have been found regarding the production of zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso pure zzso acid formation, which has tremendous demand in industrial zzso
