zzso proteins are implicated in positive and negative regulation of zzso complex zzso To better understand the function of zzso proteins we have identified the nature of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso changes a zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso changes a highly zzso zzso to zzso Based on zzso and the crystal structure of the zzso zzso the corresponding zzso acids zzso to the zzso domain of zzso Compared to the zzso zzso the zzso proteins are less abundant even at the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso zzso may cause structural zzso that affect folding and make the zzso proteins more susceptible to zzso The remaining part is sufficient for growth and protein zzso at 24 degrees C and thus is likely to be properly zzso At 37 degrees C the zzso proteins become zzso In zzso experiments the newly zzso zzso and zzso proteins decayed similarly with the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of the zzso proteins cannot be explained by zzso degradation zzso It is possible that the newly zzso zzso proteins fold slowly and are susceptible to degradation before they have managed to fold and associate with other zzso The zzso proteins were unable to interact with the zzso proteins zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso even at the zzso zzso These results zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a domain of zzso and suggest a mechanism by which zzso and zzso cells become zzso
