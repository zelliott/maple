The orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso sex zzso critical region on the X zzso gene 1), zzso by the zzso zzso plays important roles in the development of the zzso zzso axis as well as in sex zzso zzso in zzso cause the zzso zzso form of adrenal zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in sex reversal in mice and zzso of the zzso zzso locus in human patients results in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of these investigations was to determine if alternatively spliced forms of zzso zzso Analysis of expressed sequence tag data predicted a truncated zzso of zzso We confirmed the presence of an alternatively spliced form of zzso which we will refer to as zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and will refer to the deduced protein zzso as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed slight differences from the recently described zzso form, zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2A located within the zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 2A includes 35 zzso of coding zzso zzso encodes a deduced protein zzso zzso of 400 zzso acids compared with 470 zzso acids for zzso zzso detected expression of zzso in adrenal zzso zzso zzso and zzso The identification of zzso and the deduced zzso requires reinterpretation of many previous experiments involving expression and knockout of zzso and zzso
