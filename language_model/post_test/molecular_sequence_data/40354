This study focuses on the zzso of two natural enemy species, belonging to the zzso zzso in the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two species are of primary importance in biological control all over the zzso However, they are zzso very similar and specific zzso is zzso This study zzso zzso molecular markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso to differentiate these two zzso zzso analyses showed significant differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 17 zzso characters of the 32 zzso However, despite these significant differences, the ranges of all characters zzso Only the zzso of the zzso on the zzso zzso allows the differentiation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite these small zzso differences, molecular results, for both zzso DNA fragments considered zzso and zzso zzso showed a clear zzso between the specimens of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study emphasizes zzso that only one zzso character zzso of the zzso zzso clearly separates these two species, and zzso the usefulness of an zzso molecular and simple diagnostic tool for accurate differentiation of the two species and ensure the zzso zzso Further studies are proposed, including more DNA sequences especially for zzso zzso
