The zzso zzso is a zzso DNA zzso which was originally identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by in zzso screening for Holliday junction migration zzso Further zzso analyses of the zzso protein from zzso zzso showed that this protein preferably binds to zzso zzso zzso and zzso their zzso regions in zzso just like the zzso coli zzso zzso Furthermore, genetic analyses showed that zzso produced in zzso coli cells partially zzso the zzso of functions of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso coli zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a functional counterpart of zzso in zzso in which it is necessary for the maintenance of zzso integrity, although the zzso acid sequences are not zzso The functional interaction of zzso with zzso for its zzso activity further suggests that the zzso works at stalled replication zzso as a member of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso
