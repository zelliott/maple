We analyzed the viral zzso envelope diversity, zzso patterns, and zzso ratios of plasma zzso in an attempt to better understand the complex interaction between viral zzso and the zzso pressures zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the envelope gene of five patients revealed zzso zzso in patients with higher zzso T cell counts and sequence intermingling in those with lower zzso T cells in relation to the stage of zzso Our analyses also showed clear shifts in zzso zzso patterns in patients with higher zzso T cells, suggesting possible distinct zzso pressures zzso and zzso The relative preponderance of zzso changes in the envelope region suggested a positive selection in patients with higher zzso T cells, whereas lack of evidence for positive selection was found in the patients with lower zzso T zzso An exception to the last analysis occurred in the only patient who reached complete viral suppression, maybe due to drug pressure exerted over the pol gene that may obscure the immune zzso at the envelope in this zzso All these indications may suggest that even when zzso generates viral suppression, zzso evolve in the envelope gene probably resulting from zzso zzso
