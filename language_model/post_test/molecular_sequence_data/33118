During the past few years, our knowledge on zzso regulation in many organisms has tremendously zzso In bacteria, although zzso regulatory proteins remain key players in gene regulation, a wide variety of zzso regulatory mechanisms discovered highlights the importance of the zzso structure in the regulation of gene zzso zzso regulation largely contributes to rapidly adapt the bacterial metabolism in response to environmental changes, stress and in establishment of zzso zzso exploit the extraordinary ability of zzso to fold into different structures in response to various signals zzso cues, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can potentially regulate transcription, translation and zzso zzso The present review focuses on the structures of regulatory regions of zzso that have evolved to permit productive interactions with zzso regulators, such as protein or zzso zzso Finally, we describe how particular properties of these regulatory complexes regulate translation zzso
