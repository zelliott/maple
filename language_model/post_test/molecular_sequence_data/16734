A zzso region zzso downstream of the zzso start site of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso can enhance gene zzso By using transient expression zzso with plant zzso this activity was shown to be at least partially due to the effect of zzso enhancers within this zzso We identify sequence motifs with zzso function, which are normally masked by the powerful upstream enhancers of the zzso zzso A repeated zzso motif is involved both in zzso function and in interaction with plant nuclear zzso The zzso region can also enhance expression from zzso zzso
