The zzso molecular zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a typical representative of a zzso of specific zzso involved in assembly of surface zzso with a very simple zzso One characteristic feature of this zzso zzso is possession of an extended, variable sequence zzso zzso between the F1 and zzso binding zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso members, characterized by zzso have a short zzso loop and are involved in assembly of complex zzso To zzso the structural and functional significance of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the 27 zzso acid zzso between the F1 and zzso zzso had been deleted, was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli resulted in zzso of high levels of zzso The zzso circular zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins were indistinguishable and exhibited practically the same temperature and pH zzso Thus, the zzso sequence of zzso clearly does not contribute significantly to the stability of the protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso at zzso confirmed surface exposure of this part of the zzso sequence in the isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso outer membrane protein and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was not able to form a stable complex with zzso nor could it protect the zzso from zzso degradation in zzso This demonstration that the zzso sequence is required for stable zzso interaction, but not for folding of a stable zzso provides a sound basis for future detailed molecular analyses of the zzso zzso of zzso
