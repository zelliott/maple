zzso of the zzso and zzso genes are responsible for the inherited zzso and zzso zzso Syndrome, both of which are associated with a predisposition to zzso A related syndrome, the zzso disorder, is due to zzso of the zzso zzso However, the role of this gene in cancer development has not been zzso Here we describe an often zzso zzso of the zzso repeat within human zzso zzso 4 that leads to zzso zzso impairment of zzso zzso expression and generation of a truncated zzso This zzso is present in mismatch zzso but not zzso zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso and is associated with reduced expression of the zzso complex, an impaired zzso checkpoint and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso Our findings identify zzso as a novel and major target for zzso in mismatch zzso cells and suggest its impairment may contribute to the development of zzso zzso
