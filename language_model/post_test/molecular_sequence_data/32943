zzso binding proteins zzso belong to the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso zzso of zzso bonds in zzso and zzso zzso are involved in zzso assembly and trafficking of zzso However, only limited knowledge is available about the roles of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and their interaction with other zzso Here we show the zzso located zzso zzso zzso to be a zzso protein with zzso and a novel zzso zzso While the zzso of zzso is zzso by its zzso domain, the zzso domain is a functional zzso zzso The zzso activity is zzso by the zzso domain but is exhibited only by the full-length zzso We further demonstrate a direct interaction between zzso and zzso the major zzso zzso in the zzso The binding to zzso is zzso by the zzso domain of zzso Interestingly zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso Both proteins form a stable complex with an unfolded zzso protein and thereby prevent its zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso form a folding helper complex with a high zzso capacity in the zzso of zzso zzso
