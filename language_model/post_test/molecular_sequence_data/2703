zzso zzso components strongly influence the differentiated properties of isolated rat zzso smooth muscle cells during in zzso zzso The attachment and spreading of the cells on a zzso of zzso or a zzso zzso zzso of zzso are accompanied by a structural and functional zzso referred to as a transition or zzso from a zzso to a synthetic zzso Here, the ability of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso to promote this process was zzso The results demonstrate that freshly isolated smooth muscle cells attached to a zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso in a specific manner and as well as to zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso spreading of the cells on the zzso zzso followed the same zzso and was as extensive as on zzso even if protein synthesis was blocked by treatment of the cultures with zzso Like zzso the zzso zzso induced formation of zzso filament zzso again without ongoing protein zzso Moreover, it was as efficient as zzso in supporting the transition of the cells from a zzso to a synthetic zzso as analyzed by electron zzso zzso against the beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the attachment, zzso and fine structural reorganization of the cells in a similar manner on zzso of zzso the zzso fragment, and zzso Taken together, the findings indicate that the zzso sequence zzso mimics intact zzso in promoting a change in the differentiated properties of zzso smooth muscle cells and does so by interacting with a cell surface zzso for zzso
