The zzso zzso elements that promote programmed zzso zzso zzso present a natural target for the rational design of zzso zzso It has been commonly accepted that the zzso zzso signal is special, because its downstream zzso element consists of a simple zzso stem loop rather than a more complex secondary structure such as a zzso Here we present three lines of evidence, zzso zzso and zzso showing that the biologically relevant zzso zzso signal contains a complex zzso structure that likely includes an extended zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the potential zzso triplex structure is essential for viral propagation and zzso and that small molecules targeted to this zzso structure may possess zzso zzso
