We have used the zzso chain reaction to map the gene zzso human zzso zzso zzso form II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cashman, 1992, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso to zzso zzso We propose the designation zzso for this gene as it is the third zzso gene to be zzso The two other human zzso genes identified to date, zzso and zzso are also located on zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso Shephard, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Palmer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, and zzso zzso Phillips, 1991, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shephard, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, and zzso zzso Phillips, 1992, zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso has been refined to the long arm of zzso zzso Analysis of human zzso zzso by in zzso zzso confirmed the mapping of zzso and localized this gene more precisely to zzso
