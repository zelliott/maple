zzso precursors originate from and undergo lineage commitment within designated sites of zzso such as the zzso bone zzso These cells subsequently differentiate in response to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso bone zzso unlike that of zzso has been overlooked as a source of zzso precursors in favor of the liver zzso region, where zzso occurs in zzso Here we report that the bone zzso rather than the liver periphery provides zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso examined its gene expression in developing and zzso infected zzso zzso zzso and produced it in zzso form zzso This zzso did not bind or elicit zzso of zzso liver zzso Surprisingly, a zzso of bone zzso cells engaged this growth factor and formed zzso zzso colonies in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso bone zzso (but not zzso cultures comprised of cells with characteristic zzso zzso and high gene expression of the zzso marker zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that in contrast to all other zzso studied to date, committed zzso zzso precursor populations are not present at the central site of zzso but reside in the bone zzso
