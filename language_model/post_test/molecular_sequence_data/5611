zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso of the zzso iron center and activated by zzso of zzso oxide zzso To obtain structural information on the iron center, we isolated zzso complexes containing the iron center by zzso When the zzso digest of the alpha zzso isolated from the inactive form was analyzed by zzso high performance liquid zzso the zzso characteristic of the zzso iron center was observed in the zzso fragment, zzso - zzso The zzso contained zzso zzso of zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso by digesting the zzso with zzso zzso Y, and zzso zzso M, we found that the minimum zzso segment required for the zzso iron center is the 11 zzso acid zzso from zzso to zzso Furthermore, by using mass zzso protein zzso and zzso acid composition zzso we have shown that the zzso zzso zzso of the alpha zzso is zzso oxidized to a zzso acid zzso in the zzso These results indicate that the zzso from zzso zzso zzso has a novel zzso iron zzso containing a zzso acid in the iron zzso zzso zzso zzso of the iron center are zzso
