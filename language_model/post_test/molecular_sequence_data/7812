We have previously described studies of a 22 zzso active zzso of the zzso zzso In follow-up studies of zzso we have discovered the separate existence of a 23 zzso zzso which shares many of the zzso properties of zzso including the ability to lyse zzso zzso However, this apparent zzso zzso which we designate zzso is distinct from the 22 zzso active zzso protein for the following reasons: zzso the zzso sequence of zzso shares no zzso with zzso or the zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso do not produce zzso yet produce zzso and zzso specific zzso to each zzso do not show any zzso zzso appears to be produced as a 30 zzso zzso which is possibly zzso to produce a 23 zzso active zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows strong zzso activity only at higher pH conditions, while zzso exhibits zzso activity over a broad pH zzso In addition to their ability to cleave at internal zzso sites, both the zzso and zzso zzso efficiently cleave zzso
