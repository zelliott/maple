The two human zzso zzso zzso zzso which differ by their zzso region, are zzso by a single zzso The gene is composed of 19 zzso that span more than 68 zzso and has been mapped to the zzso band of the human zzso The two zzso zzso display different tissue zzso Their precursors are transcribed from two distinct start sites, upstream from zzso 1 and zzso 3, zzso zzso analysis of the two putative promoters revealed the presence of motifs characteristic for several zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene structure with those of other zinc zzso as well as a zzso study, confirm the existence of a zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso blood group zzso and two bacterial zzso
