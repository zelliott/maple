Two zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso brain functions such as anxiety and zzso To facilitate the analysis of their differential involvement, we developed a zzso zzso zzso by synthesis of zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso High affinity to the zzso protein was prevented by introduction of zzso acid in the binding site of the zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso was analyzed zzso in cell culture by using human embryonic zzso cells zzso with zzso coding for zzso or zzso in zzso experiments, and in behavior experiments using male zzso mice for its zzso action on zzso and zzso behaviors with the elevated zzso test and the forced swim test zzso zzso We observed that zzso was more selective than zzso frequently used as zzso zzso in stimulating the zzso cells to release zzso zzso specificity was demonstrated in zzso experiments by its selective binding to zzso of brain sections of the zzso After injection into the brain zzso it enhanced zzso behavior on the elevated zzso at a lower dose than zzso Whereas at high doses, zzso injected into the lateral intermediate zzso containing predominantly zzso increased zzso behavior as zzso zzso do, zzso did zzso In contrast to its zzso actions, zzso reduced significantly the zzso time in the zzso as described for zzso zzso Thus, zzso combines zzso properties with zzso effects in the zzso
