The crystal structure of a zzso acid triplex reveals a zzso designated zzso that differs from previously reported zzso acid zzso The triplex consists of one zzso DNA strand zzso to a zzso hairpin zzso zzso acid zzso and was successfully designed to promote zzso and zzso base zzso The zzso zzso is zzso with a base tilt similar to zzso zzso The bases are displaced from the zzso axis even more than in zzso zzso zzso bonds between the DNA backbone and the zzso zzso backbone explain the observation that zzso zzso sequences form highly stable zzso zzso zzso This structure expands the number of known stable zzso forms that zzso acids can zzso
