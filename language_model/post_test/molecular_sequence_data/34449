Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the zzso zzso 1912 gene zzso which encodes a zzso regulator of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso arrested zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso The results of in zzso and in zzso studies revealed that the ABC zzso genes zzso are targets of zzso repressive zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a significant increase in the amount of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso controls the zzso of transport system genes in response to an zzso zzso Features that distinguish zzso regulation from other known regulators are zzso
