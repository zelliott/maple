zzso zzso provides a zzso barrier between an zzso and its zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso cells produce structural zzso which are zzso in an orderly fashion to form a zzso envelope zzso However, under genetic or environmental stress, specific genes are induced to rapidly build a temporary zzso Small zzso zzso proteins are the primary constituents of the zzso Under stress the entire family of 14 zzso genes is zzso The zzso genes are clustered within the larger zzso differentiation complex on mouse zzso 3, human zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso genes and their zzso under stress suggest that these genes may be zzso zzso To identify zzso elements that regulate this stress response zzso of the zzso zzso we zzso zzso tools and classical zzso zzso zzso comparative sequence analysis identified zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites zzso mapped to specific zzso Increased prevalence of these zzso in zzso zzso provides in zzso evidence of the regulation of the zzso locus by these zzso zzso Individual components of these zzso were zzso and one was shown to have strong zzso activity specific to conditions when the zzso genes are zzso zzso
