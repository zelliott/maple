Recently, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and characterized from bovine zzso This zzso has both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The discovery of this zzso led us to propose a new zzso for zzso metabolism in which the zzso group of either zzso or zzso is transferred to the zzso group of zzso In this study, the partial zzso acid sequences from the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso contains zzso acid sequences identical to those of human zzso zzso zzso zzso The coding sequences of the zzso zzso and human genes were obtained from the respective kidney zzso by zzso The open reading frames of zzso were cloned into zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso The expression of mouse zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that zzso cells had higher zzso and zzso zzso activities than did zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso had zzso zzso There were no significant zzso zzso and zzso activities in the mouse zzso cells under either zzso or neutral zzso zzso acid sequences from zzso of zzso human, and bovine zzso demonstrated a signal zzso zzso site, one zzso motif zzso and several zzso zzso sites in each zzso zzso The replacement of zzso with zzso in the zzso motif of mouse zzso resulted in elimination of zzso activity, indicating that the zzso zzso is part of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso human, and bovine zzso yielded core proteins with a molecular mass of 42 zzso without change in zzso zzso zzso was zzso modified by signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and each mature zzso had the same size core zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso
