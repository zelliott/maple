The key event in the zzso of prion diseases is a zzso change in the prion protein zzso Models for conversion of zzso into zzso typically zzso zzso as yet, unidentified zzso In an attempt to identify such an zzso we used zzso hydrogen exchange monitored with zzso Although we were unable to detect an intermediate directly, we observed substantial protection above that expected based upon zzso of the global stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso super zzso This super protection implicates either structure in the zzso state or the presence of an zzso Similar experiments with zzso a zzso of zzso that does not form infectious zzso failed to demonstrate such super zzso This suggests that the partially structured state of zzso encompassing portions of the B and C zzso may be a significant factor in the ability of zzso to convert from zzso to zzso
