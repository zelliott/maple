We have cloned and characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso a basic protein zzso to the human zzso binding protein 1 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript, which was shown to be expressed in various stages of the zzso life cycle, codes for a protein of 217 zzso acids zzso towards its zzso a zzso acid binding zzso known as the zzso domain zzso This domain is zzso identical to the zzso domain of other members of the zzso binding protein family and zzso identical to the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain possess some structural characteristics that permit zzso formation as occurs in the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso differs from the other zzso binding proteins because of the presence of tandem repeats of zzso and zzso suggesting the formation of a zzso zzso zzso This novel folding pattern for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso might suggest a distinct specific function for this protein in the zzso
