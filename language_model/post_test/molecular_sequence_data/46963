zzso is an zzso which zzso cellular proliferation by zzso the function of zzso The zzso zzso complex blocks zzso transition by zzso downstream targets essential for cell cycle zzso One such target is zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso : zzso : zzso complex, and which has been linked to zzso control by virtue of its ability to zzso the zzso protein zzso In the current work, we describe cloning and characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso Similar to zzso zzso is activated by zzso and by zzso active zzso and is inhibited by zzso as well as zzso zzso between zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso were observed, suggesting potential differences in the regulation of these zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso were both intact in zzso cell, indicating a possible role for zzso in in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we found two zzso of zzso which are localized to distinct cellular zzso the smaller form resides in the zzso zzso whereas the larger form is found in the particulate zzso Our findings demonstrate the existence of a family of zzso protein zzso potentially involved in zzso zzso zzso control, and zzso of zzso zzso
