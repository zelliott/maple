The zzso of the zzso transcript from zzso zzso interacting with the zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso bond protection against zzso by zzso of the zzso transcripts was found in the zzso zzso the D zzso and the zzso stem and weak protection was also seen in the variable zzso Most of the protected zzso zzso to regions around known identity elements of zzso Enhancement of zzso at certain positions indicates zzso of zzso upon binding to the zzso When applied to the three-dimensional model of zzso from zzso the majority of the protections occur on the D loop side of the zzso revealing that zzso zzso has a rather complex and novel pattern of interaction with zzso differing from that of other known class II zzso zzso
