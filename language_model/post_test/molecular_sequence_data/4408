zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor with a 157 zzso zzso Signal zzso zzso was shown to occur after zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso of the largest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was not required for zzso zzso After a change of the putative active site zzso to Ala, inactive zzso with the same mobility on zzso as zzso mature zzso was zzso The role of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso processing was also zzso zzso early in the zzso and zzso zzso stretch zzso to Met which should prevent zzso processing and zzso to Val which should allow removal of only the first zzso did not prevent synthesis of active mature zzso nor did use of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of the entire zzso stretch zzso to zzso resulted in zzso zzso of an zzso zzso which surprisingly was not zzso and little or no zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso resulted in zzso of only mature zzso and no zzso zzso Transit times and levels of zzso zzso were similar for both zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso after zzso which yields mature active zzso can occur in the absence of zzso processing and that zzso processing is not necessary for zzso of mature active zzso
