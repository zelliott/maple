DNA zzso maintains zzso stability and regulates gene expression zzso In zzso DNA zzso is zzso in the zzso from one generation to the next zzso In plants, it was considered that patterns of DNA zzso are zzso maintained through sexual reproduction zzso However, a recent report showed discrete variations of DNA zzso profiles from mother to daughter plants zzso The mechanisms that explain these variations have remained zzso Here, we report that maintenance DNA zzso are barely expressed during zzso female zzso In contrast, after zzso both maintenance and de zzso DNA zzso are expressed strongly in the zzso zzso is marked by increased de zzso DNA zzso reaching levels that are further maintained in the adult zzso The zzso of these zzso marks after zzso zzso a zzso fluorescent zzso De zzso DNA zzso in the zzso provides a mechanism that could account for the gradual zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we uncover that DNA zzso activity fluctuates during sexual zzso This cycle likely explains variations of zzso patterns of DNA zzso across generations in zzso zzso zzso and enables a limited degree of zzso of the zzso
