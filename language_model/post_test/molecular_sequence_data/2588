We recently reported the presence of zzso zzso repeats within the terminal regions of wound tumor virus zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1987, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 84, zzso This report describes a series of experiments designed to investigate potential zzso interactions involving the zzso and zzso zzso of wound tumor virus zzso A series of zzso zzso were constructed which allowed the synthesis of an exact copy of the transcript corresponding to zzso segment zzso and four zzso that differed from the authentic sequence only at the immediate zzso zzso designed to extend or alter the zzso zzso repeat altered the in zzso zzso efficiency of the transcript and the sensitivity of zzso bonds within the immediate zzso domain to zzso by zzso zzso These results were consistent with zzso secondary structure analyses of the complete zzso sequence of transcripts corresponding to six zzso segments which predicted zzso interactions involving the terminal zzso zzso Potential roles of the terminal zzso in zzso sorting and packaging of a segmented zzso zzso are zzso
