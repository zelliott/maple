The product of the zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso a zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso Various growth factors such as zzso growth factor, zzso zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor, insulin, zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to induce zzso of zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso is, thus, believed to play a role in zzso growth factor receptors to zzso We have examined the role of zzso in the zzso response of human peripheral zzso zzso zzso expressing T cells to human zzso zzso employing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso indicated that incorporation of zzso was zzso at 4 h and zzso remained stable in these cells for up to 24 zzso Treatment of T cells with the AS zzso in zzso duplex formation followed by efficient translation blockade of zzso In contrast, sense zzso and nonsense zzso zzso failed to form zzso duplexes and did not interfere with translation of zzso suggesting specific elimination of zzso by the AS zzso zzso of T cells zzso zzso following exposure to zzso was substantially reduced when the zzso AS zzso was added to cultures, while the zzso response to this factor remained almost unaffected in the presence of S and zzso zzso
