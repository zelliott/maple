To identify and subsequently clone the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted against two highly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were used to amplify a zzso DNA region spanning the two zzso from zzso DNA preparations of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences and deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of these fragments revealed zzso with each other and with the corresponding regions from other zzso Using an zzso specific to Mt zzso as a probe, the Mt zzso DNA zzso libraries zzso in zzso coli were screened and a zzso DNA clone zzso with the zzso was zzso Furthermore, a zzso DNA zzso containing the Mt zzso was zzso into a zzso zzso
