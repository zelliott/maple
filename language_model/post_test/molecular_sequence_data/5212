zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso is a unique new software tool that uses artificial intelligence techniques to discover motifs shared by a set of protein sequences in a fully automated zzso This paper is the first detailed study of the use of zzso to zzso a large, biologically relevant set of zzso and to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of zzso in identifying structurally important zzso For this purpose, we chose the zzso alcohol zzso zzso because it is large and zzso diverse, providing a test of how well zzso can work on sequences with low zzso acid zzso Moreover, this zzso contains zzso of biological importance, and because several zzso have known X-ray zzso structures, we can test the usefulness of zzso for structural zzso The first six motifs from zzso map onto structurally important zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso We also describe zzso zzso zzso Search zzso which zzso uses output from zzso for searching databases such as zzso and zzso zzso provides statistical measures that permit a rigorous evaluation of the significance of database searches with individual motifs or groups of zzso A database search of zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso of the first six motifs obtained from zzso yields a zzso zzso demonstrating the selectivity of zzso We show for the first time, using primary sequence analysis, that bacterial sugar zzso are zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso will be increasingly useful as zzso sequencing provides large zzso of zzso divergent sequences of biomedical zzso
