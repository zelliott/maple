The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes nine Salt zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso also named zzso zzso protein zzso and 24 zzso protein zzso zzso also named as zzso protein zzso zzso A general regulatory mechanism between these two families is that zzso calcium sensors activate zzso zzso by interacting with their zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso by their functional interacting zzso is another common regulatory zzso The zzso site zzso at the C zzso of zzso by zzso was identified by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso This zzso zzso is zzso within the zzso motif at the C zzso of zzso zzso zzso of this site of zzso by zzso has been determined zzso We further showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the same site in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, the zzso stabilized the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso This tight interaction neutralized the zzso effect of zzso on plasma membrane zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso by their interacting zzso zzso is a critical component of the zzso regulatory zzso in zzso
