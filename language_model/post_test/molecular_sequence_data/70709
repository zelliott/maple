The zzso binding site present in the zzso human T zzso cell line was zzso zzso cell zzso were found to have a single zzso binding site for zzso a zzso zzso zzso constant, zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso was inhibited by several zzso zzso Northern analysis and reverse zzso chain reaction provided evidence for the expression of the recently cloned type 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso cloned from these cells was functional in zzso expression zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso binding was zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and 12 zzso 2 zzso for zzso The binding of zzso a putative zzso zzso to zzso to the zzso cell zzso could be directly demonstrated by using zzso expressed zzso zzso The binding of zzso was zzso with a zzso constant of 88 zzso 7 zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction also produced evidence for the existence of an alternatively spliced zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso binding zzso This constitutes the first report on the molecular characterization of the zzso in immune zzso
