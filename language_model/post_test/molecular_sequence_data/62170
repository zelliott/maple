Human zzso and geographical separation over long periods may have resulted in ecologically distinct populations of zzso zzso infecting individuals in different zzso This study used zzso sequence analysis with the aim of defining zzso zzso motifs in zzso from East Asian and African dyspeptic zzso zzso of internal fragments zzso zzso of three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for 85 zzso from individuals in Japan and China (30 zzso Nigeria and South Africa zzso zzso the United Kingdom (32 zzso and nine zzso reference zzso zzso analyses showed a high degree of zzso zzso amongst sequences from the Japanese and Nigerian zzso with each robustly zzso as distinct lineages irrespective of zzso presence and zzso zzso zzso All strains had unique combined sequence types except for identical paired zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified within each gene which were combined to provide unique motifs defining the Japanese and Nigerian regional zzso The zzso were present at variable zzso in UK and South African zzso The findings provide unique evidence of positive selection for zzso zzso sites linked to the geographical separation in Japan of a strain zzso for which we propose the designation zzso zzso zzso zzso
