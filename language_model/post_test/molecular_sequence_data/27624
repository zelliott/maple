The human zzso alpha zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein which binds zzso The gene for this zzso has been zzso and the primary structure is thus known zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso A model of its secondary structure predicts that the zzso has seven zzso spanning zzso By zzso labeling and zzso zzso we have identified a region of the zzso that is directly involved with zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations of the zzso were zzso zzso with either of two specific zzso zzso zzso zzso (an zzso or zzso (an zzso The zzso receptors were then zzso with specific zzso and peptides containing the zzso bound zzso were zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso labeled zzso yielded one zzso of Mr zzso as the product of a complete zzso zzso zzso gave a labeled zzso of Mr zzso which was further zzso to the Mr zzso zzso by additional treatment with zzso Using zzso zzso a similar Mr zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso This Mr zzso zzso zzso to the fourth zzso spanning domain of the zzso These data suggest that this region forms part of the zzso binding domain of the human zzso alpha zzso zzso
