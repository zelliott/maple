Two high Mr protein bands zzso and zzso zzso in sheep brain zzso zzso were labeled with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso band is labeled by zzso with about zzso higher affinity than the 440 zzso zzso The heavily labeled zzso zzso band is identified as zzso heavy chain based on its partial zzso acid zzso and zzso with zzso zzso The 440 zzso protein is zzso identified as the zzso zzso zzso binding is obtained in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the binding of zzso to its zzso up to zzso and increased the binding affinity up to zzso Other zzso stimulate zzso binding with decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With respect to zzso zzso this binding site is similar to the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso However, the brain zzso may have additional one or more sites with lower affinity with zzso effect on zzso zzso These results suggest that the major zzso zzso in sheep brain zzso to the zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso binding by zzso involves its binding to the zzso zzso The association of zzso with brain zzso zzso may reflect a linkage of zzso to the zzso
