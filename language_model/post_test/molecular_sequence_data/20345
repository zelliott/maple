The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are specific zzso of the small zzso protein zzso The interaction of zzso with the second zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulates the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso bound to the zzso at zzso A zzso The complex is a zzso with zzso symmetry arranged in an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interface with the equivalent region of zzso shows the structural basis of zzso specificity for zzso Using zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso we further show that zzso zzso at the switch region borders are the key structural zzso of zzso zzso A zzso model of the association of the zzso complex with zzso shows that the zzso zzso should lie along the membrane to prevent zzso zzso resulting in only one zzso zzso zzso Such a zzso complex gives insights to better understand the zzso motor switch regulatory zzso
