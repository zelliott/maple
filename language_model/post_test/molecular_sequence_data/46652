In this study we present the cloning and functional characterization of a gene whose product is responsible for zzso activity and is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso synthesis of zzso zzso A zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso was obtained using the combination of reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification zzso ends zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso code for an open reading frame of zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the cloned zzso comprises three zzso zzso regions and two zzso zzso and showed similarity with zzso omega-3 and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of this open reading frame in zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso acid zzso suggesting that this gene encodes for a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that is functional in zzso
