We describe three zzso zzso caused by integration of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso All three insertions occurred within 500 base pairs of each other in the zzso end of the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso transcript that spliced into zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso contained transcripts complementary to zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso also contained small amounts of zzso zzso zzso The implications of these studies for the development of zzso zzso zzso as a strategy for cloning previously zzso genes are zzso
