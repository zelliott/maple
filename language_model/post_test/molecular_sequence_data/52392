zzso proteins are low molecular weight zzso proteins highly related to zzso and zzso which are involved in the control of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies have shown that zzso proteins are membrane associated and are localized to specific zzso along the zzso and zzso zzso zzso association requires the presence of zzso zzso zzso The present report indicates that the structurally distinct zzso motifs of zzso proteins are subjected to zzso both in zzso and in zzso Studies on deletion zzso suggest that an intact zzso end is required for the association of zzso proteins with the membrane and is necessary for the zzso zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso is different from the zzso which zzso nuclear zzso and zzso proteins in zzso
