Multiple zzso zzso zzso is a method used for amplifying limiting DNA zzso The high molecular weight amplified DNA is ideal for DNA library zzso While this has enabled zzso sequencing from one or a few cells of zzso zzso the process is complicated by the tendency of zzso to generate zzso DNA zzso in the amplified zzso zzso the source of the DNA zzso would be an important step towards reducing or eliminating zzso 

Here, we characterize the major types of zzso formed by carrying out an zzso whole zzso amplification from a single zzso coli cell and sequencing by the zzso Life Sciences zzso Analysis of 475 zzso revealed the zzso reaction mechanisms that create the DNA zzso The highly zzso DNA zzso in zzso can assume many alternative secondary zzso DNA strands extended on an initial template can be displaced becoming available to prime on a second template creating the zzso Evidence supports a model in which branch migration can zzso zzso freeing them to prime on the new zzso More than zzso of the resulting DNA zzso were zzso sequences with intervening deletions that the model zzso zzso zzso were favored, with displaced zzso zzso to single stranded zzso contained within the same zzso DNA zzso In over zzso of the zzso zzso the 3' zzso had initiated zzso at complimentary sequences of zzso zzso zzso in the new zzso 

zzso of zzso is an important limitation to the zzso method, particularly for whole zzso zzso Identification of the mechanism for zzso formation provides new insight into the zzso reaction and suggests methods to reduce zzso The zzso sequencing approach used here will provide a rapid method to assess the utility of reaction zzso
