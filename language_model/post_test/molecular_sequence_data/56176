During feeding by infected zzso malaria zzso are injected into the zzso zzso and enter zzso within zzso The remarkable target cell specificity of this zzso may be explained by the presence of receptors for the region zzso of the zzso protein zzso on the zzso domain of the plasma membrane of zzso We have now identified these receptors as zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to the receptors is abolished by zzso treatment, indicating that the recognition of region zzso is via the zzso zzso We have zzso and partially characterized the zzso zzso from zzso zzso They have a molecular weight of zzso are tightly associated with the plasma zzso and are released from the cell surface by very mild zzso a property which the zzso receptors share with the zzso family of zzso
