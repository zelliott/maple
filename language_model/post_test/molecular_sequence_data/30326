zzso B viruses evolve more slowly than human influenza A, but no reasons for the difference have been zzso We have analyzed sequence changes in the zzso and zzso of influenza B viruses (and have determined four zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in relation to zzso properties and compared these with similar analyses of variation in influenza A zzso Independent of the slower rate of change in influenza B zzso only approximately zzso of zzso changes in either the zzso or zzso gene sequence result in zzso acid changes in the zzso whereas in influenza A 50% of zzso changes result in altered zzso zzso Thus, there is less selection for change, or less tolerance to change, in the influenza B zzso This is similar to findings with influenza C and findings with influenza A viruses that replicate in lower animals and birds and is closer to the type of variation found in other zzso zzso We propose that human influenza A is unique in that it is the only virus group in which zzso selection dominates evolutionary zzso
