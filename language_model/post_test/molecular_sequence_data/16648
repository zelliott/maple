zzso zzso arrest deficient 2) is a highly zzso protein involving in zzso checkpoint zzso zzso locates at zzso zzso during zzso and zzso from zzso zzso towards zzso In this study, we isolated zzso genes zzso for zzso from zzso zzso The three zzso genes on the long arms of the zzso zzso shared approximately zzso similarity of the zzso sequence in coding zzso The zzso structures of the three zzso were also zzso showing high similarities to that of the zzso zzso zzso All three zzso were transcribed in roots and spikes but not in zzso We generated zzso against the zzso with zzso acid sequences derived from the zzso sequences of the wheat zzso zzso Using these zzso we found zzso in wheat zzso cells to change in location and amount through the cell cycle, similar to those reported for human zzso zzso zzso signals were observed at the zzso of all zzso zzso when zzso were treated with zzso a zzso drug, but no signals were observed in zzso zzso Thus, the wheat zzso protein could be a good marker for the functional zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
