We have identified two V zzso genes outside the major zzso locus on zzso zzso and shown that they reside on zzso zzso One gene zzso zzso strongly to the V zzso zzso was zzso and found to belong to the V zzso 8 family; the other gene zzso only zzso zzso zzso was present in all individuals tested zzso from three different zzso and was also found in zzso We zzso that these genes were generated by zzso and zzso of the V zzso zzso gene (and a V zzso zzso from the major zzso and that this event occurred before the evolutionary divergence of humans and zzso As there is no other evidence for V zzso genes outside the major zzso it appears that the human zzso locus has undergone considerably less evolutionary zzso than either the human light chain zzso locus or the heavy chain zzso
