To prevent in zzso degradation, small peptides are usually expressed in fusion proteins from which target peptides can be released by zzso or chemical zzso In this report, small zzso modifier zzso linked with a zzso tag was used as a fusion partner for the production of zzso human zzso a hormone for the treatment of acute zzso heart zzso The fusion zzso which was zzso mainly as inclusion bodies in zzso coli, constituted about zzso of the total cell zzso After zzso by zzso affinity zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the fusion protein was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was separated from the fusion partner by the zzso zzso using zzso once again, and then further zzso with zzso high performance liquid zzso In zzso activity zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso had a potent zzso effect on rabbit zzso strips with an zzso of zzso zzso which was similar to that of the synthetic zzso zzso The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy zzso of small zzso peptides with native zzso
