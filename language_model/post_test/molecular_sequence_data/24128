The present study was designed to zzso identify a zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso insert of zzso zzso carried by zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso method on both zzso The zzso insert contained a zzso long open reading frame coding for a deduced protein sequence of zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso program revealed about zzso protein sequence identity with a zzso protein of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso insert lacking 70 zzso acids at the zzso was zzso in frame into zzso zzso to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso prepared in rabbits zzso with the zzso zzso protein recognized a zzso component of approximately 60 zzso by zzso with zzso zzso However, two molecules with relative sizes of 60 and 70 zzso were recognized in zzso zzso extracts by zzso zzso The zzso component was apparently of host zzso zzso In an indirect fluorescent zzso test, the rabbit serum strongly reacted with the zzso stage of the four zzso species, but also, although zzso with the host zzso A zzso zzso performed with zzso fusion protein and zzso zzso from rabbit liver showed that the zzso fusion zzso but not the zzso zzso was associated to zzso From these results, we conclude that the protein present in the four zzso species analyzed here may be considered as a novel zzso zzso zzso
