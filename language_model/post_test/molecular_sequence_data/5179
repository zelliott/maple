There is increasing evidence that zzso receptors are composed of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we compared the properties of native zzso receptors with those of receptors composed of a zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso gene was cloned from a white perch zzso zzso retinal zzso zzso The clone zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso base pairs and encodes a predicted protein of zzso zzso zzso It is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso cloned from human and rat zzso The receptors zzso zzso expressed by this gene in zzso zzso show properties similar to those of the zzso receptors present on white perch retinal zzso zzso induced a sustained response that had a reversal potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for the response was zzso zzso zzso zzso a value similar to that reported for zzso zzso zzso the responses were zzso insensitive and not modulated by either zzso or zzso as is the case for zzso zzso There were, however, some distinct differences between native zzso and zzso zzso zzso acts as a partial zzso on zzso receptors whereas it is strictly an zzso on native zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso on zzso zzso but both competitive and zzso on zzso zzso We conclude that zzso receptors are formed by zzso zzso zzso but that native zzso receptors probably consist of a mixture of zzso zzso zzso
