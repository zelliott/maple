zzso immune adherence receptors are zzso complement receptors zzso that favorably influence the clearance of circulating immune complexes zzso The human zzso is the type one complement zzso zzso most commonly expressed as a 220 zzso protein containing 30 short consensus repeats zzso The zzso zzso is a 75 zzso protein composed of eight zzso and is zzso by an zzso of human zzso zzso a genetic element related to zzso Human zzso was previously identified from zzso clones that predict zzso for seven zzso and there have been no reports of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if human zzso is zzso zzso of human bone zzso zzso using zzso specific for zzso yielded a product similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso The first zzso zzso matched zzso with the predicted human zzso zzso while the second half of zzso 7 was zzso to the comparable zzso zzso sequence but with a stop zzso zzso in zzso cells yielded a human zzso protein of approximately 50 zzso that exhibited binding specificity for zzso but not for zzso Neither northern nor western zzso analysis of human bone zzso revealed the presence of the zzso transcript or zzso However, northern zzso analysis of various other zzso tissue identified a candidate zzso transcript in human fetal zzso zzso amplification of a zzso panel of human fetal tissue confirmed the presence of the zzso transcript in fetal liver, and to a lesser extent in fetal zzso and zzso Thus, expression of the zzso transcript appears to be limited to zzso and fetal zzso zzso
