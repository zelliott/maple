The main objectives of this work have been to study zzso whether or not zzso effects on gastrointestinal zzso in chicken are zzso through central or peripheral zzso zzso the receptors zzso zzso the correlation of the motor response to the distribution of zzso in the gastrointestinal tract and zzso to evaluate the zzso role of zzso zzso in spontaneous zzso zzso infusion of zzso and zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso induced gastric zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was faster in zzso zzso In the stomach there was a correlation between the duration of the zzso response and the affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso which was not zzso zzso showed that zzso like material is mainly located at the zzso zzso and the outer circular muscle in zzso In the zzso it was found in the zzso and the deep muscular zzso When zzso zzso were zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso significantly their zzso In conclusion, the fact that zzso and their zzso induced a zzso activity in the zzso and the lengthening of zzso by zzso suggest a zzso role for zzso on induction of zzso in birds, acting at peripheral zzso
