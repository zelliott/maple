zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso were isolated from a zzso enrichment culture of activated sewage zzso zzso zzso but not strain zzso was able to degrade zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The mixed strains zzso and zzso showed a better growth on zzso as the zzso than the pure strain zzso because strain zzso was able to reduce the level of zzso zzso produced during zzso zzso zzso was toxic to strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but less toxic to strain zzso zzso zzso 215 zzso zzso zzso possessed zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso whose activities toward zzso zzso zzso were strongly inhibited by zzso The two zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on mass zzso analyses of zzso peptides and database searches of the partial DNA sequences of their zzso In contrast, strain zzso containing another zzso zzso zzso could zzso both zzso and zzso This study suggested that strain zzso possessing zzso played a synergistic role in reducing the toxic and zzso effects of zzso produced in the degradation of zzso by strain zzso
