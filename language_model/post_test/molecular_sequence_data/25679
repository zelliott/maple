zzso synthetic zzso duplexes containing a single zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso base pair at the 16th position zzso zzso where X zzso A or zzso were used to study de zzso zzso by the zzso human DNA zzso isolated from zzso zzso Both duplexes containing zzso and zzso base pairs show enhanced zzso group zzso zzso zzso introduction of zzso sites at the 15th position of the top strand (the C zzso next to the abnormal base zzso and the 7th, 15th (which represents the C zzso in the zzso and zzso base zzso and 27th positions of the bottom strand were used to study the maintenance zzso of the zzso duplexes by the zzso This revealed striking differences in the rate, amount, and sites of zzso which are dependent on the position of the zzso site in the zzso The possible mechanism of action of the zzso is zzso The data show that zzso zzso in DNA can have other genetic effects apart from their zzso behavior and that zzso and zzso base pairs exert different effects in terms of zzso
