The zzso of zzso zzso fatty zzso in plants is mainly zzso by members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso products may be further zzso and are known as zzso substances in plant development and in responses to wounding and pathogen zzso In contrast with the situation in zzso information on the relevance of zzso zzso metabolism in zzso organisms is zzso zzso we aimed to zzso zzso and zzso patterns of zzso zzso A search of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso named zzso that zzso an zzso zzso Individual analysis of zzso zzso domain revealed zzso activity as a zzso zzso Analysis of the full-length zzso zzso however, revealed zzso zzso zzso activity, generating zzso acid as the main product from LA zzso zzso and zzso acid as the main product from zzso zzso zzso respectively, with zzso as preferred zzso The zzso exhibited a broad pH optimum between pH 7 and pH zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso contain more zzso zzso in zzso than in zzso cells, but products of full-length zzso were not zzso under the conditions zzso As no other zzso sequence was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the results presented suggest that zzso zzso may represent the zzso products of zzso Based on the zzso results of zzso we suggest that this zzso zzso may represent a more ancient way to control the zzso amount of zzso in this zzso
