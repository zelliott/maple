Efforts to resolve Darwin's zzso zzso origin of zzso led to the conclusion that zzso and various fossil groups are sister to zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso however, are difficult to zzso and molecular data have not provided clear resolution of relationships among major groups of seed zzso We introduce two sequence data sets from slowly evolving zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso reject the zzso hypothesis, favoring instead a close relationship between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso alone and with zzso and zzso also strongly support a zzso zzso Surprisingly, three of four genes (all but nuclear zzso and combined zzso analyses also suggest or strongly support zzso as derived zzso sister to zzso zzso with zzso screened to avoid long branches consistently identify all zzso as a zzso sister group to zzso Combined three- and zzso rooted analyses resolve the branching order for the remaining major zzso separate from other zzso first, followed by zzso and then zzso + zzso sister to a zzso group with all other conifer zzso The molecular zzso strongly conflicts with current interpretations of seed plant zzso and implies that many similarities between zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso structures and double zzso were independently zzso whereas other characters could emerge as zzso for an expanded conifer group including zzso An initial zzso split implies a long stem lineage preceding the explosive zzso radiation of flowering plants and suggests that zzso origins and zzso should be sought among extinct seed plant zzso
