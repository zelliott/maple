Bid zzso a member of the zzso zzso of zzso family, plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have cloned the chicken Bid zzso which encodes a 193 zzso acid protein and shares zzso zzso with human and mouse Bid zzso Bid sequence comparison zzso the conservation of both the functional domain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso An induction of zzso by chicken Bid and the zzso of the zzso after zzso treatment, were also zzso In addition, zzso Bid expression was detected along all zzso stages and zzso zzso suggesting a role for this protein in the zzso zzso This is the first report demonstrating the functionality of a zzso protein in zzso
