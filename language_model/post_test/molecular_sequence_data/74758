zzso zzso zzso is often followed by heart failure zzso but the mechanisms zzso the transition to zzso remain largely zzso A zzso profile was performed in a monkey model of zzso from the zzso adjacent to chronic zzso zzso followed by 3 weeks of pacing to develop zzso The transcript of the gene zzso the cell zzso zzso zzso was zzso by 50% in zzso heart compared with control zzso which was confirmed by quantitative zzso The zzso sequence cloned from a heart library showed a conservation of the zzso zzso domain when compared with the zzso zzso cloned previously but a different zzso half due to alternative zzso with zzso The zzso of the cardiac sequence was zzso between mice and zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso measured upon generation of a zzso zzso was limited to heart, liver, and zzso Upon zzso in cardiac zzso both zzso promote cell growth and reduce zzso by zzso zzso versus zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we found an interaction of the generic but not the cardiac zzso with zzso H and zzso zzso zzso In addition, only the generic zzso zzso the zzso zzso 2, which was accompanied by a doubling of zzso in the S and zzso zzso of the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso the heart expresses a zzso zzso of zzso which promotes cardiac cell growth and zzso differs from the generic zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso specificity and regulation of the cell zzso and is zzso significantly in zzso
