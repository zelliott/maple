We report the construction of expression plasmids carrying two zzso zzso genes zzso for the zzso membrane protein zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and the zzso membrane protein zzso Using the zzso promoter of zzso zzso which is controlled by a zzso zzso we obtained a high level of zzso synthesis of zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso Both proteins were zzso to near zzso and the presence of zzso to zzso and zzso in human zzso was determined by an zzso zzso zzso Whereas in all 44 serum samples from zzso patients in the secondary and early zzso stages of zzso high levels of zzso zzso were zzso only 34 serum samples contained zzso zzso As has been previously observed for zzso a correlation was found between the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the level of zzso to zzso drops soon after successful zzso zzso We concluded that, in contrast to zzso zzso is not suitable for zzso purposes as a single zzso because a significant fraction of zzso from zzso patients was zzso with zzso
