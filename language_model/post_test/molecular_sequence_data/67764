zzso replication across damaged DNA is critical to prevent replication fork collapse and resulting zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is a crucial event that triggers a number of downstream pathways important for zzso zzso Here, we report characterization of zzso an zzso zzso protein containing a zzso zzso zzso called a zzso box, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear protein and forms DNA zzso zzso that zzso with markers for stalled DNA zzso Focus formation of zzso requires its zzso and the zzso domain and is dependent on zzso and the zzso zzso site, indicating that zzso is recruited to zzso zzso zzso depletion results in increased zzso during replication of zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso is recruited to sites of stalled replication via zzso zzso and plays an important role to prevent zzso associated with replication of damaged zzso
