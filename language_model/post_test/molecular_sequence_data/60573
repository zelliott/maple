We report the isolation and identification of a new zzso affecting zzso cell fate in the zzso neural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lack zzso throughout development but have increased numbers of zzso The zzso retinal zzso zzso is normal, suggesting that the zzso does not affect zzso synthesis per zzso zzso of early zzso markers is absent in zzso zzso and transplant experiments suggested a zzso function in zzso We show that zzso is a zzso in a zzso gene zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso factor related to zzso zzso a gene known to be required for development of eye and crest zzso cells in the zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene restored zzso development in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso induced the formation of zzso zzso cells and caused defects in eye development in zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso development in fish and zzso shares a dependence on the zzso zzso factor, but that proper development of the retinal zzso zzso in the fish is not zzso suggesting an evolutionary divergence in the function of this zzso
