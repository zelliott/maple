zzso zzso appears critical to Alzheimer's zzso To clarify possible mechanisms of zzso action, we have zzso zzso gene expression in zzso by using zzso primary cortical zzso cultures and in zzso by using mice transgenic for the zzso precursor zzso Here, we report that zzso but not zzso zzso increases the level of the zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were also zzso in aged zzso zzso zzso Because others have reported that zzso zzso can substitute for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the result of zzso induction by zzso would be zzso of zzso to the active zzso zzso To gain insights into the possible actions of zzso we evaluated the hypotheses that zzso and zzso may mediate zzso in zzso toxicity or, zzso that zzso zzso may lead to zzso zzso In evaluating these conflicting zzso we found that zzso zzso degrades zzso with zzso relevant efficiency, zzso approximately zzso the rate of zzso on zzso Mass spectral analyses show that zzso zzso zzso at multiple zzso zzso zzso confirms indirect zzso suggesting that zzso degrades zzso zzso Moreover, zzso added zzso blocks zzso zzso In zzso we interpret these results as consistent with the possibility that the zzso zzso is induced by zzso zzso which can lead to zzso degradation and zzso of zzso zzso
