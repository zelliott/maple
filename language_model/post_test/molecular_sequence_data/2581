A zzso zzso zzso was constructed by inserting the zzso and the zzso repeats of zzso virus 40 zzso into the zzso virus zzso regulatory region on the late side of the zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso DNA was able to replicate very well in human fetal zzso cells, deletions were found in sequences of the regulatory zzso DNA sequence analysis of a selected clone indicated a zzso deletion from the original construction that retained the sequences for the zzso replication origin, 78 zzso of one zzso zzso 33 zzso of one zzso zzso zzso and one intact zzso zzso Of significant interest was that this zzso demonstrated an extended species and zzso host range, producing infectious virus in human fetal brain and embryonic kidney as well as in zzso monkey fetal and adult zzso zzso However, the species host range was not extended beyond zzso cells since the zzso zzso was unable to multiply in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the viral zzso transcripts from either kidney or zzso cells indicated that the major start sites for early zzso mapped within the zzso sequences of the regulatory region and major start sites for late zzso mapped within the zzso and zzso zzso This extension of the zzso virus host range was most likely attributable to changes in the regulatory region and not the viral T protein since a zzso DNA clone which placed the coding sequences for the zzso zzso T protein subject to regulation by the deleted zzso regulatory region showed a similar extension of host zzso
