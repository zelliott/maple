zzso zzso required for the synthesis of zzso in an zzso coli strain was zzso as a large molecular weight complex with zzso The complex zzso in a zzso zzso at an s value greater than zzso The zzso protein species zzso with reverse zzso activity in the complex had a molecular weight estimated at zzso which is close to the expected size of zzso for the zzso zzso In addition, the large complex also contained zzso The zzso complex was able to zzso zzso using 5 S zzso as a template zzso to a synthetic DNA zzso and a zzso DNA using a synthetic DNA template zzso to a synthetic DNA zzso When zzso was used as a natural zzso the zzso complex produced two major zzso a zzso zzso DNA by extending the 3' end of zzso using zzso as a template, and a zzso zzso DNA product resulting from the converse reaction in which the 3' end of zzso is extended using zzso as a zzso The results suggest that bacterial reverse zzso is capable of producing zzso zzso and possibly zzso DNA as zzso zzso implications of these findings on the biology of the zzso system are zzso
