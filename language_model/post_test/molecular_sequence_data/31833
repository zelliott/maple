In this study, we report the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of freshwater prawn zzso zzso identified from the constructed zzso library by zzso zzso zzso Even though, zzso have sequence zzso they differ extensively in their zzso specificity and are thought to play an important in variety of functions such as development, tissue differentiation and immune responses zzso Gene expression studies show that zzso is widely distributed in the zzso such as heart, muscle, zzso brain, zzso but higher amounts are found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso relative expression in zzso before and after infected with white spot syndrome zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that the gene expression initially increases up to 24 h and then it falls zzso zzso zzso results showed that the zzso zzso is involved in the rapid assembly of a specific, plasma zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso contains a typical zzso domain between 323 and zzso and two putative zzso motifs at zzso and zzso The predicted zzso model of zzso contains zzso coils zzso zzso acid zzso zzso extended strand zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta turns (35 zzso zzso analysis of zzso exhibited high sequence similarities with other zzso zzso with the highest observed in white shrimp zzso Moreover, the zzso analysis also showed that zzso clustered with the other members of zzso zzso Overall, these results suggested that zzso is a major and functional zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and also in spread of zzso
