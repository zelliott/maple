zzso is one of four zzso zzso information zzso proteins required for zzso the cryptic zzso locus zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso A zzso interaction with zzso the largest zzso of the origin recognition complex zzso is critical for zzso ability to bind zzso and function in the formation of silent zzso Here we show that a discrete domain within zzso the zzso interaction region zzso was necessary and sufficient for a zzso zzso The zzso contains the originally defined zzso zzso region as well as additional zzso zzso In addition, a zzso interaction required a larger region of zzso that included the zzso zzso acid zzso causing defects in either a zzso or a zzso interaction reduced zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso in zzso These data support a model in which zzso association with zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso interactions requiring a common zzso domain, and they indicate that a zzso interaction is restricted to zzso at least in part, through interactions with zzso
