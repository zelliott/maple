The zzso sense of smell is governed by the largest gene family, which encodes the zzso receptors zzso The gain and loss of OR genes is typically correlated with adaptations to various ecological zzso Modern humans have zzso OR genes but zzso of these have lost their zzso Here we show evidence of additional OR loss of function in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso using comparative zzso zzso Ten zzso and 8 zzso zzso show evidence of loss of function that differ from the reference modern human OR zzso Some of these losses are also present in a subset of modern humans, while some are unique to each zzso zzso changes in the zzso of zzso suggest different sensory arrangements to that of modern zzso We identify differences in functional zzso zzso genes among modern humans, zzso and zzso suggesting varied loss of function across all three zzso and we highlight the utility of using zzso information to zzso the sensory niches of extinct zzso
