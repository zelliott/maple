A region of DNA 6 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso structural genes and directly downstream of the zzso gene of zzso zzso was shown by zzso analysis to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso of this region revealed two complete open reading zzso and the zzso zzso of a third zzso They zzso proteins with zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso from other zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso that contains the two zzso motifs characteristic of other zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso portion of zzso which encodes the first 35 zzso upon combining with the previously reported zzso of zzso designated zzso (Van zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso studies on a zzso zzso defective strain of zzso zzso containing a polar zzso in the zzso zzso revealed that the products of the zzso zzso C, D, E genes are required for zzso zzso Evidence is also presented that the zzso genes are zzso from a large zzso together with the downstream genes zzso making a zzso message of 11 zzso
