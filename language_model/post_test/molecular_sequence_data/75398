Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of unusual large size in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso regions of the zzso transcribed from 3 zzso and 2 zzso zzso genes previously described are much longer than in the zzso zzso zzso which represent a major class in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cellulose zzso of zzso isolated at different zzso stages indicates that more than zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso A putative zzso signal is present in all five genes 17 to 27 zzso before the zzso of the zzso
