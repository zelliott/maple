zzso zzso of zzso mechanisms in the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso was investigated in rabbit zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of an initial rapid zzso contraction and a zzso contraction slowly fading to a sustained zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso contraction of rabbit isolated zzso zzso The zzso value was zzso zzso and the maximum zzso of the contraction was zzso of the response induced by zzso zzso 100 zzso Neither zzso nor zzso changed the zzso value or the maximum zzso of the response to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso decreased the zzso and accelerated fading of the zzso contraction produced by zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso induced an increase of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso increase of zzso was prevented by removal of external zzso or by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso also zzso the release of zzso at a similar zzso to that seen with zzso zzso zzso with zzso (3 zzso for 20 zzso decreased zzso and the zzso zzso release of zzso but did not alter the high zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso stimulate the release of zzso from enteric zzso through the same zzso and that the release of zzso plays a role in zzso components of contraction in the rabbit zzso
