zzso zzso zzso provides an alternative to zzso zzso for zzso proteins to the cell surface in zzso zzso anchors are zzso in the zzso zzso via the sequential addition of zzso fatty zzso and zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso lead to embryonic zzso in animals and to conditional zzso in zzso microbes by blocking cell growth, cell division, or zzso We report the genetic and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso of two zzso proteins involved in the first step of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically block male transmission and zzso zzso This results from reduced zzso zzso and tube growth, which are associated with abnormal zzso zzso This finding suggests an essential role for zzso anchor zzso in zzso tube wall deposition or zzso Using zzso and zzso approaches, we identified 47 genes that zzso potential zzso proteins that are expressed in zzso and demonstrated that at least 11 of these proteins are associated with zzso zzso by zzso zzso Many of the identified candidate proteins are zzso with proteins involved in cell wall synthesis and zzso or zzso signaling and zzso and they likely play important roles in the establishment and maintenance of polarized zzso tube zzso
