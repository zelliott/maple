zzso immature zzso require protein synthesis for zzso zzso thus the importance of zzso zzso zzso in their zzso arrest remains zzso We examined the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso arrest of zzso zzso with a special focus on zzso an zzso zzso family member recently reported in mouse zzso We cloned a zzso zzso of pig by zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso immature zzso by the injection of zzso zzso almost completely blocked the zzso zzso breakdown zzso under the low zzso zzso which could not block their spontaneous zzso resumption by zzso The zzso zzso and zzso B synthesis were inhibited in these zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by the injection of specific zzso zzso induced zzso in the zzso the spontaneous zzso resumption of which was blocked by the high concentration of zzso zzso In these zzso the zzso activity was elevated and zzso B was zzso zzso of zzso another zzso family member, could not induce the zzso under the same zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso blocked the zzso even in the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso which is zzso by zzso but not zzso is involved in the zzso arrest of zzso zzso and that the zzso of zzso in combination with the zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to the active zzso and starts the zzso B zzso zzso by a further increase of zzso and zzso zzso
