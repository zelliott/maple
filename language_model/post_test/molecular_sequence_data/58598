We have isolated a zzso clone from a human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso library which codes for a functional type 1 zzso zzso An zzso product obtained from guinea pig kidney zzso using zzso specific for the guinea pig zzso zzso zzso was used to screen the zzso zzso The zzso zzso predicts a protein of 223 zzso acids with a single putative zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence exhibits zzso identity with the guinea pig zzso zzso When functionally expressed in zzso cells, the zzso zzso enhances the binding of zzso a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso cell zzso The inhibitor specificity of the cloned zzso indicates that it is the type 1 zzso zzso Several human zzso including zzso liver, and brain, and several human cell lines express the zzso zzso zzso zzso to a variable zzso
