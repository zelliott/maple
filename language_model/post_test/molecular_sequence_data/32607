zzso zzso is a human pathogen with a broad distribution in Latin zzso The fungus is zzso zzso with two distinct forms corresponding to completely different zzso Upon zzso of the temperature to that of the zzso body, the fungus adopts a zzso form that is exclusively associated with its zzso zzso We describe expressed sequence tags zzso analysis to assess the expression profile of the zzso to zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso zzso expressed sequences during conversion we performed a large-scale comparative analysis between zzso zzso zzso identified in the transition zzso and zzso 

Our analysis was based on zzso zzso from a transition zzso library of zzso zzso A total of zzso consensus sequences were zzso Genes of primary zzso energy, protein synthesis and fate, cellular zzso zzso of cellular components were represented in the transition zzso zzso A considerable number of genes zzso had not been previously reported for zzso zzso in public zzso Gene expression analysis using in zzso zzso zzso revealed that numerous genes were more expressed during the transition phase when compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expressed sequences were selected for further analysis zzso genes related to the zzso of the cell zzso Thirty four genes from this family were zzso Ten genes related to signal zzso were zzso Twelve genes zzso putative zzso factors zzso increased zzso The in zzso approach was validated by northern zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso program of zzso zzso is characterized by significant differential positive zzso of the cell zzso related zzso and signal zzso zzso suggesting the related processes important contributors to zzso Also, putative zzso factors are more expressed in the transition process suggesting adaptation to the host of the zzso incoming zzso zzso Those genes provide ideal candidates for further studies directed at understanding zzso zzso and its zzso
