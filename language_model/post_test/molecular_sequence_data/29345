The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso zzso which contains a zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso The solution structure of the zzso domain shows a typical zzso fold, but it exists in two zzso due to zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso zzso where zzso is replaced by zzso reveals that the zzso region is inserted into the zzso and binds to its own zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso specifically binds to the trans form of the zzso zzso domain of zzso The surface of zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso zzso zzso was zzso by chemical shift mapping experiments using zzso The surface does not involve the zzso region but involves the region zzso the zzso loop, the zzso and the zzso zzso This surface is located opposite to the zzso containing region, consistent with that of our previous zzso zzso
