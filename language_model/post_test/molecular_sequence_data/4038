zzso a zzso natural product of the zzso family, is produced by zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso which target DNA zzso I or II, have already entered clinical trials as zzso zzso Using as a probe an internal zzso of zzso a zzso zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso we isolated a DNA region that directed the zzso of zzso when introduced into zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed genes for zzso core formation, zzso zzso and sugar zzso as well as a regulatory gene and two zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso of these genes resulted in production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cloned genes should help to zzso the molecular basis for zzso zzso and set the stage for the generation of novel zzso zzso by genetic zzso
