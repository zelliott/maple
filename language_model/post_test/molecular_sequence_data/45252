Four distinct zzso zzso zzso bands were extracted from leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at the leaf edge in zzso zzso viral particles of zzso zzso in diameter contained zzso segments with the same number and mobility as these extracted directly from zzso zzso The two major zzso zzso namely zzso 1 and zzso 2, were 1866 and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Computer analysis predicted that they both contained a single open reading frame zzso on their zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso dependent zzso zzso and a zzso protein similar to that zzso by members of the family zzso In addition, both zzso 1 and zzso 2 were highly zzso at the zzso untranslated regions zzso and had an zzso rich stretch at the 3' zzso with an identical terminal motif zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the two major zzso segments constitute the zzso of a zzso infecting zzso
