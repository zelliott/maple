We present an overview of the gene content and organization of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso with an A + T content of zzso The identified genes include those for two zzso zzso zzso and zzso 18 zzso ten zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso 2, 3, 4, zzso 5, 6, 7, 9 and zzso zzso b zzso three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso four zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso 6, 8 and zzso 15 zzso zzso and five other zzso excluding zzso zzso zzso features of zzso zzso zzso include the zzso zzso All genes are zzso on the same strand of the DNA and a universal genetic code is zzso zzso The zzso gene has no termination zzso and is fused to the downstream zzso zzso The 13 genes for zzso proteins and four zzso genes form a cluster zzso zzso long with several gene zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso in the zzso is not sufficient to support the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso In total, five group I zzso reside in zzso and zzso and three of those in zzso contain four zzso zzso We compare the zzso to other zzso zzso zzso particularly that of zzso zzso
