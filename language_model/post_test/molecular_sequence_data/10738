A zzso sequence zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a set of human brain frontal lobe expressed sequence zzso The zzso zzso predicts a single open reading frame coding for a zzso protein with seven zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was mapped to zzso zzso and it was isolated upon screening of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene spans more than 25 zzso and contains two zzso and a single zzso which interrupts the zzso zzso within the sequence zzso the presumed third zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis with zzso zzso revealed a main zzso zzso and a less abundant zzso zzso both expressed in human brain zzso particularly in corpus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The lowest level of expression was detected in zzso The zzso zzso is also less abundantly expressed in liver and zzso Although the zzso for the putative zzso zzso has not been identified, its deduced zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso with most zzso zzso zzso receptors and particularly with the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso
