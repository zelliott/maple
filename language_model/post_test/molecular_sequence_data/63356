When 10 strains of zzso acid bacteria were incubated with zzso zzso a precursor of zzso seven of them converted zzso to zzso the same reaction is found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso These bacteria had a zzso that zzso the reaction from zzso to zzso zzso which was so unstable that it was easily converted to zzso The zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was 100 zzso on gel zzso zzso and 33 zzso on zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso was cloned and zzso The deduced protein consisted of zzso zzso zzso and its estimated molecular mass was zzso in agreement with that by time of flight mass zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequence showed about 50% identity to those reported for alcohol zzso from zzso zzso or zzso zzso the commercially available alcohol zzso from zzso zzso did not convert zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed about zzso identity in zzso acid sequence with the zzso and also with these two alcohol zzso
