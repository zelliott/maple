The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene that encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso library and zzso The zzso sequence contains a zzso zzso open reading frame coding for a protein of 222 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is highly zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A multiple sequence alignment revealed highly zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso The zzso protein was further confirmed by an zzso zzso
