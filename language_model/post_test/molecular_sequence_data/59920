zzso DNA amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso was detected by zzso zzso acid zzso using a zzso 2000 zzso based on surface zzso resonance zzso zzso is an artificial zzso zzso that is capable of forming highly stable complexes with complementary zzso We succeeded in the direct detection of zzso DNA, amplified by zzso with zzso zzso It was shown that the target DNA was available for detection over the range of zzso zzso zzso the detection limit was zzso zzso of the target DNA zzso zzso applied volume 30 zzso Our DNA detection system, the combination of zzso and the probe zzso could detect the target DNA with good zzso In this report, we show that our system is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of zzso significant zzso
