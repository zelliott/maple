The main aim of this work was the identification of genetic zzso involved in zzso production by strain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso besides zzso zzso The zzso was observed to be a zzso high molecular weight zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso which had lost its ability to produce the zzso The zzso zzso responsibility for the above zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso An zzso DNA fragment, corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was also cloned from the zzso strain, and its introduction into the zzso zzso the zzso Moreover, that zzso enabled zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a strain not previously capable of doing zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that zzso zzso occurred in the zzso within a large zzso zzso a protein which showed similarity with proteins from the zzso zzso The DNA region including that zzso showed features which have been considered typical of the zzso genetic elements previously identified in other bacteria but whose function is as yet zzso The results of this study for the first time identify an zzso element in zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the first time indicate that an zzso element is involved in zzso production, also suggesting this possible function for zzso genetic elements previously characterized in other zzso
