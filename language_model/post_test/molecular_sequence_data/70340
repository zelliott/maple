We have isolated and characterized zzso and zzso clones containing the mouse zzso C1 zzso zzso The zzso gene is part of the zzso gene cluster and is located zzso zzso 3' of the zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene spans a region of approximately zzso zzso and consists of four zzso The zzso structure is similar to those of human and zzso zzso although in mouse zzso 2 and 3 are zzso zzso sequence zzso is found between man and mouse in the promoter and zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso and primer extension analysis of mouse zzso showed that a major transcript 409 zzso in size is expressed primarily in fetal and adult zzso The mouse zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso a protein of 88 zzso zzso including a signal zzso of 26 zzso acid zzso Comparisons of the deduced zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso with the human, zzso zzso and dog sequences showed discrete regions with a high degree of zzso The zzso of the sequence and structural organization of the mouse zzso gene is an essential step in enhancing the use of mouse models to study the function of zzso in the zzso zzso
