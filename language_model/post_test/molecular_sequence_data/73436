A critical role of the zzso zzso zzso protein of human zzso type 5 during productive infection is to zzso expression of all early viral zzso zzso within and zzso to zzso region 3 zzso promote expression of these viral genes through interactions with a variety of zzso factors requiring the zinc binding motif in zzso and in some cases a region at the zzso end of zzso including zzso 183 to zzso It is known that zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces the level of zzso of the zzso zzso protein through the zzso of protein zzso 2A by the zzso zzso This study was designed to identify the zzso zzso sites affected by zzso expression and to determine their importance in regulation of zzso zzso We report here that two previously unidentified sites at zzso and zzso are the targets for decreased zzso in response to zzso At least one of these sites, presumably zzso is zzso in zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and both are zzso in cells which express a zzso active form of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso activity indicated that elevated zzso at these sites increased expression of the zzso promoter but not that of zzso We have recently shown that one or more zzso products induce cell death due to zzso zzso and thus it seems likely that one role of the zzso protein is to limit production of toxic zzso products by limiting expression of the zzso zzso
