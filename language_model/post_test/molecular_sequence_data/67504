Common to all zzso zzso and zzso is a remarkable zzso the zzso or zzso carrier protein zzso These take the form of small individual proteins in type II systems or discrete folded zzso in the zzso type I systems and are characterized by a fold consisting of three major zzso and between zzso zzso zzso This protein is central to these zzso systems and it must bind and transport a wide variety of zzso zzso as well as mediate numerous zzso zzso all of which contribute to efficient zzso zzso This review covers the structural and zzso characterization of carrier zzso as well as assessing their interactions with different zzso and other zzso zzso Finally, their role as an emerging tool in biotechnology is zzso
