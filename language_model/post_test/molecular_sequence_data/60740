In this report, we present the identification of the main zzso that are extracted from zzso cell walls of a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain by reducing zzso Treatment of the zzso cell walls of this strain with zzso releases several zzso of which three, with apparent sizes of zzso 45, and 40 zzso are the most zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences revealed that the zzso zzso is zzso the zzso involved in the so-called barrier activity in zzso cells, and that the zzso and zzso zzso are the zzso and zzso forms of the gene product of open reading frame zzso zzso an zzso that belongs to the zzso zzso with internal zzso family of zzso composed thus far of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have named this gene zzso and zzso denotes the zzso zzso form of the zzso We have characterized zzso and have shown the feasibility of using it as a fusion partner for the targeting of zzso proteins to the cell zzso
