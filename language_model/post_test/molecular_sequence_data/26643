zzso zzso zzso widely distributed zzso zzso are mainly involved in zzso and zzso pathways of zzso compounds and the zzso of zzso in zzso Moreover, these zzso exhibit zzso activity, therefore they may be involved in protecting organisms against the toxicity of zzso oxygen species zzso In the present study, we cloned a zzso zzso the Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso was zzso zzso long and zzso a zzso zzso acids zzso which shared high sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso DNA zzso a zzso region consisting of zzso zzso was zzso and some putative zzso factor binding sites were zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso revealed that the level of zzso was higher in the zzso than in other zzso and zzso was expressed in all stages with the highest level in zzso adult worker zzso Moreover, the expression patterns under zzso stress indicated that zzso zzso was significantly influenced by external factors, such as temperature challenges, ultraviolet zzso light, and zzso zzso zzso was regulated zzso in response to zzso stress and may be involved in protecting zzso from zzso zzso
