zzso streak virus strain A zzso the zzso agent of zzso streak disease, is today one of the most serious zzso threats to African food zzso zzso where zzso originated and how it spread zzso could yield valuable insights into its historical emergence as a crop zzso Similarly, determining where the major extant zzso lineages arose could identify geographical hot spots of zzso zzso Here, we use zzso zzso analyses of 353 fully zzso zzso zzso to reconstruct a plausible history of zzso movements over the past 150 zzso We show that since the probable emergence of zzso in southern Africa around zzso the virus spread zzso at an average rate of zzso zzso zzso highest probability density zzso zzso to zzso zzso Using distinctive patterns of zzso variation caused by 20 unique zzso zzso events, we tentatively classified the zzso zzso into 24 easily discernible zzso Despite many of these lineages displaying distinct geographical zzso it is apparent that almost all have emerged within the past 4 decades from either southern or zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that regular analysis of zzso zzso within these diversification hot spots could be used to monitor the emergence of future zzso lineages that could affect zzso zzso in zzso
