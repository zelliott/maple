A portion of the zzso gene from 11 zzso species belonging to the families zzso and zzso was amplified by a zzso chain zzso zzso 460 zzso corresponding to the third zzso the third zzso and the fourth zzso were successfully zzso zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to the third and fourth zzso were the most zzso whereas sequences corresponding to the third zzso were zzso only between species belonging to the same zzso We also analyzed differences of substitution rates among zzso positions and between synonymous and zzso zzso zzso trees were constructed using the entire zzso zzso the first and second zzso positions, zzso sites, zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequences in the zzso by the zzso zzso These trees supported the zzso of the families zzso and zzso as well as the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
