The zzso gene of zzso coli was cut into two approximately zzso fragments with zzso II and zzso individually or together under separate zzso zzso in zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso zzso is expressed in two zzso zzso the zzso portion (the N zzso the first six putative zzso zzso and most of putative loop 7) and zzso the zzso portion (the last six putative zzso zzso and the C zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso both fragments transport zzso at about zzso the rate of cells expressing intact zzso to a comparable zzso level of zzso In contrast, cells expressing either half of the zzso independently do not transport zzso As judged by zzso labeling and zzso intact zzso is completely absent from the membrane of cells expressing zzso fragments either individually or zzso Thus, transport activity must result from an association between independently zzso pieces of zzso zzso When the gene fragments are expressed individually, the zzso portion of the zzso is observed inconsistently, and the zzso portion is not zzso When the gene fragments are expressed together, zzso identified as the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso are found in the zzso It is concluded that the zzso or zzso halves of zzso zzso are zzso when zzso independently and that association between the two zzso zzso leads to a more stable, zzso active zzso
