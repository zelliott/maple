zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso is found in a restricted part of South East Asia, including Hong Kong, zzso and zzso We determined the full length coding sequence of a type zzso isolate zzso obtained from a Hong Kong blood zzso The sequence of zzso contained a single open reading frame coding for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso within the range of zzso to zzso for other zzso zzso The full length sequence of zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence divergence from zzso zzso but only zzso zzso zzso zzso divergence from zzso zzso zzso These similarity values were intermediate between those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso zzso The close evolutionary relationship of zzso with zzso was further indicated by their grouping together by zzso zzso
