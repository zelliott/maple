The zzso from Lens zzso zzso has a binding specificity for zzso bearing zzso zzso on the reducing zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore provides an excellent example of a zzso binding protein in which zzso interactions are dependent on the integrity of the zzso core zzso We report here the synthesis of the zzso zzso of Gal beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso and its subsequent zzso and zzso The zzso zzso when bound to a zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to bind to both zzso A zzso and lentil zzso affinity zzso In contrast, synthesis of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and subsequent binding to zzso afforded zzso to a zzso affinity column but not to a lentil zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso also bound to plastic zzso plates containing the zzso zzso zzso No binding occurred when the zzso zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest the zzso zzso of zzso may have general utility as an intermediate in the synthesis of novel zzso zzso
