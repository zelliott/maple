We have determined the zzso sequences of two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso organization of these zzso is almost identical with the notable exception of the tail fiber genes that zzso the different host zzso The two zzso have zzso extensively at the zzso level but they are still more closely related to each other than either is to any other zzso currently zzso The zzso and zzso zzso contain, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with 174 zzso and 234 zzso direct terminal zzso About half of the 105 putative open reading frames in the two zzso combined show no significant similarity to database proteins with a known or predicted function that is obviously beneficial for growth of a zzso The overall zzso organization of zzso and zzso is comparable to that of the zzso group of zzso although the specific order of genes coding for DNA metabolism functions has not been zzso Low levels of zzso similarity between zzso in the zzso and zzso groups suggest that they zzso a long time ago but, on the basis of this conservation of zzso organization, they are expected to have retained similar zzso zzso
