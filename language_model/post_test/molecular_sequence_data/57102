A zzso zzso human liver zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library by screening with a rat liver zzso zzso The zzso zzso base zzso contains an open reading frame zzso 337 zzso zzso corresponding to a protein with an estimated molecular weight of zzso Its primary sequence is highly zzso to that of the pig kidney and rat liver zzso The human liver zzso was used to construct a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and the zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso 50% of the expressed human zzso was soluble and zzso active, and the zzso was zzso to zzso by heat treatment, ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso human liver zzso had a specific activity zzso zzso of zzso that was half that of the rat liver zzso but had an identical zzso for zzso However, the human zzso was more sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso than the rat liver form zzso zzso Ki zzso 4 zzso zzso Ki zzso 40 zzso zzso analyses have suggested that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso located in a zzso charged pocket that binds zzso metal zzso These zzso were zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso The zzso and zzso zzso had zzso and zzso lower zzso values than the zzso zzso respectively, consistent with their critical role in zzso zzso
