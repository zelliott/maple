The gene zzso the high output zzso of zzso oxide zzso represents a large class of alarm and defense genes zzso induced in response to bacterial zzso zzso The promoters of most of these genes contain at least two zzso zzso one of which commonly binds zzso factors of the zzso zzso Here a novel zzso element is identified in the zzso zzso oxide zzso promoter, termed zzso which contains critical zzso zzso lying zzso base pairs downstream of the zzso zzso binding element zzso Both zzso and zzso are required for zzso promoter zzso A protein partially recognized by zzso against zzso factor zzso binds to the zzso element zzso in zzso zzso while contributing to a zzso complex that includes zzso zzso in zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso proteins may together recruit an zzso zzso of zzso
