zzso zzso consists of H gamma I (or zzso of 34 zzso and H gamma II of 32 zzso which zzso lyse human zzso Our previous data showed that the zzso zzso segment of H gamma II is the essential region for the H gamma II function zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 59, zzso zzso To identify the minimum zzso acid zzso in the zzso segment responsible for the specific zzso activity, a series of zzso genes were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso and zzso for their zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso segment zzso of H gamma II is the minimum region essential for the H gamma II zzso
