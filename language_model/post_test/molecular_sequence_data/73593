zzso can be remarkably tolerant of major zzso zzso Sites that zzso large insertions without loss of function zzso zzso appear generally to zzso to surface regions at which the added sequences do not disrupt overall zzso The identification of such sites can aid in the engineering of functional derivatives of a protein with novel zzso To screen for zzso sites, we developed a simple zzso procedure for generating zzso insertions in cloned zzso In a first step, a zzso or alkaline zzso gene fusion is generated by zzso of a zzso zzso into the target zzso zzso zzso or alkaline zzso activity fixes the zzso reading frame of the zzso relative to the target zzso In a second step, most of the zzso sequences are excised in zzso leaving the zzso zzso zzso may be targeted either to zzso or exported protein zzso and the inserted sequence acts as an zzso in a variety of zzso As a test case, a set of zzso insertions in the zzso coli zzso zzso gene was zzso The zzso transport activities of the zzso proteins followed a simple zzso most of the proteins zzso with insertions in sequences thought to face the zzso or zzso were at least partially active, whereas all proteins zzso with insertions in zzso sequences were zzso The only exceptions were two inactive proteins with insertions in the third zzso zzso Most of the inactive proteins were detected at reduced levels in cells, presumably due to zzso zzso These studies thus illustrate the use of the new method to identify zzso sites and help document the remarkable sequence flexibility of many of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition to screening for zzso sites, zzso zzso zzso may be useful in zzso proteins at multiple internal positions, in analyzing membrane protein zzso and in zzso zzso relationships in zzso
