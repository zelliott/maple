zzso f I is a major zzso zzso zzso zzso and a member of the zzso family of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso f I gene was determined by sequencing zzso chain reaction products amplified from zzso zzso spore zzso The entire zzso DNA includes an zzso leader zzso preceding the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso open reading frame, zzso a zzso acid protein zzso zzso which is zzso zzso to zzso from zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used to compare zzso f I levels in spores, zzso and culture zzso and to determine the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or spore extracts had a zzso lower level of zzso f I than culture zzso suggesting that zzso of spores and growth of the fungus are essential for zzso zzso zzso f I levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso peaked at day 3 zzso to zzso zzso however, the zzso was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cultures zzso zzso zzso on either days 3 or zzso Northern analysis confirmed that zzso f I zzso was detected only in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in the other four zzso zzso zzso f zzso DNA was generated after zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso DNA obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not from the other zzso zzso The results show that zzso f I is selectively expressed in zzso zzso and suggest that this zzso could be a specific zzso factor for zzso zzso
