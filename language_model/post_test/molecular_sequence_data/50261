zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes by zzso zzso III requires two sequence elements in the zzso promoter zzso the zzso zzso sequence element, found in zzso promoters transcribed by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso element zzso in many zzso zzso The locations of the zzso and the zzso box are important zzso for zzso start site selection in their respective zzso zzso II zzso In zzso zzso genes the zzso and the zzso elements are located in approximately the same positions as in the zzso II transcribed zzso but their respective roles in initiation site selection are zzso We have analyzed the effects of spacing changes between the zzso and the zzso element, and between the two elements and the normal zzso start site on human zzso gene zzso The spacing requirement between the two elements is highly zzso zzso a possible interaction between the factors that bind zzso Our results discount the possibility that the location of either the zzso or the zzso element, by itself, dictates efficient selection of a zzso start zzso Instead, we suggest that the two elements form a compound promoter element whose location dictates the start site of zzso from the human zzso gene zzso
