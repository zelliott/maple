zzso zzso processing of zzso and zzso hormone precursors by members of the zzso family of zzso is key to determining both the identities and activities of signaling zzso Here we identify zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso processing zzso zzso and show that in contrast to zzso zzso zzso expression zzso extensive regulation in the nervous system during zzso In zzso zzso reveals that expression of zzso is restricted to the final stages of zzso when it is found in anterior sensory structures and in only zzso cells in the brain and zzso nerve zzso After larvae hatch from their egg shells, the sensory structures and most cells in the zzso turn off or substantially reduce zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a specific role late in zzso zzso lacking the zzso region containing zzso show no gross anatomical defects and respond to zzso However, such larvae show a greatly reduced frequency of a zzso behavior of zzso zzso in which larvae swing their heads, scraping through the eggshell with their mouth zzso zzso expression of zzso can restore near zzso levels of this behavior, whereas expression of zzso with an zzso substitution for the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso expression is regulated as part of a programmed zzso of neural signaling that controls zzso behavior by producing specific zzso in particular zzso at an appropriate zzso zzso
