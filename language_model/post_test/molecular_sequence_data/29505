We examined the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso throughout pregnancy and zzso zzso gene expression was zzso by real-time reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction in zzso zzso from zzso at 15, 80, zzso zzso or 141 d of pregnancy and at 0 (30 zzso after zzso 3, 48, or 70 d of zzso zzso zzso level was high at the beginning (the first 80 zzso and at the end of pregnancy and was lower at zzso and throughout zzso Furthermore, during these periods of zzso zzso zzso the location of zzso zzso as determined by zzso analysis, changed within zzso zzso It was located in zzso cells during early stages of pregnancy, in zzso cells after full cell differentiation just before zzso and in zzso cells after zzso These data, compared with published data on zzso zzso gene zzso provide evidence that zzso could be produced by different cell types of the zzso zzso and could act as a zzso factor on zzso cell growth and differentiation via zzso cells and zzso cell zzso
