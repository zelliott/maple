The zzso complex of the zzso belonging to the zzso zzso is believed to be critically involved in the events leading to host cell zzso The characterization of the components of this zzso structure is therefore an important step towards understanding how these zzso achieve host cell zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso on a zzso protein band of approximately 40 zzso following zzso extraction of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso yielded an zzso fraction which, by zzso stained predominantly the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso Following zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library, the respective full length zzso sequence was zzso This sequence was found to zzso a protein of 362 zzso zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso This protein is zzso by a single copy gene which produces a transcript of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that it contains a zzso putative signal zzso sequence and two potential membrane spanning zzso Four consecutive zzso growth factor like zzso were identified, as well a zzso sequence motif for binding of zzso zzso The full length zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso coli, and zzso affinity zzso on this protein zzso exclusively a 38 zzso band on zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, specific labeling of a 45 zzso band in zzso zzso zzso extracts was zzso By zzso these zzso stained predominantly the zzso portion of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but the protein was absent from the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso embedded zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of predominantly the zzso located zzso as well as of dense zzso located at the zzso end of the zzso As evidenced by zzso this zzso zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart in zzso appeared to be expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso
