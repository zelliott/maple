While zzso zzso acids zzso are not seen in the structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso complex E1 zzso zzso mass zzso analysis indicated that this zzso region of zzso was protected by zzso zzso five deletion zzso of zzso were created, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along with zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and the ability of zzso to zzso are not affected by any of the deletions or zzso While zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso could form a complex with zzso and produced zzso in the overall zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed in both zzso zzso all zzso of zzso from zzso coli, as well as zzso from zzso zzso could carry out reductive zzso of the zzso coli zzso domain, but only zzso of the zzso coli zzso could zzso zzso zzso coli zzso It was concluded that there are at least two zzso of interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and the zzso of zzso as reflected by the ability to zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso with regions of zzso (so far undefined for the zzso coli zzso as reflected by the overall activity of the entire zzso These studies add important information regarding recognition within this zzso complex class with an zzso E1 zzso
