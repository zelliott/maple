Blood samples from 655 zzso birds were collected in zzso of Ghana and Cameroon and examined both by zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The overall prevalence of zzso zzso was zzso as determined by combining the results of both these diagnostic zzso In comparison to zzso zzso microscopic examination of blood films was more sensitive in determining simultaneous infection of zzso zzso but both detection methods showed similar trends of prevalence of malaria zzso in the same study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the olive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are described based on the zzso of their blood stages and a segment of the zzso zzso b zzso b) zzso which can be used for molecular identification and diagnosis of these zzso Illustrations of blood stages of new species are given, and zzso analysis identifies DNA lineages closely related to these zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with small zzso zzso clearly predominate in African zzso It is probable that the development of such zzso is a characteristic feature of evolution of zzso zzso in African rainforest zzso zzso zzso of avian zzso zzso is discussed based on the recent molecular zzso of these zzso It is concluded that a zzso zzso is needed before revising the current zzso zzso of zzso We supported a hypothesis by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2007), according to which, zzso species with a genetic differentiation of over zzso in zzso zzso b gene are expected to be zzso zzso This study zzso the importance of employing both zzso and microscopic methods in zzso ecological and evolutionary investigations of avian zzso zzso
