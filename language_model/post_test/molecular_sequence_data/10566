zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso are able to enter the sexual zzso and to form fertile zzso zzso To analyze the molecular basis of zzso and to zzso the role of zzso during zzso body development, we cloned and zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso locus with zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that sequences from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso region allowed the identification of four open reading frames zzso which were termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso While zzso zzso and zzso show strong sequence similarities with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso It comprises sequences that are similar to the A and a zzso zzso from zzso zzso To determine functionality of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that all zzso are zzso zzso Furthermore, we transformed the zzso zzso zzso genes into zzso and zzso strains of the closely related zzso fungus zzso zzso The transformation experiments show that zzso genes from zzso zzso induce zzso body formation in zzso zzso
