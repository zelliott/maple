This work is part of the effort for sequencing zzso XIV of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso insert derived from a partial zzso zzso of the zzso cloned into the zzso site of the zzso zzso The strategy used for sequencing is based on the fragmentation of the whole zzso by zzso followed by shotgun sequencing on an zzso zzso DNA zzso The clones with zzso corresponding to the zzso were identified by zzso zzso without the need of zzso The analysis of the DNA sequence reveals 29 open reading frames zzso longer than 300 zzso Nine zzso are internal to some other zzso zzso searches against DNA and protein data banks show that six zzso zzso to already known zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso matches the sequence of a putative zzso gene zzso
