The nuclear envelope is a dynamic structure that completely zzso in response to zzso activity in zzso A key feature of this process is the zzso of the major structural proteins of the zzso the nuclear zzso A, B, and zzso Two highly zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso A and zzso are zzso positioned 5 zzso acids from the ends of the large zzso domain and are shown in the accompanying paper by Ward and zzso to be among four sites zzso during nuclear envelope zzso zzso in zzso and zzso that prevent zzso at these sites block the zzso of the nuclear zzso during zzso We propose a model for the regulation of zzso assembly in which zzso just outside the ends of the zzso domain controls the assembly dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso
