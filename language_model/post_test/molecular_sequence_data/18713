zzso is a small zzso that regulates zzso zzso It has been zzso to zzso and the zzso target of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso Since the zzso membrane component zzso protein light chain 3 zzso is derived from zzso we investigated the impact of zzso on the formation of zzso zzso their zzso with zzso and zzso and the retention of zzso during zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso exhibited minimal baseline zzso with zzso which was enhanced zzso upon zzso or zzso upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso was increased zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoted the zzso of zzso with zzso upon zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso had reduced zzso with zzso and zzso upon zzso but not zzso zzso A zzso active zzso zzso showed diminished zzso with zzso but promoted the zzso of zzso with zzso upon zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed diminished zzso with zzso but increased zzso to zzso A newly discovered zzso truncated native zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso to zzso and zzso without zzso or zzso zzso zzso increased the formation of zzso zzso in resting cells, while other zzso promoted zzso formation upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoted the zzso of zzso during zzso The specificity of zzso zzso zzso is indicated by its zzso by zzso zzso zzso The formation of interconnected zzso zzso networks was markedly enhanced by zzso upon zzso which may contribute to the retention of zzso during zzso The present study thus indicates that zzso regulates zzso through promoting the formation of zzso zzso and the preservation of zzso
