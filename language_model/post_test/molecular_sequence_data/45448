The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in controlling entrance into zzso A major function attributed to zzso is the induction of zzso zzso We show here that the founder zzso zzso zzso zzso is larger than previously reported, and that the full-length protein zzso the structural hallmarks of zzso Even though zzso bears two classical nuclear zzso signals zzso the zzso protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of various zzso zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso bears zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso of zzso resulted in abnormal zzso zzso with the DNA mainly confined to the periphery of the zzso Advanced zzso zzso was associated with nuclear pore complex zzso The zzso was not accompanied by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso A similar zzso has been described following zzso zzso strengthening the notion that the zzso zzso zzso has functional similarity to zzso
