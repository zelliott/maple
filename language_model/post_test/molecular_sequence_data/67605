The zzso zzso zzso genes are necessary for normal flower development in diverse zzso zzso To understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying floral initiation and development in zzso an early divergent zzso family consisting of large zzso trees, we isolated a zzso of zzso zzso and its promoter from London plane zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso a predicted zzso of 374 zzso acids and zzso of 54 and zzso zzso The putative zzso protein showed a high degree of identity zzso with zzso zzso from other species, including two highly zzso regions, the N and C zzso and a less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was expressed mainly in male zzso from May of the first year to March of next year, with the highest expression level in December, and in female zzso from June to April of next zzso zzso zzso was also detected strongly in zzso buds of December from 4-year-old and adult trees, and slightly in stem of young zzso and young leaf of adult zzso Additionally, we cloned zzso promoter sequence of zzso and we drove zzso expression in transgenic tobacco by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso promoter can drive zzso gene expression in shoot zzso zzso young leaf and zzso flower zzso zzso tip, and zzso fruits of transgenic zzso which is almost identical to the expression pattern of zzso in London zzso The results revealed that the zzso gene isolated from London plane is expressed not only in zzso organ but also in zzso zzso Moreover, this expression pattern is consistent with the expression pattern in tobacco of a zzso reporter gene under the control of the potential promoter region of zzso
