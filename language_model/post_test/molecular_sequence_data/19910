zzso muscle development and growth are regulated through multiple signaling pathways that include zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso regulation and molecular mechanisms that control zzso gene expression in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso skeletal zzso were zzso zzso is expressed in developing skeletal muscle, and its embryonic expression is significantly reduced in zzso lacking both zzso and zzso During development, the zzso zzso 1 promoter is active in multiple organ systems, including skeletal muscle, whereas the alternative zzso 2 promoter is expressed predominantly in the zzso The zzso zzso 1 promoter zzso sequence includes two highly zzso regions that contain zzso consensus binding zzso One of these zzso regions contains a zzso regulatory region that is zzso activated by zzso in zzso skeletal muscle cells and zzso zzso This zzso region contains three clustered zzso consensus binding zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated the requirement for two of these in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso sequences containing these zzso zzso binding sequences interact zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Together, these experiments demonstrated that a zzso regulatory element in the zzso zzso 1 promoter zzso region is responsive to zzso signaling and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso The identification of a zzso element in the zzso gene represents a potential mechanism of intersection of these signaling pathways in the control of muscle development and zzso
