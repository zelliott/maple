zzso are small zzso peptides from cone snails that act as zzso at specific zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso and selectively blocks the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to another zzso member of this family, zzso zzso zzso which is a potent inhibitor of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have altered side chains in both the zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and have modified its zzso The effects of these changes on activity against zzso and zzso zzso were zzso the solution structures of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined from zzso zzso and resonance assignments were made for zzso zzso The structures for zzso and its three zzso were well zzso except at the chain zzso zzso of these structures with reported structures of zzso reveals a common zzso backbone architecture within the zzso family, but with variations in zzso zzso accessibility and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in loop 1 are critical for blockade of both the zzso and the zzso zzso In loop 2, zzso zzso had activity near that of zzso zzso with high potency for zzso and low potency for zzso and had a structure similar to that of wild zzso By contrast, zzso in loop 2 is critical for specific binding to the zzso zzso probably because it is larger and more zzso accessible than zzso in zzso Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis for antagonism of the zzso zzso zzso which is a target for the development of analgesics for the treatment of chronic zzso zzso
