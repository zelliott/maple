zzso are important human pathogens that have been developed as zzso for gene therapies and genetic zzso Previous studies indicated that human infections with zzso are zzso in zzso hosts with evidence of some persistence in zzso zzso We sought to better understand the natural history of zzso infections in various zzso primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso shed substantial quantities of infectious zzso in zzso zzso in stools from zzso humans was found to be much less zzso comparable to zzso reported zzso We zzso and fully zzso 30 novel zzso from apes and 3 novel zzso from zzso zzso of the new zzso zzso sequences (as well as the 4 zzso zzso sequences we have previously zzso together with 22 complete zzso zzso available from zzso revealed that zzso the zzso zzso could clearly be classified into species corresponding to human zzso species B, C, and zzso zzso there was evidence for zzso zzso between zzso and zzso the high degree of zzso zzso of zzso across their various zzso hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E zzso The high degree of zzso shedding of live zzso in zzso primates and evidence for zzso transmissions warrants caution for zzso handling and zzso Furthermore, the presence of persistent and/or zzso zzso infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso
