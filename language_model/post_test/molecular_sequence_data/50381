zzso in animal models suggest that it is feasible to consider zzso gene therapy using a strategy in which zzso would be isolated by partial zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso containing genes of therapeutic importance, and then transplanted back into the patient by zzso zzso zzso The application of this strategy in clinical trials will require adapting these methods to human zzso We describe the zzso of primary human zzso with two forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been used previously in clinical trials, and zzso zzso which have a different host zzso Human zzso were harvested from zzso preserved in zzso solution and were cultivated in a zzso zzso zzso defined zzso These cells proliferated for 3-5 days in culture, exhibited characteristic zzso zzso and expressed zzso functions, including zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in stable incorporation of the zzso into zzso of the cells as estimated by zzso zzso zzso higher zzso efficiencies (as much as zzso of the zzso were observed with a zzso zzso zzso These data support the feasibility of using zzso as a marker gene in clinical trials of zzso zzso These data also suggest that the efficiency of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in animal models may not accurately reflect the utility of these zzso for human zzso Consideration should be given to the use of zzso zzso for zzso the efficiency of zzso for human zzso
