The 33 genes zzso the complete set of zzso species in zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso They are organized into 5 clusters in addition to 9 single zzso No redundant gene was found, indicating that 33 zzso zzso to 32 different zzso and decode all 62 zzso used in this zzso There is only one single zzso for each of the Ala, zzso zzso and Val family zzso zzso a simplified decoding system resembling that recently described for zzso zzso zzso has to also exist in zzso However, analysis of the zzso set and zzso usage revealed features characteristic of the zzso zzso there is no obvious preference toward AT rich synonymous zzso zzso zzso zzso are assigned for zzso and are translated by zzso zzso and zzso CNN or zzso zzso are encountered in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso We thus propose that this zzso recognition pattern has emerged in the zzso zzso under a zzso zzso strategy but without the influence of AT zzso
