Human and mouse zzso showing zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso were zzso They were classified into two groups, the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso withdrawal zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the similarities of primary zzso acid zzso zzso cells that were originally insensitive to zzso became sensitive to zzso on their zzso with zzso zzso either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating that these gene products are not only structurally similar but also functionally active as receptors for zzso By binding zzso the human zzso zzso showed differences in affinity and capacity of binding from those of the human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that mouse zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso are expressed abundantly in mouse small zzso The expression of zzso zzso in the small zzso was restricted to cryptic zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with reports that zzso binds to the small zzso cells via two different kinds of zzso High levels of expression of zzso and/or zzso zzso were also detected in other zzso including the zzso liver, and zzso but only low levels were expressed in heart and skeletal zzso These results indicate that zzso uses structurally related cellular proteins as functional receptors in zzso and that zzso that have not so far been recognized as zzso have the potential to be targets of zzso
