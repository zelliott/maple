A zzso DNA binding protein with a basic zzso was zzso from zzso zzso in zzso cultured tobacco cells, and its zzso acid sequence was zzso Using this sequence information, its zzso zzso was isolated, and its zzso sequence was zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso has a transit zzso of 120 zzso acids and a mature protein of 382 zzso zzso A distinctive zzso motif in the zzso zzso region of the mature protein and an zzso zzso active site motif were zzso zzso of a series of truncated zzso proteins in zzso coli indicated that the zzso region is essential for DNA binding and that zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analyses showed zzso mainly in cells and/or zzso containing zzso actively growing zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso transcripts in these cells and/or zzso zzso transcripts for QB binding protein of zzso II zzso and large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso of cultured cells of transgenic tobacco with reduced zzso levels showed a higher level of expression of zzso genes compared with that of the wild zzso We discuss the possible function of zzso as a negative regulator of zzso gene zzso
