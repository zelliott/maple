zzso zzso signal zzso I zzso zzso zzso I) is an integral membrane zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of signal zzso peptides from zzso of membrane or zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso I was significantly zzso by reaction with zzso with zzso modification of three to four of the total 17 zzso zzso in the zzso This result indicated that several zzso zzso are important for the optimal activity of the zzso In the present study, we have constructed 17 zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso to investigate the role of individual zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scarcely affected the zzso activity in zzso and in zzso However, the zzso activity toward a synthetic zzso was significantly decreased by replacements of zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso The zzso values of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were about zzso smaller than that of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso values of these zzso zzso were almost identical with that of the zzso Moreover, the zzso abilities in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were lost completely when zzso or zzso was replaced with zzso The circular zzso zzso and other zzso properties of these zzso were comparable to those of the zzso zzso indicating no global zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was significantly lower compared to the wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are thought to be important for maintaining the proper and stable zzso of zzso zzso
