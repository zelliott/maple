In zzso zzso genes for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are organized in two zzso one made up of the zzso zzso and zzso genes and another consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with respect to the zzso gene is the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso is modulated by zzso in response to the availability of zzso in the zzso To study the regulatory process in greater detail we zzso zzso and showed that it is a zzso in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were done showing that zzso recognizes the zzso zzso and zzso promoters with affinity in the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso identified the binding site between zzso and zzso at zzso between zzso and zzso at zzso and between zzso and zzso at zzso Based on DNA sequence alignment of the target sites and zzso zzso zzso data, two zzso of zzso bind to a zzso with a consensus sequence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso intermediate zzso to zzso released the zzso from its target operators, whereas other chemicals such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not induce complex zzso The zzso zzso is likely to be recognized by a sugar zzso domain located at the zzso end of zzso whereas the zzso DNA binding domain of zzso exhibits high similarity to proteins of the zzso family of zzso
