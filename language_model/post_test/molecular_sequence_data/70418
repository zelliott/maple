We report the characterization of zzso virus gene zzso which is predicted to zzso a zzso protein with zzso zzso acid identity to the zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso virus gene zzso zzso zzso protection experiments showed that gene zzso is transcribed early during infection from an initiation site 11 zzso upstream of the open reading frame zzso The gene encodes a zzso zzso that is not required for virus replication in tissue culture nor for virus zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli produced an abundant zzso zzso which lacked protein zzso activity under conditions in which the protein zzso zzso by zzso virus gene zzso and African zzso fever virus gene zzso are zzso
