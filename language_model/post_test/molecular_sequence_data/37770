zzso zzso injection into the zzso fluid of the zzso zzso zzso stimulates release of zzso A zzso peptides as determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso This release occurs in the first 15 zzso after zzso exposure and yields a zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso part of the zzso This zzso is then zzso to free an zzso zzso related to zzso zzso zzso extended zzso the zzso zzso These zzso processing peptides were characterized using a combination of techniques including zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso The isolated zzso zzso B presents a high sequence zzso with the zzso and the same activity against zzso zzso revealed the simultaneous appearance of zzso zzso and zzso B in zzso after stimulation by zzso (in a zzso zzso surgical trauma or electrical zzso to neural zzso of the zzso Furthermore, zzso B processing in zzso yields zzso zzso zzso zzso which exhibits via the delta zzso zzso zzso properties, zzso movement and zzso changes, but no zzso zzso We zzso that this unified response to the various stimuli is a survival strategy for zzso by providing immediate zzso activity and zzso zzso thereby reducing any immune zzso period needed for an adequate immune zzso
