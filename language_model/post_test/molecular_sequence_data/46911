Basic cellular processes such as electron transport in photosynthesis and zzso require the precise control of iron zzso To mobilize iron, plants have evolved at least two different zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso which is zzso from three molecules of zzso is an essential component of both zzso This compound is missing in the tomato zzso zzso which exhibits severe defects in the regulation of iron zzso We report the zzso and partial characterization of the zzso zzso from barley roots as well as the cloning of two corresponding gene zzso The function of the gene sequence has been verified by zzso in zzso zzso Further confirmation comes from reduction of the zzso content and the exhibition of a zzso zzso due to the expression of zzso zzso zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso The native zzso with an apparent Mr of approximately 105 zzso probably represents a zzso of zzso zzso A comparison with the recently cloned zzso gene of tomato reveals striking sequence zzso providing support for the suggestion that the destruction of the zzso zzso zzso gene is the molecular basis of the tomato zzso
