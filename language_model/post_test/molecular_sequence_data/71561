Despite its importance for the regulation of heart function, little is known about the zzso expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in human zzso In this study, we investigated the spectrum of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso is characteristically expressed in cardiac zzso In skeletal muscle, specific expression of a new zzso termed zzso is zzso Complete sequencing of human zzso zzso representing all common features of the investigated zzso zzso revealed its high zzso to the corresponding rat zzso Comparative zzso reverse zzso chain reaction analyses from left zzso zzso of normal hearts and from patients suffering from zzso zzso showed a significant increase in transcript levels of zzso zzso relative to the expression of zzso zzso in diseased hearts zzso zzso versus zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of the other investigated cardiac zzso zzso remained zzso At the protein level, by using a zzso zzso we observed a similar increase of a zzso signal zzso versus zzso optical density units in the zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso The diseased state of the failing hearts was confirmed by a significant increase in transcript levels for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso Our data characterize for the first time the zzso zzso expression pattern in human hearts and demonstrate changes in this expression pattern in heart zzso
