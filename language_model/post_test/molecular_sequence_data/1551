We have studied the potential of mean force of two zzso one known to adopt a zzso and the other an zzso zzso in zzso These peptides are, respectively, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the B1 domain of protein G and the 13 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso ensemble sampling has been performed using a parallel replica exchange zzso The effective potential employed in this work consists of the zzso zzso force field zzso and an zzso generalized Born zzso implicit zzso model including a novel zzso zzso free energy zzso zzso An additional zzso screening zzso has been incorporated into the zzso zzso In the case of the zzso the zzso zzso free energy zzso provides the necessary effective interactions for the collapse of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso and zzso which the more commonly used zzso zzso model does not zzso For both the zzso and the zzso increased zzso screening reduces the stability of incorrectly formed salt bridges, which tend to disrupt the formation of the hairpin and zzso zzso The fraction of zzso and zzso content we obtained using the zzso model agrees well with experimental zzso The zzso stability of the zzso from protein G and the zzso zzso from zzso A as modeled with the zzso effective potential reflects the balance between the zzso effective potential terms, which drive zzso and the polar and hydrogen bonding terms, which promote secondary structure zzso
