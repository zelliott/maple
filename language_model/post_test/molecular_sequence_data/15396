The zzso DNA sequences of zzso zzso an endemic and zzso endangered plant species, were completed in this study zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in zzso It harbors a pair of zzso regions consisting of zzso zzso zzso The lengths of the zzso and zzso regions are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The structural organizations, gene and zzso zzso gene orders, AT zzso zzso zzso and zzso units of the zzso zzso zzso are similar to those of typical land plant zzso zzso However, the detailed features of zzso zzso zzso are substantially different from that of zzso which belongs to the same family, the zzso First, the zzso zzso DNA was zzso zzso longer than that of zzso due to an expanded zzso region into the zzso region and duplicated sequence elements in several zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso Second, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso evidence zzso sequence divergence in the coding regions, zzso sequence divergence in the zzso regions, and zzso sequence divergence in the zzso zzso regions, zzso In both the coding and zzso regions, average zzso substitution rates differed zzso depending on the zzso zzso Our data strongly zzso the zzso effects of the evolutionary modes of zzso zzso The genes zzso higher levels of base zzso also have higher zzso of zzso zzso and low zzso zzso A total of 54 simple sequence repeat zzso were identified from the zzso zzso zzso The existence of rich zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso provides a rare opportunity to study the population genetic structures of this endangered zzso Our zzso trees based on the two independent zzso the nuclear ITS and zzso zzso zzso strongly support the inclusion of the zzso to the zzso zzso our molecular trees support zzso original treatment of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
