The zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso as part of a signal that causes the zzso to pause prior to release from the zzso To study the release element of the zzso independent of the zzso pause zzso we have replaced the zzso binding site with the binding site for the zzso zzso which acts as a self-contained zzso pause signal for zzso zzso efficiency is zzso when the zzso zzso causes zzso to pause in exactly the same position that zzso would have caused it to pause, suggesting that zzso must be precisely positioned for transcript release to zzso zzso analysis shows that the release element is a region rich in T zzso which codes for the extreme 3' end of the transcript and which has no apparent ability to form zzso when transcribed into zzso We discuss possible mechanisms zzso this zzso release element might zzso
