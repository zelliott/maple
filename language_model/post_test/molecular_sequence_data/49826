zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was found to be a zzso form zzso composed of and 2 zzso To zzso the relationship between the features of the zzso association and the zzso stability of the zzso zzso the zzso association and zzso stability were examined by zzso zzso zzso and differential scanning zzso respectively, in comparison with those of the counterpart from zzso zzso The association zzso between the and zzso in the zzso protein were of the order of 108 zzso which were higher by two orders of magnitude than those in the zzso zzso The negative values of the heat capacity change and zzso change upon the zzso association were much lower in the zzso protein than in the zzso one, indicating that the zzso change of the zzso protein coupled to the zzso association is zzso The zzso temperature of the zzso from the zzso was enhanced by 17 degrees C due to the formation of the 22 zzso This zzso in zzso temperature due to complex formation could be zzso estimated by the increase in the association constant compared with that of the counterpart from zzso zzso
