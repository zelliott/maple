A zzso chain reaction zzso zzso protection analysis was performed to detect subtle genetic zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso None of the 30 zzso showed abnormal zzso protection zzso Only one of 32 zzso showed an abnormal pattern, and subsequent DNA sequencing of the zzso product revealed that it had a G to C zzso in zzso 49 that resulted in a change from zzso acid to zzso However, this was a sporadic zzso with no specific zzso zzso On the basis of a previous report that genes on zzso zzso were not deleted in zzso and were relatively infrequently deleted in zzso our results suggest that the zzso gene is not involved in zzso of zzso or zzso
