zzso zzso zzso contain an associated zzso zzso activity that zzso selectively a subset of sites in the tail of zzso and has properties consistent with zzso zzso I zzso Because zzso consists of a family of as many as seven genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we investigated the extent to which different zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso we determined that zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso activity through two zzso zzso In an zzso zzso zzso zzso activity occurred at zzso zzso corresponding to the size of zzso zzso Chicken zzso express transcripts zzso four alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differing in the presence or absence of two zzso L and zzso Using zzso against different zzso or with broad zzso zzso we determined that all four zzso zzso as well as other zzso family members, are present in chicken zzso However, only zzso and zzso could be detected in zzso zzso Also, zzso studies showed that zzso and zzso together account for zzso zzso These findings raise the possibility that only a subset of zzso zzso may be able to associate with and/or zzso zzso
