The nervous system of the zzso zzso zzso is well suited to studies of zzso zzso acid zzso Using a combination of zzso binding and zzso techniques, several distinct receptors have now been zzso These include an zzso zzso channel which has no known counterpart in the zzso nervous system, and a putative zzso zzso with pharmacological properties different from those of the existing categories of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso receptors have also been characterized in the zzso nervous zzso zzso zzso and steroids have revealed important differences between certain insect zzso zzso channels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may facilitate the allocation of specific functions to zzso acid zzso zzso In view of the existence of zzso of zzso acid receptors in insects, it is of interest to examine how this is reflected at the molecular level in terms of zzso zzso composition and zzso acid zzso zzso molecular cloning studies on insect zzso receptors are zzso
