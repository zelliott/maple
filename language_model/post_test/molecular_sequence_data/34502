A diverse set of 24 novel zzso infecting the fire blight pathogen zzso zzso was isolated from fruit production environments in zzso Based on initial zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with broad host ranges were selected for detailed characterization and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso with a zzso zzso featuring zzso zzso ends with direct terminal zzso zzso zzso another zzso was also found to possess direct terminal repeats but has a larger zzso zzso zzso and the virus particle exhibits a complex tail fiber zzso zzso zzso and zzso both belong to the zzso family and feature long, zzso tails and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, with direct terminal zzso The architecture of all four zzso zzso is typical for zzso zzso zzso organized into zzso gene zzso All four zzso completely lack genes or functions associated with zzso control, which zzso well with their broad host ranges and indicates strictly zzso zzso lifestyles without the possibility for host zzso Comparative zzso revealed that zzso is similar to zzso zzso virus zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso are unrelated to any other zzso zzso zzso Instead, they feature similarities to zzso viruses zzso zzso and zzso In a series of laboratory experiments, we provide proof of concept that specific zzso cocktails offer the potential for zzso of the zzso
