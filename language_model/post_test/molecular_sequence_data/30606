A novel interrupted gene motif has been reported in which a zzso zzso into zzso T4 gene 60 appears to be present in the message at the time of translation, yet it is not zzso We present here a dynamic model for how translation may be occurring in the neighborhood of the zzso The model involves formation of an zzso structure with similarities to a Holliday zzso followed by migration of the branch point in a strand exchange between message and zzso The advantage of this model over previous ones is that at no time is a new zzso required to pair with a zzso zzso
