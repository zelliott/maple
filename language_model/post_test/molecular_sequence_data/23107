DNA replication mechanisms are poorly understood in most of zzso in particular the replication of the peculiar zzso DNA, the zzso DNA zzso To contribute to the knowledge on the mechanism of zzso replication in zzso zzso we have previously characterized the Universal zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso which was first called zzso zzso Coelho, zzso zzso zzso Franco da zzso zzso zzso zzso Silva, Identification of zzso a candidate universal zzso sequence binding protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso In this work, we describe two highly zzso zzso of the zzso locus in the zzso zzso reference clone zzso zzso and the differential expression pattern of these zzso A 62 zzso sequence in the zzso upstream zzso region in one of its zzso affects the efficiency of zzso zzso processing and the zzso sites, and therefore regulates the differential expression of zzso zzso of this zzso
