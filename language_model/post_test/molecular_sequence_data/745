zzso insights into the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso have been obtained from trapped zzso complex structures determined by X-ray zzso Multiple sequence alignment and zzso zzso indicate that zzso belongs to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso resolving zzso zzso zzso at different states, zzso zzso state, zzso state, and zzso state, were obtained by screening the zzso proteins from a double zzso zzso a wild type, and a zzso zzso zzso A zzso or an zzso analog with two water molecules that mimic an zzso zzso zzso was found close to the active site of the zzso or zzso state, zzso Their global structures were found to contain a novel zzso pocket capable of accommodating an zzso chain of no less than 16 zzso In addition, in the zzso or zzso state, substantial local unfolding or complete unfolding of the zzso was zzso with the zzso remaining essentially zzso This is in contrast to the earlier observation that the zzso exhibits local unfolding during zzso bond formation in typical zzso zzso These rich experimental data have enabled us to propose a zzso by which zzso carries out its zzso activity through the alternate opening and closing of the zzso entry channel and the zzso zzso
