The corpus zzso zzso is a temporary organ involved in the maintenance of zzso In the course of its zzso the zzso zzso two distinct and consecutive processes for its inevitable removal through zzso functional and structural zzso We isolated a gene zzso for a novel rat zinc finger protein zzso named rat zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed close sequence and structural similarity to mouse zzso and human zinc finger protein zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction analysis revealed a positive correlation with the end of pregnancy, that is, the onset of structural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso levels increased zzso zzso zzso zzso between days 13 and 22 of pregnancy and zzso zzso zzso zzso between day 13 of pregnancy and day 1 zzso In addition, we detected zzso expression in zzso zzso heart, kidney and skeletal zzso zzso analysis predicted that zzso has a high probability of zzso to the nuclear zzso The presence of both a perfect consensus zzso zzso sequence between zinc fingers 2 and 3 as well as several similar sequences between the other zinc fingers suggests physical interaction with zzso zzso zzso may therefore function as a zzso factor, zzso zzso genes and/or zzso zzso genes and thereby contributing to the demise of the zzso
