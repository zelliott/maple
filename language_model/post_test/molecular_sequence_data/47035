zzso of transfer zzso zzso to the zzso involves crucial zzso zzso zzso zzso To better understand these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stem and loop zzso zzso were used as zzso of zzso orientation on the zzso Orientation of the zzso in the zzso zzso was assessed with a quantitative chemical zzso method in which protection zzso zzso zzso protection afforded to individual zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso or synthetic zzso Chemical zzso of native zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso at position 33 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protected individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso enhanced protection of zzso but the zzso and zzso zzso did zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso with zzso approximately zzso zzso were afforded significantly greater protection by both zzso zzso and the zzso than other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso In contrast, protections of zzso and zzso were greatly and zzso reduced in quantitative zzso of zzso zzso as compared with that of the zzso zzso and zzso protected zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso However, protection of zzso and zzso zzso between 70 and 340 zzso was significantly reduced in comparison to that of the zzso zzso and 61 zzso zzso Though protections of all zzso zzso by zzso were reduced as compared to that of the zzso a zzso greater reduction of zzso and zzso protections was observed zzso zzso 242 and 347 zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are important to efficient zzso binding of zzso More importantly, when zzso is bound in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso are positioned close to each zzso
