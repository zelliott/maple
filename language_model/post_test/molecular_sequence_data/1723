zzso modeling could be done on various levels of structural details, from simplified lattice or continuous zzso through high resolution reduced models, employing the united atom zzso to zzso models of the molecular zzso Here I describe a new high resolution reduced model, its force field and applications in the structural zzso The model uses a lattice representation with 800 possible zzso of the virtual alpha zzso carbon zzso The sampling scheme of the zzso space employs the zzso Exchange zzso Carlo zzso zzso zzso of the force field include: generic zzso zzso zzso statistical zzso for the short-range zzso zzso a model of the main chain hydrogen bonds and zzso statistical zzso describing the side group zzso The model is more accurate than the previously designed lattice models and in many applications it is complementary and competitive in respect to the zzso zzso The test applications include: the zzso zzso structure zzso zzso comparative modeling and structure prediction based on sparse experimental zzso zzso the new approach to comparative modeling could be a valuable tool of the structural zzso It is shown that the new approach goes beyond the range of zzso of the traditional methods of the protein comparative zzso
