zzso zzso ticks transmit zzso species to zzso zzso Using molecular tools we were able to detect the presence of this zzso in its zzso The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and identity of zzso species in zzso ticks collected in various areas of zzso 

DNA from zzso zzso zzso ticks were examined with a zzso zzso for the presence of zzso Positive samples of tick DNA were identified to species using zzso and sequence zzso 

From a total of 1908 zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso indicated the presence of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 9 out of 22 zzso Further molecular analyses of DNA from these positive ticks indicate the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a currently zzso zzso in Norwegian zzso The most prevalent was zzso zzso found in zzso of the positive zzso 

A total of 17 out of 1908 zzso ticks were positive for zzso Our data confirm that there are several zzso species in ticks in zzso zzso zzso was the most zzso This species has a zzso potential and may cause human zzso following a tick zzso
