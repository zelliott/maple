Two sexual partners infected with related zzso viruses and enrolled in different therapeutic strategies including structured treatment interruptions zzso provided us an opportunity to compare long term (10 zzso viral genetic evolution for closely related zzso in different zzso zzso zzso were zzso typed and different genetic markers were zzso The viral genetic evolution was studied by sequencing pol and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso T cell responses were assessed by the zzso response zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso class I zzso of patients A and B were different and both of them were zzso for zzso zzso During the two zzso studies, viral load of both patients rebounded after treatment interruption and both developed a zzso strong helper and zzso zzso After definitive interruption of therapy, viral load remained below 5,000 zzso without therapy during the two years of zzso Two patients infected with related viruses showed a similar dynamics of viral evolution and zzso T cells, despite hosts having a different zzso type and being treated with several therapeutic zzso after 10 years of zzso These results suggest that, in this case, an effective zzso response to zzso depended more on the virus than on the characteristics of the zzso
