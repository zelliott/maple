The zzso zzso core zzso sequence possesses zzso properties in peripheral zzso During functional zzso recovery after damage to peripheral nerves, zzso cells play a significant role in zzso zzso Here we employ a modified zzso zzso analogue to zzso zzso zzso proteins from cultured primary rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso cells were analyzed by zzso followed by zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso proteins zzso have a molecular weight of zzso zzso These data are the first to demonstrate zzso and zzso of zzso receptors from zzso zzso
