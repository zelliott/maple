A series of zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso analog was zzso with the aim to obtain compounds which combine zzso potency with oral zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso in place of an zzso acid zzso is a potent and orally zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in various cell lines, in primary zzso and in primary zzso against laboratory strains as well as clinical zzso zzso zzso effective dose zzso zzso to zzso zzso Cell proliferation was impaired only at zzso to zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso action of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be zzso of gag precursor protein zzso The finding that the zzso potency of zzso zzso zzso in chronic virus infection, determined by zzso release, was considerably lower than that in de zzso infection may be explained by the fact that the virus particles produced in the presence of zzso zzso zzso are about zzso less infectious than those from zzso zzso Upon intravenous administration, zzso in blood of 100 and 32 zzso in mice and rats, respectively, were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso was 20 to zzso depending on the zzso In mice, rats, and dogs, the inhibitor levels after oral administration remained far above the zzso needed to efficiently block zzso replication in zzso for a prolonged zzso This compound is thus a promising candidate for clinical use in zzso zzso
