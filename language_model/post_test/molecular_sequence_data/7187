The zzso zzso zzso which represent a subset of all zzso zzso zzso proteins that regulate zzso zzso identity during zzso and are zzso of the zzso zzso proteins zzso by genes zzso the zzso complex zzso Recently, we demonstrated that multiple zzso proteins bind DNA zzso with both zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the highly zzso zzso motif zzso which occurs in numerous zzso proteins and is positioned 8 to 50 zzso acids N terminal to the zzso is essential for cooperative DNA binding with zzso and zzso Point zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso within the core of this motif were critical for cooperative DNA zzso A zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso but not one in which zzso was zzso for zzso blocked the ability of zzso proteins to bind zzso with zzso or zzso suggesting that the zzso itself provides at least one surface through which zzso proteins bind zzso Furthermore, the same zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso DNA binding by zzso suggesting that interaction of zzso proteins with zzso through the zzso motif raises the zzso ability of zzso
