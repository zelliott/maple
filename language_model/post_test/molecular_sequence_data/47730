The ubiquitous use of zzso in animals poses severe biological and chemical zzso Free zzso is toxic to cells and is a potential source of iron for zzso For protection, especially in conditions of zzso inflammation and zzso and to maintain iron zzso a zzso binding zzso zzso is zzso zzso binds zzso with the highest affinity of any known zzso but releases it into cells via specific zzso The crystal structure of the zzso complex reveals a novel zzso binding site, formed between two similar zzso zzso zzso and bounded by the zzso zzso The zzso is bound to two zzso zzso in a pocket dominated by aromatic and basic zzso Further stabilization is achieved by the association of the two zzso zzso which form an extensive polar interface that includes a cushion of ordered water zzso We propose mechanisms by which these structural features provide the dual function of zzso binding and zzso
