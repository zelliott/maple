Nuclear zzso zzso occurs in an zzso complex, termed the zzso zzso zzso is one of four essential small nuclear zzso zzso particles zzso U2, zzso and zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso and zzso and a number of zzso We report here the identification and characterization of two human genes zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a 77 zzso zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed two putative zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso were generated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso This zzso factor can zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that it is present in the zzso zzso zzso is a 58 zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso factor zzso Like zzso zzso the human zzso contains repeats zzso to the zzso of zzso These repeats are called zzso repeats because there is a highly zzso zzso of zzso and zzso acid present at the end of each zzso The primary zzso acid sequence zzso between human zzso and zzso zzso led to the discovery of two additional zzso repeats in zzso zzso zzso zzso between these human and zzso zzso factors and the zzso of zzso has been identified by zzso comparison and analysis of the protein folding by zzso zzso models of zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso have been generated based on the structure of zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to interact with each other and the first 100 zzso acids of zzso are not essential for this zzso These experiments suggest that both zzso and zzso are components of human zzso
