zzso zzso is restricted to the active zone, a specialized area of the zzso plasma zzso We report the identification and initial characterization of zzso a zzso zzso protein concentrated at the zzso active zone and associated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequences of chicken and mouse zzso indicates an organization into multiple zzso including two pairs of zzso zinc fingers, a zzso zzso and a zzso domain and two C2 zzso near the zzso zzso The second C2 domain is subject to differential zzso zzso binds zzso an zzso protein implicated in zzso zzso zzso Large parts of zzso including the zinc finger, zzso and C2 zzso are zzso to zzso or to zzso two other proteins concentrated in zzso active zzso We propose that zzso is a scaffolding protein involved in the organization of the molecular architecture of synaptic active zones and in the orchestration of neurotransmitter zzso zzso
