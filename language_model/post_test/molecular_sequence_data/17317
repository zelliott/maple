The aim of this study was to zzso a novel family of inflammatory genes induced by zzso zzso in primary human zzso zzso Using a zzso array screen two previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified that were zzso over 30 fold by treatment with zzso zzso for 2 zzso They were also found to respond to zzso necrosis factor zzso suggesting a general role in zzso zzso of both genes peaked 2 h after addition of zzso zzso with similar zzso to the fastest nuclear factor zzso zzso induced zzso The zzso of both genes by zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso which blocks zzso of zzso by preventing zzso zzso Furthermore, two sequences with zzso to zzso binding sites in the promoter of zzso were found to be essential for rapid zzso in expression in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were found predominantly in zzso cells, and the zzso proteins were zzso to the nuclear compartment suggesting a role in the regulation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso belong to a novel gene family zzso nuclear factors with a role in regulating genes which control cellular zzso This might increase vascular zzso in acute zzso
