zzso zzso acid zzso is a DNA mimic with promising properties for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted to zzso coli genes can specifically inhibit gene zzso and attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso dramatically improves zzso zzso The improved potency observed earlier was suggested to be due to better cell zzso however, the zzso zzso of standard or modified zzso into bacteria had not been zzso Here we monitored outer and inner membrane zzso by using chemical zzso that normally are excluded from cells but can gain access at points where membrane integrity is zzso zzso zzso was much more rapid in the presence of zzso zzso relative to the free components used alone or in zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso coli nearly as quickly as zzso zzso Furthermore, as expected for outer zzso compounds, added zzso reduced zzso zzso monitoring of outer and inner membrane zzso indicated that passage across the outer membrane is zzso for zzso The enhanced zzso properties of zzso can explain their potent zzso activity, and the results indicate an unanticipated zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
