Development of winter zzso in trees is a zzso process involving sequential perception of distinct environmental cues, zzso zzso zzso and low temperature zzso We have shown that both zzso and zzso are recognized by leaves of silver birch zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to increased freezing zzso and thus leaves can be used as an experimental model to study the zzso and molecular events taking place during cold zzso To obtain a molecular marker for the zzso process in birch we cloned a zzso designated zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso type of zzso The gene was responsive to zzso drought, salt, and zzso zzso zzso This responsiveness to zzso stresses and zzso acid was retained when zzso was introduced to zzso zzso zzso The zzso induction of the gene appeared to be under the control of the zzso factor zzso as suggested by the presence of several zzso zzso elements in the zzso promoter and its zzso expression in zzso factor zzso zzso In birch zzso zzso at zzso temperature did not result in significant induction of zzso However, zzso to zzso followed by zzso treatment resulted in a remarkable increase in zzso transcript zzso as compared to zzso plants grown at zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso the zzso response by conditioning the leaf tissue to be more responsive to the zzso zzso
