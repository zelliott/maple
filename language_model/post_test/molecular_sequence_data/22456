Tight junctions are directly involved in regulating the passage of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of these gate functions to zzso regulate the zzso zzso of large zzso and zzso could increase the delivery of pharmacological agents or gene transfer zzso To reduce the inflammatory responses caused by tight zzso agents, alternative strategies directly targeting specific tight junction proteins could prove to be less toxic to airway zzso The zzso delivery of peptides corresponding to the first zzso loop of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso flux has been demonstrated in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso application of these zzso peptides could similarly zzso tight junction zzso in airway zzso Thus, we investigated the effects of zzso applied zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of molecular zzso and viral zzso in well differentiated human airway zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on cellular zzso tight junction protein expression and zzso and membrane integrity were also zzso Our data showed that zzso applied zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso resistance in airway zzso and altered tight junction zzso in a zzso zzso These zzso enhanced the zzso flux of zzso as well as gene transfer zzso The zzso zzso redistributed zzso but did not alter the expression or distribution of zzso zzso or zzso These data suggest that specific targeting of zzso could be a zzso alternative strategy for tight junction zzso in airway zzso cells compared with current agents that zzso tight zzso
