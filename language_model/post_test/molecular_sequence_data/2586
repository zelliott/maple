We have investigated the recognition of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of influenza virus zzso zzso zzso by secondary in zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso While these three proteins have different functions and cellular locations, they can all be recognized as target zzso However, the zzso of these proteins for zzso is under strict genetic zzso Thus, zzso protein is recognized as a zzso target zzso by zzso raised in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso mice, also generate a low-level zzso response to the zzso This latter response was only zzso following in zzso zzso of zzso mice with a zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed from zzso zzso virus zzso was not recognized as an zzso by zzso generated from either zzso or zzso strains of zzso By contrast, human zzso influenza zzso zzso were shown to recognize this zzso protein as a target zzso zzso expression of as little as 90 zzso acids of the zzso protein was sufficient to render target cells susceptible to zzso by such zzso
