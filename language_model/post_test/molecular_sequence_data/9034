In this study, we present the full zzso sequences and evolutionary analyses of a serially sampled population of 28 zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso group in zzso Genome sizes were consistent with previously available zzso ranging in length from zzso to zzso zzso and consisted of zzso open reading zzso We analyzed their genetic diversity and found that regions of high diversity are correlated with high zzso rate regions zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso showed two major zzso that correlate well with known host zzso Using the extended zzso Skyline model, we found that population size has remained mostly constant through zzso Moreover, the zzso pattern of these zzso is in agreement with human-driven zzso as suggested by zzso zzso In addition, selection analysis found evidence of positive selection on zzso positions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, positively selected sites in the zzso were located within the neck and head region in the crystal structure, both known zzso of host zzso Our study demonstrates the utility of zzso methods applied to whole zzso data collected from populations of zzso for providing insights into applied zzso
