Studies on zzso species with a wide geographic and ecological range may be zzso by still zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated genetic zzso and zzso changes induced in a common intermediate host, in two different forms of zzso zzso based on the zzso of the zzso zzso stage zzso A zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of zzso were distinguished based on their surface and zzso We zzso sequence divergence at both nuclear zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1) genes of zzso zzso zzso and adults at various geographical zzso A high level of sequence divergence at zzso zzso and zzso c zzso zzso 1 zzso 8 and zzso zzso was found between these two zzso The divergence pattern consistently zzso two groups independently of geographic origin or host, and was zzso with zzso zzso The two forms also strongly differed in the intensity of zzso change induced in their common intermediate host, zzso zzso with the zzso zzso inducing a positive zzso whereas zzso infected zzso were as zzso as zzso zzso Overall, our data strongly support the specific status of these two zzso We suggest that smooth zzso zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso might zzso to the previously described and poorly zzso zzso zzso considered a synonym of zzso zzso This study also confirms the value of a joint analysis of internal transcribed zzso and zzso c zzso zzso 1 genes to zzso studies on these zzso Finally, we emphasize the importance of linking zzso and biological characteristics of zzso zzso to molecular data, in the study of the evolutionary ecology and zzso of this zzso
