Although the nuclear zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso a zzso red zzso was recently determined, DNA transformation technology that is important as a model plant system has never been available thus zzso In this study, improved culture conditions resulted in a faster growth rate of zzso zzso in liquid medium zzso time zzso zzso zzso and colony formation on zzso gum zzso Using these conditions, spontaneous zzso zzso acid zzso deficient in the UMP zzso gene were zzso The zzso were then restored by introducing the zzso UMP zzso gene into the cells suggesting DNA transformation by zzso zzso
