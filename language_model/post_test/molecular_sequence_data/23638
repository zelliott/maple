We cloned and characterized a zzso zzso repeat element of zzso named zzso Several internal tandem repeats were found along the zzso The repetitive nature of the zzso element was confirmed by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the data bank analysis and the presence of two zzso putative genes that may zzso proteins related to DNA zzso zzso could be considered an zzso zzso zzso By using zzso as probe or zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA Could be detected from whole blood and zzso zzso We consider that the repeat element described here has potential for zzso zzso malaria diagnosis and for zzso analysis of zzso zzso transmission zzso
