zzso variation in zzso zzso zzso was studied using a recently developed technique generating Random zzso zzso zzso zzso It appeared that variation between zzso was high and that the zzso used could be distinguished from each other by using only two different zzso A family of zzso derived from one original zzso by zzso zzso had identical zzso zzso Because of the high level of zzso and zzso stability zzso fragments are useful for zzso zzso zzso zzso among related zzso species was too high to study genetic distances either among zzso within zzso or among species related to zzso
