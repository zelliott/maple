zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso alpha or beta chain variable region zzso alpha or V zzso gene families has been observed in the zzso response to some conventional zzso zzso Current models for the interaction of zzso V region elements with different zzso of a major zzso complex zzso complex, the normal zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso zzso region zzso where J is zzso is the primary contact with a zzso zzso and that other zzso V region segments may interact directly with neighboring zzso zzso This suggests that V alpha or V beta dominance in a specific response can be zzso In this case, if related peptides bind to an zzso zzso in a similar orientation, they could select for identical V alpha or V beta dominance even if they are zzso at the level of zzso zzso We have screened for this possibility by introducing minimal conservative zzso in a synthetic zzso zzso that is presented to T cells in association with an uncommon A beta E alpha d mixed zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso but appears to preserve the same zzso binding motif since zzso responses are restricted to the same mixed A beta E alpha zzso Although the two peptides are zzso in either direction, the same members of the V alpha 4 gene family are zzso expressed in T cells specific for either zzso We conclude that the similar topography of the two zzso complexes gives functional significance to a unique A beta E alpha zzso that selects for V alpha 4 zzso
