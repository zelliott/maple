zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso surface protein 1 zzso play an important role in protective immunity to zzso Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognizing zzso can inhibit red cell invasion by interfering with zzso processing on the zzso zzso We show here that this ability is dependent on the intact zzso since zzso and zzso fragments derived from zzso zzso although capable of binding zzso with high affinity and competing with the intact zzso for binding to zzso were unable to inhibit zzso invasion or zzso zzso The DNA sequences of the variable zzso regions of both zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and partial zzso acid sequences of the same regions were confirmed by mass zzso Human zzso zzso constructed by using these zzso which combine the original mouse V regions with human zzso and zzso constant regions, retain the ability to bind to both zzso and zzso zzso and both zzso human zzso zzso zzso were at least as good at zzso zzso invasion as the parental zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the human zzso zzso of the zzso class (but not the corresponding human zzso induced significant zzso zzso bursts and zzso from human zzso These zzso human zzso will enable investigators to examine the role of human zzso receptors in immunity to malaria using a transgenic zzso and mouse model and may prove useful in humans for zzso zzso as an adjunct to zzso drug zzso
