The VS zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso via zzso zzso To study the role of zzso groups in the zzso interaction, 18 modified zzso were zzso where an zzso zzso replaces one of the zzso zzso zzso Sites in the zzso zzso where zzso substitution impaired reaction cluster in two zzso The first site is the zzso zzso zzso linkage and zzso downstream of this and the second site is within the loop zzso The addition of zzso zzso caused recovery of the rate of reaction for zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso suggesting that these two zzso groups may serve as zzso for two metal zzso In contrast, significant zzso rescue was not observed for the zzso zzso zzso linkage zzso that zzso zzso by metal zzso is unlikely to contribute to VS zzso zzso In addition, an increase in the reaction rate of the unmodified VS zzso was observed when a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso acted as the zzso One possible explanation for this effect is that the zzso reaction of the VS zzso is rate limited by a metal dependent zzso of the zzso on the zzso
