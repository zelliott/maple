zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso membrane protein which is zzso and structurally related to zzso zzso an important zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso were zzso from a single liver zzso of a zzso zzso and characterized with respect to their primary sequence and position of zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mr zzso and zzso Mr zzso each showed a zzso Mr of 35,000 and yielded identical zzso zzso The structural characterization of zzso and zzso and the assignment of zzso sites was performed by fast atom zzso mass zzso and zzso analysis of the resulting zzso This approach showed that zzso and zzso were identical with respect to primary sequence and provided direct evidence that 11 of the 12 predicted zzso zzso sites were zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso evidence was obtained for zzso at the other zzso Both zzso also contain zzso linked to zzso a finding consistent with the conclusion that these proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane through a zzso zzso The large difference in the molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso suggests significant variations in their zzso zzso
