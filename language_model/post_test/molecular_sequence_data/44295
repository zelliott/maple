We examined the zzso gene from a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso First we studied the protein coding region, zzso zzso and the zzso promoter region zzso zzso to zzso of her zzso gene by direct zzso Although the results showed that she was zzso for the zzso zzso we could find no other zzso To find a second zzso and compare the sequence in the zzso region of her zzso gene between two zzso zzso we amplified a zzso stretch zzso zzso to zzso including zzso zzso zzso by zzso and cloned it into a zzso zzso As a result, we discovered a difference between two zzso zzso in the zzso repeat zzso zzso we expect that the zzso in the zzso repeat region of the zzso gene will be used as a zzso marker of the zzso zzso
