A library of zzso zzso was created by combined zzso of the DNA zzso the human zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The parental zzso are 84 % sequence identical at the protein level, but their specific activities with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ by more than zzso zzso is of particular interest as an zzso product of zzso and of possible significance in the zzso of Parkinson's disease, and zzso is a model for zzso and potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has at least two orders of magnitude higher zzso activity with both of the zzso than any of the other known zzso including zzso zzso The DNA library of zzso zzso class zzso sequences contained zzso structures composed of alternating segments of both parental zzso All clones contained the zzso of a zzso zzso clone zzso for high-level expression in zzso zzso The remainder of the sequences derived from segments of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All of the clones analyzed contained between two and seven distinct DNA zzso In addition, each clone contained an average of approximately one point zzso None of the library clones analyzed was identical with either of the two parental zzso zzso zzso sequences were expressed in zzso coli, and their zzso activities with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined in bacterial zzso Such screening of more than 70 clones demonstrated a continuous range of activities covering at least two orders of magnitude for each of the zzso For a given zzso the activities with zzso and zzso in spite of their different zzso were clearly zzso whereas no strong correlation was found with zzso This functional correlation suggests a common structural basis for the zzso mechanisms for zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso From an evolutionary perspective, the results show that zzso of segments from zzso proteins gives rise to a large proportion of functionally competent proteins with a range of zzso The data support the proposal that natural evolution of protein functions may involve zzso of DNA segments followed by selection for advantageous functional properties of the resulting zzso Clearly, the same approach can be zzso in the engineering of proteins displaying novel functions by in zzso zzso
