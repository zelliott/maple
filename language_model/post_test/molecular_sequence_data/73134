The zzso terminal region of the zzso zzso of zzso virus A zzso a tentative member of the zzso zzso encompassing zzso zzso was zzso Evidence was obtained that the zzso is zzso Two putative open reading frames zzso were zzso zzso 1 that codes for a zzso zzso zzso with zzso motifs of zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 that encodes a 19 zzso zzso with no significant zzso with protein sequences from zzso This zzso however, showed zzso similarity with the product expressed by a comparable zzso present in zzso virus B zzso GVA zzso had the same size and structural organization as that of zzso It also had the same size of the zzso of apple zzso leaf spot virus zzso the type species of the zzso zzso but differed substantially in the number (5 versus zzso size, and order of zzso zzso existed also in the degree of sequence zzso between zzso which did not cluster together in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tentative zzso zzso zzso species differ zzso biologically and zzso to an extent that warrants the zzso revision of the zzso
