The zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso is unique to zzso zzso properties of the cloned zzso gene and the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA, containing a functional zzso gene and a promoter, was zzso to make the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso and shown to contain an open reading frame zzso of 470 zzso zzso preceded by putative zzso promoter elements zzso and zzso box zzso and two potential zzso zzso zzso within 368 zzso upstream of the start zzso This zzso shared with the corresponding region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso identity zzso zzso overall, within which were smaller regions of marked sequence zzso One such region coincided zzso zzso with a putative zzso domain motif identified in the zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso activity from cells grown in zzso minimal or zzso media was less than the activity of cells grown in minimal zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was more sensitive to feedback zzso by zzso in zzso than the zzso of zzso zzso These results show the effects of extensive evolutionary divergence on the structure and expression of a pivotal zzso in the zzso zzso Presumably, delineated regions of strong sequence conservation zzso to discrete zzso essential to zzso zzso
