In higher plant zzso zzso zzso is the unique soluble electron carrier protein located in the zzso zzso a wide variety of essential zzso and signaling processes depend upon reduction by zzso The currently available plant zzso of zzso and rice zzso zzso contain several genes zzso putative zzso although little is known about the proteins zzso To establish whether this variety represents zzso or specialized function, we have zzso expressed and zzso the four conventional zzso zzso proteins zzso in the zzso zzso and analyzed their physical and functional zzso Two proteins are leaf type zzso having relatively low zzso zzso and supporting a higher zzso zzso One protein is a root type zzso being more efficiently reduced under zzso conditions and supporting a higher activity of zzso zzso A further zzso has a remarkably positive zzso potential and so, although zzso active, is limited in zzso partners to which it can donate zzso zzso analysis indicates that all four proteins are expressed in mature zzso This holistic view demonstrates how varied and essential soluble electron transfer functions in higher plants are fulfilled through a diversity of zzso zzso
