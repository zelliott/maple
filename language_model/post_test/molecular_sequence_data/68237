A zzso clone zzso an zzso protein from zzso zzso was characterized with regard to its zzso zzso organization and regulation in response to zzso treatments that control floral zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of 432 zzso zzso a 144 zzso acid protein of approximately 16 zzso The predicted zzso has the characteristic zzso motifs of the zzso and zzso class of proteins including an zzso basic region, one of two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso region, zzso zzso deduced zzso acid sequence shares zzso zzso and zzso identity with its animal, zzso and soybean counterparts, zzso Southern zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is a member of a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso abundance indicates that the zzso gene is expressed to higher levels in zzso zzso such as roots, and at lower levels in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Following the transition to darkness, the levels of zzso zzso in zzso were initially stable, however, after a lag time of 8 h or more, zzso zzso increased in abundance to a peak level at 20 zzso A second peak in zzso levels was observed about 24 h later, indicating that the expression of the zzso gene is regulated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso during a dark period was dramatically affected by brief light exposure zzso zzso a treatment which zzso floral zzso These data indicate that the expression of zzso is regulated by both an zzso rhythm and the zzso cycle and are consistent with a role for zzso in maintaining patterns of zzso gene expression activated upon the transition from light to zzso
