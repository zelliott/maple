The zzso zzso unfolding of the zzso zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was studied using differential scanning zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso showed that zzso is a stable zzso in the pH range zzso zzso zzso data fit into a two-state unfolding model, suggesting that the zzso zzso unfolds as a single cooperative unit with a zzso melting temperature of zzso degrees C and an zzso change of zzso zzso at pH zzso The heat capacity change upon unfolding determined from linear fits of the temperature dependence of zzso is zzso zzso zzso The low specific heat capacity change of 13 zzso K zzso leads to a considerable zzso of the protein stability curve zzso zzso and results in a zzso zzso of only zzso zzso at 320 K and a zzso of only zzso zzso at the optimal growth temperature of zzso
