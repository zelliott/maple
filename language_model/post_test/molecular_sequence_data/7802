To establish in zzso zzso tumor models and permanent lines of zzso zzso cells we produced transgenic zzso mice expressing the zzso virus zzso 40 zzso zzso driven by 6 or zzso zzso fragments of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso altogether 44 zzso mice, one of which carried the shorter zzso have produced zzso zzso Two founder females expressing the longer zzso zzso and zzso and three established zzso mouse lines were studied in zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso and zzso mouse lines was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the zzso adrenal zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells possessed zzso zzso receptors zzso association constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and responded to human zzso by elevated zzso and zzso zzso Also zzso slightly zzso their zzso and zzso production zzso zzso zzso These cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso cells are immortalized zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These cells will be useful in studies on the molecular aspects of zzso cell zzso The present study indicates that the zzso zzso of the zzso alpha promoter described in this article contains the elements directing zzso expression in zzso and is useful for targeted expression of other genes in the zzso
