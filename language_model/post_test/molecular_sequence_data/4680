The transport of zzso across zzso in higher plants plays an essential role in many zzso processes including mineral nutrition, cell expansion, and the zzso of environmental zzso In higher plants the coordinated expression of transport mechanisms is essential for specialized cellular processes and for adaptation to variable environmental zzso To understand the molecular basis of zzso transport in plant roots, a zzso zzso zzso library was used to complement a zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso Two genes were cloned that zzso the zzso zzso and a novel zzso described in this report zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the secondary structure of zzso suggests that the protein contains 8-10 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso containing sequences enriched in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity was zzso using radioactive zzso in zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and possibly allowed zzso but not zzso zzso zzso is expressed in low abundance in wheat roots and zzso The precise functional role of this zzso zzso is not known, although the competitive zzso of zzso zzso by zzso has parallels to whole plant and molecular studies that have shown the important role of zzso in reducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The structure of this higher plant zzso transport protein is unique and contains zzso zzso
