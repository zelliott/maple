Under zzso adherent conditions, zzso gene expression can be regulated by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso This report demonstrates a new mechanism that can zzso control the expression of several zzso When zzso zzso cells are maintained in suspension, zzso of several zzso zzso takes zzso Within as little as 4 zzso the zzso levels for both the alpha zzso and alpha zzso are increased zzso and zzso zzso It was found that zzso levels for the alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso were markedly increased in several differentiated cell lines under zzso zzso however, cells that did not express a given zzso under zzso adherent conditions also did not express this zzso when maintained in zzso The alpha zzso did not zzso during suspension zzso By zzso changes in zzso zzso levels were confirmed at the protein zzso Both zzso B and a zzso zzso were found to induce the expression of the alpha zzso but not the alpha zzso and alpha zzso in a zzso zzso Many investigators have documented changes in gene expression that result from changes in zzso zzso These phenomena may result from zzso of zzso gene expression induced by the lack of zzso zzso
