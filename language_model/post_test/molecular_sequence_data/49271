Gene transfer from the zzso to the nucleus has occurred over evolutionary zzso zzso gene establishment in the nucleus is rare, but DNA transfer without functionality is presumably more zzso Here, we measured directly the transfer rate of zzso DNA zzso into the nucleus of tobacco plants zzso zzso To zzso this process, a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was integrated into the zzso zzso and the transfer of zzso to the nucleus was detected by screening for zzso zzso in zzso A screen for zzso zzso was conducted with about 250,000 progeny produced by zzso of zzso females with zzso from plants containing zzso Sixteen plants of independent origin were identified and their zzso showed stable inheritance of zzso characteristic of nuclear zzso Thus, we provide a quantitative estimate of one zzso event in about 16,000 zzso grains for the frequency of transfer of zzso to the zzso In addition to its evident role in zzso evolution, zzso of zzso to the nucleus in tobacco occurs at a rate that must have significant consequences for existing nuclear zzso
