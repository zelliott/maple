We have devised a simple zzso zzso zzso that detects increasing levels of zzso zzso after zzso and can be used for detecting recent zzso zzso Use of a zzso zzso that included zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso B, zzso and D allowed similar detection of zzso zzso among various zzso Because of the competitive nature of the capture zzso a gradual increase in the proportion of zzso zzso in total zzso was observed for 2 years after zzso This was in contrast to results obtained with the conventional zzso using the same zzso in solid phase, which zzso soon after zzso The zzso was used to test zzso zzso specimens from 139 incident infections in the United States zzso zzso and in Thailand zzso B and zzso The zzso was also performed with an additional 8 M zzso incubation step to assess the contribution of zzso zzso zzso optical density zzso was calculated zzso using a zzso zzso An incremental analysis indicated that a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso period of 160 days offered the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for zzso incident or long-term zzso The zzso step increased the zzso period to 180 days with similar sensitivity and zzso Separate analysis of B and E zzso specimens yielded the same optimal zzso threshold and similar zzso zzso The zzso was further validated in African specimens zzso A, C, and zzso where the observed zzso was within zzso of the expected zzso This zzso should be useful for detecting recent zzso infection and for zzso zzso among diverse zzso zzso zzso
