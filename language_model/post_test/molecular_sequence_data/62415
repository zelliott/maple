The zzso cassette (ABC) proteins are one of the largest zzso zzso zzso They are characterized by the presence of highly zzso zzso sites zzso In the present study, we identified ABC genes in zzso zzso We zzso the zzso zzso zzso with the ABC signature motif and retrieved 15 zzso zzso were classified into seven ABC families by zzso zzso Conservation of the five signature ABC motifs in the zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso of the zzso zzso of the ABC genes was examined during the blood stages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso stages of zzso zzso Our results with zzso on total zzso from blood stages demonstrated the expression of 14 ABC genes in zzso zzso and ten in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of four ABC genes was zzso
