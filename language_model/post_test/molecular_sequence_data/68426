zzso peptides show different zzso suggesting the existence of at least two zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the relationship and contribution of each zzso zzso on smooth muscle zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined in human and rabbit smooth muscle from the zzso zzso and the contribution of each of the zzso zzso to smooth muscle contraction was investigated by blocking zzso translation of either zzso B or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or of zzso 

zzso B and zzso zzso zzso were detected in human and rabbit zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso with zzso B zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso contraction, whereas incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso with zzso plus zzso B zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso response induced by zzso zzso B, and zzso 

zzso zzso B and zzso zzso zzso are present on smooth muscle cells of the zzso zzso and zzso interacts with both zzso B and zzso zzso resulting in a complex contraction that is sustained in zzso
