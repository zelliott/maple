The zzso characteristics of a zzso zzso and also the structure of the solution in the presence and absence of zzso zzso one of the strongest known protein zzso among the natural zzso both at low and high pressures, are investigated under high pressure conditions by employing the molecular dynamics simulation zzso The goal is to provide a molecular level understanding of how zzso protects proteins at elevated zzso Two different zzso of the zzso are zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso characteristics reveals that the zzso enhancement of zzso number is higher for the extended state as compared to the zzso zzso shows an opposite effect and causes more zzso of the extended zzso The total number of atomic sites that zzso zzso zzso increases in the presence of zzso whereas the number of hydrogen bonds formed by zzso with solution species reduces due to the inability of zzso to donate its hydrogen to zzso hydrogen bonding zzso In solution, both zzso and hydrogen bonding sites of zzso are found to be well zzso by water molecules and zzso of zzso enhances water structure and reduces the number of nearest identical neighbors for zzso zzso and zzso are seen to have zzso effects on water structural zzso zzso of these results for zzso mechanism of zzso are zzso
