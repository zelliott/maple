The highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were identified as in zzso zzso of the zzso Group zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso arrest, in contrast to relatively mild zzso in most other zzso gene zzso zzso belonging to the same functional group, among which is zzso zzso defects occur in both embryonic and zzso zzso during zzso The early lethal zzso is reminiscent of that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which belong to a separate functional zzso group and zzso protein zzso This finding indicates that these zzso distinct zzso complexes are both required during early mouse zzso In contrast to the strong skeletal transformation in zzso zzso mice, zzso for zzso does not affect zzso zzso However, it does aggravate the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso or zzso zzso complexes have minimal functional zzso in specific zzso despite overlap in expression zzso We show that the early zzso arrest in zzso zzso is partially zzso by genetic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso this finding implicates zzso repression of the zzso locus in early zzso zzso
