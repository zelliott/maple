At a time when zzso is threatened, we are still discovering new species, and particularly in the marine zzso zzso species boundaries is the first step to get a precise idea of zzso For zzso species which are zzso zzso using a combination of independent molecular markers is a necessary step to define separate zzso zzso zzso a cosmopolitan brittle star, includes several very divergent zzso zzso These lineages appear totally zzso in the field and studies on zzso and zzso zzso failed to find any diagnostic zzso zzso these zzso lineages may be totally zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we characterized the genetic structure of the complex in the French Mediterranean coast using sequences of zzso DNA zzso and for the first time, several nuclear DNA markers zzso and zzso The data revealed six zzso lineages corresponding to at least four biological zzso These sibling species seem to live in zzso However, they seem to display contrasted levels of genetic diversity, suggesting they have distinct demographic histories and/or zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso within the French Mediterranean coasts are revealed in three zzso as expected for a species without a free zzso zzso Finally, although zzso nuclear zzso are common within zzso zzso the data set displays a total lack of zzso suggesting a very high zzso rate, a feature likely to have zzso the formation of the species zzso
