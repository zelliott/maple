Fluorescence resonance energy transfer is a powerful zzso technique used to analyze the structure of membrane zzso Here, we used this tool to determine the distances between a distinct position within a zzso zzso and a series of distinct sites within the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having single zzso zzso zzso inserted into each of these sites were zzso The experimental strategy included the use of the full zzso zzso bound to these receptors as zzso with zzso zzso bound to the specific sites within the zzso zzso as zzso zzso was achieved by zzso of intact cells with a novel fluorescent zzso zzso A high degree of spectral overlap was observed between zzso donor and zzso zzso with no transfer observed for a series of controls representing zzso of the zzso binding site with zzso zzso and use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The measured distances between the zzso within the zzso zzso and the sites within the first zzso zzso and third zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were shorter than those directed to the second loop zzso zzso or to zzso zzso two zzso zzso These distances were zzso well within a refined molecular model of the zzso zzso that is fully consistent with all existing zzso and zzso zzso This approach provides the initial insights into the zzso of zzso loop regions of this zzso and establishes clear differences from analogous zzso in the zzso crystal zzso
