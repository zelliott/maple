zzso of zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso is controlled by core zzso zzso zzso in the core promoter region might change the activity of liver diseases through an altered zzso level of the zzso The present study was carried out to determine the diversity of zzso core promoter sequences in chronic zzso zzso 

DNA sequences in the core promoter region were determined after cloning the zzso zzso Two groups of chronic zzso carriers with zzso including five cases of zzso carriers zzso 21 zzso and eight with chronic zzso zzso 50 zzso were zzso 

zzso in the core promoter were found in three out of the zzso (11 zzso and in all eight cases in the zzso group zzso zzso While zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not found in zzso zzso at the same positions were found in all the cases of zzso group (40 zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso in the core promoter were observed in each patient in the zzso zzso 

Further studies are needed to determine whether the diversity of zzso core promoter zzso has clinical significance such as the zzso of zzso to zzso
