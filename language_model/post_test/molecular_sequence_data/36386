A rapid method for the synthesis of DNA fragments for competitive zzso analysis is zzso This procedure takes advantage of the fact that if zzso is carried out with a mixture of zzso restriction zzso fragments, only those fragments containing binding sites for both zzso zzso will be zzso Following zzso of the amplified mixture, the DNA zzso of desired size can be excised from an zzso zzso zzso and used for subsequent competitive zzso We have used this procedure to zzso deletion zzso for the rat zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and have used competitive zzso to determine the levels of this zzso in primary cultures of rat brain zzso
