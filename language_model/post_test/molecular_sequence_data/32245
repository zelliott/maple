The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed four Open reading frame zzso zzso putative zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso is approximately zzso base pair long and has been assigned as a probable zzso 1 (or 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the second zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the conversion of zzso zzso to free zzso The present work describes the functional assignment of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso through molecular zzso bacterial zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the gene zzso zzso (K zzso of the zzso protein for the zzso zzso zzso was found to be much higher zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso from other sources but in comparison V zzso ( approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso was found to be an inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of this zzso other zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) having no significant effect on the zzso zzso Like other zzso the activity of this zzso was found to be totally zzso dependent, which can be zzso partially by zzso However, unlike other zzso the zzso is zzso active at approximately 42 degrees zzso To the best of our knowledge, zzso zzso zzso has the highest zzso affinity and specificity amongst the known examples from other zzso zzso A possible application of this zzso protein in the zzso coupled zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
