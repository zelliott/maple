zzso zzso molecules are zzso zzso 19 to 24 zzso in length that have been identified recently as important regulators of gene zzso Several zzso methods have been developed to describe the target recognition mechanism by zzso We propose here a novel method to detect zzso complexes in zzso zzso As a first step, we zzso zzso on an zzso template using zzso as the zzso zzso zzso This step extends zzso and overcomes the problem of low complementary binding of zzso to their zzso zzso hybrid zzso molecules are used in a second round of reverse zzso to zzso to target zzso in a highly zzso zzso The zzso analysis of these zzso molecules demonstrated that zzso for zzso were zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of their full-length mature zzso resulted in functional zzso of target protein zzso
