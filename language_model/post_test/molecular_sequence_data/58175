zzso zzso zzso versions of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso regulatory genes zzso and rev have previously been zzso We have constructed a series of zzso zzso to zzso these genes and compare their zzso zzso The zzso activities were measured with transient zzso zzso by using a reporter which expresses an zzso zzso coli zzso fusion protein with strict dependence on zzso of both zzso and zzso Additionally, the zzso were packaged as zzso zzso and used to zzso zzso human zzso T zzso The zzso zzso cells were challenged with zzso and the effects of the zzso zzso genes were determined by measuring the levels of zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene zzso at zzso acid 41 zzso retained partial zzso activity and lacked zzso zzso A zzso gene with a premature stop zzso at zzso acid 54 zzso showed moderate zzso zzso of the reporter zzso but failed to significantly inhibit zzso zzso The zzso rev zzso with a zzso zzso showed strong zzso zzso activity both in the reporter zzso and in the zzso infection zzso The greatest zzso of zzso growth was seen when zzso was expressed under the zzso control of a human zzso zzso slightly less zzso was achieved when expression of zzso was controlled by the zzso zzso leukemia virus long terminal zzso and minimal zzso was seen when the zzso long terminal repeat controlled the zzso zzso These results demonstrate the potential utility of zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso genes for gene therapy approaches to zzso
