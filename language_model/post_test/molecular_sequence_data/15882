This paper presents results from analysis of a sample of zzso zzso zzso a malaria vaccine candidate produced in zzso coli, and discusses some zzso issues of general relevance to the characterization of such products derived from zzso DNA zzso zzso migration and zzso behavior were observed in sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso appeared to resolve four minor components from the principal band, but the minor zzso were found to consist of numerous components resolvable by zzso Western zzso zzso certain components that were not adequately stained by either zzso or silver zzso None of the techniques that were employed were individually adequate to characterize the sample, but, taken together, were adequate to characterize the sample and to identify one principal degradation zzso zzso within the zzso region decreases the zzso retention time, while degradation within the zzso segment increases the retention zzso
