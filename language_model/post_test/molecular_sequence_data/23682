zzso zzso has an absolute growth requirement for a zzso zzso This growth requirement can be satisfied in zzso by zzso zzso or the zzso zzso and zzso zzso A family of zzso termed the zzso zzso which are essential for zzso of the zzso complex, has previously been zzso A strain lacking the zzso proteins also has a residual ability to zzso zzso indicating that additional zzso contribute to zzso zzso Using a zzso affinity method an approximately 105 zzso protein was zzso zzso of the identified gene in an zzso zzso background reduced the ability of the zzso strain to zzso zzso in zzso The zzso also resulted in a reduced ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus identifying a general zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso
