To date, the association of zzso and the ecological roles of bacterial zzso in zzso remain largely zzso In particular, little is known about the community components of bacterial zzso of zzso involved in the process of zzso and zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso genes were used as functional zzso zzso bacteria with the potential to be active as zzso and zzso bacteria zzso were found in two East China Sea zzso stony coral zzso zzso and soft coral zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene library analysis demonstrated different communities of bacterial zzso in these two zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was found only in zzso zzso while both zzso and zzso genes were detected in zzso zzso which might be the result of the presence of different bacterial zzso in these two zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso were detected in both zzso suggesting that zzso might play an important role in the zzso zzso process of the zzso This study indicates that the coral bacterial zzso with the potential for zzso reduction and zzso zzso might have multiple ecological roles in the coral zzso which promotes our understanding of zzso nitrogen cycling in zzso To our knowledge, this study is the first assessment of the community structure and zzso diversity of zzso bacteria and zzso in zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso gene library zzso
