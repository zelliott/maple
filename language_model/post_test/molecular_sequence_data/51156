The gene zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso A single zzso locus was detected on an isolated zzso zzso with a size of zzso 15 zzso This gene contained zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulatory region contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences which resemble the structure of the promoter region in higher zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the gene agreed precisely with that of the major zzso zzso It was an unusual structure, much smaller than zzso from many other zzso Furthermore, all of the untranslated regions in this gene were also zzso zzso one intervening sequence zzso being only 23 zzso was shorter than any other zzso reported for zzso genes zzso zzso The position of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene corresponded closely to that of the second zzso which had been reported only for plant zzso zzso zzso routes for the evolution of zzso genes were zzso
