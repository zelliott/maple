The zzso clock is an zzso zzso zzso regulating many critical biological processes in zzso One of the key characteristics of the zzso clock is that it is zzso against temperature, maintaining an approximately zzso rhythm over a broad zzso temperature zzso Here, we tested zzso capacity of the zzso clock across a number of zzso zzso using several zzso clock reporters: leaf movement, zzso and zzso We found that leaf movement was the best temperature zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, when temperature increases, zzso rhythms of zzso and zzso zzso shorten considerably across all zzso indicating that the clock driving expression of zzso and zzso is not perfectly zzso This feature might be crucial to plants growing in a constantly changing environment, and here, we provide insight into the importance of period zzso to plant growth performance and the benefits of a flexible zzso
