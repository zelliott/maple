Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of two populations of zzso with distinct zzso pharmacological and zzso characteristics along the rabbit zzso indicating that the zzso segments of the zzso express exclusively the alpha 1 zzso of the zzso zzso whereas the collecting duct expresses an alpha zzso zzso Because pharmacological studies have shown the existence of two populations of zzso with different sensitivities to zzso in the rat cortical collecting zzso which may result from the presence in the same zzso segment of the two zzso demonstrated in the different segments of the rabbit zzso the present study was undertaken to characterize the properties of zzso along the rat zzso zzso indicate that each segment of the rat zzso contains two zzso of zzso a component highly sensitive to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso which is recognized by an zzso 3 zzso and another zzso of lower affinity for zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso which is recognized by an zzso 1 zzso Whether these two zzso zzso to different zzso of the alpha zzso of zzso zzso 1 and alpha zzso remains to be zzso
