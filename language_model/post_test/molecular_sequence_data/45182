zzso zzso is expressed on the outer membrane of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso surface zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso The zzso is zzso expressed from a single gene zzso and does not undergo zzso or phase zzso We observed that zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso strain zzso contain about fivefold more zzso zzso activity than extracts of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso see zzso a zzso B zzso zzso We confirmed and expanded upon this observation by showing that extracts of 16 random zzso zzso zzso contain various amounts of zzso activity, but, on average, zzso zzso activity than extracts of 16 zzso zzso clinical zzso representing several zzso and zzso zzso Northern and real-time reverse zzso analysis of zzso transcript levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso strains express more zzso transcript than zzso zzso zzso Although transcript levels correlate with average zzso activity observed in the two species, there was not a direct correlation between zzso transcript levels and zzso activity among individual zzso of each zzso zzso of zzso upstream zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed striking sequence differences characteristic of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso regions possess zzso and zzso elements present as single elements or as tandem repeats that exist only as single elements in the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso regions of zzso zzso strains have zzso zzso zzso elements which are absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) higher zzso zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, indicating differential expression is governed at least in part by sequence variations in the zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso use different promoters with different strengths to transcribe zzso In zzso zzso a strong zzso 70 promoter 80 zzso upstream of the zzso start site is used to transcribe zzso whereas this promoter is inactive in zzso zzso In zzso zzso a weak zzso 70 promoter at the 3' zzso of a zzso zzso zzso element 99 zzso upstream of the zzso start site is used to transcribe zzso We conclude that differential zzso expression between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is due at least in part to differential zzso gene zzso
