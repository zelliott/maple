The zzso zzso zzso factors play essential roles in general zzso and regulate alternative zzso site zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is a plant zzso of the human zzso zzso factor zzso We report here that alternative zzso regulates zzso zzso Of the five detected zzso transcripts only one encodes the full-length zzso while the other four are different zzso of the essential zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso could be committed to two alternate zzso zzso One, dependent on the alternative zzso of competing 3' zzso sites in zzso 9, generates zzso zzso and zzso The other, regulated by suppression of zzso 9 zzso zzso site zzso generates zzso and zzso The zzso pattern and molecular structure of zzso indicates an evolutionary conservation of zzso regulation between plants and zzso and suggests that the various zzso perform important zzso zzso from transient gene expression zzso indicate that alternative zzso is not an zzso mechanism used to control the transcript level of the full-length zzso The ratio of zzso zzso which are generated by alternative 3' zzso site zzso in zzso 9, is under temperature zzso The zzso increase in zzso ratio suggests a role of zzso in the adaptation to zzso zzso In addition, based on the regulated zzso of zzso zzso it is possible that some zzso functions could be determined by the zzso action of the various zzso
