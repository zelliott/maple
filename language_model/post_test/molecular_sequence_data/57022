We determined the zzso zzso and structure of the gene zzso human type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso associated with cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso specific for type II zzso we screened a panel of zzso zzso cell zzso hybrids and a separate deletion panel of zzso 3 hybrids and localized the gene to zzso Two overlapping zzso artificial zzso clones containing the full gene for type II zzso zzso were isolated, and a physical map of 117 zzso of human zzso DNA in this region of zzso 3 was zzso The gene for type II zzso was localized and oriented on this map and found to span no more than zzso zzso
