We used DNA zzso to measure zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso (a zzso labeling zzso zzso to measure protein expression in 14 strains of zzso coli adapted for hundreds of generations to zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or a zzso mixture of the zzso The two ancestors, zzso and zzso differ only in their zzso zzso and have similar zzso and protein expression zzso Changes in zzso and protein expression are observed at zzso genes depending on the evolved zzso zzso specialists carry zzso of the zzso zzso and show increased zzso and translation at zzso zzso specialists are zzso and so zzso transcribe and translate zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso However, there are two strains that carry zzso zzso are zzso and show increased zzso and translation at both zzso One is a zzso the other a zzso zzso The zzso fails to sweep to fixation because its zzso zzso competitor expresses the zzso zzso and sticks to the zzso wall, thereby preventing complete zzso zzso and translation are sometimes zzso zzso strains show increased protein expression at zzso a zzso zzso without evidence of increased zzso This suggests that zzso produced by the action of zzso on zzso may leach from cells before being zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso is an adaptation to zzso A comparison with two other long-term evolution experiments suggests that certain aspects of adaptation are zzso some are characteristic of an experimental system, whereas others seem zzso
