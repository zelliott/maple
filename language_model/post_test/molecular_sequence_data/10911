We present the first structural evidence supporting the hypothesis that the binding specificity of the winged zzso DNA binding motif is zzso by zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso the zzso which is primarily involved in the interaction with zzso Using zzso to determine secondary structural elements of a winged zzso family member, Genesis (formerly zzso and comparing these with those found in the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso we show that the major differences observed occur for zzso and the region immediately prior to zzso zzso in Genesis is slightly shorter than in zzso and, in addition, we observe an extra small zzso zzso in the region between zzso and zzso which is not found in the zzso zzso This is significant as it has been shown previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Costa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso that the zzso specificity is influenced by zzso acid zzso in this zzso
