zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso liver disease characterized by the presence of zzso zzso zzso directed primarily against the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex, the zzso chain zzso zzso complex, the zzso zzso complex, as well as the zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso response to each zzso zzso is directed to the zzso acid binding zzso However, zzso the zzso recognized by zzso to zzso has not been zzso In this study, we have taken advantage of the recently available full-length human zzso complementary DNA zzso to map this zzso In addition, another zzso binding zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, was also studied as a potential zzso recognized by zzso zzso the sequence corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction and zzso protein and then zzso zzso of 45 zzso zzso (and 52 control zzso against the zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was similarly analyzed by zzso against zzso It is interesting that zzso of patient zzso with the zzso acid binding domain of zzso completely removed all zzso with the entire protein by zzso analysis, suggesting that zzso to zzso are directed solely to its zzso acid binding zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso reacted with zzso with the majority of the response being of the zzso G zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, there was little zzso response to the zzso suggesting that the immune response was secondary because of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso does not appear to possess (or zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso This observation is consistent with structural data on this zzso
