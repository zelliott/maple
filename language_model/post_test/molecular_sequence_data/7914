zzso cellulose degradation is a zzso reaction requiring binding of soluble zzso molecules to the solid zzso Based on our studies of the zzso complex of zzso zzso (the zzso we have previously proposed that such binding can be brought about by a special zzso zzso In this zzso model, zzso (a major zzso of the zzso enhances the activity of zzso (the most abundant zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso it to the cellulose zzso We have subsequently reported that zzso contains a zzso duplicated sequence at its C zzso and that zzso contains nine repeated sequences with a cellulose binding domain zzso in between the second and third zzso In this work, we zzso the zzso mechanism by using zzso zzso zzso and various zzso zzso zzso zzso (the repeat next to zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso As analyzed by zzso gel zzso zzso through its zzso duplicated zzso formed a stable complex with zzso or zzso but not with zzso Although zzso or zzso alone did not affect the binding of zzso to zzso such binding was dependent on zzso indicating the zzso role of zzso Such zzso apparently increased the zzso activity toward zzso zzso These results substantiate the proposed zzso model and the expected roles of individual zzso zzso and the zzso duplicated sequence of zzso
