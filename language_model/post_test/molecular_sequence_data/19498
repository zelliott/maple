It has been reported that unlike the more commonly expressed zzso zzso the embryonic and zzso zzso form of zzso zzso is unable to promote cell zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the possibility that the unique zzso zzso zzso zzso might be responsible for this difference, either by binding to zzso itself and zzso the zzso site or by competing with zzso for zzso zzso zzso peptides representing the zzso a scrambled version of the zzso and sequences of the previously identified zzso site on zzso were used in in zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso It was observed that the zzso was able to bind to zzso identified previously as an in zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, to collagen IV and to zzso zzso zzso binding was, however, of very low affinity and was not significantly affected by peripheral site zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso site is not the reason for zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso site peptides for binding to zzso in zzso and the zzso was observed to inhibit cell spreading in zzso cells grown on zzso zzso zzso recognizing the known zzso zzso site reacted with the zzso suggesting structural zzso These were borne out by an examination of sequence alignments of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains part of the zzso motif seen in zzso and zzso zzso and both it and the zzso sequence bear some resemblance to collagen and zzso zzso It therefore appears likely that the zzso structural similarity to the zzso zzso site is the basis for the observed competition for zzso binding and might account for the zzso characteristics of zzso
