Extension of the zzso zzso of many zzso zzso with an zzso bond is the basis for their zzso optical zzso The presence of this zzso modification is evident in crystal structures of these zzso zzso zzso of proteins containing an zzso bond results in partial zzso zzso For the red fluorescent protein zzso the extent of zzso is zzso However, this is not the case for the blue zzso zzso zzso even though all zzso in zzso zzso contain an zzso zzso We have identified two positions around the zzso of zzso where zzso can promote or suppress the extent of zzso on harsh zzso We propose a model in which zzso of zzso is facilitated by a trans to zzso zzso of the zzso
