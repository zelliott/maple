The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso contains 42 predicted zzso zzso and the functions of 34 coding sequences could be zzso zzso analysis for the replication protein and the typical features of the origin of replication suggested that zzso replicates via the zzso zzso Among the predicted zzso we identified a zzso gene cluster (a zzso zzso zzso for the first time in the zzso zzso and a system for zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso functions and the zzso experiment showed that the genes of zzso could serve for the niche adaptations of zzso zzso zzso and make significant contributions to its viability under zzso zzso Furthermore, the relative copy number of zzso was determined to be zzso copies per zzso
