A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso root zzso zzso The identity of the zzso was established by the coincidence of the structure of the zzso protein with that zzso from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso had a zzso insert of zzso zzso and the open reading frame zzso 411 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was similar to putative partial sequences of zzso from higher plants and to the sequences of zzso from organisms as diverse as zzso and zzso The zzso sequence deduced from the open reading frame had a typical structure that is associated with the import of proteins into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso to an zzso of about zzso zzso This transcript was more abundant in roots than in leaves and was localized in the bundle sheath cells in leaf zzso Analysis of zzso DNA by Southern zzso suggested the existence of zzso for another zzso zzso
