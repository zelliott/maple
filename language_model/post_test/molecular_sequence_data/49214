Two major zzso factors are associated with epidemic strains zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso by the zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso genes reside in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene resides in a zzso zzso island zzso which has also been proposed to be a zzso zzso designated zzso In order to determine the prevalence of horizontal transfer of zzso and zzso among zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 300 strains of both clinical and environmental origin were screened for the presence of zzso and zzso In this paper, we present the comparative genetic analyses of 11 zzso zzso strains which carry the zzso zzso Seven of the 11 zzso strains have also acquired the zzso zzso sequence typing and restriction zzso length zzso analyses of the zzso and zzso zzso regions revealed that the zzso and zzso strains were genetically diverse and clustered in lineages distinct from that of the epidemic zzso The left end of the zzso in the zzso and zzso strains exhibited extensive DNA zzso In addition, several zzso zzso types characterized by novel zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso with novel zzso genes were found in these zzso These data suggest that the potentially zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains identified in our study most likely evolved by sequential horizontal acquisition of the zzso and zzso independently rather than by exchange of zzso zzso regions in an existing epidemic zzso
