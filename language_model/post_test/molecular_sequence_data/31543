zzso zzso deposit is a hallmark in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease but their mechanism of formation still remains zzso Previously we reported that a normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso oxide zzso and rapidly initiated zzso Critical zzso acids within these fragments were not zzso We now report on the interaction of four zzso with zzso - two peptides with a reversed zzso acid sequence zzso zzso and two peptides with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with polar zzso acid zzso zzso It was shown that while the inhibitor zzso zzso increased 2-3 fold for each of the zzso when compared with the normal peptides the zzso constant zzso increased between 20 and 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively at zzso K some 2-3 fold lower than the corresponding zzso zzso With temperature increase there was an increase in zzso and zzso suggesting a dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all positive indicating zzso zzso zzso associations of the zzso with the zzso By zzso analysis the efficiency of zzso transfer between zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso to zzso for the natural zzso The distance the zzso moved after interaction with zzso and zzso was zzso greater, while for zzso and zzso it was zzso greater, than with the normal zzso the zzso intensity was zzso zzso This increase in distance, fluorescent intensity and transfer efficiency illustrate an increase in interaction energy for the zzso with zzso lending support for the strategic position of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the original peptides not only for zzso of the zzso but for initiation of zzso
