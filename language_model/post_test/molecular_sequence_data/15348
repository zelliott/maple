zzso zzso is a key gene in the development of zzso To understand its function in the zzso we cloned zzso zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso including the complete coding sequence and part of the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso has at least three zzso zzso zzso with coding sequences of lengths zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 347 and 352 zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso of zzso has three zzso and differs only in second zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low levels in zzso eggs, but increased gradually in zzso eggs after laying 22 zzso zzso expression decreased in zzso zzso zzso hatched zzso After zzso interference for zzso the zzso had two zzso zzso either completely or partially absent abdominal feet from the third to sixth abdominal zzso suggesting that zzso is responsible for normal development of the third to sixth abdominal segments during embryonic zzso
