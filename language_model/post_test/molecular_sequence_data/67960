The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of zzso and growth factors in cardiac zzso rejection and zzso zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain and zzso genes in 21 zzso zzso obtained from 9 heart transplant zzso There was no statistically significant correlation between zzso gene expression and zzso although a trend toward increased zzso and zzso expression was noted with rejection (6 of 10 zzso with zzso 1 of 7 without zzso and 4 of 9 zzso with zzso none of 7 without zzso zzso zzso gene expression was detected in only 2 of 21 zzso both positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not detected in any of the zzso zzso chain zzso was found in all zzso indicating the zzso presence of T cells regardless of zzso diagnosis of zzso The zzso gene was expressed in the majority (18 of zzso of zzso and its presence was not correlated with zzso In addition to zzso for the complete coding sequence of zzso two alternatively spliced zzso for zzso were present in zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso beta genes were expressed in most zzso we determined whether zzso zzso was expressed in T zzso zzso transcripts were found in 2 of 5 zzso clones zzso Thus, zzso zzso in cardiac zzso may have been induced within the zzso or elaborated by zzso T zzso The presence of zzso for zzso a potent zzso and smooth muscle cell zzso in zzso zzso suggests that zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso
