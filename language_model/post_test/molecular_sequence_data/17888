The zzso zzso on adhesive zzso surfaces was significantly reduced by the addition of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso which was identified as the common zzso acid sequence of adhesive site of adhesive zzso The zzso effect was also observed for zzso in zzso zzso No significant effect was observed for zzso in zzso zzso These indicate that the zzso zzso mechanism operates on adhesive zzso surfaces for both cellular systems and that activated complement factor zzso zzso zzso interaction operates for zzso as the complement is zzso
