The zzso zzso recently described at positions zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso region of the G gamma zzso gene for the zzso beta S zzso was zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso We studied 108 beta S zzso and 122 beta A zzso The zzso sequence was found as zzso in all of 80 zzso bearing the zzso beta S zzso with the zzso deletion zzso zzso from the G gamma gene in 3 out of 5 zzso beta S zzso without the zzso in 1 out of 122 beta A zzso from different ethnic origins but in none of 23 beta S zzso bearing the zzso zzso or Cameroon zzso These results confirm the zzso of the zzso beta S zzso and allow a tentative evolutionary sequence for the different zzso at this locus to be zzso
