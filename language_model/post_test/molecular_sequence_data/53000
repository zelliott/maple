The zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibits great zzso diversity among different zzso of this zzso This zzso is a useful genetic marker for studying the zzso of natural zzso zzso zzso zzso One or more of these populations has been responsible for resurgent malaria now occurring in zzso This paper reports the analysis of a highly zzso region between zzso zzso blocks 5 and 6 of the zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction to amplify the DNA zzso encompassing these regions from 25 Korean zzso followed by zzso Almost all zzso acid sequences of Korean zzso were nearly identical to that of Thai zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and very similar to that of the zzso strain when compared with other zzso zzso Sri zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso repeat and a zzso type zzso acid structure was observed in all zzso This study shows that the MSP gene zzso sequence of resurgent zzso zzso in Korea is most similar to that of Thai zzso however, the Korean strains are zzso zzso
