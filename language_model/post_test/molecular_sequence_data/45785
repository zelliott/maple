New World zzso monkeys zzso zzso have high circulating cortisol levels but normal zzso and blood zzso The goal of the present study was to gain insight into zzso mechanisms used by zzso zzso monkeys to minimize the effects of high cortisol on zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso and water zzso zzso levels in serum from 10 zzso monkeys were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range in humans, 4 to 31 zzso suggesting that zzso monkeys do not exhibit a zzso increase in zzso The zzso monkey MR was cloned and expressed in zzso cells and found to have similar responsiveness to cortisol and zzso as human zzso suggesting that zzso monkey MR is not inherently less responsive to zzso To determine whether altered metabolism of cortisol might contribute to MR protection in zzso zzso serum and urinary cortisol and zzso were measured, and a comprehensive urinary zzso zzso profile was performed in samples from zzso and awake zzso zzso The levels of zzso exceeded those of cortisol in serum and zzso suggesting increased peripheral zzso zzso 2 activity in zzso zzso In addition, a significant fraction zzso zzso of total zzso zzso in the urine of zzso monkeys appeared as zzso compared with that in man zzso zzso changes in cortisol metabolism likely contribute to zzso mechanisms used by zzso zzso monkeys to minimize effects of high zzso
