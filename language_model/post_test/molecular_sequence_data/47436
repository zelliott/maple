The transfer of genetic information from the zzso to the nucleus is thought to be still zzso in higher zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains only one zzso zzso In this paper we show that the functional gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been zzso to the zzso This gene transfer is a recent evolutionary event, which occurred within zzso probably after the divergence of zzso and zzso zzso A zzso extension of the zzso reading frame encodes a zzso which, in zzso targets the zzso to isolated zzso and is zzso off during or after zzso No zzso was found at the junction of the targeting zzso with the zzso derived zzso which are directly zzso By contrast, a zzso zzso which is removed by zzso to give a mature zzso zzso of zzso zzso is located in the 3' zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of an zzso in such a position in a functional transferred gene in higher plants, and suggests that zzso zzso may have been involved in the acquisition of elements necessary for expression in the zzso zzso roles of this zzso in zzso and enhancement of gene expression are zzso
