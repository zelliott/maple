zzso zzso uses a type IV zzso system zzso to transfer zzso and zzso proteins to zzso The zzso is composed of two major structural zzso the zzso and a zzso complex that is responsible for zzso zzso across both bacterial zzso zzso protein is the major component of the zzso We used the zzso portion of zzso protein as a bait to screen an zzso zzso zzso library for proteins that interact with zzso in zzso We identified three related plant zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso with unknown functions, and a zzso zzso zzso The three zzso proteins also zzso with zzso in zzso zzso of zzso with zzso protein decreased the transformation efficiency of zzso suspension cells by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso interference zzso plants are less susceptible to transformation by zzso than are zzso zzso The level of zzso protein is zzso increased immediately after zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso protein in transgenic zzso results in plants that are zzso to zzso zzso zzso microscopic data indicate that zzso proteins zzso zzso to the periphery of root cells in transgenic zzso plants, suggesting that zzso proteins may contact the zzso zzso We propose that the three zzso proteins and zzso are involved in the initial interaction of zzso with plant zzso
