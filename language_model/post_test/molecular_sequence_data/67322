We have thoroughly investigated the zzso gene zzso zzso an zzso regulator in the zzso strain of the model zzso zzso strain zzso We report that zzso is expressed from an active but zzso promoter that possesses an extended zzso element zzso that compensates for the absence of a zzso zzso zzso the biological significance of these data, we found that the occurrence of an extended zzso promoter box and the absence of a zzso element are two zzso features in zzso genes from other zzso We also show that zzso is an zzso that is zzso to cell growth under standard laboratory zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso also zzso the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso interest, and that the zzso zzso is zzso expressed even though it possesses the two sequences resembling zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso In both the zzso promoters of the zzso gene and the zzso zzso we found a repeated DNA motif zzso which could be involved in zzso zzso Supporting this hypothesis, we found that a zzso zzso of one of these elements increased the activity of the zzso zzso We think that our zzso zzso with increased expression of the zzso zzso and zzso activity, together with the reporter plasmids we constructed to analyze the zzso gene and the zzso zzso will serve as useful tools to decipher the function and the regulation of hydrogen production in zzso
