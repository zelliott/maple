zzso zzso proteins are a group of recently discovered zzso their zzso characterization remains much zzso Here we demonstrate that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso domain at its zzso region and an extended zzso zzso zzso is mainly present in the zzso In contrast to zzso the presence of zzso cannot enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the pull-down and reverse pull-down zzso reveal that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso an essential zzso involved in energy zzso forming a zzso zzso The zzso activity zzso show that zzso activities are inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso All these data suggest that zzso is involved in energy zzso via binding to zzso and zzso activities of zzso and offer first clues to its role as a regulator of zzso zzso
