We have focused our interest on two zzso zzso named site II motif and zzso box, identified within the promoter of plant zzso cellular nuclear zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso expression of the zzso A zzso zzso association between site II motifs and zzso boxes is observed in the promoter of numerous genes expressed in cycling cells, including several cell zzso genes and 153 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene was observed in plants under the control of zzso site II motif within a minimal zzso This expression is strongly enhanced by addition of a zzso box within this zzso zzso We showed by gel zzso experiments that the site II motif is a target for several zzso activities present in zzso crude cell extract and can bind a zzso factor, zzso from the zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso experiments, zzso appears to be a potential partner of zzso which was previously shown to bind zzso zzso An important consequence of this analysis is to reveal new and zzso regulatory processes concerning the regulation of plant zzso gene expression in cycling zzso The implication of these observations in zzso zzso pathways is zzso
