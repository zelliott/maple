zzso zzso additions to a zzso zzso residual source area in deep, fractured zzso at a zzso Department of Energy site have resulted in the enrichment of the indigenous microbial community, the complete zzso of nearly all zzso zzso to zzso and the continued depletion of the residual source since zzso The bacterial and zzso zzso in groundwater obtained from the residual source were assessed by using zzso zzso zzso zzso A clone library of bacterial zzso was predominated by those from members of the class zzso zzso of 93 zzso of which a zzso most similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was most abundant (32 of 93 zzso The remaining zzso consisted of zzso affiliated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and candidate divisions zzso and zzso The two zzso zzso were most similar to those of the known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although not represented by the bacterial clones generated with zzso bacterial zzso a zzso zzso was identified with zzso zzso Only four distinct zzso were detected in the groundwater zzso library, including predominantly a clone affiliated with the strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso (24 of 43 zzso A mixed culture that completely zzso zzso to zzso was enriched from this groundwater, and both communities were characterized by terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso According to zzso the laboratory enrichment community was less diverse overall than the groundwater community, with 22 unique zzso as opposed to 43 and a higher percentage of zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso structure was very similar to that of the groundwater community, suggesting that methane is generated primarily via the zzso pathway, using zzso generated by zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso
