zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to determine the amount of zzso of the zzso gene in 52 zzso zzso coli clinical zzso that had previously characterized zzso in their zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso that create a consensus zzso box zzso are the most important factor in strengthening the zzso promoter, followed by base pair insertions that increase the distance between the zzso and zzso boxes to 17 or 18 zzso zzso in the zzso box are of lesser importance and those in the zzso region appear to have little effect on zzso zzso Three strains zzso zzso due to the effect of zzso elements located in the zzso promoter zzso Further, the data show that there is no correlation between zzso zzso and the minimum zzso concentration of zzso in clinical zzso Overall, the data indicate that a combination of zzso promoter zzso and other zzso factors combine to contribute to the magnitude of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
