The X zzso center candidate region zzso in mouse and zzso is poorly characterized for the presence of zzso zzso Only two zzso genes have been isolated to date, zzso and zzso The other known gene lying within this region, zzso has been identified so far only in zzso by analyzing the complete zzso sequence of a zzso region zzso to zzso Here, we report the characterization of an additional gene lying within this zzso zzso zzso zzso for Brain zzso zzso is a rare transcript zzso expressed in the zzso It is normally zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso its human zzso has shown the gene to be located within the zzso but zzso human zzso zzso These results suggest that the gene order of the region encompassing the zzso zzso in the mouse is similar in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso regions in mouse and human indicates that these intervals are three times longer in human than in zzso zzso is a new potential candidate for one of the zzso mental zzso syndromes mapped within the zzso region of the human X zzso zzso
