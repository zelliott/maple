The zzso zzso C gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso DNA binding protein that is a zzso zzso of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A symmetrical consensus C recognition zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso repeat separated by a zzso of five to six zzso zzso has been zzso To investigate this, we used zzso zzso to introduce random zzso within and zzso the proposed zzso zzso each zzso site was tested for C recognition by an in zzso functional zzso zzso We observed that all single zzso in either zzso reduced C zzso Although two out of ten zzso within the zzso reduced zzso the zzso region does not appear to make specific contact with zzso We also used in zzso zzso and zzso to study C contacts with zzso The results indicate that C contacts zzso DNA on only one face of the zzso through interactions within two adjacent major zzso this conclusion was supported by gel shift analyses using synthetic zzso duplexes containing zzso or other zzso zzso Evidence is also presented that zzso contacts are zzso and that they extend two zzso 3' to the zzso zzso We also show that C binding zzso a zzso possibly a zzso in zzso zzso
