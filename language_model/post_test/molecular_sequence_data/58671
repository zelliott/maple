We have investigated the extent of sequence variation in human zzso zzso zzso genes and the expression of specific zzso gene zzso in different zzso of an zzso Focusing on the fifth variable region zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we find that sequence differences between zzso genes of a single individual are characterized by differences in number of repeats of simple sequences at four specific zzso These data support and extend previous findings which show similar zzso sequence variation in zzso genes from a group of zzso We performed experiments to determine if there is differential gene expression within the zzso zzso zzso From the analysis of data of six zzso zzso zzso protected from zzso zzso by zzso isolated from different zzso of the individual, we conclude that each zzso zzso is present in a similar proportion in these zzso whereas the actual contributions of zzso zzso their relative proportion is maintained from tissue to tissue in an zzso We favor the explanation of a gene dosage effect over that of a regulated gene effect to account for this pattern of zzso gene zzso In addition, computer generated secondary structure models of each zzso clone structure predict the same three zzso structure with the regions of sequence variation contained in one zzso zzso
