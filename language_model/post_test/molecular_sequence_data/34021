Recent evidence indicates that during copper zzso stress, the roots of zzso plants manifest a higher activity of acid zzso zzso which are zzso in zzso zzso than zzso zzso To test whether the higher activity of acid zzso is the result of higher expression of acid zzso zzso we isolated partial zzso for acid zzso from two populations of zzso zzso (from zzso and zzso zzso determined their zzso zzso and designed zzso to measure changes in transcript levels during zzso zzso We also determined the growth of the plants' roots, zzso zzso and acid zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were exposed to control or 20 zzso zzso for zzso under zzso zzso The transcript level and zzso activity of acid zzso in zzso plants were both significantly higher than those in zzso plants when treated with 20 zzso Under zzso stress, the root length and root biomass of zzso plants were also significantly higher than those of zzso zzso The results suggested that under zzso stress, the expression of acid zzso genes in zzso plants of zzso zzso differed from those in zzso zzso Furthermore, the higher acid zzso activities of zzso plants under zzso stress could be due in part to elevated expression of acid zzso zzso
