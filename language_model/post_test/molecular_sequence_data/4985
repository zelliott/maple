In a previous study of B locus zzso by zzso zzso probe zzso zzso we observed 18 novel patterns in a panel of 360 zzso Four of these novel patterns were caused by zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso group, and three were available for this zzso These zzso were found in zzso Latin American, African American, and Caucasian zzso In addition, we analyzed a Caucasian subject who was found by zzso to have an unusual zzso zzso We zzso these four samples by performing amplification from zzso DNA using zzso chain reaction zzso designed to obtain zzso class I products that included zzso 2 and zzso 3 as well as the intervening zzso The amplified segments were cloned and identified by colony zzso with zzso zzso zzso sequences were obtained using an automated DNA zzso The zzso zzso differs from zzso by a substitution of zzso for zzso in position 114 and zzso for zzso in zzso zzso The new zzso zzso differs from zzso at zzso acids 94, 95, and zzso The zzso zzso was found to have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar motif exists in B locus zzso that have the zzso specificity zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso it is likely to have been generated by gene zzso Finally, the novel zzso zzso is similar to zzso except for the presence of zzso instead of zzso at position zzso Because this change exists also in zzso it is possible that zzso was derived from zzso through zzso It is of interest that a similar substitution zzso for zzso at position zzso zzso zzso from zzso and is known to determine an zzso recognized by T zzso Thus, zzso may also carry a change that is functionally relevant in zzso zzso
