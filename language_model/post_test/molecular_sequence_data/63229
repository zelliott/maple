This study isolated nine strains of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were characterized using zzso zzso gene sequencing, with zzso as the dominant strains in the zzso zzso While most strains demonstrated either high zzso capabilities or zzso capabilities, three zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed both zzso These findings contradict the previous view that zzso and zzso degradation are mutually exclusive in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso independently formed zzso zzso zzso except for zzso zzso activity test results indicated that strains zzso and zzso inhibited growth of strain zzso However, zzso zzso with zzso or zzso helped to form zzso
