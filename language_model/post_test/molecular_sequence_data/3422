zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We report the solution structure of the zzso 1 zzso domain of zzso bound to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso has a triangular geometry composed of four zzso with three intervening zzso zzso zzso serves as a scaffold for folding of the zzso alpha zzso zzso domain, which forms a zzso clamp on the zzso domain that is stabilized by extensive zzso and polar zzso The structure reveals the mechanism of specific recognition of zzso by zzso zzso and shows how zzso alpha zzso is regulated by zzso zzso
