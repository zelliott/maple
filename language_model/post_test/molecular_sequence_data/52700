zzso is an important primary zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso that binds zzso It was shown that zzso proteins from some bacteria and zzso are functionally interchangeable within the zzso and in the repression of zzso The crystal structure of bacterial zzso from zzso zzso zzso has previously been zzso 

We report here the first structure of a zzso protein from zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The overall shape of the zzso zzso differs dramatically from that of its bacterial counterpart zzso because of the different relative zzso of the zzso Two strictly zzso regions of the zzso acid zzso each belonging to one of the zzso and positioned close to each other in the zzso cavity of zzso are separated by about 25 A in zzso zzso to a significant opening of the zzso These regions are structurally highly zzso and are proposed to be the specific zzso zzso 

The unusually high zzso affinity of zzso might be explained by the exposure of its highly zzso zzso The open zzso of zzso is strongly stabilized by zzso zzso interactions and suggests that the closed zzso of zzso (as in zzso open upon zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso protein structures reveals a high zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure offers an additional zzso for fitting the zzso protein into zzso maps of the zzso zzso zzso
