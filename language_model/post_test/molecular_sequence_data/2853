The zzso structural gene of zzso zzso zzso was cloned in both zzso and zzso zzso of the cloned gene was detected in zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso by an zzso reaction utilizing zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso expressed from the cloned gene was slightly larger than native zzso zzso when produced in strains zzso and zzso but distinctly smaller in zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso did not lyse strain zzso containing the cloned zzso zzso zzso indicating that functional zzso zzso were not assembled in this zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed a coding region which when translated would produce a zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of this zzso is identical with published zzso zzso While the rest of the peptides are generally zzso common zzso are seen within potentially zzso zzso
