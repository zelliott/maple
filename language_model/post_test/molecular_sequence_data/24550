In zzso disease zzso brain, activities of protein zzso zzso which are known to be associated with zzso are compromised and are probably a cause of zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, an increase of approximately 11 zzso zzso protein in 100,000 zzso g zzso from zzso compared with zzso control brains was zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso can only account for approximately 4 zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso proteins in the diseased zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso revealed a approximately 54 zzso zzso protein to be significantly zzso in zzso compared with zzso control cases in the particulate zzso The approximately 54 zzso protein was zzso by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and identified as zzso by zzso with specific zzso mass zzso analysis and by zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso protein was zzso at zzso zzso in zzso
