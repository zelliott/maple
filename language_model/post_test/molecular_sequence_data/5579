The surface zzso envelope zzso of zzso leukemia virus zzso B zzso and zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso are highly zzso even in the variable regions zzso and zzso that have been shown to be required for zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso use different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as receptors for zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to have 10 zzso zzso and five zzso zzso The close relationship of the zzso envelopes enabled us to generate zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso envelope zzso We found that some of the zzso viruses could not use zzso or zzso proteins but could efficiently zzso specific zzso zzso proteins as zzso By studying zzso zzso tail zzso expressing zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso envelopes, we show that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso interact in a modular manner with specific zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso 4 and 5 and that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso However, this interaction is insufficient for infection, and an additional interaction between zzso zzso and zzso loop 2 is zzso Similarly, zzso infection requires interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso 4 and 5 and zzso with zzso loop 2, with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso being critical for zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso and zzso infections require two major discrete interactions between the viral zzso envelope zzso and their respective zzso We propose a common zzso mechanism for interaction between zzso envelope zzso and cell surface zzso
