The objective of this work was the application of zzso technologies for the detection and identification of reliable and robust zzso for Alzheimer's disease zzso contributing to facilitate and further improve the diagnosis of zzso Using a new method for the comprehensive and comparative profiling of zzso the differential zzso display zzso 312 zzso fluid zzso samples from zzso patients, cognitively zzso subjects and from patients suffering from other primary zzso disorders were zzso as four independent zzso zzso By combination with a cross validation zzso candidates were selected from a total of more than 6,000 different zzso signals based on their discriminating zzso Twelve candidates were identified using zzso techniques as fragments of the possibly zzso neuroendocrine protein zzso and another one as the complement factor zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso profiling and cross validation resulted in the detection of novel potential zzso with remarkable zzso and a close relation to zzso zzso
