The memory T cell pool is characterized by a substantial degree of zzso in zzso and function as well as anatomical distribution, but the underlying mechanisms remain zzso In this study we confirm that the memory zzso T cell pool in zzso and zzso mice consists of zzso subsets, as defined by surface marker expression or zzso zzso zzso sites contain significant numbers of memory zzso T cells, which are zzso and functionally distinct from their zzso zzso However, we show in this study that the zzso of zzso and zzso memory T cells is not zzso Instead, the unique properties of zzso memory T cells are acquired upon migration into zzso sites and are lost when memory T cells migrate back into zzso zzso Thus, at least some of the zzso properties may represent a transient zzso state that can be adopted by T cells belonging to a single memory T cell zzso Furthermore, such intermittent zzso during or after migration into zzso sites could provide an important zzso promoting the survival and functional competence of memory T cells in the absence of zzso
