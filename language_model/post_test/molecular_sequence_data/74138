Parkinson's disease zzso is a major neurodegenerative condition with several rare zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso function have been implicated in the zzso of zzso but the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso remain zzso zzso zzso are one cause of zzso zzso but this gene is also reported to be involved in cancer by promoting Ras signaling and suppressing zzso zzso The specific function of zzso is unknown, although it is responsive to zzso stress and may play a role in the maintenance of zzso Here, we show, using four independent methods, that zzso associates with zzso targets in cells and the brain, including zzso zzso genes involved in zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are deficient in this zzso We show that zzso is sufficient for zzso binding at zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso binds zzso but zzso after zzso zzso These data zzso a single mechanism for the zzso effects of zzso in different model systems, namely that the protein binds multiple zzso targets in an zzso zzso
