According to the zzso hypothesis of zzso the progressive zzso of zzso that occurs upon division of normal zzso cells eventually leads to cellular zzso The zzso of human cells is associated with the acquisition of a zzso maintenance mechanism which is usually dependent upon expression of the zzso zzso About one third of in zzso zzso human cell lines, however, have no zzso zzso but contain zzso that are zzso zzso The nature of the alternative zzso maintenance mechanism zzso to as zzso for Alternative zzso of zzso that must exist in these zzso cells has not been zzso It has previously been shown that abnormal lengthening of zzso zzso may occur due to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso That this is not the mechanism of the zzso long zzso in zzso cell lines was demonstrated by the finding that seven of seven zzso lines have zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso including a novel zzso that is present in zzso of normal zzso We found that two zzso cell lines have no zzso expression of the zzso zzso This shows that the zzso mechanism in these cell lines is not dependent on zzso zzso of zzso zzso via infection of these cells with a zzso zzso zzso did not result in zzso activity, indicating that their lack of zzso activity is not due to absence of zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso mechanism is not dependent on the expression of zzso and does not involve zzso in the zzso zzso
