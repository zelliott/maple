The zzso gene encodes a specific zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form of protein zzso zzso zzso cloned from human zzso libraries, is zzso by one zzso zzso composed of 10 zzso and 9 zzso with a total length of about 60 zzso The zzso start site was determined, and the zzso zzso sequence was analyzed for its potential as a zzso This region lacks a zzso sequence in the appropriate position relative to the zzso start, is very zzso and contains upstream of the zzso start four zzso sites, a feature common to many zzso zzso Based on the zzso with DNA binding consensus sequences of zzso factors, we identified in this zzso region several putative DNA binding sites for zzso factors, such as zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments with a construct containing the zzso zzso region inserted zzso of a zzso reporter gene revealed that the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso gene indeed displayed zzso activity that seems to be zzso zzso By zzso in zzso zzso and zzso the zzso gene was localized to the zzso zzso The zzso gene is positioned zzso of zzso in a region embracing several genes implicated in zzso
