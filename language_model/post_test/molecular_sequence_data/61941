In this study we examine the distribution of zzso zzso in a zzso set of zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that the total fraction of zzso zzso is roughly constant and has no discernible dependence on protein zzso This results in a decrease of the zzso of the core as the size of proteins zzso Using a zzso measure, and by comparing with sets of randomly zzso zzso we show that this change in the composition of the core is statistically significant and robust with respect to which zzso acids are considered zzso and to how buried zzso are zzso zzso with model sequences zzso for stability, while still required to retain their native state as a unique minimum energy zzso suggests that the zzso of the total fraction of zzso zzso could be a result of requiring proteins to be zzso zzso
