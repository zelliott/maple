Over 40 zzso zzso in the human zzso sodium channel gene are linked to an zzso syndrome termed genetic zzso with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso is dominant, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly zzso Here we report that zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso sodium channel zzso zzso causes a zzso zzso seizure zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso in the brains of adult zzso flies reveal a novel cellular mechanism underlying zzso zzso the zzso threshold for persistent sodium currents zzso shifts to a more negative zzso when the temperature is zzso This leads to sustained zzso in zzso zzso and reduced zzso activity in the central nervous zzso Furthermore, our data indicate a natural zzso shift in sodium current zzso zzso by zzso may contribute to zzso zzso in zzso and perhaps normal zzso
