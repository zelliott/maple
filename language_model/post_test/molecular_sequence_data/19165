Type 1 zzso are zzso zzso zzso the attachment of zzso zzso coli to zzso cells of host zzso The zzso zzso rod consists of up to zzso copies of the main structural zzso zzso that interact via donor strand zzso where the incomplete zzso fold of zzso is completed by zzso of the zzso extension zzso zzso of the following zzso zzso Recently, it was shown that zzso also exists in a zzso zzso form and that zzso zzso act as zzso of zzso in infected host zzso Here we present the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso with its natural zzso donor strand zzso the zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso in the assembled zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso fold with significantly less zzso and the natural zzso donor strand is inserted in the opposite zzso In addition, we show that a motif of two zzso zzso in the zzso donor zzso separated by five zzso is the prerequisite of the alternative, parallel donor strand zzso mechanism in the zzso zzso and that this motif is preserved in zzso zzso of many zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a unique case of a protein with alternative, functionally relevant folding possibilities, with the zzso zzso forming the highly stable zzso rod and the zzso zzso promoting pathogen propagation by zzso suppression of infected zzso target zzso
