zzso constitute a zzso of zzso motor proteins with important cellular functions ranging from zzso transport to cell zzso Some zzso family members function during the zzso phase of the zzso cell cycle and are crucial for the successful progression of cell zzso In the early stages of zzso during zzso certain zzso are required for the formation of the bipolar zzso such as zzso and zzso which seem to possess partially overlapping zzso Because zzso transform the chemical energy from zzso zzso into mechanical work, zzso of their function is a zzso approach for drug zzso Drugs targeting zzso have shown promise as zzso zzso zzso has recently come to the fore because it can substitute the functions of zzso and may itself have potential as a prospective drug zzso Here, the initial zzso kinetic and structural characterization of zzso is reported and it is compared with the functionally related motor zzso Although zzso contains zzso in the zzso site, its zzso structure was captured in the zzso zzso with the neck zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was also investigated and structural differences between these two zzso were zzso which indicate profound differences in their mode of action, in agreement with current models of zzso zzso and zzso
