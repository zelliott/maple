zzso and zzso are nuclear genes of zzso zzso whose products are localized in zzso and are required for the synthesis of zzso zzso Genes zzso to zzso are present in at least four different bacterial zzso zzso zzso The bacterial zzso termed zzso has recently been proposed to code for a zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso O zzso et zzso (1992), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this communication we report that the zzso zzso like the product of zzso is needed for zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso constituents in a zzso zzso indicate the absence of zzso A and presence of a novel zzso with zzso properties indistinguishable from those of zzso zzso This evidence suggests that the zzso protein may be another zzso A zzso zzso involved in forming the zzso group at position 8 of the zzso zzso
