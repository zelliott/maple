zzso the changes of aquatic microbial community composition in response to changes in temperature and ultraviolet zzso is relevant for predicting zzso modifications in the functioning of natural microbial communities under global climate change zzso zzso we investigate shifts in the zzso composition in response to long-term changes in temperature and zzso zzso For this purpose, 15 zzso were seeded with composite aquatic microbial communities from natural pools within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were subject to different temperatures and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene clone libraries were obtained from water samples at the zzso (4 zzso and the end of the experiment (8 zzso An increase in bacterial diversity over time was found in the treatment of constant temperature and zzso protection, which suggests that stable environments promote the establishment of complex and diverse bacterial zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso composition and structure were observed in response to fluctuating temperature and increasing zzso radiation and zzso zzso temperature induced the largest decrease of bacterial richness during the experiment, indicating that frequent temperature changes drive the reduction in abundance of several species, most notably zzso The long-term impact of these environmental stresses reduced diversity and selected for zzso aquatic bacterial zzso such as zzso These changes at the community level occur at an ecological time scale, suggesting that under global warming scenarios cascade effects on the food web are possible if the microbial diversity is zzso
