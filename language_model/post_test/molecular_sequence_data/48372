In order to characterize the vertical variation of abundance and community composition of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso in sediments of a zzso lake, Lake zzso molecular techniques including real-time zzso clone library, and sequencing were carried out in this zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso to zzso copies zzso dry zzso were higher than those of bacterial zzso gene zzso from zzso to zzso copies zzso dry zzso for all samples and both of them exhibited negative correlations with the increased zzso zzso of zzso and bacterial zzso gene increased with the elevated zzso There were no significant variations of zzso community structures derived from different zzso zzso whereas obvious differences were observed for the zzso community zzso The information acquired in this study would be useful to zzso the roles of zzso and zzso in the nitrogen cycling of freshwater zzso
