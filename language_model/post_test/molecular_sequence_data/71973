zzso virus zzso replication depends on two viral components for zzso the zzso zzso proteins zzso in zzso and zzso terminal repeat zzso sequences in zzso zzso type 5 zzso is a distinct virus compared to the other cloned zzso zzso Whereas the zzso proteins and zzso of other zzso are interchangeable and can be used to produce zzso viral particles of a different zzso zzso zzso proteins cannot zzso in the packaging of a zzso with an zzso zzso In zzso replication zzso indicated that the block occurs at the level of replication instead of at viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding activities demonstrate similar affinities for either an zzso or zzso zzso however, comparison of terminal resolution site zzso zzso activities showed a difference in specificity for the two DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso only a type 2 zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso only a type 5 probe zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso identified a distinct zzso site zzso zzso which is absent from the zzso of other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 19 integration locus identified some zzso zzso downstream of the zzso site but little zzso zzso
