zzso zzso zzso represent a family of zzso zzso that modify the zzso activities and zzso of zzso compounds and zzso A novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso was previously isolated from zzso To compare the zzso properties of zzso with that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso high level expression of zzso zzso was achieved in this study with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso that represented zzso of total zzso coli zzso zzso by zzso zzso on zzso yielded more than 2 zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso exists as a zzso of zzso zzso by gel zzso zzso zzso prefers zzso as zzso and does not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso possessed zzso and zzso values of 3 zzso zzso and 160 zzso zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso is zzso since its activity was reduced upon zzso at 37 degrees zzso These results indicate that zzso shows similarities and differences compared to zzso and zzso zzso zzso prefers zzso as zzso is sensitive to zzso by zzso and is zzso in contrast, zzso prefers zzso as zzso is not sensitive to zzso and is zzso The distinct profile of zzso properties of zzso and its primary sequence zzso to zzso and zzso suggests that zzso represents a novel zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso this study demonstrates that high level expression of zzso allows determination of distinguishing characteristics of zzso forms of zzso
