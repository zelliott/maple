The zzso pathogen zzso zzso is capable of undergoing structural and zzso phase variation in its zzso zzso components after in zzso and in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso from the zzso tract have not been observed to vary in phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report that specific zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso reacted with some zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso bound to LOS components of about zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso including a zzso zzso Following in zzso passage of a zzso zzso of strain zzso that was zzso with the zzso zzso of young colonies shifted to a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso probe zzso to zzso DNA from strain zzso but did not react with DNA from a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the gene containing zzso tandem sequences revealed zzso zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso type zzso Our results indicate that some LOS zzso are zzso between zzso zzso and other zzso and zzso species, that LOS phase variation may occur at a high rate in some strains of zzso zzso and that phase variation may, in part, be due to zzso tandem sequences present in zzso zzso zzso
