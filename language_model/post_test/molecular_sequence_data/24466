zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso are zzso produced primarily by zzso and zzso with regulatory effects in inflammation and multiple aspects of the immune zzso As yet, no molecular data have been reported for zzso and zzso of the beluga zzso In this study, we cloned and determined the entire zzso sequence zzso beluga whale zzso and zzso The genetic relationship of the zzso sequences was then analyzed with those from several zzso species, including the human and the zzso The zzso of beluga whale zzso zzso acid and deduced zzso acid sequences with those from these zzso species ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, whereas that of zzso varied from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso analyses based on deduced zzso acid sequences showed that the beluga whale zzso and zzso were most closely related to those of the zzso species zzso zzso and zzso The beluga whale zzso and zzso sequences were thereafter successfully expressed in zzso coli as fusion proteins by using zzso expression zzso The fusion proteins were used to produce beluga whale zzso and zzso rabbit zzso
