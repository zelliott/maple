zzso zzso zzso the intricate network of zzso signaling pathways and contributes to the onset of diseases such as zzso Although several zzso zzso are on the market, inhibitor selectivity and drug resistance zzso persist as fundamental challenges in the development of effective long-term zzso Chemical entities binding to less zzso zzso sites would be expected to offer new opportunities for scaffold zzso Because no zzso method was previously available, we developed a zzso zzso binding zzso for identifying and characterizing zzso which stabilize the inactive zzso zzso Here, we present a description of the development and validation of this zzso using the zzso zzso zzso By zzso attaching zzso to the zzso loop of the zzso we were able to detect zzso changes and measure the zzso zzso and zzso associated with the binding and zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso We report the zzso of a zzso focused library of zzso zzso a scaffold known to bind with high affinity to the zzso pocket of zzso Additionally, we used protein X-ray zzso together with our zzso to examine the binding and zzso zzso to characterize potent zzso and zzso type II zzso which also zzso this binding pocket in zzso zzso we identified the zzso inhibitor zzso as a potent low zzso inhibitor of zzso and used protein X-ray zzso to confirm a unique binding mode to the inactive zzso zzso
