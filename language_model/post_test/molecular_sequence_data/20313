The system zzso zzso plays an essential role in the transport of zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso Its molecular correlate has been identified and named zzso or zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso showed it to be zzso and zzso but the zzso remained zzso Using zzso modeling along the structure of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso we identified two highly zzso zzso sites and a putative zzso zzso zzso of all zzso in the two proposed zzso sites revealed that most of them were essential for zzso and completely zzso the zzso However, zzso zzso zzso site 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso site 2) were partially active and characterized zzso zzso studies suggested that zzso of zzso site 1 caused a decrease of the zzso whereas zzso of site 2 increased the zzso zzso of zzso site 1 also changed the zzso selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso actively zzso zzso demonstrating that the proposed zzso binding site is used in the zzso zzso experiments and flux zzso at different holding zzso showed that the zzso can work as a zzso zzso The proposed zzso model allows to study zzso in zzso associated with zzso
