The human zzso gene is responsible for the X zzso zzso syndrome, which consists of an association between zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso Additional symptoms are occasionally zzso The zzso zzso is associated with zzso of the zzso bulbs and zzso The zzso may be due to a zzso in the embryonic migratory process of zzso zzso from the zzso pits up to the zzso The human and chicken zzso genes have been zzso From the zzso acid sequences zzso it has been zzso that the zzso protein is an zzso zzso zzso with putative zzso activity and zzso zzso Various point zzso and, in a few cases, deletions of zzso have been detected in zzso By in zzso zzso zzso expression has been studied during embryonic development in the zzso From embryonic day 2 zzso to zzso the zzso gene is expressed in various zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the expression from zzso is almost entirely restricted to zzso zzso populations in the central nervous system, most of which still express the gene after zzso According to such a zzso pattern of zzso we suggest that the zzso gene is involved both in zzso events and in late zzso differentiation and/or zzso zzso With respect to the zzso system, the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso bulbs from zzso zzso In contrast, no expression of the zzso gene is detected at any stage in either the embryonic zzso zzso or the surrounding zzso zzso zzso assuming that similar conditions are found in the human zzso we suggest that the zzso anomaly in zzso zzso syndrome results from a central target cell zzso Current hypotheses regarding the zzso of the zzso zzso are also zzso In zzso zzso experiments in the human zzso as well as characterization of the zzso zzso are in zzso
