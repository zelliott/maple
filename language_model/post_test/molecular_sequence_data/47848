The zzso zzso of the breast cancer zzso gene product zzso has been zzso zzso results have been reported during the past 3 years, partially because of the unavailability of highly specific zzso for zzso zzso Our objective was to characterize the zzso zzso that is detected in human seminal plasma by using zzso and zzso zzso that are supposedly specific for zzso zzso 

We used zzso zzso and protein sequencing techniques to detect the zzso of zzso in seminal plasma and to purify and partially identify the zzso zzso 

We present data indicating that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were thought to be free of zzso strongly interact with proteins present in human seminal zzso This zzso is zzso even at seminal plasma zzso as high as zzso and it is effectively blocked by peptides that capture the binding site of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso and characterization of the zzso compound revealed that this consists of a zzso complex that contains zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso with zzso zzso I and zzso the zzso zzso zzso appeared to recognize a component of the zzso complex that was not zzso 

Our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly interact with seminal plasma proteins and are not highly specific for zzso zzso It is thus suggested that zzso zzso should be used with caution until zzso free of interference are developed and zzso In light of the very high zzso of the two zzso with seminal plasma zzso we recommend that new zzso zzso should be examined for zzso with seminal plasma proteins to verify zzso
