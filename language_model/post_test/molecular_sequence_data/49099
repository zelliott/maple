Factor I is a novel zzso zzso that regulates complement zzso Here we report the complete primary structure of two zzso factor Is isolated from the common carp ( zzso zzso a zzso zzso A carp zzso zzso library was screened using two zzso zzso fragments zzso part of the carp factor zzso zzso zzso zzso Two distinct zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso Their deduced zzso acid sequences share zzso identity with each zzso zzso has a typical factor zzso domain organization composed of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso contains a novel sequence of 115 zzso acids inserted at the zzso of the zzso zzso Southern zzso suggests that zzso and zzso are zzso by distinct genes in the carp zzso zzso analysis by zzso revealed that the major site of zzso expression is the zzso whereas zzso expression is detected mainly in the zzso at a level higher than that of zzso The present data, taken together, suggest that carp have duplicated genes coding for factor I, and zzso with the novel zzso plays a dominant role in the complement zzso In addition, zzso search of the zzso zzso database using the carp zzso and zzso sequences identified a putative zzso factor I zzso which has an zzso organization different from that of the human zzso
