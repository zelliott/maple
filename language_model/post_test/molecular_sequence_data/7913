We describe a zzso zzso analog of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of the zzso zzso receptors found on locust zzso zzso competitively zzso zzso zzso binding to both zzso and zzso receptors of membrane zzso zzso mimics the zzso effects of zzso on locust zzso by zzso zzso and induced zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is therefore recognized by the binding and zzso regions of the zzso zzso This discovery provides a unique opportunity within insects to finally target a zzso zzso for the development of future zzso management zzso
