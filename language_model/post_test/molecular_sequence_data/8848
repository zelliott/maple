zzso proteins are essential for zzso zzso in zzso act early in the zzso pathway, and can influence alternative zzso site zzso Here we describe the isolation of both dominant and zzso zzso of zzso the gene for a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified as a dominant zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the second zzso of the eye pigmentation gene white with a complex zzso zzso zzso also exaggerates the zzso zzso of a distinct white zzso carrying a zzso zzso site zzso zzso and alters the pattern of zzso zzso at zzso under zzso conditions, so that the zzso zzso is zzso In addition to being a dominant zzso of these zzso zzso zzso is a zzso lethal zzso that fails to complement other lethal zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso from which it was derived revealed a single change in a zzso zzso acid in the beta 4 strand of the first zzso domain of zzso which suggests that altered zzso binding is responsible for the dominant zzso zzso of the zzso dominant zzso with X rays led to the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso Together, these results indicate a critical role for the zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso in zzso
