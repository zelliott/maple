A 1 zzso zzso restriction zzso cloned from a band visible in an zzso gel of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA is present in both zzso of zzso with at least zzso zzso A full-length copy of this repeated element recovered from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA library was found to possess all of the sequence features associated with zzso zzso This report describes the biology and history of the zzso zzso of Forest zzso family of zzso The characterized zzso is zzso zzso zzso Immediately interior to its zzso and 3' long terminal repeats are sequences consistent with primer binding sites for reverse zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene products associated with zzso appear to be coded in a single reading frame and are in the same order as the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso elements codes for the 3' half of zzso reverse zzso and the entire zzso H zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests zzso was present in zzso before its division into its modern zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments and southern analysis also suggest that zzso continued to evolve in zzso with restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso appearing early in the history of each zzso often zzso with subdivisions of zzso Features shared with other plant zzso are also zzso
