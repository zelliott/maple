We have cloned the gene zzso the zzso membrane zzso zzso which is recognized by the zzso zzso The zzso is strongly expressed in prostate cancer, and the zzso has been approved for use as an imaging agent for detection of zzso cancer zzso The gene was unique and zzso a type II membrane zzso The only clue to its potential function was found in the zzso coding sequences from zzso to zzso which had a modest but significant zzso with zzso demonstrating a zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso In comparing the zzso obtained from normal prostate with that obtained from zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the prostate zzso cells, normal cells produced a shorter alternative spliced species that zzso a zzso form of the zzso and not a membrane zzso It appeared that, as the zzso cells became zzso there was a nearly zzso difference in expression of the ratio of the messages zzso the 2 forms, with the zzso form zzso zzso in normal cells and the membrane form zzso zzso in cancer zzso The other tissue in which the membrane zzso form of zzso is highly expressed is the membrane brush border of the small zzso of the zzso but not zzso small zzso This is the location of a unique membrane form of a folate zzso This membrane folate zzso and its location are necessary in human nutrition because humans require zzso and the folate in foods is zzso zzso zzso cannot be taken into the cells by zzso zzso The ability to take up folate from foods requires the membrane folate zzso to zzso remove the zzso zzso freeing folate that can then be zzso zzso zzso has a similar folate zzso zzso Others have reported finding an zzso in the rat brain that functions as an zzso and acts on the abundant brain zzso zzso to generate zzso and zzso The zzso of the rat brain zzso had zzso sequence zzso with zzso zzso Because this zzso zzso zzso in the brain, the zzso is considered to have regulatory activity related to zzso zzso Current investigations are zzso to determine whether zzso receptors are present in zzso Thus, zzso zzso is a unique folate zzso that can release zzso with either zzso zzso Its zzso activity raises a number of questions for zzso In the normal prostate where the protein is zzso is zzso zzso keeping folate in zzso zzso If so, folate should be able to readily diffuse out of prostate cells, making the prostate zzso an organ at risk for localized folate zzso and zzso In prostate tumor cells, with the zzso outside of the cell, can zzso zzso be used for the zzso of zzso zzso
