Tomato plants grown in zzso in Thailand developed typical symptoms of a tomato yellow leaf zzso Thailand virus zzso zzso After confirmation by zzso a zzso DNA zzso approach was chosen for further molecular analysis of zzso Total DNA zzso from infected tomato leaves was subjected to zzso amplification zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso In addition, a new zzso zzso with a putative zzso background was identified by RCA and tentatively named tobacco leaf zzso Thailand virus zzso To confirm the composition of both zzso full-length clones were established and used for zzso of zzso zzso by particle zzso or zzso When zzso zzso and zzso were applied together by particle zzso or zzso severe zzso zzso and leaf zzso were zzso Whereas zzso zzso and zzso revealed no infection zzso zzso similar symptoms in zzso zzso like leaf upward zzso and zzso were observed following zzso components of zzso zzso and zzso were excised from their respective zzso zzso and amplified by zzso DNA zzso The ability of viral zzso zzso was evaluated in particle zzso experiments on zzso zzso Thus, particle zzso of zzso zzso products proved to be at least as effective as zzso with a partial repeat construct and tenfold as effective as zzso with excised zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso when using each DNA component in an amount of 5 zzso
