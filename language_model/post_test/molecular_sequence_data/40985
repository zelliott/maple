zzso promote zzso zzso by exchanging zzso for zzso on zzso zzso and delivering zzso to growing filament barbed zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso invade host cells using an zzso gliding zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 generates an innate immune response upon sensing zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso reveals a zzso surface motif consisting of an zzso loop, followed by a long zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso show that zzso recognition of the zzso loop is responsible for most of the zzso zzso zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso loop and the zzso completely abrogates zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso loop and zzso into zzso zzso is sufficient to generate zzso zzso zzso of the zzso loop in zzso with the zzso loop from the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso zzso while substitution with the zzso loop from zzso zzso results in reduced but significant zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso motif in zzso is the key molecular pattern recognized by zzso Unlike other zzso zzso slows zzso exchange on zzso rabbit zzso and binds rabbit zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso surface includes the zzso and zzso widely from the zzso surfaces of zzso zzso
