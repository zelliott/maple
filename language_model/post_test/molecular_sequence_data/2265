The zzso lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta often results from zzso which disrupt stable zzso delay zzso and cause excessive zzso modification of type I zzso zzso One such zzso was efficiently characterized by an indirect method of zzso sequence zzso The zzso initially was localized in zzso by mapping the distribution of abnormal zzso modification within the triple zzso domain of zzso zzso Total zzso was isolated from osteogenesis imperfecta cells in culture, zzso was zzso using alpha zzso and alpha zzso specific zzso and fragments of zzso suspected to harbor the zzso were amplified by the zzso chain reaction technique and then cloned in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the amplified zzso revealed a new, zzso zzso substitution at zzso 256 of the triple zzso domain of alpha zzso chains produced by the zzso lethal osteogenesis imperfecta zzso The nature and location of the zzso were confirmed by sequence analysis of amplified zzso zzso A zzso substitution has not previously been associated with the lethal form of osteogenesis zzso and this zzso has the most zzso location within the alpha zzso chain triple zzso domain reported to zzso
