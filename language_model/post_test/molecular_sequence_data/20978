zzso is essential for extreme radiation tolerance in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso has three zzso genes zzso zzso zzso that code for two different zzso proteins zzso zzso Moreover, and in contrast to other zzso zzso species, zzso zzso possesses zzso of zzso synthesis zzso DNA zzso including zzso and zzso Together with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a gene cluster similar to a widespread zzso zzso zzso After having developed genetic tools, we have constructed zzso strains to characterize these zzso and zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are functional and allow zzso zzso to survive, and thus repair massive DNA damage, after exposure to high doses of zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso which requires zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso but not zzso zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso following zzso zzso We propose that the extra zzso and zzso genes may provide higher levels of zzso protein for efficient zzso repair of DNA damage, without further increasing zzso zzso bypass by zzso and zzso whereas limited zzso may contribute to adaptation to harsh conditions by generating genetic zzso
