A zzso clone coding for the guinea pig zzso B4 zzso zzso has been isolated from a lung zzso zzso The guinea pig BLT zzso has an open reading frame corresponding to 348 zzso acids and shares zzso and zzso identity with human and mouse BLT zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso prepared from guinea pig and human BLT zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso cells showed that both receptors displayed high affinity for zzso B4 zzso value of approximately zzso zzso and were expressed at high levels zzso values ranging from 9 to 12 zzso zzso The rank order of potency for zzso and related zzso in competition for zzso B4 specific binding at the zzso guinea pig BLT zzso is zzso B4 zzso zzso B4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the human zzso the rank order of zzso zzso B4 and zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter gene zzso were used to demonstrate that the guinea pig and human BLT receptors can couple to both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso However, in the case of the zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with either the guinea pig or human BLT zzso expression of zzso was required to achieve a robust zzso driven zzso zzso B4 was a potent zzso in functional zzso of both the guinea pig and human BLT zzso zzso a zzso B4 analogue which possesses both zzso and zzso properties behaved as a full zzso of the guinea pig and human BLT receptors in zzso cells and not as an zzso The zzso guinea pig BLT zzso will permit the comparison of the intrinsic zzso of zzso B4 zzso zzso used in guinea pig in zzso models of allergic and inflammatory zzso
