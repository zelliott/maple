This investigation was based on 23 zzso from several European countries collected over the past 30 years, and included characterization of all zzso Published data on amplified zzso length zzso typing of zzso representing all zzso as well as protein profiles were used to select strains that were then further characterized by zzso profiling and sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed a zzso group within the avian zzso zzso group of the zzso which currently includes the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five zzso zzso related to zzso zzso were recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence zzso zzso similarity between strains of the five zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso calculated from zzso sequences allowed us to zzso them within the zzso zzso In addition, zzso data including zzso traits, protein profiling and zzso patterns clearly indicated that these zzso are zzso Major zzso diversity was observed for zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Furthermore, comparison of zzso similarities, zzso data and published data on amplified zzso length zzso and protein profiling revealed that each of the five groups present unique properties that allow the proposal of three novel species of zzso for which we propose the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso 3 of zzso and an unnamed zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
