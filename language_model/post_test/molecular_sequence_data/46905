We report here the isolation of two zzso of a novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso A of zzso Da and B of zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The two molecules display zzso activity against zzso bacteria, whereas only zzso B is active against the fungus zzso zzso and a zzso bacteria zzso coli zzso Complete zzso sequences were determined by a combination of zzso degradation, mass zzso and zzso cloning using a zzso zzso zzso The mature zzso named zzso comprise 40 zzso with four zzso zzso bridges and a zzso array in the primary structure different to that of the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the cloned zzso revealed that zzso precursors consist of 96 zzso acids with a putative signal zzso of 20 zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso zzso This structure suggests that zzso are zzso as zzso and then processed by various zzso events before storage of the active zzso in the zzso zzso precursors are expressed mainly in the zzso as revealed by Northern zzso zzso
