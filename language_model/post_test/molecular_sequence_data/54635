We report the development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso for differential diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso gene were aligned and new zzso were designed based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for canine zzso zzso were then designed manually based on the variable region between the zzso zzso Specifically, zzso were designed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each probe showed high specificity as no zzso with any amplified zzso zzso was zzso We evaluated the zzso using 49 zzso zzso samples collected from dogs in zzso DNA from 5 to 10 eggs was extracted in each zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso the zzso successfully detected zzso products from zzso zzso in 42 samples, zzso zzso in 3 samples, and both species zzso zzso in the remaining 4 zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is a reliable alternative for differential diagnosis of zzso eggs in zzso zzso
