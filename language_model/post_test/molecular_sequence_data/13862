A bovine zzso zzso library was constructed with randomly sheared zzso zzso of this zzso DNA library with CA or zzso zzso resulted in zzso positive zzso The zzso of positive clones with zzso zzso 12, and not containing zzso repetitive zzso were zzso and the efficiency of marker production was compared with random zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences and zzso information are presented for 390 zzso bovine zzso zzso The zzso frequency for 11 zzso and zzso repeats was estimated by zzso to a zzso zzso zzso Only zzso zzso and zzso were estimated to have a frequency of zzso 100 per zzso zzso of the zzso library for these repeats failed to provide a viable source of zzso markers in the zzso zzso of map zzso lengths between 100 markers from the enriched library prepared from randomly sheared DNA and zzso zzso libraries prepared from zzso restriction zzso suggested no bias in skeletal zzso coverage based on source of small insert zzso In conclusion, enrichment of the bovine zzso library provides a sufficient source of zzso so that small repeat lengths and zzso repetitive sequences common in the bovine can be zzso resulting in a high percentage of zzso zzso
