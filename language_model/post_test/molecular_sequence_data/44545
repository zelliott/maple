The zzso protein genes of five zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with different disease manifestations were cloned and zzso The viruses represented two recent zzso from cats with chronic zzso one recent isolate from a cat with acute zzso one recent isolate each from a cat with acute respiratory symptoms and the classical limping syndrome strain zzso The zzso acid sequences were compared with eight other published sequences and analyzed for their zzso zzso analysis of the complete zzso protein sequences or of known zzso regions of that protein zzso regions A and zzso did not group the zzso of different disease manifestations in distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso generated against either a chronic zzso isolate or a recent isolate associated with respiratory symptoms were tested against a panel of 11 recent zzso and four zzso zzso zzso covering all known disease zzso With those zzso no obvious zzso with respect to disease manifestation could be zzso Four specific zzso prepared in rabbits against our zzso zzso also failed to cluster those zzso according to the disease manifestations when examined in zzso zzso From these zzso and genetic analyses of the zzso protein the hypothesis of the existence of zzso of zzso responsible for distinct disease manifestations could not be zzso
