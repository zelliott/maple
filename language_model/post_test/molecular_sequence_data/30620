To determine the influence of zzso repair on the distribution of zzso zzso zzso we have zzso the DNA sequence changes of zzso induced at the zzso gene of zzso coli in a zzso zzso The zzso specificity was similar to that found in the zzso zzso Base zzso zzso zzso transitions accounted for almost zzso of the zzso events, while zzso zzso constituted approximately zzso of the zzso In both strains the distribution of zzso transitions was zzso but the site specificity of the zzso transitions appear zzso with the hot and cold sites occurring at different zzso A single - 1 zzso was recovered in each strain but deletion events were absent in the zzso zzso The complexity of the zzso of zzso might reflect the differential repair of zzso and zzso zzso
