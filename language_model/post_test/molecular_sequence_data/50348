The zzso protein zzso has been expressed in zzso coli in an zzso soluble zzso Like mature zzso from rabbit zzso zzso the zzso produced zzso zzso zzso in zzso forms an zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso bonds and binds zzso under reducing zzso In order to analyze the zzso and the reduction dependence of zzso binding in more detail, we separately replaced zzso 3 and zzso 69 by zzso Under reducing conditions, both zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind zzso with the same affinity as the zzso suggesting that both zzso zzso are not directly involved in zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso both zzso zzso also bind zzso with high affinity in the absence of reducing zzso In addition, zzso and zzso both form zzso linked zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso bonds exist in zzso and zzso zzso These data together with computer models based on X-ray zzso data strongly support the idea that zzso reaches its binding site located in an internal zzso cavity via a zzso tunnel along zzso 1 and zzso Under zzso conditions the tunnel is closed by two zzso bridges zzso and zzso that lie in the most flexible region of the zzso Reduction or replacement of a zzso zzso enables zzso changes that open the channel allowing zzso to zzso
