Among the zzso zzso sequences zzso in the human zzso are one or more zzso segments that are active zzso zzso of these zzso appears to be favored in cells of germ line origin, as well as in some other tumor cells of zzso zzso In such cells, the product of the first zzso open reading frame zzso a protein called zzso is zzso zzso has no apparent similarity to gag zzso but contains a zzso zzso region which may be responsible for the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso 1 although the zzso regulatory regions are downstream in the first 670 zzso of the zzso untranslated zzso deletion of a zzso site in the first 20 zzso reduces zzso by zzso zzso of the second ORF, which encodes reverse zzso is independent of the translation of the frame zzso zzso
