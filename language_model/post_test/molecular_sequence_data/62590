To identify candidate genes involved in the aggressive behavior of worker zzso we used the differential display method to search for zzso exclusively detected in the brains of aggressive workers that had attacked a zzso We identified a novel, zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso that shares structural features and sequence similarities with various zzso virus zzso especially those from zzso virus, which zzso zzso The zzso protein contains several zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of various zzso virus zzso When the worker bee tissue zzso was subjected to zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso except for the material at the bottom, was separated into two major zzso One of the zzso corresponded to the position of zzso zzso and the other corresponded to the position of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso exists as an zzso free zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso Furthermore, injection of the zzso zzso from the attacker heads into the heads of zzso bees resulted in a marked increase in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of a novel zzso virus and that the brains of aggressive workers are infected by this novel zzso zzso zzso was detected in aggressive workers but not in nurse bees or zzso In aggressive workers, zzso zzso was detected in the brain but not in the zzso or abdomen, indicating a close relation between viral infection in the brain and aggressive worker zzso
