zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor of the zzso family that associates with the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso is most abundant in the prostate zzso where the protein is produced in zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso could play an important role in prostate cancer because its expression is zzso by zzso in zzso prostate cancer cells and the protein is more abundant in zzso than in zzso prostate zzso We recently added 74 zzso and 43 specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso to our survey of zzso expression in prostate zzso This study showed that zzso is expressed in all grades of zzso and that it is more abundant in high-grade zzso and in zzso than in normal zzso The zzso function of zzso remains unknown but its association with the zzso and its structural zzso to zzso factors such as zzso suggest that zzso could be activated by regulated zzso zzso during the cellular response to zzso zzso This review will describe the characteristics of human and zzso zzso its relationship to prostate cancer, and our recent efforts to characterize the zzso properties and targets of zzso
