zzso represent a new class of infectious zzso The zzso prion protein zzso is known as the trigger of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, an oral transmission of zzso and an ensuing infection seems to be blocked in zzso such as zzso Several investigations zzso that the zzso protein zzso zzso previously named zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso is the candidate for binding and zzso of zzso added cellular prion protein in the zzso We isolated a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that consists of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a 295 zzso zzso The alignment of zzso zzso protein zzso sequences displayed zzso differences between cattle and pigs at positions zzso and 272 in the putative indirect zzso interaction site zzso zzso on zzso A zzso library screen revealed the existence of two processed zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of one zzso zzso zzso The zzso have been assigned to zzso and zzso by hybrid panel analyses and zzso Compared with the zzso zzso 3, 7, and 13 zzso 36, 25, and 57 single zzso exchanges and 6, 10, and 8 premature stop zzso have been zzso for zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso like regions, 2 zzso 10 zzso and 4 zzso repeats have been zzso Basically, the repeats belong to one of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that the pig zzso contains multiple copies of the zzso sequence probably as a consequence to maintain the zzso of the mature zzso
