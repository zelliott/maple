zzso zzso defects can cause severe zzso To examine the possibility that zzso zzso defects are a common cause of such deficiencies, we have determined the coding sequence of the zzso zzso gene in nine patients with severe zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso coding sequence predicts a normal zzso acid sequence for the zzso zzso of eight of the nine patients, indicating that the observed defects in zzso are infrequently caused by zzso of the zzso frame of the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the importance of family history and zzso studies in identifying patients likely to harbor coding sequence zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and they serve to focus attention on other genes that may influence zzso action in this group of zzso
