zzso is a zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso insert cloned from zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was determined, and the sequence information was used to design zzso for application of the zzso chain reaction zzso to the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of citrus bacterial zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso were designed and tested with DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and other strains of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso as templates in the zzso Four primer pairs directed the amplification of target DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso strains but not from strains of zzso zzso associated with a different disease, citrus bacterial zzso zzso pair 2-3 directed the specific amplification of target DNA from zzso A but not other zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso A pH zzso buffer that contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso gelatin was absolutely required for the successful amplification of the target DNA, which was zzso zzso Limits of detection after amplification and gel zzso were 25 zzso of zzso target DNA and about 10 cells when Southern blots were made after gel zzso and zzso with zzso zzso This level of detection represents an increase in sensitivity of about zzso over that of dot zzso with the same zzso zzso zzso products of the expected sizes were amplified from DNA extracted from zzso zzso from which viable bacteria could not be zzso These products were confirmed to be specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso by Southern zzso This zzso detection protocol will be a useful addition to current methods of detection of this zzso which is currently the target of international zzso zzso
