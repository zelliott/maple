Since the early 1980s, zzso sequence similarity search has become of major importance to zzso and the need for fast and efficient tools grows with the size of zzso Two programs use the strategy of finite state deterministic zzso to accomplish these zzso One of these two is zzso which is now widely used, and the other zzso which has just been zzso The differences and similarities in their basic principles, their use and their performances are zzso in this paper in order to allow optimal use of these important zzso
