We recently reported the existence of zzso zzso zzso to zzso T zzso cancer vaccine peptides derived from zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of healthy zzso The zzso class of these zzso was either lacking or unbalanced in zzso zzso patients, although the induction of a specific zzso by zzso vaccination was correlated with long survival in cancer patients, suggesting its positive role in the host zzso To understand the biological features of these zzso we employed zzso models due to the sequence zzso of these peptides in human and zzso Both zzso and zzso classes of these zzso zzso were detected in all of the zzso mice zzso however, only zzso was found in zzso zzso mice, and not in zzso zzso Maintenance of zzso mice under zzso conditions resulted in a lack of the zzso class of the zzso in these zzso zzso levels were found to increase with zzso but they decreased under tumor bearing conditions or in cases of zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso activity upon hydrogen zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the existence of a novel type of natural zzso that is zzso to cancer vaccine zzso
