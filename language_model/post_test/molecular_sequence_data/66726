zzso dynamics zzso simulations of proteins in a zzso zzso environment are usually undertaken with one or a few starting zzso Here we report a search protocol for systematically exploring the possible interactions in zzso bundle zzso zzso a frequently occurring structural zzso The search protocol correctly identifies the zzso known structure of the zzso human zzso A zzso domain as the lowest energy structure among five different models without any prior zzso whilst an identical in zzso search fails to identify the correct zzso The lowest energy structure from the search in a zzso zzso has a root mean square zzso of zzso to the experimental zzso We have applied the same search protocol to the unknown zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the family of zzso growth factor zzso zzso structures show the role of zzso acid hydrogen bonding and close zzso zzso Water molecules may also play a key role in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
