The DNA zzso sequence of the zzso DNA zzso L zzso to zzso map units zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of insect zzso virus type 6 was zzso The size of this DNA zzso was zzso zzso with a base composition of zzso G + C and zzso A + zzso The DNA sequence contained many perfect direct repeats of sizes up to 145 zzso In addition to these zzso a cluster of four imperfect repetitive DNA elements zzso to zzso with a complex structural arrangement was zzso zzso zzso and zzso existed in duplicate zzso boxes zzso between zzso positions zzso and zzso and their size were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso repetitive element was found in 12 boxes (between bases zzso and zzso which were interrupted at zzso positions 1883 to zzso and zzso to zzso These interruptions define three segments zzso harboring boxes B1 to B3 zzso B4 to B8 zzso and zzso to B12 zzso The size of the individual boxes was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 102 zzso for zzso to zzso zzso Five open reading frames zzso of 118 to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso The analysis of the zzso acid sequences of the largest zzso revealed that the deduced zzso acid sequence of the putative gene product contained two repetitions zzso (three zzso of 50 zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 74 zzso zzso of 43 zzso acid zzso of zzso 5 (160 to 202 zzso were zzso within the majority of zzso A consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in all five zzso Although classical zzso and zzso zzso start signals were zzso zzso signals were not zzso
