Atomic zzso zzso demonstrated that highly zzso zzso zzso II from the zzso zzso zzso binds seven zinc zzso This number agrees with the number of potential zzso sites among the 12 different zzso of the zzso and with our observation that the ninth largest zzso alone is able to bind two zinc zzso The zzso motif in the largest zzso of the zzso was investigated using zzso zzso zzso any one of the six zzso zzso in the zzso motif zzso either a lethal or conditional zzso and zinc zzso analysis indicated that zzso forms of the domain had a zzso reduction in zinc zzso zzso in the zzso domain reduced zzso zzso II activity in zzso zzso even though protein zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso was present in excess of zzso zzso zzso of one zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso profile that was zzso like with the exception of two zzso not required for core zzso activity zzso and zzso which were zzso Core activity of the zzso zzso was reduced zzso We conclude that zzso in the zzso domain can reduce core activity without altering the association of any of the zzso required for this zzso
