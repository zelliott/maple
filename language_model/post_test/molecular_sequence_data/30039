We have investigated the zzso properties of an zzso site in DNA by zzso zzso and zzso cells of zzso coli with a zzso zzso zzso that carries a single example of this zzso at one or other of two unique and adjacent zzso Random samples of progeny zzso were zzso to determine the nature of the replication events that occurred at and around these zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso could be zzso in zzso cells, but only zzso to zzso of them gave plaques in the absence of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso resulted from the zzso of a zzso opposite the zzso site, while the remainder resulted from a targeted omission of a single zzso At one of the sites, zzso insertions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At the other site they were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence variation in all but two of the 204 sequences analyzed was restricted to the zzso site zzso In the remaining two, a change at the zzso site was accompanied by a zzso at an immediately zzso zzso
