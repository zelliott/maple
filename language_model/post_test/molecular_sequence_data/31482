A strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from a sea zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequencing revealed that this novel isolate was affiliated to the class zzso and formed a robust cluster with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso grew in the presence of zzso zzso and at a temperature range of zzso zzso The isolate was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso starch and Tweens 40 and zzso The prevalent fatty acids of strain zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso and the major zzso zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso value of strain zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso data in a combination with zzso findings strongly suggest inclusion of this novel strain in the zzso zzso as a representative of a novel species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
