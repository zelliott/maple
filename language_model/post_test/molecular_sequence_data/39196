The nuclear factor of activated T cell zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso factors primarily recognized for their central roles in T zzso zzso and cardiac valve zzso We demonstrate that zzso is commonly zzso in pancreatic zzso and enhances the zzso potential of tumor cells through zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso directly binds to a specific element within the zzso zzso promoter and zzso zzso transcription, ultimately resulting in increased cell proliferation and enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cell growth is significantly attenuated by zzso of zzso signaling or zzso knock down of zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso signaling zzso is an important mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso
