The solution structures of the zzso zzso of protein zzso a plasma vitamin zzso zzso and its zzso growth arrest specific protein 6 zzso were predicted by molecular dynamics computer zzso The initial structures were based on the zzso zzso structure of the corresponding region of bovine zzso zzso zzso The subsequent molecular dynamics zzso were calculated using the second-generation zzso force zzso The long-range zzso forces were evaluated by the particle mesh Ewald zzso The structures that stabilized over a zzso time zzso were compared with the corresponding region of the simulated solution structure of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of the zzso acid zzso zzso obtained from simulations and calcium binding were found to be zzso for all three zzso Analysis of the predicted solution structure of the zzso domain of zzso suggests that this domain should bind with zzso charged zzso surfaces analogous to bovine zzso zzso 1 and protein zzso
