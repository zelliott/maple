zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly all steroid hormones by converting zzso and zzso to their respective zzso and zzso and protects against circulating steroid hormone zzso It is highly expressed in rat liver zzso zzso of the soluble zzso Previously, we identified a powerful zzso zzso resident at about zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso We now report the functional dissection of this zzso zzso of zzso deletions of the zzso of the gene promoter linked to zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells located the zzso activity between zzso to zzso zzso Further internal and zzso deletion zzso revealed that a zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso contained a major zzso zzso This zzso spanned two imperfect direct repeats zzso and zzso and contained three direct repeats of zzso This zzso also contained three potential zzso factor 1 zzso sites zzso and a putative zzso binding protein zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso enhanced zzso activity from the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not bind to this zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso and rat liver nuclear extracts bound to this zzso zzso The zzso protein complex was zzso out by a zzso zzso and was zzso by an zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was fused to an zzso zzso construct and zzso with zzso zzso factor 1 zzso into zzso Schneider zzso insect cells (which lack zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity was zzso These results indicate that members of the zzso zzso factor family regulate high zzso expression of the rat zzso gene that is responsible for steroid hormone zzso The potential role of zzso in regulating other zzso genes that have protective roles is zzso
