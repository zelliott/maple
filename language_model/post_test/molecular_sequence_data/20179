In bacterial zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso attached via two zzso zzso organized in a zzso zzso zzso Here, a novel zzso c zzso zzso is described that contains only seven conventional zzso zzso motifs zzso in addition to several single zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso suggests that two of the single zzso zzso are actually part of an unprecedented zzso sequence involved in zzso c zzso zzso characterization of zzso identified an unusual zzso zzso c with a zzso zzso zzso not unlike that of certain zzso zzso c that exceptionally bind zzso via only one zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene was found to be specifically required for the maturation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes belonging to either the bacterial zzso c zzso system I or II are present in the vicinity of every known zzso gene suggesting a dedicated zzso c maturation zzso The results zzso reconsideration of computer-based prediction of putative zzso zzso motifs in bacterial zzso
