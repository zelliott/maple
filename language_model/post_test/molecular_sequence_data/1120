We have characterized the molecular zzso in two families with severe factor zzso zzso zzso In family I, the zzso was found to be zzso for a novel 18 zzso deletion in zzso 8 zzso resulting in the zzso deletion of six zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests the deletion is likely to disrupt folding of the zzso zzso The reduced zzso zzso (21 zzso and negligible activity zzso zzso in the patient's plasma indicated that the deletion affected both the zzso and function of the zzso zzso In family II, the zzso was found to be a compound zzso for a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 5 zzso the zzso domain of zzso and a nonsense zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison in a wide evolutionary context suggested that the zzso zzso is critical for structure of zzso The zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and activity zzso zzso plasma values indicate the zzso primarily affected the zzso or stability of the zzso
