zzso of the zzso zzso genes and proteins necessary for zzso zzso is far from zzso Such information should zzso studies of zzso regulation and zzso zzso Using the zzso protein zzso recently identified as necessary for synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso we show that a zzso zzso reading frame zzso termed zzso zzso 1) is necessary for synthesis of zzso zzso the most abundant and complex zzso in zzso zzso This conclusion is based upon analysis of an zzso strain, which fails to accumulate zzso and instead accumulates increased amounts of the precursor zzso The zzso also fails to incorporate radioactive precursors into zzso and zzso prepared from it do not incorporate zzso into zzso indicating a lack of zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is inhibited in the zzso range by zzso A, but drug sensitivity is over zzso lower than reported for zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso has no severe zzso effects but is slightly more resistant to growth zzso by calcium zzso Identification of the zzso gene should be helpful in determining the function of the zzso zzso and in determining the zzso mechanism of zzso and zzso zzso
