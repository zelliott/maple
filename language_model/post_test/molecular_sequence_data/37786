The zzso B virus X protein zzso has been thought to be implicated in the development of zzso zzso Although many functions of zzso have been reported, it is not clear which of zzso functions is important in zzso zzso To study zzso function, we produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso cell clone zzso and mapped its zzso to a region of zzso between zzso acids 29 and 48 by Western zzso with truncated forms of zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso with synthetic zzso zzso The variable regions of zzso zzso zzso were cloned by zzso chain reaction using the zzso and by the zzso rapid zzso end zzso The sequence analyses revealed that the variable gene segments of the heavy and light chains are the members of mouse heavy chain variable gene 1 family and zzso light chain variable gene 2 family, zzso In addition, zzso or zzso gene segment at the end of the zzso or zzso variable region and zzso gene segment in the zzso 3 of heavy chain were zzso
