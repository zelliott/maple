The zzso zzso zzso protein exhibits zzso activity and has an active site functionally similar to that in influenza zzso Earlier work identified zzso zzso acids among zzso sequences and proposed similarity between zzso and influenza zzso zzso In this work we identify the three-dimensional fold and develop a more detailed model for the zzso zzso in the process we examine a variety of protein structure prediction zzso We use the known structures of viral and bacterial zzso as controls in testing the success of protein structure prediction and modeling methods, including zzso zzso discrete three-dimensional environmental profiles, hidden zzso models, neural network secondary structure zzso pattern matching, and zzso zzso The results from zzso show that the zzso protein sequence has a 6 zzso zzso fold and enable us to assign the locations of the individual zzso The three-dimensional environmental profile and hidden zzso model methods were not successful in this zzso The model developed in this work helps to understand better the biological function of the zzso protein and design zzso of the zzso and serves as an assessment of some protein structure prediction methods, especially after the zzso zzso solution of its zzso
