zzso and zzso sequence data are essential tools for tackling ecological zzso Using an approach that combines next-generation sequencing, de zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and synthetic gene construction, we identify and cluster the protein families from zzso zzso from the northern Red zzso 

We obtained 80 million 75 zzso zzso zzso reads from two zzso adult samples collected at 65 m zzso zzso on the zzso zzso platform, and generated two de zzso zzso using zzso and zzso After removing zzso and filtering out low quality reads, our zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso longer than 100 zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso as a reference, we were able to zzso almost zzso of each zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso transcripts allowed us to divide them into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcript clusters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso categories were assigned to zzso clusters using the functional zzso of zzso zzso General zzso of the assembled transcripts was improved zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we screened these transcript zzso clusters for fluorescent proteins zzso zzso and identified seven potential zzso zzso in zzso and four in zzso These transcripts were validated as bona fide zzso transcripts via robust zzso zzso zzso zzso of the assembled zzso revealed that zzso and zzso (in zzso and zzso zzso of the total assembled zzso likely originated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Here we present a study to identify the zzso transcript zzso clusters from the zzso of zzso zzso using a zzso reference zzso Furthermore, the zzso transcripts were isolated from the zzso and their contribution zzso This is the first zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a major increase in zzso resources available in this important family of zzso
