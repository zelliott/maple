The zzso channel zzso is an attractive pharmacological target for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are key prospects for diagnosing and treating these zzso Here, we identified the first scorpion zzso zzso channel toxin family with three groups and seven zzso In addition to their function as zzso zzso with zzso zzso of 140 zzso for zzso zzso 160 zzso for zzso 124 zzso for zzso 136 zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso 760 zzso for zzso and 107 zzso for zzso all seven zzso scorpion zzso toxins could block the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that six of seven scorpion toxins inhibited zzso of zzso channel currents at a concentration of 1 zzso The exception was zzso which had weak zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso channels were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further pharmacological experiments indicated that zzso was a highly selective zzso channel inhibitor with weak affinity for other zzso zzso Different from classical zzso zzso channel toxins with zzso regions as the zzso zzso the zzso interface of zzso was in the zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings describe the first scorpion zzso zzso channel toxin family, of which a novel zzso zzso is specific for zzso zzso Their structural and functional diversity strongly suggest that zzso toxins are a new source to screen and design potential peptides for diagnosing and treating zzso zzso zzso
