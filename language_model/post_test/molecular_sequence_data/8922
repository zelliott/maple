zzso zzso is a model for the large class of zzso small zzso that act to zzso regulate bacterial zzso The function of zzso is zzso in zzso zzso coli, where it was originally shown to counteract zzso stress by acting as a zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes the major zzso zzso We have discovered additional zzso targets in zzso zzso a pathogen related to zzso coli that recently acquired one-quarter of all genes by horizontal gene zzso We show that the zzso short seed region of zzso that recognizes zzso was recruited to target the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction is exceptionally zzso we find that zzso zzso whose gene arose from zzso zzso during zzso evolution, is deaf to zzso because of a zzso zzso pair in the potential zzso zzso duplex zzso zzso in zzso In other words, zzso discriminates the two zzso factor zzso at the level of a single hydrogen zzso Our study suggests that bacterial pathogens use their large suites of zzso zzso regulators to integrate zzso acquired genes into existing zzso networks, just as zzso zzso factors are recruited to tame foreign genes at the DNA zzso The results zzso illustrate the importance of the seed regions of bacterial small zzso to select new targets with high zzso and suggest that target predictions must consider all or none decisions by individual seed zzso
