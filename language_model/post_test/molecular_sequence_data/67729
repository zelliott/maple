zzso in gene expression are termed expression level zzso zzso Here, we propose a new zzso class, zzso zzso zzso as a criterion to screen for genes that are responsible for natural zzso variation and/or that are targeted by balancing zzso zzso genes are characterized by two expression level zzso zzso scans based on zzso sequences are not ideal for identifying genes targeted for zzso A critical concern is that several genes can be present in the zzso regions identified by such zzso This situation indicates the importance of zzso zzso sequence data and other information, such as gene expression zzso Comparative zzso is useful for determining zzso and ecologically important zzso In a zzso expression screen of 34 zzso we identified 344 zzso zzso genes exhibiting zzso zzso genetic analysis revealed that zzso genes had high zzso zzso and long linkage zzso The highest zzso diversity zzso greater than the zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso We observed a clear association between the expression mode and sequence type of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso will be useful for the screening and functional analysis of genes responsible for zzso zzso Such a zzso approach has the potential to facilitate the scanning of genes relevant to balanced zzso not only in zzso zzso but also in other model and zzso zzso
