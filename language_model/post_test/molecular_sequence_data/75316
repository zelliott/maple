zzso zzso zzso is strongly associated with zzso This rare zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are both found in positive genetic linkage zzso with zzso zzso zzso and also display zzso zzso To investigate the relationship between these two zzso at the structural level, the zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso genes have been zzso They differ by 28 zzso resulting in 14 zzso acid zzso 5 in the alpha 1 domain, 8 in the alpha 2 domain, and 1 in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence with other zzso sequences shows a segment of zzso zzso identical with zzso in the alpha 1 domain and a segment of 218 zzso identical with zzso in the alpha 2 domain, but only a 91 zzso segment of identity with zzso in the alpha 1 zzso The complex pattern of zzso and their degree of divergence indicate that zzso and zzso zzso are not related by a simple zzso zzso
