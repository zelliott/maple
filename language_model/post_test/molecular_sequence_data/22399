The zzso zzso zzso gene has been identified as a regulator of zzso development in zzso zzso We find that zzso petals in zzso zzso can be replaced with zzso zzso zzso or filaments and that some zzso flowers have increased numbers of zzso and exhibit fusion of zzso We show that these zzso defects are due to zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso with its role in maintaining the spatial boundary of AG zzso zzso enhanced the zzso defects present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the development of zzso zzso zzso acts in the same zzso and downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso organ fusion in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso supports an additional role for zzso in organ zzso zzso thus acts to maintain two different types of spatial boundaries in young zzso boundaries between organ zzso within a zzso and boundaries of zzso gene expression between zzso
