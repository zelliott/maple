A new approach was developed to embody the zzso protein structure having an arbitrary combination and arrangement of zzso by the successive zzso of a zzso zzso segment with a zzso zzso A zzso protein was efficiently constructed by the repetitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso unprotected zzso segments facilitated the zzso of the zzso to afford the highly homogeneous desired zzso The use of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for the zzso was judged to make no difference in zzso A trial of introducing an additional zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The resulting protein showed high stability in the zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso zzso
