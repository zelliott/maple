A biological role for the zzso binding of human zzso by group A zzso is evidenced by its strong association with a zzso of strains giving rise to zzso zzso zzso activity lies within many of the M and zzso surface proteins zzso by zzso zzso and several structurally distinct zzso sites are known to zzso In this report, two adjacent zzso zzso differing in their specificity for human zzso zzso are localized within the zzso zzso protein zzso The putative coding regions for the two zzso zzso were mapped for 82 zzso unrelated zzso Both coding regions are associated with zzso distant zzso zzso supporting a role for horizontal transfer and zzso zzso in the evolution of zzso zzso In most instances, the two coding regions are tightly linked, suggesting that there exist strong selective pressures to maintain a zzso binding zzso Both coding regions are found among all strains bearing zzso gene markers associated with zzso zzso as the principal tissue zzso but are absent from most strains that exhibit markers for a zzso zzso zzso The data support the hypothesis that the zzso potential of an isolate is dictated, at least in part, by its unique array of zzso zzso gene zzso
