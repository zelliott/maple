Using an inverse zzso technique with zzso directed against constant region zzso 18 V zzso regions have been isolated at random from bovine zzso zzso for detailed zzso On the basis of protein sequences in zzso and their zzso to the human zzso chains zzso and zzso the bovine zzso can be separated into two families that have been designated V zzso 1 zzso of all clones zzso and V zzso 2 zzso of all clones zzso zzso of the zzso sequences has allowed subdivision of the dominant family into V zzso zzso V zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso which represent 29, 65, and zzso of all V zzso 1 clones zzso It appears that the size of zzso is V zzso zzso region comprises 14 zzso acids in V zzso zzso zzso and 13 zzso in V zzso zzso and V zzso zzso with a single exception, seven zzso acids make up zzso The size of zzso is zzso ranging from 10 to 15 zzso acids in zzso Conservation of those zzso sequences that zzso the signal zzso and zzso has enabled us to amplify and characterize 14 V zzso 1 genes from kidney zzso zzso Interestingly, half of the zzso sequences were not represented in the data gathered from zzso zzso while the remaining genes could be identified as members of the V zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso The findings indicate that the V zzso 1 family dominates the expressed bovine light chain repertoire but that a large proportion of the zzso segments from which this repertoire is derived may be zzso
