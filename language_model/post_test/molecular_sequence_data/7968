We report the design of a new tightly controlled zzso system which allows the existence of the zzso gene in host cells without a signal zzso When expression of zzso is turned on by gene inversion in zzso the lethal effect of zzso (or its zzso is not compromised either by zzso of its zzso inhibitor zzso or by zzso zzso This serves as a zzso sensitive in zzso test for the detection of any very low residual activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso which greatly reduces the stability and yield of zzso zzso produce enough activity to be zzso by this zzso In contrast, when expressed on a zzso zzso these zzso do not yield zzso activity in a solution zzso Truly inactive zzso such as those of zzso to zzso Ala or zzso were completely harmless when expressed in this zzso
