By a combination of large-scale sequencing, zzso and traditional molecular biology, we identified the zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso of the chicken zzso and zzso zzso These molecules are the first discovered zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the chicken zzso and zzso proteins to the corresponding known zzso of various species, zzso humans, zzso zzso cat, zzso zzso and zzso ranged between 21 and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells and proved to be dependent on the cell type and zzso while expression was not detected in zzso primary chicken zzso zzso zzso Following transient expression of both molecules in zzso cells, we confirmed the necessity of zzso into zzso to yield zzso as was also shown for its zzso zzso The chicken zzso zzso generated either by transient zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso or as a fusion protein (as in a fusion zzso zzso induced zzso synthesis and zzso activity of freshly exposed chicken zzso The high degree of functional similarity between chicken zzso and zzso of higher zzso zzso despite their poor sequence zzso illustrates the conservation and vital importance of the zzso zzso since the evolutionary zzso of birds and zzso zzso million years zzso In this article, we describe the first zzso zzso zzso and show that this chicken zzso zzso is zzso
