zzso zzso is a zzso that regulates zzso differentiation and survival of various zzso cell zzso Its actions are zzso through its binding to the zzso zzso which is composed of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only beta and zzso have been shown to zzso zzso cellular zzso The zzso chain is shared by the zzso 4, 7, 9, 15 and 21 zzso and is essential for zzso zzso The regulation of zzso expression level is therefore critical for the ability of cells to respond to these zzso In the present work, we show that the zzso zzso associates with the zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso We identified the specific binding site on zzso And we show that the loss of zzso association on zzso is accompanied by a dramatic increase of the zzso of the zzso zzso
