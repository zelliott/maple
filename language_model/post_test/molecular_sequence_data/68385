zzso of pol II and pol III transcribed zzso genes in plants have identical sequence elements comprised of a zzso zzso box and an upstream sequence element zzso located four or three zzso turns upstream of the zzso box in pol II and pol III zzso zzso it is this difference in element spacing that determines the zzso zzso specificity of the zzso We are interested in identifying factors binding to zzso gene promoters and their role in selection of zzso zzso In this work we have investigated possible differences in the activity of the two zzso binding proteins zzso zzso by two different zzso genes of zzso Using zzso zzso with altered DNA binding zzso similar to those described previously in zzso we show that two zzso zzso zzso are equally active with both pol II and pol III zzso genes and with an zzso gene zzso into plant zzso In contrast to zzso where modified zzso permits zzso only from promoters containing the zzso zzso of the consensus zzso zzso element, altered zzso zzso also suppress other zzso box zzso Similar results were obtained with human and zzso zzso zzso expressed in plant zzso Interestingly, in several cases suppression of different zzso box zzso by altered zzso was gene or zzso zzso specific suggesting that assembly of zzso into specific complexes containing different zzso factors may alter DNA binding specificity of the zzso
