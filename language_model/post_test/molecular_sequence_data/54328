Sex zzso of zzso are largely classified into two types based on the presence zzso I) or absence zzso zzso of a terminal functional zzso While zzso sex zzso are zzso from common fatty acids in the zzso zzso zzso zzso sex zzso are derived from zzso produced presumably in the zzso and transported to the PG via the zzso Recently, a fatty acid transport protein zzso was identified from the PG of the zzso zzso zzso which produces a zzso sex zzso zzso zzso was shown to facilitate the zzso of zzso fatty acids into PG cells for the synthesis of zzso To zzso the presence and function of zzso in the PG of zzso that produce zzso sex zzso we explored zzso zzso expressed in the PG of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso an zzso sex zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the zzso and its expression is zzso shortly after zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso coli enhanced the zzso of long chain fatty acids zzso and zzso but not zzso precursor zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and functional characterization of a zzso in the PG of a zzso producing a zzso sex zzso Although zzso is not likely to be involved in the zzso of zzso precursors in zzso zzso the expression pattern of zzso suggests a role for zzso in the PG not directly linked to zzso zzso
