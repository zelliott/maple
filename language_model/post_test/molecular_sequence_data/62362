zzso zzso zzso have two important functions in the zzso zzso zzso which causes brown rot of zzso First, a zzso is required to generate zzso zzso zzso via zzso cycling between two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Second, because zzso is zzso and zzso is not, a zzso is needed to maintain the zzso pool of these zzso in the reduced zzso Given their importance in zzso zzso zzso zzso could prove useful targets for new wood zzso We have identified two zzso zzso zzso each existing in two closely zzso perhaps zzso zzso that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Past work with zzso and zzso expression of zzso in this study confirmed that both genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso cultures showed that zzso expression was zzso during secondary zzso coincided with the production of zzso and was moderately zzso by chemical zzso such as zzso By contrast, zzso expression was zzso during zzso growth when zzso levels were low, yet was markedly zzso by chemical stress or heat zzso The total zzso activity in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly enhanced by induction beforehand with a zzso zzso The promoter of zzso contains likely zzso zzso and heat shock zzso absent in zzso that probably explain the greater response of zzso zzso to zzso We conclude from these results that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso routinely uses to zzso zzso during zzso wood zzso and that it could also drive the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso assumes a more important role when the zzso is zzso
