The zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso is believed to involve environmental factors, but their identity and mode of action are zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso specific for the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso domain of the bovine milk protein zzso zzso Analysis of paired samples of zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso identified a zzso zzso response in the zzso that differed in its zzso specificity from that in the zzso This effect was statistically significant for the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso in the zzso compartment with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso These observations suggested that zzso synthesis of zzso recognizing zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was sustained by molecular mimicry with zzso zzso evidence of molecular mimicry between the two proteins was obtained by analyzing zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso repertoire zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso including a zzso component that occurred at a higher frequency in zzso patients than in zzso healthy controls, as well as responses to zzso within zzso that occur at similar zzso in both zzso The demonstration of molecular mimicry between zzso and zzso along with zzso of zzso zzso in zzso suggests that exposure to this common dietary zzso may influence the composition and function of the zzso zzso repertoire during the course of zzso
