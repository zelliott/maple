With the increase of laboratory facilities, molecular zzso are playing a zzso role in evolutionary zzso However, understanding the evolution of zzso traits remains essential for a comprehensive view of the evolution of a zzso Here we present a new approach based on zzso analysis for identifying characters which variations are dependent to the zzso a prerequisite for analyzing the evolution of zzso Our approach has the advantage of treating the full data set at once, including qualitative and quantitative zzso It provides a zzso output giving the contribution of each variable to the zzso allowing a direct discrimination among zzso dependent and independent zzso We have implemented this approach in deciphering the evolution of zzso traits in a highly specialized group of zzso zzso the zzso We have first zzso a molecular zzso of this group based on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso indicated that the zzso zzso was restricted to the single zzso zzso and within the zzso zzso two sister zzso were zzso zzso (new zzso and zzso Among zzso the zzso groups zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso analysis highlighted a strong relationship between the zzso and the genetic data sets, and identified three quantitative and eight qualitative variables linked to the zzso The evolution of quantitative variables was assessed using the zzso method and showed a major zzso event in the evolution of the number of zzso rays, and a more gradual pattern of evolution of the number of teeth along the zzso The evolution of qualitative variables was zzso using ancestral states reconstructions and highlighted parallel patterns of evolution in characters linked to the mouth, suggesting zzso of the traits for adapting to divergent zzso
