zzso zzso zzso is prone to zzso from zzso binding of zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from tobacco and other plants in the family zzso is an inefficient zzso of zzso from zzso plants and from the green zzso zzso zzso To determine if the zzso small zzso plays a role in the interaction with zzso zzso a hybrid zzso zzso composed of tobacco small zzso and zzso large zzso was zzso The zzso hybrid, like other hybrid zzso containing plant small zzso supported zzso growth in zzso but growth in air was much slower than for cells containing zzso zzso The kinetic properties of the zzso hybrid zzso were similar to the zzso zzso indicating that the poor growth in air was probably caused by disruption of zzso formation and the zzso impairment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso activated the zzso hybrid zzso and hybrid zzso containing spinach and zzso small zzso at rates similar to the rates with zzso zzso However, none of the hybrid zzso was activated by tobacco zzso zzso That replacement of zzso small zzso with plant small zzso does not affect the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso suggests that the association is not dominated by the small zzso that surround the zzso central zzso zzso zzso the geometry of a zzso binding mode is more consistent with the data than a zzso or zzso binding zzso
