zzso zzso zzso which is produced by a plant soft rot disease zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso showing zzso zzso zzso with zzso sheath and zzso tail zzso We determined the complete zzso sequences of zzso genes on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and report that zzso genes consist of zzso zzso major and minor structural protein gene zzso Four promoters were zzso The zzso gene zzso which is composed of the genes for zzso zzso and zzso was also identified and zzso The zzso sequences and organization of the genes for zzso which is produced by zzso zzso strain zzso with the zzso similar to zzso were also determined and compared to that of zzso and it was found that zzso is almost identical to zzso except for tail fibers which are involved in the killing zzso of both zzso We also explain that the gene organization and the deduced zzso acid sequences of both zzso are very close to those of zzso which is zzso in the zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso evolved as a zzso zzso zzso from a common zzso with zzso zzso zzso
