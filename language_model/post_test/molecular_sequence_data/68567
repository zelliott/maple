The detection of pathogens by zzso chain reaction zzso in clinical samples, such as blood, zzso or feces, requires initial sample preparation to remove zzso zzso and to concentrate the target zzso Here we show for the first time that zzso separation can be used to recover pathogens from whole blood and then used for zzso zzso With zzso to the zzso surface protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and concentrated from clinical zzso The recovered zzso were used directly for in zzso DNA zzso The zzso product was subsequently analyzed by a zzso zzso zzso plate zzso The results from examining 117 patients attending a clinic in the zzso district, zzso demonstrate that the combined method with zzso separation followed by zzso increases the group of positively diagnosed patients compared with microscopic examination of stained blood zzso Analysis of 1 zzso of whole blood resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso increase in positively diagnosed patients while a zzso sample volume increased the zzso diagnosed to zzso (24 of zzso
