The zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was searched on the database zzso zzso Institute, zzso More than 30 proteins were drawn in a list with 15 zzso acid varieties at the position adjacent to zzso Seven zzso peptides with the zzso zzso where zzso denotes the selected zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso Together with the zzso protected zzso zzso zzso and zzso they have been evaluated for zzso zzso For the zzso zzso receptors to which zzso binds specifically and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala, zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a considerably weaker binding affinity than zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso demonstrated an affinity ten times greater than zzso Because of an extremely weak affinity for the delta zzso its zzso became very high zzso The present results and the increased activity of zzso zzso et zzso zzso indicate that the zzso receptors tolerate the zzso or aromatic zzso at the site corresponding to position 4 of zzso When the circular zzso zzso zzso are compared between active and inactive zzso no significant difference is found in both water and zzso This suggests that the activity of zzso zzso with the zzso sequence is mainly determined by the structural characters of the zzso acid zzso in position 4 rather than by the molecular zzso The results suggested a possible formation of zzso peptides in various protein zzso
