The N gene product of zzso coli zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that captures the host zzso zzso and zzso it to a zzso form, permitting gene expression in two large zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso requires at least one host factor called zzso which directly binds the N protein as well as zzso zzso and also a transcribed zzso site known as zzso within which lies the hypothesized zzso zzso zzso zzso is an interrupted zzso capable of forming a hairpin in the zzso zzso studies with complementary DNA zzso provide evidence for a direct role of the zzso hairpin in zzso zzso studies of transcript zzso reveal that the zzso hairpin does not induce an appreciable pause to hold zzso captive for engagement by N and zzso Moreover, the efficiency of zzso remains virtually the same whether N and zzso are added early, prior to nut site transcription, or added later, after the zzso has already transcribed past the nut zzso After zzso of the nut site, zzso zzso remains susceptible to modification by N and zzso for an appreciable amount of time and distance, and the nut site DNA becomes zzso for this zzso These results lead to the hypothesis that the zzso zzso hairpin acts in a manner analogous to the DNA zzso binding N and zzso a productive zzso interaction by zzso zzso
