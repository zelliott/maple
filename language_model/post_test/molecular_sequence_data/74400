zzso are zzso receptors that have presumably evolved from the DNA zzso protein family, and the zzso of many organisms contain genes for both types of zzso Both protein structures resemble each other, which suggests that light control and light protection share a common ancient zzso In the zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso however, only one zzso zzso termed zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso gene triggers sexual differentiation under inappropriate culture conditions and results in zzso of transcripts zzso regulators of zzso body zzso zzso is a protein whose zzso and zzso synthetic green fluorescent protein zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso sexual development under UVA zzso zzso light both on plates and in submerged zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity as demonstrated by zzso zzso of a DNA zzso zzso coli strain as well as zzso in an zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso This is in contrast to the single deletion zzso strain, which does not show increased sensitivity toward zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel type of zzso that exhibits a regulatory function during zzso development and DNA repair zzso This represents a paradigm for the evolutionary transition between zzso and zzso
