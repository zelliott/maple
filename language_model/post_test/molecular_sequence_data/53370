A study was made of the zzso of the mercury resistance zzso zzso which, together with the closely related zzso degradation zzso zzso forms a separate group in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso the element zzso in its original host zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso in these strains proved to be zzso by the zzso gene zzso of zzso The gene region determining the host dependence of zzso zzso was localized with the use of a series of hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its location in the zzso one-third of the zzso gene is consistent with the data that this region is involved in the formation of the zzso complex in zzso of the zzso zzso As in other zzso of this family, zzso of zzso occurred via zzso formation, suggesting its zzso zzso However, neither of the putative resolution proteins zzso by zzso resolved the zzso formed during zzso or an artificial zzso in zzso coli zzso Similar data were obtained with the mercury resistance zzso isolated from environmental zzso strains and closely related to zzso zzso zzso
