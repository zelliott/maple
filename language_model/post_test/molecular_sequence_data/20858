Recently, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, and zzso Schulz, zzso zzso zzso reported a new zzso coli zzso zzso by the zzso gene that zzso the zzso bonds of zzso zzso A zzso zzso generated during zzso of certain zzso fatty zzso These authors suggested that zzso expression might be regulated by zzso the zzso of the fad zzso acid zzso zzso We report mapping of the zzso promoter and show that zzso zzso responded to zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso bound to a DNA sequence similar to the zzso zzso binding site located upstream of the zzso coding sequence and was released from the promoter upon the addition of zzso zzso zzso We therefore propose the designation zzso in place of zzso Although zzso regulation of zzso expression had the pattern typical of fad zzso zzso its zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso global regulator was the opposite of that normally zzso zzso generally acts as an zzso of fad gene zzso consistent with the low status of fatty acids as carbon zzso However, zzso growth zzso zzso expression relative to zzso growth, as did zzso of zzso indicating that the complex acts as a negative regulator of this zzso The stimulation of zzso expression seen upon deletion of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was reversed by supplementation of the growth medium with zzso zzso and zzso also reported that growth on a zzso zzso acid zzso yields much higher levels of zzso zzso activity than does growth on zzso zzso In contrast, we found that the zzso zzso acid zzso was only a weak zzso of zzso zzso Although the gene is not essential for growth, the high zzso level of zzso expression under diverse growth conditions suggests that the zzso zzso has functions in addition to zzso
