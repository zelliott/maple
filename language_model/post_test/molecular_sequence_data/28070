The zzso of forming all possible single base substitution errors are measured for zzso zzso DNA zzso alpha and avian zzso virus reverse zzso zzso sites along zzso zzso DNA are investigated so that effects of nearest neighbor base stacking on zzso zzso can be zzso zzso alpha appears to be more error prone than reverse zzso zzso alpha forms zzso zzso at rates comparable to transition zzso with two zzso zzso and zzso are formed with significantly higher and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso forms zzso with lower efficiencies than zzso especially low being zzso zzso and zzso For both zzso zzso zzso vary typically by zzso for the same zzso in different zzso zzso frequency can be expressed as a product of two zzso one based on zzso and the other on zzso DNA zzso alpha appears to use primarily zzso discrimination zzso to achieve zzso zzso while reverse zzso shows a greater balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso base stacking interactions appear to have opposite effects on the two discrimination zzso The zzso neighbor influence on zzso is greater for correct insertions than for zzso while the influence on zzso is greater for the incorrect zzso Target sites that have zzso as the zzso neighbor to incoming zzso show a higher than average zzso component based on zzso but a lower than average component based on zzso zzso target sites with nearest neighbor zzso have a higher than average zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso zzso zzso will occur next to zzso when zzso discrimination is dominant and next to zzso when zzso discrimination is zzso When zzso and zzso discrimination components have similar zzso nearest neighbor effects tend to cancel thereby reducing the effects of base stacking on zzso error zzso
