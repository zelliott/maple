The overproduction of the zzso zzso is associated with inflammatory and zzso zzso We have developed a means to block zzso production with zzso directed against zzso zzso to selectively inhibit its production in zzso and in zzso Following zzso zzso delivery to zzso zzso zzso in culture, zzso zzso were more effective zzso of zzso zzso than zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso to the concentration of zzso zzso with an zzso of approximately 10 zzso After zzso injection of zzso zzso complexes, zzso zzso accumulated approximately zzso of the administered zzso The zzso active zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso by approximately 50% relative to an inactive zzso control without zzso zzso of another zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation products were found among the zzso extracted from zzso following in zzso zzso treatment and ex zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso can accumulate in appropriate target cells in zzso once in the target cell, zzso can be potent zzso of specific gene zzso
