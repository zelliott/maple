We have previously shown that zzso of zzso alpha zzso is associated with zzso zzso In this study, we used high-resolution Northern blots to determine the rate and extent of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was found to undergo complete zzso within 2 h following withdrawal of zzso However, the process was not zzso at 1 h following zzso withdrawal, zzso alpha zzso zzso lengths ranged from 0 to 180 zzso There was an zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso which suggested that there may be another step before the zzso is zzso zzso was found to block zzso alpha zzso degradation at the level of zzso zzso Northern blots revealed a previously zzso periodic distribution of zzso lengths that was consistent with zzso zzso between complexes of zzso zzso The findings indicate that the degradation zzso of zzso alpha zzso is a slower version of the zzso zzso model, with the important additional feature that zzso and degradation are subject to zzso zzso This study provides a detailed picture of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and establishes a basis for further investigation of the mechanism by which zzso zzso specific zzso
