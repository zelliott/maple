The majority of proteins are unable to zzso into the cell zzso Hence for zzso and zzso zzso a direct zzso delivery with the aid of zzso agents is an attractive zzso We wanted to deliver to the cell interior a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was achieved in zzso with three different commercial zzso However, in our hands, delivery of various control proteins without known deleterious effects, as well as of protein zzso always induced cell zzso Finally, we used a novel zzso zzso zzso which was not toxic to cultured cells, even in a quite large range of zzso Most importantly, control protein delivered to cells in culture did not display any toxicity while zzso protein exerted a strong zzso zzso These data show that results obtained with zzso agents should be interpreted with zzso
