The occasional occurrence of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso has led to the hypothesis that zzso derived from the neural crest may be arrested in their migration and may undergo an in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso cells have only rarely been identified by zzso examination in a few zzso other than skin and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is considered one of the most specific markers of zzso zzso We have attempted to detect cells committed to the zzso zzso in human zzso by means of zzso gene zzso Total zzso was extracted from normal and zzso zzso and analyzed using a highly sensitive reverse zzso zzso zzso with zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso from healthy subjects were used as negative zzso zzso transcripts were identified in a wide range of normal zzso such as skin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, and peripheral zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso samples including benign zzso zzso zzso zzso involved by zzso breast zzso zzso zzso lymphoma, and zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso were also positive, while no zzso was detected in blood specimens from patients with other zzso zzso it appears likely that cells expressing the zzso gene are present in a wide range of human zzso Although these cells still have to be accurately identified, one could propose that they might zzso to either fully differentiated zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells bearing zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
