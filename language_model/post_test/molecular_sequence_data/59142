A zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso by affinity zzso on bovine zzso zzso followed by gel zzso and it showed a molecular weight of zzso by sodium zzso gel zzso This zzso has the capacity to interact with zzso since it binds to zzso in a zzso zzso and it acts as a zzso in the binding of zzso to the affinity zzso The zzso zzso rabbit and rat zzso but not human A, B or O zzso zzso zzso zzso of different zzso zzso and zzso indicate that this zzso has affinity for zzso acid, which is enhanced by its zzso The zzso sequence of the protein shows zzso identity with rabbit and zzso zzso zzso
