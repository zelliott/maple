zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso zzso and Toll zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso and regulated by zzso in zzso A zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso of zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso and zzso zzso library zzso The full-length zzso consists of zzso zzso 411 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso zzso contains a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein contains a putative signal zzso of 19 zzso acids and the zzso signature sequence zzso zzso showed some identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso loop zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso An zzso at the zzso position of the zzso site indicates that zzso may have zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were mainly detected in zzso and the zzso organ by zzso The variation of the zzso zzso level in zzso followed by artificial infection with bacteria or white spot syndrome virus zzso was zzso by zzso Green real-time zzso zzso zzso profiles of zzso greatly zzso after zzso This work represents the first report of a zzso in zzso zzso The data provide clues that zzso might play potential roles in the innate immunity of zzso
