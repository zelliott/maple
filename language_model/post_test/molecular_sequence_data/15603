The zzso virus zzso gene zzso is zzso in all members of the zzso family and encodes a protein associated with the mature zzso We confirmed this association and provided evidence for an internal zzso An zzso zzso that zzso expresses E6 was zzso In the absence of zzso plaque formation and virus production were severely inhibited in several cell lines, whereas some replication occurred in zzso This difference could be due to variation in the stringency of repression, since we could not isolate a stable deletion zzso even in the more zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, viral late proteins were zzso but processing of core proteins was inefficient, indicative of an assembly zzso zzso electron zzso of sections of cells infected with the zzso in the absence of zzso revealed zzso defects with zzso and empty immature zzso adjacent to dense inclusions of zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso appeared to have zzso zzso
