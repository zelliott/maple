It is possible to interfere with the replication of a number of plant zzso viruses by systemic production of viral zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or by production of zzso portions of viral plus strands or minus zzso zzso can occur by a number of zzso We have discovered that the zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso and zzso which exist as permanent persistent infections of their host cells, can be cured very efficiently by production of zzso fragments of their zzso zzso These zzso produce only two zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso fusion zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Three types of interference can be zzso interference due to overproduction of both Cap and zzso interference due to overproduction of Cap (and zzso distortion of the Cap to zzso zzso and interference due to negative zzso by zzso fragments of zzso Some zzso fragments of Cap appear to be incorporated into viral zzso but only in the presence of a complete Cap zzso We zzso that incorporation of zzso fragments of Cap results in the formation of defective zzso
