To further understand and evaluate the phenomenon of zzso zzso we wished to determine whether zzso of an zzso zzso could antagonize a specific zzso zzso To this end, the ability of zzso zzso peptides to inhibit a panel of five different zzso influenza zzso zzso T cell lines was zzso An analysis of their V beta and J beta usage indicated that each of these five T cell lines expressed different zzso A series of zzso zzso single zzso acid zzso zzso were used to determine the fine zzso zzso of the different zzso zzso zzso that demonstrated little or no zzso capacity were then examined for their ability to act as zzso zzso by zzso the zzso response of these five zzso Overall, 17 different zzso zzso capable of zzso at least one T cell line were zzso Although no single analog was capable of zzso all five T cell lines, two different zzso were identified that were capable of zzso four of five of the T cell zzso zzso
