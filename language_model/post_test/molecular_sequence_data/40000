zzso production is emerging worldwide as an important mechanism of zzso resistance among zzso zzso zzso and this mechanism is becoming frequently observed in zzso This study documents the occurrence and characteristics of an epidemic zzso zzso zzso strain in a teaching hospital located in Rio de zzso City, zzso The zzso zzso gene and a class 1 zzso were detected in 13 zzso representing zzso of the 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from January, 2000, to August, zzso DNA sequencing revealed that this zzso carries three gene zzso that zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso a putative zzso All 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso had closely related zzso gel zzso zzso profiles, designated as zzso group A, suggesting zzso spread of the zzso This zzso group was the same as that observed in other zzso zzso zzso zzso from distinct Brazilian zzso The dissemination of this clone throughout Brazil could not be explained by transfer of infected patients and/or sharing of common health-care zzso It is likely that the spread of these strains occurred indirectly via the zzso
