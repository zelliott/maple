zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed on two strains of zzso zzso that showed them to be clustered with major members of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso strains were isolated from tooth surfaces of zzso humans and showed the classical zzso shape of zzso species growing in zzso zzso analysis from zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene and zzso genes showed that these strains belonged to the zzso group, but both of them clustered into a new zzso zzso The zzso of these two zzso were zzso and zzso average zzso identity zzso demonstrated that these strains significantly differed from any zzso species, showing zzso values under zzso even when compared with the zzso closest species such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the two zzso also showed distinct zzso features relative to closely related species, like zzso zzso From the results of the present study, the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate these novel zzso which have been deposited in open collections at the Spanish type Culture Collection zzso and zzso Institute zzso Collection of zzso and Cell zzso zzso being respectively identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
