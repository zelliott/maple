We recently identified two zzso of mouse zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso 3 zzso which are produced by alternative zzso and different only in the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Honda, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined here zzso zzso of the two zzso using Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing these zzso Exposure of the zzso alpha zzso to zzso for 30 zzso did not change zzso response but increased zzso concentration needed to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Further exposure of this zzso to zzso suppressed the zzso response as well as sensitivity to zzso in a zzso manner; after zzso exposure, it zzso only 50% of the zzso response of the control zzso zzso with these results, short term exposure zzso the zzso alpha zzso away from the cell surface and long term incubation decreased the total zzso number in the zzso In contrast, exposure of the zzso beta zzso to zzso did not affect its zzso curve for zzso and no zzso or decrease in the zzso number was observed in this zzso Thus, alternative zzso produced the two zzso with different zzso zzso which are different in sensitivity to zzso zzso
