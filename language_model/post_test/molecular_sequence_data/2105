The contributions of direct and zzso repeats to deletion formation were studied by characterizing zzso zzso of plasmids with a series of zzso zzso at a specific site in the zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso The zzso at this site are zzso variable in zzso and bracketed by zzso or zzso direct repeats of zzso zzso There is an additional direct repeat composed of 4 zzso within the insert and 4 zzso of adjoining zzso zzso DNA sequencing and colony zzso of zzso zzso showed that they contained either the parental zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso repeats, or a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Although generally direct repeats seem to be used as deletion zzso with a frequency zzso to their zzso we found that with uninterrupted zzso longer than 32 zzso the majority of deletions ended in the 4 zzso not the zzso or zzso zzso This preferential use of the shorter direct repeats associated with zzso is interpreted according to a DNA zzso model in which hairpin structures formed by zzso pairing foster the zzso of nascent strands during DNA zzso
