Human zzso devoid of its zzso is expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso by zzso zzso after zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso removes its zzso zzso zzso during the zzso zzso The zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso of protein and retains full activity when stored several months at 4 degrees zzso It zzso the fluorescent zzso zzso at the zzso bond with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso M at pH zzso 37 degrees C, values closely similar to those for the zzso produced by zzso of the Chinese zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The properties of this form of zzso demonstrate that the zzso is not essential for proper folding or stability of the zzso but likely determines the zzso zzso acid of the mature zzso The pH dependence of zzso for zzso shows that zzso has a broad pH optimum zzso and the zzso values obtained are zzso and zzso at 25 degrees zzso The activity is inhibited by several metal binding agents including 1, zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by likely forming a transient zzso zzso zzso The zinc atom is then removed from the protein in a zzso zzso In agreement with the kinetic studies, dialysis in the presence of zzso and zzso removes only the zzso zinc zzso The zzso zzso can be zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the native activity by addition of zzso zzso nickel, and zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, forms an inactive zzso zzso The differences in the zzso accessibility properties of the two zinc sites can thus be exploited to yield zzso of zzso
