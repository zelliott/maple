To date zzso zzso is the only zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso ticks collected in zzso and zzso This suggests that the zzso diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases toward the southwestern margin of its Old World zzso zzso In order to further explore the genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso from this region, 55 zzso zzso and 27 zzso zzso zzso adults, collected during the spring of 1998 from a zzso habitat south of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso ticks and zzso in zzso zzso ticks were detected by a zzso zzso that targets the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso showed that the sequences in the majority of samples were similar to those of zzso zzso type strains zzso for strain zzso zzso for strain zzso Two novel zzso patterns were obtained from zzso of the zzso The remaining zzso of samples gave mixed zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequences revealed a diverse population of zzso zzso in zzso adult zzso zzso ticks (the sequences did not cluster with those of any other zzso This population consisted of 10 distinct sequence types, suggesting that multiple strains of zzso zzso were present in the local zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso has a narrow ecological niche that involves host species restricted to the Mediterranean zzso
