zzso sequences of human zzso virus zzso type 18 were used for screening of zzso cells zzso library in zzso zzso using the protein binding zzso zzso with zzso I gene zzso sequences were zzso This gene is coding the protein which binds the regulatory region of Y gene of main zzso complex zzso zzso The zzso I transcripts were revealed in all tested samples of cervical zzso To analyze the protein the rabbit zzso were produced to synthetic zzso which zzso to the most zzso region of the zzso This zzso serum allowed to identify the nuclear zzso protein in zzso cells as well as in normal zzso
