zzso and zzso are tumor zzso proteins that are involved as zzso via zzso in many cellular zzso such as DNA zzso Loss of zzso or zzso results in early embryonic zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso carries a zzso zzso and we were able to identify a zzso zzso zzso and the putative zzso protein are able to interact with each other as indicated by in zzso and in zzso zzso We have identified zzso zzso zzso for both zzso which show no visible zzso under standard growth conditions and are fully zzso Thus, in contrast to animals, both genes have no indispensable role during development and zzso in zzso The two single as well as the double zzso are to a similar extent sensitive to zzso C, indicating an zzso interaction in DNA zzso zzso We could further demonstrate that in zzso zzso plays a prominent role in the regulation of zzso DNA repair in zzso zzso
