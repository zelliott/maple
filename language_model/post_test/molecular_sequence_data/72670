The solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso in methanol zzso has been determined by zzso followed by distance bound driven dynamics and subsequent restrained molecular dynamics simulations combined with an zzso relaxation zzso approach and alternatively by a simulated zzso zzso The molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the zzso program system and with the zzso program zzso The distance bound driven dynamics calculation was conducted using a modified version of the zzso II zzso The zzso distance restraints were derived from jump zzso zzso zzso enhancement and exchange zzso zzso which yield optimum sensitivity for zzso molecules like zzso The zzso via the zzso bridges were zzso confirmed by zzso zzso techniques zzso single quantum zzso and zzso multiple bond correlation zzso Due to the zzso structure, zzso exhibits a rather rigid zzso shape, which neither belongs to the zzso nor to the zzso structure type zzso The resulting structures for the simulated zzso protocol of restrained and subsequent free molecular dynamics were compared and found to be very zzso
