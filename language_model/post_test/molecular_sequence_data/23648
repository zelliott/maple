zzso zzso zzso is a stress response protein that protects cells against diverse noxious zzso Although regulation of zzso occurs mainly at the zzso level, its zzso modifications remain zzso We have identified a putative consensus sequence for zzso by zzso of zzso at zzso zzso human and rat zzso but not zzso zzso are zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells confirmed that zzso is a zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso is increased by zzso zzso zzso a single point zzso equivalent to the zzso zzso exhibited over zzso higher activity than wild type zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso studies indicated that zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a slightly lower zzso than zzso zzso Although the changes in activity are small, this study provides the first evidence for a role of the survival zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso
