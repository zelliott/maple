We report two cases of acute zzso leukemia zzso with a zzso Philadelphia zzso zzso confirmed by the expression of zzso zzso using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The first patient was a 10-year-old boy with precursor B cell type zzso zzso zzso At diagnosis, no zzso cells were found by zzso analysis and zzso zzso was not zzso At the beginning of zzso which occurred after 7 months of complete zzso a normal zzso was zzso At the terminal stage, zzso cells with zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso variety were zzso The second patient was a 12-year-old boy with immature T cell type zzso The zzso cells showed a zzso zzso at diagnosis and zzso appeared in addition to zzso at zzso zzso zzso for the zzso variety was detected only when zzso had zzso The blast cells with zzso were derived from the original zzso clone through zzso evolution, since the same zzso zzso of zzso or zzso were detected in zzso cells obtained both at diagnosis and zzso in both zzso Thus, in both cases, zzso was detected only in the course of ALL along with expression of zzso zzso This observation also confirmed that, as in de zzso zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso varieties of zzso zzso are observed in ALL with zzso zzso
