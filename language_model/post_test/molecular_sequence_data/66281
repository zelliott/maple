zzso acid zzso is an important signal involved in the zzso of zzso responses against zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso acid or zzso zzso were proposed to be precursors of zzso This is in sharp contrast with studies in zzso zzso where zzso derives from zzso We have determined the importance of zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso using zzso gene zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Plants with silenced zzso expression do not accumulate zzso after exposure to zzso or to pathogen zzso Plants with silenced zzso expression also exhibit strongly decreased levels of zzso a product of zzso Our data provide evidence for an zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso
