zzso zzso is part of the normal zzso of the human gastrointestinal tract and also the leading cause of bacterial infections in human newborns and zzso zzso The colonization and infection of different regions within the human host require a regulatory network in zzso zzso that senses environmental stimuli and controls the formation of specific zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized an zzso zzso regulator, designated zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso resulted in strain zzso zzso which exhibited an increased attachment to immobilized zzso and a significant increase in adherence to the zzso lung zzso cell line zzso zzso of expression levels of known and putative zzso zzso zzso genes by real-time zzso revealed that zzso influences the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The altered gene expression in zzso zzso zzso was restored by zzso expression of zzso confirming the zzso zzso as the cause for the observed changes in zzso gene expression in zzso zzso DNA zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso specifically binds to the promoter regions of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso indicating that zzso directly regulates their zzso zzso and zzso studies in the promoter region of zzso zzso the main zzso zzso in zzso zzso identified a zzso DNA zzso Similar motifs were also found in the promoter regions of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and alignments allowed us to propose a consensus sequence for the zzso site of zzso
