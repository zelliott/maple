In order to understand the structural bases of zzso zzso zzso zzso and gating in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modification were combined to identify the zzso acid zzso that line the zzso The side chains of alternate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso segment of the alpha zzso are exposed in the closed zzso Thus alpha zzso probably forms a beta zzso and the gate is closer to the zzso end of the channel than any of these zzso On channel zzso zzso is also zzso These results lead to a revised view of the closed and open channel zzso
