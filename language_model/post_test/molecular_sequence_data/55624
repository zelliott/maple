A complete zzso copy of the fourth zzso segment of the human group B zzso adult zzso zzso zzso has been cloned into zzso zzso and excised into zzso zzso zzso Gene segment 4 contains zzso bases and encodes one long open reading frame beginning at base 16 and terminating at base zzso The zzso protein contains zzso zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso Gene 4 zzso was inserted into a zzso zzso via zzso zzso The gene 4 zzso zzso at 84 zzso when expressed either by a zzso zzso or in zzso in a rabbit zzso zzso The gene 4 protein is zzso by zzso serum to zzso human zzso zzso serum, a zzso group B zzso infection serum, and a zzso zzso made to zzso zzso zzso pig zzso serum to the zzso zzso zzso protein recognizes virus and zzso an zzso protein from in zzso translations of total zzso zzso In addition, the gene zzso protein shares significant zzso acid identity and similarity with the group A zzso zzso zzso This information, together with our previous identification of an zzso protein present on zzso intact zzso but not zzso zzso suggests that gene 4 encodes the zzso protein equivalent present on the outer zzso of zzso The zzso zzso protein is also zzso identical to the zzso rat group B zzso gene segment 3 zzso The substantial differences between these two group B zzso proteins suggests that they are zzso related and likely to define two different group B zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein should be useful for developing zzso zzso and tests for human and animal group B zzso as well as for addressing the role of zzso in zzso zzso
