zzso fiber zzso zzso or zzso is the major component of the zzso zzso fibers zzso in the zzso zzso apparatus of green zzso We generated nuclear zzso of zzso expressing green fluorescent protein zzso fused to the zzso of zzso zzso assembled into zzso fibers that exceeded those of zzso cells in size by several zzso At elevated temperatures zzso degrees zzso zzso was mostly soluble and heat shock zzso the zzso zzso deletions of 18 or only six zzso disturbed the ability of zzso to zzso indicating an important role of the zzso domain for fiber zzso The exchange of the penultimate zzso with zzso made zzso highly zzso causing zzso fiber formation and zzso heat stability to the zzso By contrast, a replacement with zzso acid increased the zzso of the zzso indicating that zzso on zzso might control zzso of zzso In zzso observation of zzso zzso showed that zzso fibers were zzso during zzso In cells zzso full-length or truncated zzso the amount of zzso protein was zzso zzso temperatures dissolved zzso fibers and induced the synthesis of zzso suggesting that cells control both the amount of soluble and zzso zzso By expressing zzso consisting of zzso and zzso DNA for parts of zzso in zzso zzso the amount of zzso was severely zzso In these strains we observed defects in zzso zzso indicating an important role for zzso zzso roots in the zzso zzso
