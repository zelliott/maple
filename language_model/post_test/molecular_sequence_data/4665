A previous study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and two designed zzso at this site, zzso and zzso showed that these zzso cause partial or total zzso of the zzso expressed in zzso cells from the corresponding zzso zzso zzso We now report on expression and characterization of the zzso from the following zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso that zzso to six of the seven zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All the zzso caused partial zzso of the zzso as observed by the zzso zzso characteristics and by separation of the expressed zzso into zzso that bound zzso to form the corresponding zzso zzso and those that did not bind zzso Further, all the zzso zzso prepared from the above zzso except for zzso showed zzso abnormal zzso behavior with abnormal zzso II zzso The results show that zzso zzso zzso in every one of the zzso zzso can cause zzso of the zzso zzso on the basis of these and previous results, we conclude that defects in the packing of the zzso zzso resulting from these zzso are relayed to the zzso domain, where they cause zzso of the zzso by inducing the formation of a zzso bond other than the native zzso zzso zzso Thus, there is zzso between packing of the zzso in the zzso domain and folding to a zzso structure in the zzso zzso
