We describe zzso a zzso intensive project aimed at carrying out molecular dynamics zzso simulations including water and zzso on zzso zzso containing all 136 unique zzso base zzso This initiative was undertaken by an international collaborative effort involving nine research groups, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out on the 136 cases zzso in 39 DNA zzso with repeating zzso zzso capped on both ends by zzso pairs and each having a total length of 15 zzso zzso All MD simulations were carried out using a zzso zzso the zzso suite of programs, and the zzso force zzso Phase I of the ABC project involves a total of approximately zzso zzso of simulation for systems containing approximately 24,000 zzso The resulting zzso involve 600,000 coordinate sets and represent approximately 400 gigabytes of zzso In this article, the research design, details of the simulation zzso zzso issues, and the organization of the results into a zzso database are zzso zzso results from zzso MD zzso are presented for the zzso step in its 10 unique sequence zzso and issues of stability and zzso the extent of zzso problems, and the possibility of zzso zzso zzso are zzso
