zzso storage of zzso human zzso growth factor zzso an important promoter of cell division, results in its conversion to a new species that zzso later than native zzso on a zzso zzso This new species, called zzso has only zzso of the biological activity of native zzso zzso mapping indicated that the primary structure of zzso differs from that of native zzso solely within the first 13 zzso zzso sequencing of zzso revealed that about zzso of the zzso have been zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, the yields after the His zzso at position 10 were extremely low, indicating that a chemical modification occurs at zzso 11 that is incompatible with zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso acid 11 had been converted to an zzso zzso and this was confirmed with zzso zzso an zzso that zzso the zzso zzso group of zzso zzso but does not recognize normal zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was found to be a zzso of this zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso localized the site of zzso to a zzso zzso containing position zzso We did not observe formation of the zzso zzso in zzso that had been zzso by reduction of its zzso zzso In addition, replacement of the zzso zzso at position 11 with zzso acid resulted in a fully active zzso zzso that does not form zzso amounts of zzso We propose that conversion of this zzso zzso to zzso is a significant zzso degradation reaction affecting this growth zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
