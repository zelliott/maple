The complement system is a crucial component of the innate immune response against invading bacterial zzso The human pathogen zzso zzso zzso is known to possess several mechanisms to evade the complement system, including binding to complement zzso In this study, we describe an additional mechanism used by zzso to evade the complement system and survive in human zzso Using an zzso zzso deletion zzso and zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the central component of the complement zzso The zzso occurs 4 zzso upstream from the natural zzso zzso site and produces shorter zzso and longer zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in the presence of the complement regulators zzso H and zzso and this degradation results in lower deposition of zzso on the bacterial zzso We conclude that zzso is an important factor to increase the survival of zzso in human zzso
