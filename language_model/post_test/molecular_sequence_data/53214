The zzso zzso system is necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso and is responsible for regulating several modifications of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso regulator zzso resulted in the identification of a zzso able to activate zzso of regulated genes approximately zzso in the absence of zzso zzso analysis showed two zzso zzso resulting in zzso acid changes at positions 93 zzso and zzso zzso These zzso were individually created, and although each resulted in a zzso zzso the double zzso displayed a synergistic effect both in the induction of zzso gene expression and in resistance to zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was placed under the control of an zzso promoter to examine the zzso of zzso gene induction and the zzso modifications of zzso Gene induction and zzso modification of the zzso A were shown to occur within minutes of the addition of zzso and to peak at 4 zzso As the first zzso zzso of zzso identified, this zzso will be invaluable to future genetic and zzso studies of this and likely other regulatory zzso
