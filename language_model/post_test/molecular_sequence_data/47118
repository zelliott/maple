Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were produced by zzso with a synthetic zzso with a sequence based upon that of the protein core of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso The zzso were identified as T G T Q for zzso and P T G T Q for zzso zzso competition tests also confirmed the overlapping nature of the zzso for the two zzso zzso and zzso were employed in zzso columns for the zzso of human zzso zzso tissue zzso While the two zzso displayed only relatively minor differences in zzso specificity and affinity for the zzso synthetic zzso zzso core related zzso they had the capacity to separate zzso distinct molecules when used as zzso The findings indicated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso exist in human zzso and that these may be distinguished by the differential exposure of zzso in the zzso protein zzso The results are in zzso with the view that zzso patterns of zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso produces a spectrum of zzso zzso zzso
