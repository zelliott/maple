The molecular basis of zzso zzso is poorly zzso Work on zzso zzso has implicated beta zzso zzso but the limited information available for zzso indicates zzso peptides containing the zzso sequence do not inhibit zzso and induction of cell spreading in zzso zzso cells by zzso is not accompanied by an increase in synthesis of zzso beta zzso Here we report that beta zzso zzso are, zzso the principal zzso receptors in the zzso zzso although their cell surface levels are zzso zzso recognizing the external domain of the zzso can, unlike peptides containing the zzso site, block zzso when introduced into the zzso These results allow us to propose a model to explain the role of zzso beta 1 in zzso zzso
