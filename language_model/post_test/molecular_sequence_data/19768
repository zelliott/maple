zzso (a 12 S zzso is the most abundant storage protein in the seeds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso sharing structural similarity with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor in the rough zzso zzso zzso assembly is accompanied by structural zzso involving zzso and zzso formation prior to deposition in protein storage zzso The zzso zzso zzso Columbia zzso contains four zzso zzso two of which, on the basis of zzso analysis, give rise to three alternatively spliced zzso Using zzso we confirmed the presence of four zzso zzso by genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso along with zzso detection using zzso zzso and zzso against zzso zzso acid zzso revealed that zzso was the major zzso protein in zzso seeds and that zzso far exceeded that predicted on the basis of known zzso The latter may be zzso at least in part, to zzso site zzso A total of 20 zzso sites, zzso nine zzso eight zzso and three zzso zzso were identified by zzso Most of these are located on the zzso zzso zzso face of the zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso The implications of these findings for zzso processing, assembly and zzso are zzso In addition, the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to exhibit increased levels of zzso zzso suggesting either that zzso may be an in zzso target for this zzso or that zzso regulates the protein zzso system required for zzso zzso
