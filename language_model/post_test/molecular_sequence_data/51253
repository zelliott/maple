zzso of the zzso zzso zzso delta locus are observed in the majority of human zzso precursor acute zzso zzso zzso with a striking predominance of V delta zzso delta 3 zzso in common ALL zzso zzso Recently, we and others showed that almost zzso of zzso cases are characterized by further zzso of V delta zzso delta 3 segments to J alpha zzso thereby deleting the zzso delta locus in zzso to the delta zzso J alpha zzso in zzso zzso T zzso We report here that two human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso are competent to recombine the zzso zzso locus under standard tissue culture zzso Analysis of different zzso zzso obtained by limiting dilution of the initial culture showed a biased zzso of V delta zzso delta 3 to distinct J alpha zzso During prolonged tissue culture, a zzso acquired growth advantage and displaced parental cells as well as other zzso zzso the DJ junctions of zzso zzso contained extended stretches of zzso sequences derived from modified D delta 3 coding zzso The other cell line, zzso started the zzso zzso zzso with an unusual signal joint of a cryptic zzso signal sequence zzso upstream of D delta 3 to the 3' zzso of D delta zzso The zzso zzso was subsequently rearranged in all investigated zzso to an identical J alpha zzso Both cell lines might become valuable tools to unravel the complex regulation of zzso zzso zzso pathways in zzso and normal zzso
