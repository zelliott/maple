We recently identified the second of three zzso zzso in the skeletal muscle zzso zzso type 1 zzso as a potential binding partner in the zzso zzso channel for the zzso zzso loop of the skeletal muscle zzso zzso for a scorpion zzso zzso A and for an zzso interaction within zzso zzso zzso are structural zzso that were first described in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spore zzso A and all three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our studies are the first to assign a function to any of the three zzso zzso in the zzso However, in other systems zzso zzso provide binding sites for regulatory proteins or zzso binding sites that maintain the structural integrity of a zzso In this article, we review the general characteristics of a range of zzso zzso and discuss evidence that the zzso domain in zzso supports interactions with binding partners that contain a structural surface of aligned basic zzso
