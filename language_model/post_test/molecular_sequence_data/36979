In zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to exist in two distinct forms zzso zzso zzso zzso in similar zzso The binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso alpha requires the zzso be in its zzso 8-10 to S zzso zzso to other protein zzso while zzso binding to zzso beta can occur with the zzso 5-6 S zzso Occupancy of zzso alpha by zzso zzso protects it from zzso zzso zzso beta is not zzso by high salt zzso The addition of zzso to zzso during tissue homogenization stabilized zzso alpha against zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not prevent zzso of zzso beta by high zzso Although the presence of zzso appears to stabilize zzso alpha in its zzso 8-10 zzso it had no significant effect on the overall amount of zzso complex which bound to its specific DNA recognition site, the zzso responsive element zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso is either unable to transform or bind to the zzso with high zzso
