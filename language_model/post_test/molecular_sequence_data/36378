A zzso method for zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso was developed in which the target sequence is amplified by the zzso using fluorescent zzso The amplified products are then zzso and applied to a zzso controlled gel in an automated DNA zzso The separated strands are detected as zzso zzso at the bottom of the zzso and zzso are detected as shifts in the position of the zzso in the zzso The system does not involve zzso and the conditions of zzso are more strictly controlled than in the previous system, which relied on ambient zzso to maintain the gel at a constant zzso The nature of the output data allows direct quantitative zzso and so the relative abundance of each zzso in a mixture of two or more zzso can easily be zzso The application of zzso for detection of zzso and loss of zzso of zzso in tumor zzso is zzso
