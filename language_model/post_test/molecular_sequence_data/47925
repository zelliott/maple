The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso in zzso nuclear factor zzso a zzso factor zzso to zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso type 2 zzso zzso between diabetes and two zzso markers at the zzso locus zzso and zzso was evaluated in 32 zzso families with zzso zzso type 2 diabetes zzso to known zzso diabetes of the young zzso Total zzso of odds zzso scores were strongly negative zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso but linkage could not be excluded in 15 families having zzso scores zzso To screen these zzso for zzso zzso the gene structure was zzso Because reverse zzso chain reaction experiments indicated that the first zzso zzso of the published zzso sequence zzso zzso were a cloning artifact, the correct zzso sequence was determined by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and primer extension zzso Based on the new zzso sequence zzso zzso 11 zzso were zzso After screening the zzso zzso region and all coding zzso for zzso we identified several zzso one of which affected the zzso acid sequence zzso However, no zzso segregating with diabetes could be found in these zzso We conclude that genetic zzso in the zzso gene is unlikely to play a major role in the zzso of zzso zzso type 2 zzso
