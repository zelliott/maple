We isolated a zzso zzso zzso from a zzso pond located on the zzso Ice zzso in zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of this zzso showed that it is a member of the zzso zzso This assignment is consistent with the zzso and zzso characteristics of the zzso A gene zzso a zzso in this isolate was cloned in an zzso coli zzso zzso analysis of this gene placed it in zzso family 42 most closely related to an zzso from zzso zzso Even though an increasing number of family 42 zzso sequences are appearing in databases, little information about the zzso features of these zzso is zzso zzso we zzso and characterized this zzso The zzso zzso did not appear to have any metal requirement, had an optimum pH of zzso and an optimum temperature of activity at 42 degrees C, and was zzso zzso within 10 zzso when it was incubated at 55 degrees zzso The zzso had an apparent zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso of protein at 39 degrees zzso Of special interest was the finding that the zzso remained active at high salt zzso which makes it a possible reporter zzso for zzso and zzso zzso
