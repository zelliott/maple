The zzso zzso zzso play a major role in zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to isolate a zzso in zzso zzso by using a zzso 10 zzso zzso system and evaluate its adherence to host zzso One zzso apparently did not possess zzso as it did not react with a zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso of capsule was confirmed by flow zzso and also by transmission electron zzso after zzso zzso zzso The site of zzso of the zzso 10 was determined and found to be in the zzso zzso Its gene product, zzso is a protein involved in zzso transport across the zzso membrane during zzso zzso Use of zzso zzso frozen sections indicated that the zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso more than the parent zzso The zzso zzso was less virulent in pigs compared to the parent strain and showed no mortality in zzso infected zzso The zzso zzso was however resistant to pig zzso This zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso in a zzso transport zzso It is also the first time that adherence of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso Our observations indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 are not involved in adherence to zzso zzso frozen sections but rather mask, at least in part, the adhesive zzso
