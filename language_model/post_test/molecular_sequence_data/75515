A novel human T cell zzso zzso zzso located 85 zzso upstream to the C alpha coding regions, was isolated using human zzso clones to identify zzso zzso to messages zzso by this zzso The deduced protein sequence of this gene is highly zzso to that of the newly identified constant region found in the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso This gene zzso zzso and is expressed at the zzso level in human zzso peripheral T cells and several zzso T cell lines which have been shown to express the surface zzso zzso suggesting that this gene encodes the human T cell delta zzso
