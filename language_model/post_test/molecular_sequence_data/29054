zzso of zzso into suspension cultures of zzso zzso induced cell zzso which was confirmed by gel zzso of the DNA ladders indicating the progressive zzso of fragmented nuclear DNA zzso into distinct zzso The additional zzso not only changed the zzso assembly of cells, but also affected the gene zzso Fourteen zzso fragments, named as zzso were isolated after addition of zzso and their zzso zzso numbers were given as zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso were apparently homogeneous with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other zzso fragments showed no significant zzso with the known sequences in zzso
