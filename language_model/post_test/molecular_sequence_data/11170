zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased cell surface expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and increased collagen zzso In tumor zzso outgrowth zzso cell migration of zzso zzso relative to control was enhanced on collagen and decreased on zzso and zzso These effects were reversed by zzso and were not associated with any substantial changes in cell zzso zzso of zzso cells to the zzso domain of zzso was specifically inhibited by zzso zzso blocking zzso indicating that zzso interacts with zzso through the zzso zzso portion at or near the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that these mechanisms could govern directed zzso degradation in the tumor zzso zzso by zzso of active zzso on the cell zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso and its zzso activity localized to the cell surface could zzso zzso tumor cell migration in response to particular zzso proteins by altering both composition of the zzso zzso and expression of zzso receptors on the cell zzso
