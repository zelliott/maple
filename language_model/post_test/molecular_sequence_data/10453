A regulatory zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso It encodes a zzso protein zzso which contains a zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso exhibits similarity with the zzso family members over the entire zzso It displays zzso identity with zzso (the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso identity with zzso (a putative regulatory gene of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso (the carbon zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso disruption of zzso affected the expression of several zzso The production of zzso of zzso zzso and that of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso were enhanced in the zzso zzso strains and relieved of carbon zzso zzso As a result, the zzso level of the zzso of zzso zzso was noticeably increased in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the induction of zzso production in zzso zzso was relieved of carbon zzso repression by zzso in the zzso zzso strain, while the induction by zzso was zzso zzso zzso can be regarded as a zzso regulatory gene in zzso zzso
