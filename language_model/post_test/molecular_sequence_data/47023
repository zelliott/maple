Plants and zzso show an astonishing diversity of mechanisms to promote zzso the most widespread of which is sexual zzso Sexual zzso involves molecular recognition between mating zzso In zzso and algae, highly zzso zzso zzso mediate mating through complementary interactions between molecules zzso or regulated by different zzso zzso whereas in flowering plants zzso zzso zzso regulate mate recognition through zzso interactions between molecules zzso by the same zzso zzso This subtle zzso difference is a consequence of the different life cycles of zzso algae, and flowering zzso Recent molecular and zzso studies have provided fascinating insights into the mechanisms of mate recognition and are beginning to shed light on evolution and population zzso of these extraordinarily zzso genetic systems of zzso
