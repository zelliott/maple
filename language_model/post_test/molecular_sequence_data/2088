zzso zzso is the zzso agent of a lethal pneumonia which occurs in patients with the acquired immune zzso syndrome zzso and other zzso zzso The basic zzso and genetic characteristics of zzso zzso are poorly understood and its zzso zzso as a zzso is zzso To address the zzso question, a method was developed for the extraction of total zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed the two zzso zzso species of zzso zzso to be similar in size to those of other lower zzso including zzso zzso Three portions of the small zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso by reverse zzso from zzso zzso Three hundred zzso zzso of sequence were zzso The sequence derived from zzso zzso zzso contained regions that previous zzso studies have shown to be highly variable among species, as well as regions that are highly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence to corresponding sequences of organisms from other zzso showed the zzso zzso sequence to be more similar to sequences from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso than to zzso
