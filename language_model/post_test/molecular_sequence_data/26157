We have isolated and characterized complementary zzso zzso zzso chicken cardiac muscle zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The cardiac muscle zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein that differs from chicken skeletal muscle zzso and zzso throughout its zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein that is most similar zzso to the zzso class including rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the cardiac and zzso zzso are identical from the position zzso cardiac zzso acid 81 zzso zzso acid zzso through cardiac zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The sequences differ both zzso and 3' of this region of zzso These comparisons suggest that the chicken cardiac zzso and zzso zzso zzso are derived from the same zzso locus by alternative zzso zzso analysis suggests that this locus encodes at least one other zzso zzso
