The synthesis of a novel zzso zzso with a zzso backbone is zzso This zzso has been used to incorporate a zzso zzso on an zzso zzso directly in the course of its automated zzso Multiple zzso attachments can be achieved by repetitive zzso zzso A simple and rapid zzso method is described where zzso zzso are zzso attached to zzso zzso The binding capacity of the membrane can be zzso depending on the zzso concentration used, to zzso 180 zzso There is at least zzso end attachment of the zzso through the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso can be used as a carrier for the zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso incorporated at the zzso of the zzso is recognized as a zzso by the T4 zzso zzso and the terminal zzso group is successfully zzso allowing its zzso zzso
