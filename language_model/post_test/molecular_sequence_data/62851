zzso is an zzso zzso in the base zzso repair zzso zzso that is involved in the repair of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso contains a zzso cluster that is part of a novel DNA binding zzso referred to as the zzso cluster loop zzso zzso This motif is found in a subset of members of the zzso zzso zzso defining the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully employed to investigate the zzso interface of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated adjacent to the zzso mismatch formed a specific zzso between the zzso DNA and zzso The zzso acid participating in the zzso reaction was characterized by positive zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso This analysis revealed zzso 143 as the site of modification in zzso zzso 143 and nearby zzso 147 are zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of zzso 143 and zzso 147 with zzso by zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso activity of zzso toward zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso zzso exhibit a reduced affinity for duplexes containing the zzso analogue zzso opposite zzso and zzso Modeling of zzso bound to DNA using an zzso zzso complex structure shows that these two zzso zzso are located within close proximity to the DNA zzso The insight from mass zzso experiments combined with functional zzso results indicate that these two zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso play an important role in recognition of the damaged DNA zzso
