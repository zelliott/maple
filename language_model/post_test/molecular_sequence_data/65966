We previously showed that nuclear export of the large zzso zzso zzso relies on zzso in a zzso zzso Recently the general zzso export factor, the zzso zzso was shown to act as an export zzso in parallel with zzso These observations raise the possibility that nuclear export of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso requires multiple export zzso Here, we show that the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso also acts as an export zzso for the zzso zzso We found that deletion of zzso was synthetic lethal with zzso and zzso zzso and was synthetic sick with several zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso of zzso particles in the nucleus that were enriched for zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that in the absence of zzso zzso export is impaired even though the zzso is loaded with export zzso Finally, zzso zzso with several zzso in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso These results show that zzso can directly bridge the interaction between the zzso particle and the zzso and thus is a third export zzso for the zzso zzso in zzso
