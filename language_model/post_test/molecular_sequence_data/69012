The strong association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso women suggests that these class II molecules play a crucial role in the immune response against zzso The zzso system zzso results in a single zzso acid zzso at the zzso 33 of the zzso zzso So, we tested the binding of peptides from the zzso region of the zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a solid phase zzso and a liquid phase zzso binding zzso No binding was demonstrated, indicating that either the crucial region for binding to class II molecules is not the zzso region, or that other events only occurring zzso zzso are required for zzso These results may also suggest an indirect role of the zzso 33 for zzso zzso
