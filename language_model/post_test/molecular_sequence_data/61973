DNA zzso zzso a member of the X family of DNA zzso is known to be involved in base zzso zzso A key to determining the zzso properties of this DNA zzso is zzso studies of zzso zzso that result in substitution of particular zzso acids at critical zzso In a previous genetic screen, we identified three zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso of zzso beta in the flexible loop of the palm zzso In this work, we perform an extensive kinetic analysis to investigate the role of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso T opposite template bases G and zzso The zzso basis of zzso appears to be altered DNA positioning within the active zzso We provide evidence that the zzso of zzso is greatly affected by the base that is zzso of the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso at position 246 helps to maintain the proper positioning of the DNA within the zzso active site and maintains the zzso of zzso zzso Altogether, the results suggest that the flexible loop domain of zzso beta plays a major role in its zzso
