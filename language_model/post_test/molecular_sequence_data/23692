The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso gel zzso enabling the construction of a physical and genetic zzso A total of 21 recognition sites of the restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were mapped on the zzso which was found to be circular with an estimated size of zzso zzso This is believed to constitute the first study into the zzso organization of a strain of this zzso addressing the zzso of important zzso regions such as zzso and zzso A total of 23 genetic markers were zzso including eight zzso zzso that were precisely assigned in 37 % of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso direction of zzso zzso was determined and three different zzso clusters were recognized regarding the zzso of zzso genes in ITS zzso
