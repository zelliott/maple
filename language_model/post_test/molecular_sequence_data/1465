This paper describes the application of two novel screening technologies, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso technology, in the mapping of a zzso zzso on zzso for a series of 20 zzso zzso 11 out of 20 zzso mapping of which was not successful by conventional zzso technology zzso zzso showed selective binding to zzso corresponding to the zzso of zzso in the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso replacement analysis studies with zzso zzso revealed that for most zzso the zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso form the core of the zzso A zzso zzso performed in the zzso format showed highly selective binding for zzso 1 and 2 with only three zzso zzso covering the zzso zzso in combination with zzso while for zzso 10 binding was observed with zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso 17 showed that peptides from four different regions on zzso zzso strand zzso alpha zzso long zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced binding in combination with several zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso 1, 2, 13, and 17 using a set of 21 different zzso partially confirmed the zzso and zzso zzso screening zzso Only zzso and zzso peptides covering both the 1st and 2nd strand of the zzso showed measurable zzso zzso zzso zzso mimics were found to bind significantly stronger zzso approximately 5 zzso than the zzso zzso in agreement with the fact that the zzso zzso is part of a loop zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the linear zzso zzso via zzso bond formation showed a 2-3 fold increase in zzso thus zzso participation of the beta zzso in zzso binding for these zzso
