We have cloned human protein zzso zzso zzso and found that it contains two regulatory zzso sites, zzso and zzso which zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso Thus it differs significantly from the previously published rat zzso We have also isolated a similar clone from a mouse zzso zzso In human zzso zzso is widely expressed as two zzso A zzso analysis of the two regulatory sites of human zzso showed that zzso of both sites, occurring in a zzso zzso manner, is required for full zzso Our results suggest that the two zzso sites act in concert to produce full zzso of zzso similar to zzso This contrasts with rat zzso which is thought to be regulated by zzso protein zzso 1 zzso
