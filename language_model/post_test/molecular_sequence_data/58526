Two members of coronavirus zzso I, human respiratory coronavirus zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus zzso use zzso N zzso as their cellular zzso These viruses show marked species specificity in zzso zzso as zzso can zzso human but not zzso zzso while zzso can zzso zzso but not human zzso To determine whether zzso zzso could serve as a zzso for two zzso zzso in zzso I, zzso infectious zzso virus zzso and zzso enteric coronavirus zzso we cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso from zzso isolated from a zzso cell line and zzso expressed it in zzso and zzso mouse and zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso shows 78 and zzso identity with human and zzso zzso zzso When zzso with either of two biologically different strains of zzso or with zzso zzso mouse and zzso cells became infected and viral zzso developed in the zzso zzso zzso was released from zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso The zzso mouse and zzso cells were challenged with other zzso in zzso I including canine zzso zzso coronavirus zzso and human coronavirus zzso In addition to serving as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso also served as a functional zzso for each of these zzso I zzso as shown by development of viral zzso in the zzso of infected mouse or zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso In contrast, zzso did not serve as a functional zzso for mouse zzso virus zzso which is in zzso II and zzso mouse zzso zzso receptors unrelated to zzso Thus, zzso serves as a zzso for a much broader range of group I zzso than human and zzso zzso The human, zzso and canine zzso in zzso I that are able to use zzso as a zzso have previously been shown to zzso cats without causing zzso zzso host factors in addition to zzso specificity apparently affect the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso I zzso in the zzso
