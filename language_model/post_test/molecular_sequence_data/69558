As an early stage of plant transformation by zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso at the border sequences that zzso the zzso zzso results in zzso attachment of zzso to the zzso terminal of the zzso strand by a process resembling initiation of DNA transfer that occurs in the donor cell during bacterial zzso We demonstrate that this zzso can be reproduced in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed with zzso zzso encompassing the zzso zzso border region or the transfer zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso can cut only the zzso zzso zzso The respective proteins remain zzso bound to the zzso end of the zzso sites, leaving the 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be an equilibrium reaction that allows specific joining of zzso products restoring border and zzso regions, zzso The possible role of zzso in zzso integration into the plant cell's zzso is discussed in terms of less stringent zzso zzso
