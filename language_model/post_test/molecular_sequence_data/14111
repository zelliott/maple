We report the first case of two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso that have been cloned and zzso from an zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence suggested the presence of two zzso genes in the zzso The two genes are isolated using different molecular zzso zzso via zzso to a zzso library using a zzso probe and zzso from zzso using a zzso probe generated by zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso and zzso are different zzso The zzso zzso sequences show that all essential zzso of the active site are strictly zzso which suggests both genes zzso functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis by the maximum zzso method with zzso zzso of previously known zzso zzso reveals two zzso groups, zzso and zzso The position of zzso in this zzso is undefined with respect to zzso zzso zzso plant, zzso and zzso zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso detected in zzso is zzso perhaps as old as the origins of the zzso zzso in the zzso more than 500 million years zzso In zzso zzso to zzso zzso places the genes on different zzso which is consistent with an ancient gene zzso
