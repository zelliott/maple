zzso motifs are modular zzso interaction zzso consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso whose function appears to be the direction of zzso proteins to zzso zzso In skeletal muscle, there are a few known zzso zzso which include zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso both of which are components of the zzso complex, and zzso zzso zzso which binds to the zzso repeats of zzso Here, we report the identification and characterization of a new skeletal muscle protein containing a zzso domain that binds to the zzso region of zzso This novel zzso protein is specifically expressed in heart and skeletal zzso Using zzso produced to a zzso of the zzso we can show its location in the zzso at the level of the zzso by zzso zzso At least two zzso 32 zzso and 78 zzso can be detected by Western zzso analysis of both heart and skeletal muscle, suggesting the existence of alternative forms of the zzso In fact, several forms were found that appear to be the result of alternative zzso The transcript coding for this zzso alternatively spliced zzso motif zzso protein maps on zzso zzso near the locus for zzso zzso zzso
