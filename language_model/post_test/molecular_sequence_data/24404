zzso zzso was investigated as an zzso zzso The label was amenable to high zzso zzso but did not interfere with mass zzso zzso The zzso label has high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso zzso at zzso zzso 267 zzso is chemically stable, and adds easily in reductive zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso Various linear and zzso zzso were labeled with zzso and the products were zzso by zzso on porous zzso carbon zzso The zzso reaction gave excellent yields zzso Up to zzso increase in zzso sensitivity at zzso zzso 206 zzso compared to the corresponding zzso was zzso Mass zzso were recorded for the labeled zzso In the presence of sodium zzso series of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of the labeled compounds prior to mass zzso analysis resulted in simplified zzso zzso only) and allowed for complete sequence zzso The retention of the positive charge at the label in the zzso species was consistent with the zzso of the zzso The smallest amount of labeled sugar to be detected by zzso array zzso was 5 zzso zzso zzso 267 zzso
