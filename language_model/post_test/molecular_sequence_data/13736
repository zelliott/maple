We studied the effects of ozone exposure and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in Brown Norway rats in zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso probe, we detected a zzso zzso zzso zzso by Northern analysis in rat zzso The zzso signal was weak in control zzso but increased in lungs exposed to ozone (3 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso with zzso expression at 2 zzso declining by 8 h and increasing again at 24 h zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso expression in the lungs of both controls and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that ozone inhalation zzso zzso expression in zzso thus providing evidence at the molecular level for the possible involvement of zzso oxide generation in zzso pulmonary inflammation or lung zzso
