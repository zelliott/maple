To zzso the functional role of the zzso zzso highly zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso into Ala, zzso or zzso All of the zzso zzso had markedly reduced activities in the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso did not change significantly upon the zzso except for a zzso increase in zzso values for zzso in the Ala and zzso zzso The pH profiles of kinetic parameters of the zzso considerably differed from those of the wild type, in which two zzso groups with zzso values of zzso and zzso must be zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso Combined with the analyses of zzso isotope effect and zzso by zzso zzso these results unequivocally show that the zzso group of zzso zzso in zzso as a general base, assisting the zzso attack of a water zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the Ala zzso was markedly zzso by primary zzso depending on the zzso and molecular volume, suggesting that in the Ala zzso the added zzso can partially replace the general base function of zzso in the wild type zzso
