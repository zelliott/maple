The duration of the persistence and dynamics of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied in lungs of laboratory mice after zzso and intravenous challenge by virulent bacteria of the zzso agent of zzso zzso The capability of the virulent zzso zzso bacteria to long-term persistence in the body of mice was zzso Using the real-time zzso approximately hundred zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA were detected in lungs of mice in two months after infection regardless of the way of zzso Using the bacterial test bacteria were identified during only four weeks after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were accumulated for the infection zzso The percentage of the zzso bacteria in the zzso zzso population reached 50% in 7-9 weeks after zzso The obtained results show that the laboratory mice can be used for study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation dynamics in zzso and confirm the hypothesis about zzso zzso zzso zzso virulent zzso zzso during development of zzso infection in zzso
