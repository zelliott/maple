A scoring procedure is described for measuring the quality of the results for protein identifications obtained from spectral matching of zzso data using the zzso database search zzso The scoring system is essentially zzso and operates by zzso the probability that a protein identification has come about by zzso The probability is based on the number of identified peptides from the zzso the total number of identified zzso and the fraction of distinct zzso peptides from the database that are present in the identified zzso The score is not strictly a zzso as it also incorporates information about the quality of the individual zzso zzso The result of using zzso on a large test set of data was similar to that achieved using approaches that validate individual spectral matches, with only a narrow overlap in scores between identified proteins and false positive zzso In direct comparison with a published method of evaluating zzso results, zzso was able to identify an equivalent number of proteins without any identifiable false positive zzso zzso greatly reduces the number of zzso protein identifications that have to be validated zzso
