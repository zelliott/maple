The zzso zzso zzso and zzso catalyze the degradation of zzso zzso zzso components in the growth plate and at the same time cleave and release biologically active molecules stored in the zzso such as zzso In mice, zzso of zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso causes severe distortion of the zzso growth zzso We report that zzso in either zzso or zzso are responsible for the human disease zzso zzso zzso a zzso group of disorders for which a milder zzso zzso and a more severe dominant zzso are zzso We found that zzso MAD is caused by zzso loss of function of either zzso or zzso whereas dominant MAD is associated with zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso that determine zzso of zzso and zzso degradation of both zzso and zzso resulting in a double zzso zzso
