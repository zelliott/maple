zzso zzso analyses were performed in an attempt to determine cellular zzso zzso interactions with the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of the zzso C virus zzso zzso Two cellular zzso with estimated molecular masses of 58 zzso zzso and 35 zzso zzso respectively, were found to specifically bind to the 3' zzso The zzso protein was determined to be the zzso zzso zzso In addition to binding to the zzso 98 zzso zzso of the 3' zzso zzso also binds to the zzso tract of the 3' zzso The zzso protein was found to interact only with the zzso tract of the 3' zzso These conclusions are supported by the following findings: zzso zzso and not zzso binds to the 3' end zzso 98 zzso zzso both zzso and zzso bind to a 3' zzso zzso with a deletion of the zzso 98 zzso zzso the zzso deletion zzso 3' zzso zzso out both zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso out both zzso and zzso zzso zzso a 3' zzso zzso with deletion of the zzso tract zzso out only zzso binding but not zzso zzso and zzso an zzso containing the variable region of the 3' zzso with a deletion of both zzso tract and 98 zzso failed to compete for binding of either zzso or zzso zzso of these cellular proteins with the zzso 3' zzso is probably involved in regulation of translation and/or replication of the zzso zzso zzso
