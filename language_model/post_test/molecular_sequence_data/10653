A strain isolated from a biopsy sample taken from a slowly spreading skin zzso on a child's hand was found to have properties consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso An almost complete gene sequence of the zzso zzso of the strain was determined following the cloning and sequencing of the amplified zzso The sequence was aligned with those available for zzso and zzso trees were zzso with four zzso zzso The zzso which formed a distinct zzso line within the evolutionary radiation occupied by rapidly growing zzso was readily distinguished from members of zzso described species of rapidly growing zzso on the basis of its zzso acid pattern and a number of other zzso features, notably its ability to form yellow pigmented colonies when incubated in the zzso The name proposed for this new species is zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso
