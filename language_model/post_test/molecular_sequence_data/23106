Category A zzso as defined by the National Institute of zzso and zzso Diseases zzso are human pathogens that could be zzso by zzso Many of these deadly viruses require zzso zzso zzso zzso for all laboratory work, which limits traditional laboratory zzso screening zzso for identification of small zzso zzso For those reasons, a related zzso New World zzso zzso virus, zzso identical to zzso virus at the zzso acid level, was used in a zzso campaign where approximately 400,000 small zzso compounds were screened in a zzso zzso zzso effect zzso zzso zzso identified in this screen showed zzso activity and specificity against not only zzso virus, but also the Category A New World zzso zzso zzso and zzso Drug resistant zzso were isolated, suggesting that these compounds act through zzso of a viral zzso the viral zzso zzso and not through cellular toxicity zzso A lead compound, zzso has been chosen for drug zzso This potent and selective compound, with good zzso demonstrated protective zzso efficacy in a zzso mouse challenge zzso This series of compounds represent a new class of zzso that may warrant further development for potential inclusion in a strategic zzso
