To isolate genes expressed zzso from the bone zzso cells of patients with familial acute zzso leukemia and to explain the molecular mechanisms of the disease at the gene zzso 

Bone zzso cells were obtained from a family with cases of familial acute zzso leukemia for successive 4 zzso Super SMART zzso synthesis and suppression zzso zzso zzso were performed to set up a zzso zzso library of specially or highly expressed zzso The white clones were screened and identified by modified differential screening technique in which the zzso were labeled with zzso zzso Positive clones were zzso and compared with the known sequences in the public databases of zzso using zzso zzso for zzso zzso The unknown fragments were then submitted to zzso 

A zzso library of zzso expressed genes for the family with cases of familial acute zzso leukemia was constructed zzso After differential zzso 28 effective sequences were confirmed to be positive zzso expressed gene fragments and were submitted to zzso for zzso zzso Then 17 sequences were identified as a part of known zzso and the rests were verified as unknown zzso 

zzso is an effective approach to isolate zzso expressed zzso Some genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation has been acquired by zzso Eleven novel expressed sequence tags related to library have been successfully isolated and accepted by zzso
