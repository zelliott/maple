zzso zzso shuttle zzso derived from zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso were frequently found to undergo structural zzso due to zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso element, at a cluster of sites located within a small region of 60 zzso immediately upstream of a zzso resistance gene present in these zzso The structural zzso led to deletion of large regions of the zzso which, in several cases, were found to extend into the zzso zzso coding sequences of the zzso replication region without affecting its replication zzso This suggests that the entire zzso coding sequences of the zzso replication region may not be essential for replication of zzso zzso The deletion zzso which contain the minimal sequences required for replication and selection in zzso were found to be structurally stable and therefore these could be potentially used as stable zzso systems for the transformation of zzso
