A general method to directly obtain the DNA sequence of the variable regions of any zzso chain using a mixture of zzso zzso and the zzso chain reaction zzso is zzso Mixed zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso signal zzso and a zzso 3' constant region primer were used for zzso amplification of each of the heavy and light chain variable regions of a human zzso producing a zzso zzso recognizing an zzso of zzso of the human zzso virus zzso The amplified DNA segments were cloned and the sequence was determined for the heavy chain variable zzso This method will greatly facilitate structural and functional studies of zzso by reducing the effort to clone and sequence the members of the zzso as well as other zzso zzso
