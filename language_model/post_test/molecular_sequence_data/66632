In order to know the role of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso of zzso we attempted to inhibit the translation of zzso zzso in zzso by injecting zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso into single germ zzso cells of zzso zzso Among three types of zzso complementary to different parts of the zzso region of zzso zzso tested, only one zzso designated as zzso inhibited the translation of the zzso in zzso zzso resulting in the absence of labeled zzso in experimental zzso On the other hand, two other zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit the translation, so that a similar number of labeled zzso found in zzso but zzso control zzso were observed in experimental zzso derived from zzso zzso Surprisingly, use of zzso zzso resulted in the disappearance of the protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 1, zzso from zzso zzso by zzso the translation of zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso zzso on the translation of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso formation could be canceled by the zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein in zzso may play an important role in the formation of zzso by regulating the production of zzso zzso
