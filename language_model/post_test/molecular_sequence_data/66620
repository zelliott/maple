During the last few years, a growing number of zzso zzso peptides has been isolated from plants and particularly from zzso It has become increasingly clear that these peptides play an important role in the protection of plants against microbial zzso In this work, proteins from chili pepper zzso zzso zzso seeds were extracted in zzso zzso pH zzso and peptides zzso were performed by employing zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and reverse phase in zzso Three zzso enriched zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso were obtained after the zzso zzso The F1 zzso mainly composed of three peptides ranging from 6 to 10 zzso was submitted to zzso zzso acid zzso The closer to 10 zzso zzso showed high sequence zzso to zzso transfer proteins zzso previously isolated from others zzso F1 fraction exhibited strong zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also promoted several zzso changes to zzso zzso including the formation of zzso as revealed by scanning electron zzso F1 fraction also reduced the zzso zzso zzso of the medium zzso by zzso of zzso zzso cells in a zzso manner and caused the zzso of zzso plasma membrane to the dye zzso Green, as verified by zzso laser zzso
