Chemical zzso and other characteristics of zzso and zzso were evaluated within a zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso generated structures compared well to those determined by X-ray zzso zzso zzso suggested that the secondary zzso functions zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso were more zzso than the primary alcohol zzso which is consistent with experimental zzso In addition, the enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso which is observed upon zzso zzso of the object zzso was rationalized in terms of increased zzso zzso The chemical behavior of the zzso examined may be zzso in explaining the zzso of zzso zzso
