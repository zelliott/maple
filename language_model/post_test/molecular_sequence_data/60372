Nearly all zzso male mice with zzso zzso between zzso female and zzso male die within a few days after zzso however, this is not observed in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso males usually exhibit growth zzso prior to zzso To identify the putative genetic locus or zzso in zzso zzso that cause the abnormalities in the presence of the zzso a linkage analysis was carried out in zzso progeny of a cross of zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso of growth zzso was examined from the day of birth, and both zzso and normally weaned zzso males were zzso for zzso marker zzso spanning zzso and the X zzso zzso zzso evidence for linkage was identified on the zzso edge of the X zzso near the zzso marker of zzso Furthermore, among mice from zzso female zzso zzso zzso male produced between zzso and zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso only the progeny from female zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso male did not show any zzso and/or growth zzso Thus, the zzso in zzso zzso males accompanied by growth zzso is caused by the interactions between the zzso zzso X zzso and Y zzso Based on the zzso repeat sequence length zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was different from zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that there are at least two functional types of Y zzso in zzso zzso zzso
