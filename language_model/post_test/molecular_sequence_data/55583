Identification of zzso in the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind snake zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso provides structural information about the neurotransmitter binding region of the zzso Using synthetic peptides of the human zzso zzso region zzso we previously localized a zzso specific binding site for zzso in segment zzso To define in more detail the zzso that influence the binding of zzso to this region, we prepared 16 zzso zzso of the zzso segment zzso with the zzso acid zzso zzso replacing each native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not reveal changes in the secondary structure of the peptides except for the analogue in which zzso was zzso with zzso This implies that any change in zzso binding could be attributed to replacement of the native zzso side chain by zzso zzso group, rather than to a change in the structure of the zzso The influence of each substitution with zzso was determined by comparing the analogue to the parental sequence alpha zzso in zzso competition with native human zzso for binding of zzso zzso The binding of zzso by analogue peptides with zzso zzso for zzso zzso or zzso was greatly zzso zzso of zzso to peptides containing zzso replacements at zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was also reduced significantly zzso zzso zzso An unanticipated finding was that substitution of zzso for zzso significantly increased zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
