The complete sequences of the zzso and zzso elements of zzso coli K-12 have been zzso These sequence data reveal a new repeated zzso called zzso zzso zzso which is distinct from the zzso core repetition that is found in all five zzso zzso zzso is found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso supports the view that the zzso elements are composite structures assembled from components with very different evolutionary histories and that their incorporation into the zzso coli zzso is relatively zzso In each case, zzso is found downstream from the zzso core and is separated from the core by a segment of DNA that is unique to the individual zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso are very similar, zzso by only zzso They are zzso zzso in zzso and each contains an zzso open reading frame zzso zzso has three tandem copies of zzso all of which appear defective in that they are large deletions and/or have the reading frame zzso Features of zzso are analogous to features typical of zzso zzso however, no associated zzso activity has been zzso A zzso zzso of zzso is found near zzso 5 of the zzso coli K-12 map and is not associated with any zzso core zzso The complete core sequences of zzso and zzso have been compared with that of zzso As anticipated, the three core sequences are closely zzso all having identical lengths of zzso zzso zzso Like zzso the zzso and zzso zzso constitute single zzso that begin with the first core zzso In each case, the core zzso extends beyond the core into the unique zzso Of the three cores, zzso and zzso are the most similar, showing only zzso sequence zzso while zzso and zzso are the least similar, zzso by zzso All three zzso conserve the 28 repetitions of a zzso motif noted originally for zzso A secondary structure is proposed for this zzso and the possibility of its having an zzso binding function is zzso zzso contains one additional unique ORF, and zzso contains two additional unique zzso One of these zzso includes a signal zzso that is functional when fused to zzso
