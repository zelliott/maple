We previously reported that the zzso defined zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed on various zzso zzso zzso with tumors in patients with zzso diseases using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study we investigated differences at the molecular level between zzso on zzso and zzso zzso on zzso a zzso derived from an zzso line zzso that expresses a high amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso or zzso but not to any of the other five different zzso alpha zzso or four zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso membrane protein zzso zzso from zzso cells, whereas it zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins from a zzso cell line zzso under both zzso and reducing zzso The molecular difference was confirmed further by zzso treatment of the zzso The zzso point of zzso zzso was zzso whereas those of zzso alpha and zzso beta were zzso and zzso respectively, by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso of zzso alpha gene on zzso cells was not detected at the zzso level by six different sets of zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso on an zzso cell line was a distinct zzso from zzso on zzso
