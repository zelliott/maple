zzso zzso regulates the production of zzso zzso factors using the zzso zzso zzso This regulatory system responds to a zzso zzso zzso signal called an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso requires zzso the zzso precursor of zzso and the integral membrane zzso zzso In this study, we performed a molecular analysis of zzso to identify zzso regions important for processing and zzso zzso As a zzso to this study, we discovered that zzso type I could be generated in zzso coli through the zzso expression of the zzso zzso allowing the use of zzso coli as an expression host for investigating the zzso zzso One of the most zzso regions of zzso is the charged zzso tail, and through zzso analysis, the first nine zzso were found to be essential for zzso production and zzso zzso zzso Within this essential region, zzso of zzso zzso 34 or zzso 41 inhibited zzso production and zzso zzso Following zzso zzso is hypothesized to form an zzso intermediate with the zzso zzso region, but clear evidence of this intermediate has never been zzso By zzso the zzso zzso 28 zzso an zzso structure was stabilized and detected in zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso of the structure could not be detected using the zzso zzso zzso indicating the zzso zzso is essential for its zzso These studies provide new insights on the requirements and mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso
