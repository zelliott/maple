We report here the sequencing and analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso is a member of the enteric bacteria, it serves as a model for studies of zzso zzso associations due to its efficient colonization of plant zzso (including zzso and zzso two of the most important crops in the zzso while maintaining a zzso relationship that encompasses zzso organic nitrogen to the host zzso zzso analysis examined zzso zzso zzso for the presence of previously identified genes from other bacteria involved in colonization of, or growth in, zzso From this set, approximately one-third were identified in zzso zzso zzso suggesting additional factors most likely contribute to its zzso zzso Comparative zzso analyses were used to provide new insights into this zzso zzso included the identification of zzso pathways and other features devoted to processing zzso cellulosic and aromatic compounds, and a robust complement of transport genes zzso one of the highest percentages in bacterial zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso resistance genes were predicted, experiments conducted using mouse models showed zzso to be attenuated in this zzso Comparative zzso analyses with the presumed human pathogen zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso apparently cannot fix zzso and the distribution of genes essential to surface attachment, zzso zzso and regulation and signaling varied between each zzso which may indicate critical zzso between the strains that influence their preferred host ranges and lifestyles zzso plant associations for zzso zzso zzso and presumably human zzso for zzso Little zzso information is available concerning zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso will drive new research into this zzso but important category of zzso host zzso which could ultimately enhance growth and nutrition of important agricultural crops and development of zzso products and zzso
