T cell zzso zzso chains are composed of two zzso zzso the zzso variable domain and the zzso constant zzso Data presented here show that the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso exhibits considerable zzso zzso that appear to be positively zzso Each of 32 zzso zzso clones showed different patterns of zzso zzso in the constant zzso zzso of the 121 zzso constant region zzso acid zzso show zzso clustered mainly in the zzso between the beta zzso zzso regions of the zzso genes differ by up to zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso Southern zzso zzso zzso and zzso cloning data suggest zzso zzso at two zzso zzso distinguished by a single zzso zzso zzso ratios suggest that balancing selection is acting to maintain zzso at the variable sites of one of these zzso but not the other, in a manner comparable to the zzso binding regions of zzso Nonetheless, each zzso gene is spliced to variable and joining segments similar to those described in other zzso These data suggest that our understanding of the function of the zzso constant zzso of these zzso is zzso
