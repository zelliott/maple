As a component of the innate immune system, natural killer zzso cells may play a significant role in the early events after zzso zzso zzso zzso cells have been shown to zzso zzso in transplant zzso To better understand zzso cells and the role of zzso cell receptors in zzso we have cloned and begun characterizing a novel rat zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was cloned by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso chain reaction zzso and reverse zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso a rejecting liver zzso Southern zzso analysis was used to determine the zzso gene copy zzso zzso and Northern zzso were used to examine zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, multiple zzso and liver zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso treatments determined the extent of zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso to human and zzso zzso It is a single copy gene with five identified zzso zzso zzso is expressed by zzso cells and is zzso as a single transcript by Northern zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso is a zzso zzso cell surface zzso with a protein backbone of approximately 21 zzso zzso transcript expression of zzso is detected in both rejected and spontaneously accepted liver zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a zzso surface zzso cell zzso with limited zzso This putative zzso zzso is expressed in liver zzso and may participate in the innate immune response after zzso
