The reaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex was studied by using zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was treated with zzso acid to modify zzso zzso groups to zzso charged zzso and separated into eight different zzso by zzso zzso on a zzso zzso 53 zzso zzso zzso mapping studies indicated that six of these zzso were modified at single zzso zzso zzso Each of the derivatives had the same zzso value as native zzso zzso in the zzso reaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso values of the zzso zzso derivatives modified at zzso 10, 55, 95, 97, 99, and 106 were found to be larger than that of native zzso zzso by factors of 6, 2, 3, 32, 13, and 8, zzso These results indicate that zzso located in the sequence zzso on the left side of the zzso zzso have the greatest involvement in binding the zzso zzso zzso The involvement of zzso 97 is especially significant because it is located in an extra loop zzso zzso zzso that is not present in zzso zzso zzso
