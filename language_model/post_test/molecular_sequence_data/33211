We zzso the small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of two zzso isolated from the Brazilian snakes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured and their zzso and zzso features were characterized by light zzso and scanning and transmission electron zzso zzso trees zzso using independent or combined zzso zzso and zzso data sets always clustered the snake zzso together in a zzso closest to zzso zzso forming a strongly supported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The positioning in the zzso trees and the zzso based on the variable zzso region of the zzso zzso which showed high sequence zzso allowed us to zzso the zzso from distinct snake species as separate zzso The isolate from zzso zzso is described as a new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the isolate from zzso zzso zzso is zzso here as zzso zzso
