To clone and analyze a member of the zzso acid zzso gene family, zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso database of zzso zzso was used to clone the new zzso gene by zzso probe of zzso zzso was applied to analyze the sequence characteristics of zzso protein and construct zzso zzso zzso zzso has been applied to detect the zzso level of zzso in seven zzso as well as in leaves under three zzso The results showed that, the zzso sequence of zzso contains 903 zzso was zzso The open reading frame zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso 226 zzso zzso which has typical structural zzso and characteristic sequence of zzso family zzso zzso showed the highest expression level in unfolded zzso followed by the zzso And the expression of zzso was quickly decreased with leaf growing zzso The zzso level increased under continuous cropping conditions while it reduced both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso an zzso gene from zzso zzso has been obtained for the first time, which can lay the foundation for further studies about its molecular function in development and responses to zzso
