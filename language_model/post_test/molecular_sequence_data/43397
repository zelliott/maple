Here we report zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso nuclear zzso protein which is localized to zzso and zzso spaces in the nuclear interior and which is zzso to the zzso nuclear pore complex protein zzso In the nuclear interior, zzso is excluded from zzso and the zzso and generally zzso to regions between these structures and the nuclear zzso This distribution matches the zzso channel zzso described zzso In the nuclear zzso zzso zzso on or near nuclear pore zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusively with the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence predicts a large protein zzso zzso with two distinct structural zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to form an extended region of zzso while the zzso zzso (82 zzso is predicted to be zzso and zzso zzso shows moderate sequence identity over its entire length to the zzso nuclear pore complex protein zzso zzso zzso acid identity and 50% zzso Furthermore, several of the sequence motifs and zzso similarities between zzso and zzso are sufficiently striking that it is likely that zzso and zzso are functionally zzso The zzso gene exists in a single copy in region zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to both the nuclear interior and nuclear pore complexes and its sequence similarity to a known nuclear pore complex protein leads to speculations about a role for zzso in zzso transport which we can test using molecular genetic zzso
