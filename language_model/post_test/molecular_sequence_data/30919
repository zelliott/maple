The gene zzso the spike zzso of the human coronavirus zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso This analysis predicts an S zzso of zzso zzso acids with an Mr of zzso The zzso has 30 potential zzso zzso A number of structural features typical of coronavirus S proteins can be zzso including a signal zzso a membrane anchor, zzso repeat structures and a zzso zzso zzso A detailed, zzso comparison with the S proteins of infectious zzso virus, zzso infectious zzso virus, zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso virus, strain zzso is zzso We have also done a Northern zzso analysis of viral zzso in zzso zzso cells using synthetic zzso On the basis of this analysis, and by zzso to the replication strategy of other zzso we are able to propose a model for the organization and expression of the zzso zzso zzso
