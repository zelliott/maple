Using zzso zzso directed against the human zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso protein expression were found in 12 out of 18 zzso zzso zzso In contrast, we failed to observe elevated zzso zzso indicating the absence of zzso zzso in seven zzso zzso a potentially zzso condition that can progress to form zzso zzso For two zzso zzso we demonstrated that high levels of zzso protein were accompanied by zzso 7 zzso The zzso were found at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that acquisition of abnormalities of the zzso gene may be an important step in the development of zzso zzso
