We determined the zzso zzso zzso sequence from three zzso breeds, zzso zzso hybrid, and zzso zzso Five single zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were identified, respectively, at positions zzso zzso 376 zzso zzso zzso and 465 zzso of the coding sequence in zzso hybrid, and at position 251 zzso in zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso zzso resulted in zzso and zzso replacements in the mature zzso zzso zzso of zzso breed zzso and zzso hybrid zzso which, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso were introduced into a zzso expression zzso zzso to express zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso The identity of both protein zzso was further confirmed by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso We then compared zzso of these two zzso zzso Although both zzso protein zzso exhibited comparable activities in zzso of zzso cells and in zzso oxide zzso induction of zzso peripheral zzso zzso activity of zzso protein was significantly higher zzso than that of zzso protein in a plaque zzso zzso using zzso virus zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso protein in zzso zzso were determined as zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified five novel zzso in zzso zzso including two zzso zzso that result in zzso and zzso zzso Our results further demonstrate that zzso can markedly reduce zzso activity of the zzso zzso This is the first report that shows the functional zzso in the coding region of zzso In the future, it is imperative to determine whether zzso replacement in zzso may have disease zzso
