zzso specific zzso are associated with unique clinical zzso and are useful zzso in zzso zzso A 120 zzso protein recognized by certain patients with zzso was identified and clinical features of patients with this specificity were zzso 

The 120 zzso protein recognized by a zzso serum was zzso and identified by mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso to this 120 zzso protein was screened in zzso from zzso patients with various diagnoses from four countries, including 254 zzso by zzso of zzso labeled zzso cell zzso Clinical information of patients with this specificity was zzso 

The 120 zzso zzso which exactly zzso with zzso was identified as zzso zzso factor zzso zzso by mass zzso and validated by zzso By zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso nuclear zzso zzso Four cases of zzso were zzso all are women, one each in a Japanese, African American, zzso and Mexican zzso Three had a diagnosis of zzso and one case was classified as having an zzso zzso tissue disease with an elevated zzso but without significant muscle zzso This individual also had a history of colon cancer, cervical zzso zzso and zzso tumors of the zzso zzso was mild in all cases and resolved without treatment in one zzso The zzso specificity was not found in other zzso 

zzso is a new zzso zzso associated with a mild form of zzso Whether it has an association with zzso as in the case of zzso or other unique features will need to be evaluated in future zzso
