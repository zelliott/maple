zzso leaf spot, caused by the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso is the most economically damaging zzso disease of zzso zzso Although most zzso zzso populations display characteristics reminiscent of sexual zzso no zzso has been zzso To assess whether populations in northern United States have characteristics consistent with sexual zzso zzso zzso collected over a zzso period were analyzed for frequency and distribution of mating type zzso After clone zzso an approximately equal distribution of mating types was found for each sampling zzso zzso type frequency was also assessed in individual zzso zzso always consisted of zzso with a single mating type and zzso zzso but both mating types and up to five zzso zzso could be found on an individual zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso from 28 zzso and 28 zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso were identified that zzso a single zzso acid zzso For zzso five zzso zzso were identified that zzso four protein zzso zzso and zzso gene expression analyses were conducted on plants zzso with either or both mating zzso zzso expression remained low, but zzso spiked during late stages of zzso A segment of the zzso coding sequence was also found in zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso has the potential for sexual zzso
