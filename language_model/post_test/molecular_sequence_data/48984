zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with specific DNA structural motifs such as those encountered at zzso damage, zzso zzso and zzso The interaction of full-length zzso containing two tandem zzso box zzso and a zzso zzso tail, with zzso DNA was investigated by zzso radical zzso and zzso gel mobility shift zzso The full-length zzso protein binds to DNA containing a zzso zzso zzso mainly through domain A, as revealed by zzso with a zzso constant zzso of 120 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in both zzso zzso A and B in full-length zzso further supports the conclusion that only one zzso box domain is bound to the site of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tail with the rest of the zzso protein was examined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso tail mainly interacts with domain B and zzso regions rather than domain A in zzso These results illuminate the respective roles of the tandem zzso boxes and the zzso zzso tail of zzso in binding to DNA and to the major DNA zzso formed by the zzso drug zzso
