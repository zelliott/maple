Of the approximately 1,000 zzso zzso zzso genes in the mouse zzso an zzso sensory zzso zzso is thought to express one zzso from one zzso This is reminiscent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which undergo DNA zzso in zzso Here, we test the hypothesis that OR gene choice is controlled by DNA zzso in zzso Using permanent genetic zzso we show that the choice by an zzso to express an zzso of the OR gene zzso is zzso Using zzso zzso as donors for nuclear transfer, we generate zzso embryonic stem zzso cell lines and zzso zzso DNA analysis of these cell lines, whose zzso is zzso derived from an zzso zzso does not reveal DNA zzso or sequence zzso at the zzso zzso zzso that differentiate from zzso cells after injection into zzso are not restricted to expression of zzso but can express other OR zzso Thus, zzso gene choice is irreversible but is reset upon nuclear transfer, and is not accompanied by zzso zzso
