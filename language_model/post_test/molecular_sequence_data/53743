zzso zzso of group A zzso zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso due to the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso sequences were obtained from a diverse set of zzso reference strains and clinical zzso and correlated with M zzso and zzso testing zzso Attempts to amplify zzso from strains with M zzso or zzso types historically associated with the zzso zzso were negative, except for zzso zzso which were found to contain a highly zzso zzso zzso There was a strong correlation of certain M zzso with specific zzso sequences regardless of strain background, and likewise a strong association of specific zzso zzso types to zzso gene sequence zzso In several examples, M type identity, or partial identity shared between strains with differing zzso types, was correlated with short, highly zzso zzso zzso sequences likely to zzso zzso zzso Additionally, each of three pairs of historically distinct M type reference strains found to share the same zzso zzso zzso were also found to share M zzso zzso Based upon zzso sequence comparisons between strains of the same and of differing zzso types, an approximately 450 zzso domain was determined likely to contain key zzso required for zzso type zzso Analysis of two zzso sequences that were not highly zzso yet shared a common zzso type, further implicated a 107 zzso portion of this zzso domain in zzso containing zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso data suggest that zzso zzso for all zzso proteins may reside within a region corresponding to this zzso zzso The presence of specific, zzso zzso pairs within multiple zzso appears likely to be a reliable indicator of their overall genetic zzso and to be very useful for accurate zzso of zzso zzso by an approach that has relevance to decades of past zzso zzso zzso
