Tomato yellow leaf zzso zzso and tomato leaf zzso zzso diseases are serious constraints to tomato production in zzso and other countries in West zzso In 2003 and 2004, samples of tomato showing zzso symptoms were collected during a survey of tomato virus diseases in zzso Three zzso symptom zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso upright growth and zzso leaves with zzso zzso and vein zzso zzso yellow leaf zzso and zzso broccoli or zzso zzso zzso and distorted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a general zzso probe and/or zzso analyses revealed zzso infection in plants with each of these symptom zzso and no evidence of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso fragments revealed two putative new zzso species associated with the zzso and yellow leaf zzso symptom zzso zzso zzso clones of these zzso were obtained using zzso and overlapping zzso When introduced into zzso zzso and tomato plants, these clones induced upward leaf zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso or downward leaf zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso Thus, these zzso were named tomato leaf zzso zzso virus zzso and tomato yellow leaf zzso virus zzso The zzso organization of both viruses was similar to those of other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were most closely related to each other and to tobacco leaf zzso Zimbabwe virus zzso and tomato zzso stunt virus from South Africa zzso Thus, these likely represent zzso zzso that evolved from indigenous zzso on the African zzso Mixed infections of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and tomato plants resulted in more severe symptoms than in plants infected with either virus alone, suggesting a synergistic zzso zzso experiments indicated that both viruses induced symptomatic infections in tomato and zzso whereas neither virus induced disease symptoms in pepper, common zzso small sugar pumpkin, African eggplant, or zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed for detection of zzso and zzso and will be used to further investigate the distribution and host range of these zzso
