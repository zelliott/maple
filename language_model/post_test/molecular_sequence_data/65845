We have determined the complete zzso and zzso acid sequences of the Polish zzso mosaic virus zzso isolate marked as zzso The zzso zzso consists of a single zzso zzso strand of zzso that contains five open reading frames zzso zzso encodes the putative viral zzso zzso zzso 2-4 the triple gene block zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Two short untranslated regions flank the coding ones and there is a zzso zzso tail at the 3' end of the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso organization of zzso is that of a typical member of the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on full-length zzso of zzso sequences showed that zzso was most closely related to the zzso isolate from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso showed the following zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and 98, 99, and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This high level of zzso sequence identity between the Chilean and Polish zzso zzso suggest their common zzso
