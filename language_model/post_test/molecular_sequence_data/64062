zzso chain reaction zzso that can amplify a zzso of the zzso gene of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso virus and zzso was made use of to study the genetic zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The obtained zzso were analyzed by the method of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Four zzso strains had an identical restriction zzso zzso G zzso also displayed the expected restriction profiles, however, contradictory results were obtained for strain zzso zzso the restriction profiles with zzso zzso and zzso corresponded to zzso and the restriction profile with zzso corresponded to zzso The sequencing of appropriate fragments of strains G and zzso revealed a zzso zzso localized in zzso restriction zzso The thus worked out zzso was used jointly with zzso in the zzso of 75 zzso samples obtained from women with zzso zzso who were treated at Moscow zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in 18 zzso and 57 zzso of samples, zzso No changes were registered in the restriction profile for zzso among the investigated samples and all of them had the restriction profile similar to that of strain zzso The conclusion is that zzso zzso associated with zzso is genetically stable within its Moscow zzso
