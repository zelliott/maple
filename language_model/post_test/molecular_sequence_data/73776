zzso of the zzso locus by zzso has previously shown zzso association of zzso and zzso with a new zzso zzso zzso sequencing studies zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso zzso corresponded to the new zzso zzso In this study we have characterized the whole coding region of zzso from a zzso individual of zzso zzso Our results partially confirm the previously reported sequence and reveal that zzso has many new zzso at several zzso including a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is thus a most unusual zzso zzso defining a third zzso lineage of this zzso
