Four classes of floral zzso zzso domain proteins specify the identities of the four organ types in an zzso zzso While the activities of the zzso domain proteins are essentially confined to the flower or to the zzso several zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso also act outside the flower in addition to their organ identity functions inside the zzso We identified a new zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso from a zzso genetic screen in the zzso zzso background that is compromised in floral zzso C zzso We showed that zzso like the C function gene zzso acts to specify zzso organ identities and to repress A zzso zzso also shares zzso zzso function in controlling floral zzso zzso may achieve these functions by regulating the expression of zzso zzso single zzso exhibit zzso zzso such as reduced organ size, altered zzso leaf shape and increased number of zzso during most stages of zzso zzso zzso like the A function gene zzso plays multiple roles in plant development as well as acting in organ identity zzso in the zzso zzso codes for a novel protein and is expressed throughout the zzso
