The class A zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are located predominantly in the brain and are linked to a range of different zzso functions, including the control of zzso energy zzso zzso of zzso function, and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and domain exchange zzso studies have provided important insight into key features of the zzso and zzso binding zzso However, the precise zzso of zzso binding and selectivity are still not fully zzso In this work, we used zzso modeling of zzso receptors to direct further zzso zzso These zzso studies were followed by molecular dynamics zzso simulations to zzso the full scope of the zzso data and to explain the role of each zzso zzso in the binding and selectivity of a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso selective zzso and zzso Our primary interest was focused on zzso zzso 3 zzso which is identified as being of great importance for the selectivity of zzso zzso These studies revealed zzso differences between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulting from differences in zzso acid sequences of the zzso receptors that affect key zzso interactions formed between zzso and neighboring TM zzso The MD simulation protocol used here, which was followed by flexible zzso studies, went beyond the use of zzso models and allowed for a more detailed exploration of the zzso zzso In this work, we have demonstrated how even small differences in the zzso acid sequences of zzso can lead to significant differences in structure, zzso binding zzso and selectivity of these zzso The MD simulations allowed refinement of the zzso zzso models to a degree that was not possible with zzso zzso modeling alone and provided a deeper rationalization of the zzso data zzso To validate these findings and to demonstrate that they can be zzso applied to the design of novel, very selective zzso antagonists, we show here two examples of zzso designed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
