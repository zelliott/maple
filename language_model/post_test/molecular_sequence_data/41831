We have constructed a zzso zzso zzso resolution genetic linkage map for zzso zzso that contains 55 zzso satellites and 3 zzso that have placed on the map with odds for order of at least zzso zzso from 67 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to construct the zzso Nine genes are included in the zzso map and 37 markers have zzso of at least zzso The zzso map length is 128 zzso and the largest genetic zzso is 11 zzso zzso zzso on the female zzso The female and male map lengths are 150 zzso and 106 zzso zzso The map was constructed with zzso and is based on the zzso reference zzso and includes over 12,000 new zzso A zzso of 12 markers spanning the length of the linkage map were zzso in a zzso cell hybrid panel with zzso that divided zzso into five zzso zzso placement agreed with the linkage positions for each of the zzso tested with the exception of one zzso which failed to give consistent zzso Ten spontaneous new zzso were identified from a subset of 42 zzso zzso (out of a total of zzso zzso giving an apparent observed spontaneous zzso rate of 5 zzso zzso per zzso An integrated map of zzso zzso was also constructed with the zzso markers described here and previously zzso zzso zzso The sex average map spans zzso zzso with an average distance between unique map locations of zzso zzso and a maximum zzso distance of zzso zzso These genetic linkage maps can be considered baseline maps for zzso which will be useful for physical mapping and the zzso of disease genes and other genes of zzso
