This study exploited the unusual zzso cycle of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso milk composition during acute zzso a time when the zzso zzso is subjected to increased risk of zzso In zzso zzso milk contains elevated levels of complex zzso and low protein and zzso zzso Later in zzso protein and zzso zzso increase significantly, whereas zzso content is reduced dramatically and changes to zzso Following initiation of zzso at zzso the zzso concentration greatly zzso while zzso and protein zzso were zzso suggesting that complex zzso are the major zzso in milk at this zzso In contrast, zzso at late zzso when zzso concentration was very low, led to an increase in the zzso zzso but the concentration of protein was not significantly zzso This indicates that protein synthesis during acute zzso at late zzso in the zzso may be zzso much more rapidly than during zzso Analysis of milk at day 3 after the onset of zzso at zzso identified a number of potential zzso zzso at high zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fragments of zzso These proteins may protect the zzso zzso by zzso the risk of potential infection during zzso
