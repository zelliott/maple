To better understand zzso and zzso organization and evolutionary patterns of the zzso zzso gene in zzso fish, the gene was zzso mapped and comparatively analyzed in 19 species belonging to several zzso of the zzso Moreover, the distribution and organization of zzso zzso gene was analyzed in the zzso zzso zzso The results indicated high conservation of one zzso cluster of zzso zzso in the zzso Asian, and South American species, with few variations in the zzso position of the clusters in the South American zzso The zzso analysis of zzso revealed a distinct scenario from that observed under the zzso zzso An enrichment of the zzso gene on linkage group zzso 14 was observed that did not zzso to the same zzso that harbors the zzso cluster identified by zzso zzso Moreover, it was revealed that the presence of several distinct zzso elements in the zzso gene zzso regions could be involved in the spreading of this zzso but the generation of new, large zzso clusters zzso by fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso is apparently zzso These results contribute to the understanding of zzso families' evolution and reinforce the utility of zzso analysis and the use of zzso and zzso methods to address the zzso and zzso evolutionary patterns of repeated zzso among zzso Moreover, the zzso gene represents a useful new zzso marker for zzso zzso
