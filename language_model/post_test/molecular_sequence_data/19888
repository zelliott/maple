zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso are known as bacterial regulators for a zzso resistant to multiple zzso zzso zzso data have indicated the presence of zzso zzso regulators, including zzso family proteins in zzso though the zzso zzso system is close to that of zzso To zzso the structural basis of the zzso regulation mechanism of zzso zzso family zzso the crystal structure of the zzso zzso which was identified as an zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain 7 was determined at zzso zzso The protein was composed of two zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain consisted of a winged zzso zzso as in the case of bacterial zzso family zzso Despite the relatively low overall structural similarity between zzso and bacterial zzso family zzso the structure of the zzso domain displayed high structural zzso A comparison with the crystal structures of bacterial zzso family proteins revealed that structural variation was mainly due to the different orientation of the two zzso at the zzso and zzso Our results indicated that the distance between the two zzso zzso of zzso family proteins would be changed by the rotation of the two terminal zzso to interact with the target zzso
