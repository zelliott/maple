zzso zzso zzso zzso 61 contains a zzso zzso cluster that is sufficient to elicit the hypersensitive response zzso in zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso in zzso groups VIII, IX, and zzso in the zzso cluster abolished the ability of the zzso to cause the zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso zzso covering groups VIII and IX now reveals five open reading frames zzso in the same transcript, designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and predicted to zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso and arranged zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These proteins also show similarity to zzso proteins of zzso and enteric zzso The zzso and Spa proteins are involved in the zzso of zzso factors, like the zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in zzso zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing mainly group zzso revealed five zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso predicted to zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The first three genes belong to an zzso containing zzso which encodes an zzso protein that elicits the zzso zzso and zzso are two potential zzso upstream of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso proteins are most similar to zzso proteins among those zzso zzso insertions in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished the ability of zzso zzso zzso 61 to zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso analysis of zzso and culture zzso zzso Thus, many of the proteins required for zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in plant and animal pathogens may have a common zzso
