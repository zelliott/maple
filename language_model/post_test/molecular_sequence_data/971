The growth properties and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso which represent the two distinct zzso genetic lineages and exhibit 5 and zzso zzso acid divergence in the fusion zzso and attachment zzso zzso respectively, were investigated in zzso and in zzso and nonhuman zzso Both strains zzso to high zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the upper respiratory tract of zzso and to moderate zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the lower respiratory zzso The two lineages exhibited zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and infection with each strain provided a high level of resistance to zzso with the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso human zzso virus type 1 expressing the fusion F protein of the zzso strain developed a serum zzso response that efficiently neutralized virus from both lineages and were protected from challenge with either zzso zzso This result indicates that the zzso F protein is a major zzso zzso that mediates extensive zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso strains zzso to low zzso in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of zzso zzso but induced high levels of zzso zzso in serum effective against both zzso The level of zzso replication in chimpanzees was moderately higher, and infected animals developed mild zzso zzso zzso the most efficiently in the respiratory tracts of African green zzso and the infected animals developed a high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso effective against both zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso from all three zzso species were used indicated that zzso and zzso are 64 to zzso related zzso zzso chimpanzees and African green monkeys were highly protected from challenge with the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results from zzso and nonhuman primates support the conclusion that the two zzso genetic lineages are highly related zzso and are not distinct zzso zzso or zzso as defined by zzso zzso in zzso
