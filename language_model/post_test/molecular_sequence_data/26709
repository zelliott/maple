Two new species of zzso are zzso Both were collected from flat leaf zzso from South Australia, one on zzso zzso and the other on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davies is zzso by the combination of a zzso zzso female with a short, broadly rounded zzso tail, an zzso to open zzso zzso female with an zzso tail tip, and zzso to zzso males with angular zzso and short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davies is similar in having an zzso to zzso zzso female with a small zzso tail, an almost straight to zzso zzso female with an zzso tail tip, and males that are almost straight to barely zzso with angular zzso and short zzso zzso They differ in that the bodies of zzso and zzso females of zzso zzso zzso zzso are more curved than in zzso zzso zzso zzso Other known similar forms of zzso zzso are outlined and the zzso shield zzso of their associated zzso zzso fly species are discussed where zzso An inventory of all known zzso associations from flat leaf zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso from analysis of sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a portion of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso from flat leaf zzso appeared in two zzso
