Northern zzso analyses of zzso from an Iranian strain of Peanut stunt virus zzso zzso using cloned zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from two zzso zzso zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso is derived from a zzso II zzso No zzso signals, however, were detected with zzso zzso 1 and 2 suggesting they are distinct from both zzso I and zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of cloned zzso fragments zzso zzso in zzso representing zzso zzso 1 and 2 showed that zzso is more closely related to zzso II strains than to any other zzso zzso The percent zzso identity between zzso sequences from zzso and zzso or between zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding values for zzso were zzso and zzso zzso comparison analyses of deduced zzso acid sequence of cloned partial sequences of zzso zzso 1 and 2 indicated that zzso zzso and zzso proteins are most closely related to those of zzso II strains zzso zzso zzso supported the replication and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not cucumber mosaic virus zzso zzso may be perceived as an Old World zzso of zzso II zzso or it may represent a natural zzso between a zzso II zzso and an as yet zzso zzso of zzso strains zzso 1 and zzso
