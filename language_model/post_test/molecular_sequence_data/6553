All zzso zzso for zzso zzso I zzso I) that have been studied so far, ranging from zzso to humans, require a specific DNA binding protein to cause zzso In zzso this zzso protein has been identified as zzso We now show that, in addition to the binding site for zzso the zzso pol I zzso also requires the presence of a zzso region coding for the last 12 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with this zzso element, both to pause the zzso and to effect release of the zzso These findings have implications for the termination mechanism used by all three nuclear zzso zzso since all three are known to pause at this zzso
