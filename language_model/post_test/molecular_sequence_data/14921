A novel zzso rod zzso zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a sea water sample collected near zzso coast, Bay of zzso zzso zzso on marine zzso were zzso zzso in diameter, zzso and rose with entire zzso Growth occurred at zzso zzso zzso zzso and pH of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The fatty acids were dominated by zzso saturated and zzso fatty acids with a high abundance of zzso zzso and summed feature 9 (as defined by zzso zzso was found to be the major respiratory zzso and zzso zzso zzso and four unidentified zzso as polar zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso analysis revealed that strain zzso was a member of the zzso zzso and closely related to zzso zzso with a zzso distance of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso and clustered with the same zzso zzso from the zzso zzso study support the conclusion that strain zzso represents a novel zzso species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
