zzso zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso a zzso type zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso then associates with the transforming growth factor zzso type I zzso zzso enhancing zzso However, the mechanism of nuclear export of zzso by zzso has not been zzso Here we identified a functional nuclear export signal zzso in a zzso region of zzso In zzso cells, the zzso complex was accumulated in the zzso by the nuclear export zzso zzso this action was prevented by treatment with zzso B, a specific zzso of zzso zzso A green zzso protein fusion protein containing the zzso zzso motif of zzso located in the zzso accumulated in the nucleus following treatment with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was shown to bind physically to zzso through zzso and nuclear export of the zzso complex was prevented by zzso of zzso within the zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso induced by zzso These results thus suggest that zzso nuclear export of zzso is essential for the negative regulation of zzso signaling by zzso
