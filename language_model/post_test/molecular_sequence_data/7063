The level of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in the liver of vitamin zzso rats was found to be zzso higher than that of the control zzso The administration of zzso to zzso vitamin zzso rats induced expression of zzso zzso zzso and the induction was suppressed by the simultaneous administration of zzso Since the zzso regulatory region of the rat zzso gene contains several sequences showing zzso to zzso zzso we zzso an zzso probe of zzso element sequence and zzso the binding activity of liver nuclear extract to the zzso by gel mobility shift zzso We found that the binding activity of nuclear extract prepared from the liver of vitamin zzso rats was far greater than that of the control rats, indicating that the zzso activity of zzso zzso was enhanced by vitamin B6 zzso We further found that zzso of the nuclear extract from the zzso liver with zzso zzso brought about a rapid and extensive decrease in the binding of the extract to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show an zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression by zzso the binding activity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
