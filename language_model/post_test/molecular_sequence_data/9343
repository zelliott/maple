DNA fingerprints and end sequences from bacterial artificial zzso zzso from two new libraries were generated to improve the first generation integrated physical and genetic map of the rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso The current version of the physical map is composed of zzso clones of which zzso are assembled into zzso and zzso are zzso The number of zzso was reduced from zzso to zzso End sequencing of clones from the new libraries generated a total of zzso high quality sequence zzso The end sequences were used to develop zzso new zzso of which 42 were added to the genetic zzso zzso zzso between the rainbow trout zzso and model fish zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso end sequence zzso zzso The zzso of zzso reads with significant zzso hits against the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, while the zzso of significant zzso hits against the zzso zzso and zzso protein databases were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The overall number of unique regions of zzso zzso identified through grouping of the rainbow trout zzso into zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso These numbers are approximately three to five times greater than those we have previously identified using zzso paired zzso zzso of the zzso zzso analysis results by linkage groups as derived from the integrated physical and genetic map revealed that despite the low sequence zzso large blocks of zzso are zzso between zzso arms of rainbow trout and the model fish zzso
