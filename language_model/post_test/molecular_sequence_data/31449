zzso zzso zzso to human zzso 14 and 15 were generated by a zzso event of an ancestral zzso zzso where the two zzso were joined zzso The zzso ancestral zzso most closely resembles the zzso zzso zzso In this work, we provide insights into the evolution of human zzso 14 and 15, performing a comparative study between zzso boundary region zzso and the zzso human zzso We construct a zzso zzso of zzso zzso clones in the region zzso to the ancestral zzso zzso site and use it to define the structural changes that occurred on human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We characterize the novel zzso transition region zzso zzso acquired during the zzso establishment on zzso 14, and find it was mainly derived through zzso zzso from ancestral zzso zzso zzso to human zzso and zzso Further, we show a relationship between evolutionary hotspots and zzso repeat zzso for zzso 15, revealing a possible role of zzso zzso not only in zzso but also in zzso together zzso zzso
