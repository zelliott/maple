The zzso zzso of mice encodes two functional class II zzso zzso A alpha A beta zzso and E alpha E beta zzso While failure to express the A protein has not been reported, a significant proportion of of zzso zzso in both zzso and wild mice do not express E zzso We and others have previously characterized the molecular basis for defective E expression in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso species, identifying six distinct defects in the genes for E alpha or E zzso In this report we have extended these studies to other zzso zzso including several from zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso and one derived from the Asian species zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and DNA levels were employed to identify the defects in the genes for zzso and zzso At least one new zzso was identified that prevents E beta expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso bringing the number of distinct zzso causing the zzso zzso to zzso Another zzso zzso zzso was found to share the same E beta zzso with mice of the zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso while its zzso gene contains the deletion carried also by the zzso b and s zzso and by a number of wild zzso The zzso in the zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso were found to be identical to those of the zzso f zzso This indicates that the origin of the zzso in the zzso genes of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso and zzso genes of the f and zzso zzso predated zzso within zzso thought to have occurred approximately zzso million years zzso Their maintenance in mouse populations suggests that in certain conditions the failure to express E alpha E beta proteins may be advantageous and selected zzso
