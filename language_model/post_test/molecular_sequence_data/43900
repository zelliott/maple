zzso genes are known to play a critical role in pattern formation during zzso development by being expressed at the specific time and in the specific position along the zzso body zzso In order to understand the regulatory mechanism for the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso system was zzso DNA zzso zzso a position specificity to the zzso gene was placed just upstream from the zzso zzso promoter and zzso gene in a zzso zzso of zzso positive clones after zzso of the reporter and mouse embryonic zzso library as an zzso which was designed to be expressed as fusion proteins to the zzso zzso domain, allowed us to isolate putative factors interacting with the zzso regulatory element of zzso zzso A total of 28 positive clones were screened from 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso About zzso of the clones turned out to be novel and most of the candidate clones selected in this study showed a temporally restricted expression pattern during embryonic development, suggesting that this method could provide an efficient way for zzso novel genes whose expressions are temporally regulated during zzso
