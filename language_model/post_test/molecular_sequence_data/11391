The zzso zzso of zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso filament, a hook, and a zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and expression of the hook zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso long and is located on the zzso linear zzso of zzso zzso The primary protein sequence of zzso shows zzso similarity to the zzso protein of zzso zzso and approximately 50% similarity to the zzso proteins of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned into an zzso coli expression zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared by zzso mice with the partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By Western zzso zzso analysis, the zzso was found to react with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso confirming the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso to zzso were found in serum specimens from 19 of 42 patients with zzso zzso Moreover, when other zzso including zzso (the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to test for the development of corresponding zzso in these patients, zzso of these patients zzso of zzso reacted to at least one of these five zzso suggesting that a combination of zzso with other available zzso zzso zzso proteins is a good candidate for zzso in zzso to aid in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
