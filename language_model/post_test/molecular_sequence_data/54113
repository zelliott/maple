A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso zzso Republic of Korea, and was characterized using a zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso of the class zzso and exhibited zzso gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty acids and zzso and three unknown zzso as the major polar zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso properties and zzso zzso it is suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species of a new zzso in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
