To investigate the in zzso evolution of zzso zzso we followed up on a mother who was initially zzso with zzso A and D in zzso Blood samples were obtained in 1996 and 2002, and zzso pol and zzso genes were amplified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As for the 1996 sample most of the clones generated from the pol and zzso genes clustered either with zzso A and D reference zzso However, two clones from the pol gene were found to be independent zzso between zzso A and D by zzso analysis, suggesting active generation of zzso zzso As for the 2002 sample, all the clones from the pol gene clustered only with the zzso A reference strain, while all the zzso clones clustered only with zzso D, denoting a dominance of an zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that in patients zzso infected with zzso A and D there is an ongoing generation and selection for zzso zzso zzso
