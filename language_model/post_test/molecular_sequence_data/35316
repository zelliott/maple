zzso zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis is a promising target for the development of zzso zzso With the absence of an available bacterial zzso crystal structure, that of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been a useful tool for determining its structural and functional zzso In this study, a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso was selected, and the possible role was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso were expressed in their soluble forms in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso The molecular mass zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso which is similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited significantly lower activity than zzso zzso whereas zzso was inactive under the tested zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso and zzso zzso showed a significantly decreased preference toward zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the zzso showed similar zzso to that of zzso zzso Like in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso binding pocket of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that the zzso zzso plays a significant role in the zzso binding of zzso tuberculosis zzso
