zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso toxic zzso zzso produced during normal metabolism or after zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso Using a mouse liver cell model, we report here that after cellular zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities decreased dramatically and that cellular transformation further decreased zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso activities seen in transformed cells zzso were due to decreased amounts of zzso zzso protein that results from decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso of gene expression may occur at the zzso level, as suggested by results with zzso zzso and zzso D zzso zzso
