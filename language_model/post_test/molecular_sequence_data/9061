Two types of methanol zzso zzso were obtained from a novel marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grown on zzso Type I zzso consisted of two identical zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso organized to form the zzso zzso Type II zzso contained an additional zzso protein zzso zzso and had more specific activity than type I zzso The zzso values of type I and II zzso for methanol under zzso zzso reduction zzso system were estimated to be zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso points of type I and II zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso The average zzso ratios of zzso zzso and zzso in type II zzso were approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on these results, the original zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is most likely the zzso zzso During zzso the zzso and zzso cell disruption method significantly increased the amount of type II zzso in the soluble fraction compared with strong physical disruption methods such as zzso and French zzso
