zzso is used to induce in mice experimental zzso zzso zzso a model for zzso zzso Because zzso zzso is a more potent zzso of EAT than zzso zzso it has been hypothesized that it contains unique zzso zzso The validation of this hypothesis has been hampered by the lack of the zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso areas in zzso we zzso by reverse zzso zzso and zzso the complete zzso zzso zzso This encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids that is zzso and zzso identical to bovine and human zzso zzso Six regions are unique to each zzso We also analyzed through zzso the sequences able to bind to the zzso major zzso zzso and, therefore, function as T cell zzso zzso analysis showed seven zzso T cell zzso in zzso The availability of the complete zzso zzso sequence should promote the understanding of the zzso and zzso of zzso
