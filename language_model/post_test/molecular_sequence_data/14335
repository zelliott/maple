The zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is essential for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The expression and function of zzso must adapt to zzso zzso The goal of this study was to zzso the mechanisms responsible for higher zzso zzso in zzso zzso during zzso and to evaluate whether there are differences between zzso and respiratory zzso with regard to zzso zzso and, if so, to identify the relevant parameters that may trigger these distinct zzso zzso We achieved zzso zzso by lowering zzso concentration in the cell culture medium and respiratory zzso by increasing zzso tension in the incubator zzso We found that zzso zzso expression was increased in response to both forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels, at least in part due to zzso of transcription, whilst mild zzso and severe zzso respiratory zzso did not zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region suggested that the regulatory elements sensitive to zzso zzso are located between zzso and zzso zzso where two consensus binding sites for zzso a zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso were zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso which results in higher zzso and total protein zzso At the plasma membrane surface, zzso expression was increased in zzso and respiratory zzso alike, suggesting that low pH is responsible for zzso displacement to the cell zzso
