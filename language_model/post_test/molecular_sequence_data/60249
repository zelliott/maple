The zzso zzso zzso are major targets of the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso and others, recently identified a family of proteins termed zzso which interact with zzso In cells, zzso suppresses zzso zzso by upstream zzso zzso has a zzso effect on zzso zzso and we now show that the closely related zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso To understand the differential regulation of zzso by Cool zzso we screened for zzso proteins by affinity zzso and zzso This has led to the identification of two closely related proteins called Cat zzso zzso zzso which contain a zinc finger followed by three zzso zzso zzso is identical to the recently identified binding partner for the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso which was shown to have zzso zzso zzso and zzso both bind to the zzso region of zzso and zzso but do not bind to zzso zzso is zzso in growing zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso is increased following cell spreading on zzso decreased in cells arrested in zzso and increased in the ensuing zzso zzso Cat proteins are zzso when zzso in cells with the focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest that in addition to playing a role in zzso zzso Cat proteins may serve as points of convergence between G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle regulators, and zzso signaling zzso
