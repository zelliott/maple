The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a zzso important zzso that regulates the rate of cellular and viral protein synthesis by zzso and thereby zzso the zzso chain initiation factor zzso We have generated a partial zzso zzso which probably represents the zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using sequence information of the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the mouse zzso It has zzso overall identity with the corresponding region of the human zzso All the protein zzso zzso zzso are zzso in the mouse zzso Moreover, there are additional stretches of zzso that are totally zzso between the two zzso The functional zzso of the two proteins was tested by constructing a zzso zzso that zzso a protein whose zzso 364 zzso were of human origin and zzso zzso zzso were of mouse zzso The zzso protein was as efficient as the human zzso zzso in binding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
