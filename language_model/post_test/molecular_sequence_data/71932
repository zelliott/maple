zzso analyses were carried out on a large number of proteins that contain the highly zzso basic zzso zzso zzso derived from information theory were used to examine the extent of conservation at zzso acid sites within the zzso domain as well as the extent of mutual information among sites within the zzso Using the zzso zzso measure, we described the extent of zzso acid conservation throughout the zzso zzso We used position association zzso statistics that reflect the joint probability of occurrence of events to estimate the zzso information zzso among distinct zzso acid zzso Further, we used zzso statistics to estimate the extent of association in zzso acid composition at each site in the domain and between zzso acid composition and variables reflecting zzso and group membership, loop zzso and the presence of a zzso zzso The zzso values were also used to describe groups of zzso acid sites called zzso that were highly associated with each zzso Finally, a zzso motif was constructed that accurately identifies zzso zzso proteins that belong to Groups A and zzso
