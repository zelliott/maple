zzso C virus zzso cell entry involves interaction between the viral envelope zzso zzso and the cell surface zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso important for successful binding will facilitate development of entry zzso designed to block this zzso Previous studies have assigned the zzso binding function to a number of zzso regions of zzso To better define specific zzso involved in zzso zzso a panel of zzso of zzso envelope proteins was generated, where zzso zzso within putative zzso binding regions were zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins were tested for binding to a panel of zzso zzso and zzso and for their ability to form zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso proteins were correctly zzso zzso proteins fell into three groups: those that bound zzso and zzso zzso zzso those that zzso both zzso binding and zzso zzso and a final group containing zzso that were able to bind zzso but were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso across all zzso that were critical for zzso binding were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data significantly increase our understanding of the zzso zzso binding zzso
