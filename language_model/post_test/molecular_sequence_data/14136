zzso zzso zzso a zzso analogue which interacts with highest affinities at zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 2 zzso or zzso 3, was zzso into selective brain sites and its influence on zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric acid zzso was investigated in rats zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso was measured by zzso the stomach with saline through a gastric zzso every 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso complex zzso 7, 15, 30 and 60 zzso zzso increased zzso gastric acid zzso The peak acid response was reached within 20 zzso and returned to zzso level 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso into the surrounding area or the central zzso did not modify zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso injected into the lateral zzso zzso 100, zzso or 300 zzso zzso nucleus zzso or lateral zzso zzso zzso 15, or 30 zzso zzso inhibited zzso gastric acid zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso into the area surrounding the zzso or zzso did not modify the acid zzso response to zzso zzso zzso prevented the effects of zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso Spinal zzso zzso abolished the zzso action of zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso into the zzso but not the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso acts in the zzso to enhance and in the zzso and zzso to inhibit zzso gastric acid zzso The action is zzso through zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso The site specific pattern of acid responses to zzso zzso may be linked to the distribution of zzso zzso at these sites that convey the different biological actions of zzso
