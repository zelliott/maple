Multiple and variable zzso zzso in zzso class II zzso repeat zzso were characterized by mass zzso The zzso on zzso is zzso and is released from peptides under normal mass zzso zzso Thus, special approaches must be considered in order to identify this zzso By using a combination of mass zzso studies operating in negative and positive zzso mode, zzso zzso could be zzso In positive mode, the peptides normally appeared zzso whereas in negative mode a mixture of zzso and zzso species was zzso A combination of peptides released by different zzso was used to obtain details on the locations of zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso were observed in the zzso region of zzso (up to 9 zzso zzso (up to 6 zzso and zzso (2 zzso zzso contains two additional zzso zzso zzso close to its C zzso We also identified an error in the published sequence of bovine zzso resulting in the replacement of zzso by zzso thus increasing its zzso with its human zzso
