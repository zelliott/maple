Multiple copy tandem repeats zzso of an authentic zzso region of the human zzso zzso promoter between zzso to zzso relative to the cap site or the zzso zzso derived from this region, both acted as strong zzso regulatory elements in zzso zzso zzso Such zzso were unresponsive to treatment with zzso despite their considerable zzso with the zzso elements of other genes but were highly responsive to treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso induction of zzso cells zzso with zzso of the zzso region linked to a zzso gene increased the activity of the reporter gene zzso to zzso over baseline zzso Treatment with zzso prior to virus induction did not increase further zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso gene under the control of a zzso tandem repeat zzso of the human zzso promoter and an expression zzso for the zzso zzso zzso markedly increased zzso activity while zzso of zzso cells with the zzso construct together with an expression zzso for the zzso regulator zzso markedly decreased zzso activity relative to cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
