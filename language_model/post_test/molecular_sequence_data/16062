Gene 32 from zzso T4 is transcribed as precursor transcripts which are processed to a stable zzso This processing of the gene 32 zzso was observed in zzso III or zzso strains of zzso zzso However, after infection of an zzso zzso strain, the amount of processed transcript was significantly reduced while the levels of the precursor transcripts remained zzso zzso E therefore appears to have an essential role in the processing of the gene 32 zzso We have mapped the exact zzso end of the processed transcript by primer zzso The zzso occurs near a zzso structure at a site which shows some similarity to other known zzso E zzso zzso The effects of the processing on the differential stability of the upstream and downstream zzso and on gene zzso are zzso
