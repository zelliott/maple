The advantage of using the two-dimensional separation method was demonstrated by the separation of the complex zzso peptides of zzso human tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso This method zzso two zzso methods where zzso containing zzso are collected from zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and separated by zzso zone zzso zzso zzso readily resolved zzso structural zzso based on zzso acid content and zzso on the same zzso zzso peptides zzso collected in the same zzso fraction were well resolved from the zzso This combination of zzso and zzso was able to uniquely resolve all of the peptides and zzso zzso in zzso Confirmation of the specific zzso in the zzso was made by zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The advantages and disadvantages of the existing methods for zzso characterization in the biotech industry were zzso The advantage of this approach is to provide a simple extension of the existing zzso digest protocols to include zzso analysis to a detailed level of zzso
