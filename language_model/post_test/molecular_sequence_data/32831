zzso zzso has nine zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, several of them implicated in zzso differentiation and/or responses to different zzso One of the nine, zzso is the focus of this zzso A constructed zzso zzso zzso was delayed in development and exhibited a bald zzso when grown on minimal medium containing zzso as carbon zzso One of two distinct zzso zzso zzso was active only during growth on solid zzso when its zzso coincided with aerial zzso zzso zzso from zzso was readily detected in several zzso zzso zzso in zzso of aerial zzso into zzso but was absent from all zzso zzso tested, suggesting that zzso activity was restricted to the aerial zzso It also depended on zzso thus zzso was zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed no functional significance to the location of zzso next to zzso zzso another zzso zzso zzso We identified another potential zzso target, zzso zzso a putative small zzso zzso zzso of zzso originated from a single, aerial zzso and zzso zzso While in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso promoter confirmed that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso failed to initiate zzso from zzso and from the zzso promoter in zzso Additional in zzso data indicated that further zzso upstream zzso which are likely to bind a potential zzso are required for successful zzso Using a zzso zzso fusion we located zzso zzso to a novel zzso the zzso zzso of the aerial zzso We suggest that this newly recognized compartment defines an interface between the aerial and zzso parts of the zzso colony and might also be involved in communication between these two zzso
