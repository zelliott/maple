A zzso protein has been zzso an estimated zzso from zzso nuclear extracts using four different zzso zzso Two zzso of apparent molecular weight of 160,000 and 100,000 were present in the final zzso fraction as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso clipping of the zzso complexes zzso after zzso treatment indicated that the zzso zzso is most likely a degradation product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have shown that both these zzso bind specifically to zzso duplexes containing zzso zzso zzso DNA binding studies and zzso competition zzso showed that although the zzso protein binds with highest affinity to zzso containing zzso zzso it is also capable of binding to zzso containing other zzso The zzso protein has an associated zzso zzso activity, which is markedly enhanced in the presence of zzso zzso A zzso capable of unwinding a zzso zzso zzso to a complementary sequence in zzso zzso also zzso with the zzso zzso This reaction occurs in an zzso and zzso zzso
