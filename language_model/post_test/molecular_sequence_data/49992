zzso zzso zzso determine the zzso specificity of zzso and, until recently, had been classified into two families, the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is a domain of approximately 70 zzso acids that is present in proteins from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso chain assembly factor zzso that zzso with a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso to catalyze the formation of a zzso chain on artificial zzso We recently showed that zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with an E1 and an zzso mediate zzso in the absence of a zzso type or zzso type zzso zzso proteins have thus been defined as a third family of zzso We here review recent progress in the characterization of zzso proteins and of their role in the quality control system that zzso the cellular stress response to the zzso zzso of abnormal zzso
