In this study, zzso structural changes were investigated in human, zzso zzso zzso zzso body temperature zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso and zzso zzso zzso body temperature zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso using circular zzso zzso and dynamic light zzso The average zzso radius zzso and fractional zzso change in the zzso zzso at 222 zzso 2 zzso of zzso were zzso The temperature was varied zzso from 25 degrees C to 45 degrees zzso The existence of a structural transition of human zzso at the critical temperature zzso between zzso degrees C was previously shown by zzso aspiration experiments, zzso and circular zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso this study proves the onset of molecular zzso at zzso In two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso the critical transition temperatures were found between zzso degrees C, which are close to the zzso body temperature zzso The data suggest that the correlation of the structural zzso critical temperature zzso and the zzso body temperature zzso is not mere coincidence but, instead, is a more widespread structural phenomenon possibly including many other zzso
