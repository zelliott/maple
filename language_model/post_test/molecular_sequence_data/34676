The field of zzso is built on technologies to analyze large numbers of zzso the entire zzso the same zzso Mass zzso zzso has been successfully used to characterize proteins in complex zzso but results so far have largely been zzso Two recently developed zzso offer the opportunity to obtain quantitative zzso zzso Comparing the signals from the same zzso under different conditions yields a rough estimate of relative protein abundance between two zzso zzso and more accurately, peptides are labeled with stable zzso introducing a predictable mass difference between peptides from two experimental zzso zzso isotope labels can be incorporated zzso by chemical approaches or in live cells through zzso zzso This zzso handle zzso direct zzso from the mass zzso Using these quantitative approaches, precise functional information as well as zzso changes in the zzso can be captured by zzso
