We have used chemical zzso functional zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso to probe the functional dynamics of zzso zzso which regulates the zzso zzso in cardiac zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso at low zzso but the zzso domain zzso this zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso replaced by the zzso acid zzso spin label, which reports zzso backbone dynamics zzso zzso was zzso into zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso showed normal zzso function, which was reversed by zzso at zzso or by zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso domain exhibits two resolved zzso a tense T state that is ordered and a relaxed R state that is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shifts this equilibrium toward the R state and makes it more dynamic zzso zzso strongly zzso the dynamics of zzso zzso without zzso the complex, while zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso A zzso anchor zzso attached to the N zzso of zzso permits zzso zzso zzso but prevents the zzso zzso and reversal of zzso We conclude that the relief of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is due to an zzso transition in the zzso domain of zzso which allows this domain to extend above the membrane surface and induce a structural change in the zzso domain of zzso This mechanism is distinct from the one that zzso zzso zzso zzso upon the addition of zzso zzso
