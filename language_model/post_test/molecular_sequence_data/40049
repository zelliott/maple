zzso are rich in zzso zzso zzso which improves health by treating conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as diabetes zzso and zzso zzso is a food made from soybeans fermented by strains of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso strain zzso there is a putative promoter region almost identical to the zzso promoter for zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the putative zzso promoter functioned to induce zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso reaction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso and the promoter was indispensable for the zzso of zzso as well as zzso suggesting that zzso might be an alternative carbon source zzso in a way involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed that the parental zzso strain consumed zzso while a zzso defective in the zzso promoter did not do so at zzso These results suggest that zzso the zzso zzso genes might prevent zzso consumption, retaining it in zzso for enrichment of possible zzso zzso
