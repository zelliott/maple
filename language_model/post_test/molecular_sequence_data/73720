An zzso gene zzso was isolated from a previously constructed zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consisted of a zzso open reading frame zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso identity was found between the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso and the sequences for zzso C from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein containing an zzso zzso tag was constructed and zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that it was a zzso zzso having a zzso mass of 50 zzso with optimum temperature, zzso zzso and pH for activity at 32 to 37 degrees C, zzso and zzso zzso zzso had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of zzso cheese (10 degrees C, zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso internal zzso bonds in zzso and zzso however, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was not zzso
