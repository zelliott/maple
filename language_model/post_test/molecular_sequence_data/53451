The human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso function as a zzso zzso of three zzso exterior zzso and three zzso zzso zzso Previously, we reported three approaches to stabilize soluble zzso containing parts of the zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso disruption of the zzso site between zzso and zzso and introduction of zzso in the zzso coiled zzso to form zzso zzso zzso Here, we applied similar approaches to stabilize soluble zzso zzso including the complete zzso and zzso zzso A combination of fusion with the zzso zzso sequences and disruption of the zzso zzso site resulted in relatively homogeneous zzso zzso with exceptional zzso The zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso are intact and exposed on these zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of the soluble zzso are relatively zzso compared with those on zzso zzso zzso This zzso similarity to the functional zzso envelope zzso and the presence of the complete zzso zzso should make the soluble zzso zzso useful tools for structural and zzso zzso
