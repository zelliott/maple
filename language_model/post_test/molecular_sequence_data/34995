zzso zzso the most abundant water channel in the brain, plays a central role in water zzso zzso activity, and migration of zzso in the central nervous zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso is a target of an zzso specifically detected in an zzso zzso disease called zzso zzso Here we have generated a zzso zzso zzso against the zzso region of zzso using a zzso expressing mouse zzso as an zzso This zzso zzso zzso recognized both human and mouse zzso in a zzso condition and was able to zzso zzso from cell zzso of zzso cells zzso expressing zzso Western zzso analysis using deletion zzso revealed that the zzso was located within a region between zzso and zzso in the zzso tail of zzso Although clone zzso could not be used for zzso when cells or zzso were fixed with zzso zzso or zzso zzso it could be used when cells were fixed with zzso zzso acid and when a zzso tissue section was zzso with zzso zzso This zzso can be a valuable tool for analysis of zzso in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso and zzso as well as in zzso models, both in zzso and in zzso
