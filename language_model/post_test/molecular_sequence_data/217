We investigate the zzso of the full chicken prion protein zzso in solution at neutral pH with molecular dynamics zzso We focus on the persistence of its secondary structure motifs using a recently proposed protein zzso indicator zzso zzso et zzso zzso 2008, 70, zzso From this, we find a high rigidity of zzso 2 zzso and of the zzso domain, which is turn rich, and a plasticity of the short zzso consistent with the available zzso structural zzso We also determine the extent of zzso for each zzso revealing local zzso for such structured zzso These features hint at a possible origin of the high resistance to zzso of the avian prion proteins and of its capability in preventing the zzso in comparison to zzso
