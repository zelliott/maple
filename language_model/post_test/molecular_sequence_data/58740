A DNA sequencing strategy was developed based on the zzso resistance zzso zzso A universal zzso primer binding site zzso for DNA sequencing and restriction sites for mapping were inserted near one end of zzso and the new zzso zzso introduced onto a zzso zzso zzso The target sequence is inserted between two zzso resolution sites zzso of zzso present on the zzso zzso zzso Due to the zzso of long zzso sequences in zzso coli insertions between the zzso zzso zzso sites of zzso are positively zzso zzso of zzso into the target sequence is selected by zzso formation of zzso during zzso mating and transfer of the zzso sequencing zzso After zzso resolution, the additional zzso sites in the zzso result in a second zzso zzso removing most of the zzso (except of 136 zzso and part of the target zzso The reduced zzso sizes and the use of the universal primer improved the quality of the sequencing results obtained on an automated fluorescent zzso A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso terminal zzso repeats zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by this zzso A zzso sequence was found on this zzso with the features of zzso zzso The element called zzso had zzso zzso and two potential open reading zzso The predicted gene products had similar sizes and high similarity to gene products zzso by zzso sequences of the zzso zzso Furthermore, a potential signal stimulating zzso shifts and typical for members of the zzso family was zzso Five to seven copies of zzso were found in different strains of zzso zzso but none in other zzso species zzso
