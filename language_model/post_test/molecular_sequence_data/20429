zzso zzso is initiated by the formation of numerous DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso by the widely zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso requires nine other proteins for zzso zzso zzso however, unlike zzso few of these are zzso across zzso In order to investigate this zzso step in higher zzso we took advantage of a zzso zzso zzso screen carried out in the model plant zzso zzso A collection of 55,000 zzso lines was screened, and zzso zzso zzso by a drastic decrease in zzso formation at zzso I associated with an absence of zzso at zzso were zzso This screen led to the identification of two populations of zzso classified according to their zzso zzso zzso that repair zzso zzso using the sister zzso such as zzso or zzso that are unable to make zzso like zzso We found that in zzso zzso at least four proteins are necessary for driving zzso zzso repair via the zzso zzso These include the previously zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but also the zzso specific zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso defective in zzso formation, we identified the previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as two new zzso zzso and zzso Our data thus increase the number of proteins necessary for zzso formation in zzso zzso to zzso Unlike zzso and (to a minor zzso zzso these two new proteins are poorly zzso among species, suggesting that the zzso formation zzso but not its regulation, is zzso among zzso
