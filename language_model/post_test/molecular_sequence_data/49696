In Europe, the zzso cycle of zzso zzso has not been determined so zzso Recently, zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso ticks in Slovenia by using molecular zzso In order to investigate the zzso hosts of zzso zzso in Slovenia we collected 261 small zzso representing 11 zzso They were tested for the presence of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso based on the nuclear small zzso zzso gene zzso The bank zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso were infected with zzso zzso The prevalence rate was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso sequences of amplified portions of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were indistinguishable from each other and identical with those previously described in zzso zzso ticks collected in zzso The results of this study represent molecular evidence of zzso zzso in small zzso in zzso
