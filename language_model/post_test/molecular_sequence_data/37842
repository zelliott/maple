zzso zzso syndrome protein zzso is an zzso protein that zzso zzso formation downstream of zzso It has been shown that zzso actively extend from the growth zzso a guidance apparatus located at the tip of zzso suggesting their role in zzso zzso Here we examined the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso extension zzso Since zzso zzso zzso and zzso region zzso of zzso is known to be required for the zzso of zzso complex that zzso zzso zzso we prepared a zzso zzso lacking four zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso in zzso had been reported to be zzso in some zzso syndrome zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppressed zzso extension of zzso zzso In support of this, the zzso region of zzso cannot activate zzso complex enough compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso which has been shown unable to bind to zzso also works as a dominant negative zzso in zzso extension zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso double zzso has no significant dominant negative zzso Finally, the expression of the zzso zzso also severely inhibited the zzso extension of primary zzso from rat zzso Thus, zzso is thought to be a general regulator of the zzso zzso indispensable for zzso extension, which is probably caused through zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso zzso
