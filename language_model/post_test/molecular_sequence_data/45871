In the last decade enormous advances in life sciences have been possible due to the information obtained from DNA sequencing zzso The optimal interpretation and analysis of zzso sequence data requires the precise zzso and zzso of proteins deduced from open reading zzso which is usually done with the help of zzso zzso Here we report a novel profile for the zzso type of zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to profiles for other families of zzso regulators, the new zzso profile is located outside the zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that the new profile is more specific than any of the existing signatures for this family of zzso More than 500 representatives of this family were identified with this zzso A database on bacterial regulators zzso was built to compile and regroup the sequences with the aid of the new zzso
