Several self-defense proteins have been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso acid sequences zzso These proteins include novel zzso proteins designated zzso and zzso and a novel zzso designated zzso an insect zzso of zzso von zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso and zzso have been analyzed and their ability to form zzso channels in bacterial zzso play an important role in defense against bacterial zzso zzso and genes zzso these proteins have been cloned to examine their induction mechanisms upon bacterial zzso Regulatory motifs such as the zzso and zzso sequence have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso gene expression was confirmed to occur upon bacterial infection and before zzso under zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso plays an important role in both immunity and zzso Moreover, this review also describes the releasing mechanisms of a bacterial cell wall zzso zzso zzso from intact bacteria, clearance of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and a possible signal zzso zzso for zzso protein gene zzso
