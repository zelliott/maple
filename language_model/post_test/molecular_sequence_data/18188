zzso light and heavy chains are zzso in zzso cells as precursors containing a signal zzso zzso and assembling result in formation of active zzso zzso genes have been made containing the coding sequence of the barley zzso signal zzso which has been fused to zzso coding for either the mature light or the mature heavy chain of a zzso zzso A zzso was constructed linking both zzso genes under the control of plant active promoters in an expression zzso This DNA zzso was zzso integrated into the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of light and heavy chains and assembly to zzso was detected in transgenic tobacco tissue using specific secondary zzso By electron microscopic zzso zzso the presence of assembled zzso could be detected within the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated biological activity of the assembled zzso produced in plant zzso zzso a significant amount of assembled zzso was found within zzso
