Mechanical loading of cardiac and skeletal muscles in zzso and in zzso causes rapid zzso of a number of zzso zzso genes and zzso of muscle zzso However, little is known as to how muscle cells sense mechanical load and zzso it into zzso signals of gene zzso We examined roles of putative cellular zzso zzso zzso channels, the zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso of cardiac zzso grown on a zzso silicone zzso Using the zzso technique, we found a single class of zzso zzso channel that was completely blocked by zzso zzso zzso of this channel by zzso did not affect either the zzso expression of zzso genes or the increase in protein zzso Neither disruption of zzso with zzso nor that of zzso zzso by zzso D prevented the zzso zzso gene expression and increase in protein zzso Arresting zzso activity of zzso by high zzso zzso or zzso did not affect the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso could increase protein synthesis in response to zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso and zzso activity may not be necessary for zzso of mechanical stretch into the zzso gene expression and zzso The stimulus of membrane stretch may be transmitted to the cell nucleus through some mechanisms other than electrical or direct mechanical zzso in cardiac zzso
