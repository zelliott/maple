Nerve growth factor zzso is involved in a variety of processes involving zzso such as cell differentiation and survival, growth zzso and zzso of zzso These events are zzso by zzso as a result of binding to its two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso with zzso zzso activity that forms a zzso binding site for zzso Of the five zzso zzso its zzso portion, the zzso domain zzso to the membrane zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso Here we present the crystal structure of human zzso in complex with human zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso interface consists of two patches of similar zzso One patch involves the central zzso that forms the core of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso at the zzso pole of zzso The second patch comprises the zzso zzso of zzso which adopt a zzso zzso upon complex formation, packing against the zzso sheet of zzso The structure is consistent with results from zzso experiments for all zzso and indicates that the first patch may constitute a zzso binding motif for all family members, whereas the second patch is specific for the interaction between zzso and zzso
