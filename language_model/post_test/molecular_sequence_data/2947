The zzso zzso encodes two zzso designated zzso and zzso is expressed only in zzso whereas zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso in that it contains an insert of 6 zzso zzso To study the evolutionary conservation of the zzso acid zzso the expression of zzso in the brain of animals from different classes was zzso by using zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso was detected only in the brain of zzso birds, and zzso but not zzso and fish, whereas zzso was present in the brain of all animals tested, including lobster zzso These findings indicate that zzso may play a role in events associated with higher brain function, such as zzso zzso
