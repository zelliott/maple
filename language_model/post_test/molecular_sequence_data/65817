The polarization of zzso and animal cells relies on membrane zzso for polar targeting of proteins to the plasma zzso their polar zzso recycling and restricted lateral zzso However, little is known about zzso function in zzso zzso zzso root growth along the gravity zzso requires polar transport of the plant hormone zzso In zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso directs root zzso Although the composition of membrane zzso influences zzso and zzso of two other zzso zzso it remains unknown how zzso contribute mechanistically to zzso zzso Here, we show that correct membrane zzso composition is essential for the acquisition of zzso zzso Polar zzso zzso is defective in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which displays altered zzso zzso zzso zzso and root zzso At the end of zzso zzso zzso initially to both newly formed zzso but subsequently disappears from zzso By contrast, zzso frequently remains at both daughter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composition affects zzso acquisition of zzso polarity by zzso suggesting a mechanism for zzso action on establishment of zzso protein zzso
