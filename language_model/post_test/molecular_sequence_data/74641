We report the comparative zzso characterization of the zzso of adult and newborn specimens of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from two geographically isolated populations from the Caribbean and the Pacific zzso of Costa zzso The crude zzso were zzso by zzso zzso followed by analysis of each zzso fraction by zzso zzso sequencing, zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso tandem mass zzso of zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso separated since the late zzso or early zzso zzso zzso by the zzso Mountain Range, Central Mountain Range, and zzso Mountain Range, contain both identical and different zzso from the zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a similarity zzso we estimate that the similarity of zzso proteins between the two zzso zzso populations may be around zzso zzso differences between zzso among different geographic regions may be due to evolutionary environmental pressure acting on isolated zzso To investigate zzso zzso among specimens from the two zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein profiles of 15 zzso from Caribbean specimens and 11 zzso from snakes from Pacific regions were zzso Within each zzso zzso geographic zzso all major zzso protein families appeared to be subjected to individual zzso The occurrence of zzso individual zzso zzso highlights the concept that a species, zzso zzso in our case, should be considered as a group of zzso Analysis of pooled zzso of zzso specimens from Caribbean and Pacific regions with those of adult snakes from the same geographical habitat revealed prominent zzso changes in both geographical zzso Major zzso changes appear to be a shift from a zzso to a zzso zzso and the zzso in adults of a distinct set of zzso 2 molecules than in the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso composition shift results in increasing zzso complexity, indicating that the requirement for the zzso to zzso prey and initiate zzso may change with the size zzso of the zzso Besides ecological and zzso zzso the geographical zzso zzso reported here may have an impact in the treatment of bite victims and in the selection of specimens for zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso in the zzso composition and zzso after zzso by snakes from different geographical location and age has long been appreciated by zzso and zzso though detailed comparative zzso analysis are zzso Our study represents the first detailed characterization of individual and zzso zzso protein profile variations in two geographical isolated zzso zzso zzso and highlights the necessity of using pooled zzso as a statistically representative zzso for zzso zzso
