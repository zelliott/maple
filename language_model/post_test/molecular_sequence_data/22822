The aim of this study was to investigate the constitution of zzso gene types, their zzso zzso sequence zzso element, their zzso zzso or zzso and zzso gene status in zzso zzso strains zzso in order to examine their zzso 

Southern zzso and zzso zzso transfer were used to zzso the zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the IS elements and the zzso zzso zzso was applied to detect the zzso zzso IS zzso zzso products and a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

Nine of the zzso genes zzso were activated by zzso and nine were carried on zzso four of which were zzso The five zzso genes were zzso and two of them were associated with zzso and one with zzso Of the three zzso zzso two were activated by zzso and one was carried on a zzso zzso The only zzso gene was zzso The five zzso strains zzso the resistance genes on zzso one zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and a novel zzso element was demonstrated upstream of all the zzso zzso The zzso events of some of these IS elements were restricted to certain zzso zzso zzso The 11 zzso zzso genes displayed a positive association with the zzso zzso zzso 

Fourteen strains zzso the well-known genetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and a common zzso zzso However, a rate of zzso was also demonstrated, mostly due to combinations of zzso genes and their associated IS elements zzso on different zzso
