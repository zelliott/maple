zzso zzso is a major zzso DNA damage zzso Its repair activity was determined in the human zzso cell line, zzso during the aging zzso The repair activity increased in the first part of the aging process and decreased in the latter zzso The highest repair activity was observed at the age of 30 zzso These results suggest that the defense capacity for replication errors due to zzso DNA damage increases greatly when the cells are rapidly zzso
