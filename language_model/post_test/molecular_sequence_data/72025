zzso available human zzso preparations of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso were shown to contain low levels of zzso and we sought to determine whether zzso might be a means of regulating the zzso zzso zzso A zzso form of zzso with similarly low levels of zzso as zzso was treated with hydrogen zzso in order to study the effect of zzso specifically zzso zzso on the zzso properties of this zzso AT contains two adjacent zzso zzso near the zzso site loop zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and two exposed zzso that border on the zzso binding region of AT zzso and zzso In forced zzso with hydrogen zzso the zzso at 314 and 315 were found to be the most susceptible to zzso but their zzso did not affect either zzso activity or zzso zzso zzso at positions 17 and 20 were significantly oxidized only at higher zzso of zzso at which point zzso affinity was zzso However at zzso zzso zzso activity was only marginally decreased for these highly oxidized samples of zzso zzso studies indicate that highly oxidized AT is less able to undergo the complete zzso change induced by zzso most probably due to zzso of zzso Since this does not occur in less zzso and presumably more zzso relevant, forms of AT such as those found in plasma zzso zzso does not appear to be a means of controlling AT zzso
