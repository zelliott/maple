The presence of zzso in zzso was tested using an zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western blots revealed the presence of a unique band of 80 zzso in total protein extracts and after zzso zzso of this 80 zzso protein appeared constant during the different zzso of the cell zzso In protein extracts from various other zzso this 80 zzso protein was detected only in the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso expression library with this zzso revealed a zzso coding for an zzso acid sequence without zzso in the zzso However, particular regions were zzso - a zzso repeat domain in the zzso part of the zzso - four zzso sequences associated with zzso sites, - a sequence with slight zzso to the rod tail of zzso zzso zzso II, zzso sequence with zzso to a human zzso motor zzso zzso performed on zzso zzso thin sections with a zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein showed zzso to be present both within the nucleus and in the zzso zzso was widespread in the zzso and more concentrated at the periphery of the permanently condensed zzso In the zzso zzso appeared in a zzso region close to the nucleus and in the zzso Potential functions of this novel protein are zzso
