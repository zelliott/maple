Investigation on the absence of zzso activity in zzso zzso has led to the cloning of a new zzso gene from this zzso zzso that exhibited unexpected zzso zzso zzso analysis shows zzso of zzso together with functional zzso of near zzso plants, such as zzso and zzso This group lies apart from that of previously zzso zzso which also includes two putative tobacco members identified in this zzso Moreover, strong expression of zzso is found in leaves, flowers, fruits and developing seeds of tobacco plants that is highly dependent on the development phase, with zzso activity being higher at stages of active tissue zzso This pattern is similar to that showed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, functional zzso using a zzso expression system revealed that the protein zzso by zzso lacks zzso activity, but instead it is able to zzso zzso zzso by introducing a double bond on the zzso These data indicate that zzso represent a novel zzso gene placed in a different evolutionary lineage to that of previously zzso zzso
