Ras is a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that zzso signals for growth and differentiation in zzso In zzso the importance of Ras in regulating growth is underscored by the observation that zzso zzso in zzso genes are found in many animal zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen of alfalfa which causes zzso zzso To investigate signaling pathways that regulate growth and development in this zzso a gene zzso a Ras zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso exhibited extensive zzso acid similarity to Ras proteins from higher and lower zzso A single zzso acid change resulting in zzso activated zzso induced cellular transformation of mouse zzso zzso zzso and tumor formation in zzso zzso In zzso zzso activated zzso induced abnormal zzso proliferation and defects in polarized growth, and significantly reduced differentiation in a zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso Ras is a functional growth regulator in both zzso and zzso and demonstrate that proper regulation of Ras is required for normal zzso growth and zzso
