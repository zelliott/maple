The complete sequence of zzso zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones is presented and, consequently, the first analysis of the banana zzso zzso One clone zzso is zzso zzso long with an overall zzso content of zzso Twelve putative zzso sequences were identified, representing a gene density of one per zzso zzso which is slightly less than that previously reported for zzso but similar to zzso One coding sequence was identified as a partial zzso zzso zzso zzso while the remaining sequences showed a similarity to predicted or hypothetical proteins identified in zzso sequence zzso A second zzso clone zzso is zzso zzso long with an overall zzso content of zzso Only seven putative coding regions were discovered, representing a gene density of only one gene per zzso zzso which is zzso lower than that of the first zzso One coding sequence showed significant zzso to the soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso A transition point between coding regions and repeated sequences was found at approximately 45 zzso separating the coding upstream zzso end from its downstream end that mainly contained zzso sequences and regions similar to known repetitive sequences of zzso zzso This gene organization resembles zzso zzso zzso where genes are clustered in zzso regions separated by zzso DNA containing abundant zzso
