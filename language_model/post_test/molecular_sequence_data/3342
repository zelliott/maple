Two putative zzso zzso and zzso carrying zzso for the zzso zzso and for resistance to zzso zzso and zzso were previously isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and determination of the complete sequence of zzso revealed that it is a class 1 zzso here renamed zzso with a backbone structure identical to that of zzso from zzso zzso contains two gene zzso zzso and zzso replacing the zzso cassette array in zzso Although zzso does not include any zzso zzso movement of zzso zzso targeted to a single location in the zzso zzso zzso has been reported previously zzso zzso Sinclair and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the target, which lies within the zzso site recognized by the zzso zzso of zzso was present, indicating that the mechanism of movement was zzso Together, these data indicate that class 1 zzso that are defective in zzso can move under appropriate zzso The zzso isolate studied was found to represent only the cassette array of zzso which had replaced the cassette array in the recipient zzso zzso probably by zzso zzso
