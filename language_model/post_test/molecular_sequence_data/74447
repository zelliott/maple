zzso zzso zzso channels set and stabilize resting membrane potential in rat small zzso root zzso zzso zzso However, whether zzso channels play the same role in other size zzso zzso is still zzso The aim of this study is to identify the existence and potential zzso functions of zzso channels in medium diameter zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were used to study the zzso zzso of native zzso zzso zzso was used to identify the existence of zzso and Slick zzso 

We report that zzso channels are required for zzso zzso zzso in medium sized rat zzso zzso In zzso patches, zzso channels represented 201 zzso zzso chord zzso and were activated by zzso zzso zzso half zzso effective concentration zzso 35 zzso in 160 zzso symmetrical zzso zzso Additionally, these zzso channels also represented zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the existence of zzso and Slick genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso completely blocked the zzso inward zzso zzso and the following outward currents which were thought to be zzso zzso The zzso was increased when zzso zzso was replaced by zzso 

We conclude that zzso and Slick zzso channels are required for zzso of medium diameter rat zzso zzso that regulate zzso action potential zzso
