The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso representing the minimal zzso sequence of zzso is a catalyst of factor zzso zzso zzso of SP, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso two close zzso of SP for zzso zzso zzso and human AT has been zzso The zzso zzso zzso for AT of the three species were in the range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for SP, zzso and zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso of their zzso zzso activities were determined in rats, rabbits and zzso An apparent correlation could be demonstrated between zzso of elimination and the corresponding zzso for AT in rats and rabbits whereas in zzso such a correlation was not zzso These results showed that despite zzso values ten times lower for zzso than for SP, both compounds showed close zzso parameters in zzso whereas the very low zzso value for zzso was associated with an extended terminal zzso in this zzso The predicted human zzso parameters were determined using an zzso model: an empirical approach based on the integration of data obtained in various animal species which allows the zzso to zzso The values obtained for the terminal zzso of SP, zzso and zzso were zzso 88 and zzso zzso zzso For SP, calculation by zzso correlated well with the values observed in zzso Since knowledge of duration of activity is pivotal for appropriate design of phase I clinical studies of zzso zzso zzso appears to be an interesting tool to predict the duration of action of such compounds in zzso
