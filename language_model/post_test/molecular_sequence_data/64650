zzso virus zzso C zzso is translated as a precursor zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into the signal zzso and immature zzso before zzso is zzso processed into its zzso zzso and zzso which form the mature zzso zzso The signal zzso of zzso comprises 58 zzso acids and contains two distinct zzso zzso Here, we show that each zzso domain alone can insert zzso into the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the native signal zzso only uses the zzso zzso domain for membrane zzso exhibiting a novel type of a zzso for signal peptides with an extended zzso zzso part, which is essential for zzso processing of zzso into zzso and zzso
