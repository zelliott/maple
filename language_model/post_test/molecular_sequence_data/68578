The genetic zzso leading to zzso zzso storage disease zzso has been determined in a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso activity in cultured skin zzso was reduced to approximately zzso of control zzso Plasma cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were elevated whereas zzso was reduced (19 zzso zzso were moderately elevated zzso zzso There were no clinical abnormalities with the exception of zzso Both parents have reduced zzso activity in white blood zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso from the zzso revealed a single slightly smaller zzso species in skin zzso as well as in zzso The mother of the patient and his older brother had two zzso zzso one of normal size and one of the same size as the zzso The father has a zzso zzso of normal size zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso deletion resulting in the loss of the zzso for zzso acids zzso Analysis of zzso DNA revealed that the 72 zzso represent an zzso indicating that the deletion in the zzso is caused by defective zzso zzso analysis of the patient's zzso DNA revealed a zzso substitution in the last zzso of the zzso zzso in one of his zzso The zzso zzso was shown to zzso with the truncated zzso in the pedigree, providing further evidence that the zzso substitution causes zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso even though he is not zzso for the zzso site zzso This can be only accounted for by assuming that he is a compound zzso with a zzso zzso inherited from his zzso In zzso the data presented provide evidence that deletion of the zzso for zzso acids zzso in the zzso zzso in combination with a zzso zzso cause the clinical expression of zzso in our zzso
