zzso zzso by the segment polarity gene zzso functions as a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested the presence of zzso network in the middle zzso of zzso zzso To test this, a zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso using zzso zzso designed based on the zzso regions of the zzso and zzso The cloned region zzso one complete and two incomplete zzso zzso repeat motifs and was highly zzso across zzso zzso Southern analysis suggested zzso arm to be a zzso zzso The expression of zzso arm zzso was first detected at stage 6 of zzso which reached maximum levels at stage zzso and was maintained until zzso zzso The zzso was expressed zzso in the zzso whereas the zzso protein was localized in a zzso reiterated striped pattern, in conformity with its predicted segment polarity zzso zzso arm was also expressed in the entire zzso and the transition from third to fourth and fifth zzso zzso was accompanied by an increase in the transcript zzso However, the zzso protein was predominantly localized to the middle zzso especially the middle and zzso zzso The zzso represented a novel expression domain for arm in zzso and the results were consistent with the existence of a zzso zzso network in the middle zzso
