To analyze molecular characteristics and zzso activity of bovine zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso gene was amplified from Chinese zzso cow using reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Based on the sequence of mature zzso and zzso preference in zzso coli, a modified mature zzso zzso was zzso cloned into zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso as a 26 zzso fusion protein after zzso zzso zzso The expressed mature zzso accounted for zzso of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso activity against both zzso coli and zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso diffusion zzso zzso zzso found that zzso treatment of zzso coli and zzso zzso could induce cell content zzso Taking together, zzso protein was successfully expressed in zzso coli and it has zzso activity against both zzso and negative bacteria and zzso in control of zzso zzso
