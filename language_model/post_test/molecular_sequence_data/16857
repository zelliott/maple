zzso are zzso relics of formerly functional genes and are thought to evolve zzso In some zzso however, the molecular evolutionary patterns are zzso of zzso evolving zzso exhibiting sequence zzso zzso bias, and other features associated with functional zzso zzso is a transcribed zzso first identified in the mouse zzso zzso The transcript of zzso can regulate the stability of the transcript of its zzso functional gene zzso Specifically, the zzso of zzso zzso increases significantly in the presence of zzso transcript, and targeted deletion of zzso is lethal in zzso Here, we show that zzso originated after the separation of zzso and zzso but before the divergence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The transcribed region of zzso exhibits rates of point and zzso zzso that are two to four times lower than those in the zzso region, suggesting that the transcribed region is under functional constraint and is not evolving zzso Although the transcript of zzso likely functions by its sequence similarity to zzso we find no evidence of gene conversion between them, indicating that functional conservation alone is sufficient to maintain their coordinated zzso A zzso model is proposed to explain how zzso was zzso into the regulatory system of zzso There are over 10,000 zzso in a typical zzso zzso and it is plausible that many functional but zzso zzso zzso Our results illustrate the potential of using evolutionary analysis to identify such zzso from zzso zzso
