To determine whether the persistent nature of zzso C infection is related to the emergence of zzso zzso driven by immune selection, we examined the sequence zzso in a portion of the zzso C virus zzso zzso 3 zzso gene of a patient infected over the course of more than 2 zzso By zzso amplification, zzso and sequencing, we observed several variable and zzso regions in the zzso segment of the zzso zzso All variable regions had higher ratios of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their locations were not essential to maintain the known function of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the regions that are critical for zzso zzso zzso activity were found to be zzso with lower zzso or lower ratios of zzso zzso and none except one of these regions was zzso within zzso zzso Our results are consistent with immune selection of viral zzso at the zzso and molecular levels that may enable zzso to evade host defenses over zzso zzso the zzso of sequence zzso revealed a star zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso sequence is zzso unlike zzso
