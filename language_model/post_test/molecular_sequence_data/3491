zzso complexes are the largest family of zzso zzso zzso and mediate the zzso of diverse regulatory and zzso zzso Here we present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex, which shows that zzso is an zzso protein that consists of a long stalk and a zzso zzso The zzso domain binds the zzso finger protein zzso through an zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso core that recruits the zzso zzso The long zzso which consists of three repeats of a novel zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso protein zzso complex at its zzso zzso serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the zzso zzso and zzso zzso holding them over 100 A zzso The structure suggests that zzso may contribute to zzso through the positioning of the zzso and the zzso zzso and this model is supported by zzso zzso designed to eliminate the rigidity of the zzso
