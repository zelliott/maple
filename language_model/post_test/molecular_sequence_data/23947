zzso is a zzso expressed orphan nuclear zzso which functions as a zzso zzso zzso and is expressed in zzso according to a robust zzso zzso We report here that two zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso 2, are generated through alternative promoter usage and that both show a zzso expression pattern in an in zzso system using zzso zzso Both promoter regions zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain several zzso DNA sequences which function as response elements for the core zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso stimulates the activity of both zzso and zzso promoters in transient zzso zzso by zzso This zzso was inhibited by the zzso of zzso a component of the negative limb of the zzso zzso zzso Critical zzso elements were mapped within both zzso This regulation is zzso in zzso since we found that the zzso zzso also regulates the zzso zzso zzso In line with these data zzso zzso expression was strongly impaired in the zzso of Clock zzso mice and in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso treated with Clock and zzso zzso zzso Together these data demonstrate that zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso distant zzso and suggest a role for zzso in the zzso clock zzso
