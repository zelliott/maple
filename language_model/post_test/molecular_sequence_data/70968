Previous zzso studies with zzso V alpha zzso zzso showed that V alpha zzso zzso and zzso expression was selectively favored in the zzso peripheral T cell zzso As this phenomenon was essentially independent of the zzso zzso it was suggested that zzso and zzso zzso exert a preference for recognition of class II zzso zzso The V alpha segment of the zzso zzso is suggested to have a primary role in shaping the T cell repertoire due to selection for class I or II molecules acting through the zzso determining regions zzso 1 alpha and zzso alpha zzso We have analyzed the repertoire of V alpha 11 family members expressed in zzso mice and have identified a new member of this family; zzso We show that, whereas zzso and zzso are more frequent in zzso cells, zzso and zzso are more frequent in zzso zzso The sequences in the zzso alpha and zzso alpha correlate with differential expression in zzso or zzso cells, a phenomenon that is also observed in zzso zzso With no apparent restriction in zzso J alpha usage or zzso alpha length in zzso these findings support the idea of V zzso T cell repertoire selection through preferential recognition of zzso class I or class II zzso
