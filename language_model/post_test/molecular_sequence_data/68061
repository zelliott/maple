In order to express human serum zzso protein zzso in zzso coli in a form that is structurally indistinguishable from the native zzso we placed the coding sequence of the zzso zzso next to that of the outer membrane protein A zzso signal sequence in the zzso zzso zzso However, this construct did not generate zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso When the DNA zzso consisting of the zzso site and the zzso fusion sequence was zzso downstream to the zzso promoter of zzso however, the zzso construct zzso gave low but zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso of the 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso zzso further improved the expression (by zzso zzso After charging with retinol, the zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibited all the three molecular recognition properties characteristic of zzso zzso it zzso with retinol, zzso and its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso with those of the serum protein revealed that while the affinity of zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso the zzso of the zzso is about zzso zzso This indicates that a major proportion of zzso isolated from serum, is incapable of interacting with the zzso
