zzso the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression is a central question in zzso With the availability of data from zzso technologies such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso we can begin to not only identify associations but to understand how genetic variations zzso the underlying zzso regulatory networks to induce differential gene zzso In this study, we describe a simple model of zzso regulation where the expression of a gene is completely characterized by two zzso the zzso and promoter affinities of active zzso zzso We devise a method that extends Network zzso Analysis zzso to determine how genetic variations in the form of single zzso zzso zzso zzso these two zzso zzso our method to a segregating population of zzso zzso we found statistically significant examples of zzso zzso located in regulatory hotspots that zzso zzso factor zzso and affinities for target promoters to cause global differential expression and zzso genetic variations that zzso the promoter affinities of zzso factors on a single gene to cause local differential zzso Although many genetic variations linked to gene expressions have been identified, it is not clear how they zzso the underlying regulatory networks that govern gene zzso Our work begins to fill this void by showing that many genetic variations affect the zzso of active zzso factors in a cell and their affinities for target zzso zzso the effects of these zzso can help us to paint a more complete picture of the complex landscape of zzso zzso The software package implementing the zzso discussed in this work is available as a zzso package upon zzso
