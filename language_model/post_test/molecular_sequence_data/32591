zzso zzso transmission requires accurate targeting of zzso zzso zzso zzso to synaptic zzso zzso However, the signals that regulate this zzso targeting are not well zzso Although previous studies suggest that the zzso of the zzso is required for its zzso zzso it is not clear whether this region is sufficient for this zzso Furthermore, a synaptic zzso motif zzso within this sequence remains to be zzso Here we use a zzso zzso zzso between an unrelated plasma membrane zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso to demonstrate the zzso of the zzso for targeting to synaptic zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso shows zzso and zzso with the zzso marker zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso demonstrates that a short, zzso zzso sequence is required and sufficient to direct this zzso zzso zzso analysis within this sequence suggests indistinguishable signals for both zzso and zzso zzso Using additional zzso as controls, we confirm the specificity of this region for zzso zzso zzso we suggest that the zzso motif is sufficient as a dual signal for both zzso and zzso targeting during zzso zzso
