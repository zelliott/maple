zzso muscle zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is reversed by zzso zzso zzso is also zzso upon stimulation at sites specific for zzso protein zzso zzso Because of these properties, zzso is thought to be involved in the regulation of smooth muscle zzso The molecular mechanism of the reversal of zzso is not well zzso We have expressed zzso fragments containing the sequence of the zzso region of human (from zzso to zzso and chicken (from zzso to zzso zzso as well as a zzso of the chicken zzso with a zzso point zzso By zzso with zzso followed by high-speed zzso with zzso and mass zzso we found that within the zzso region of zzso there are multiple zzso contact points forming two zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer between zzso attached to zzso zzso (the zzso zzso and the engineered zzso located in these two clusters revealed that the zzso region of zzso is zzso but it becomes more compact when bound to zzso zzso of zzso restores the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso When the zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso only one of the two zzso clusters zzso from zzso whereas the other remained zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that while both zzso and zzso zzso govern zzso function via a zzso change, the regulatory mechanisms are zzso
