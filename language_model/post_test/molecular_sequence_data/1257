Like the zzso zzso the zzso zzso genes are generated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso D and J regions, but unlike the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso event in zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the occurrence of spontaneous zzso in the constant regions of the zzso zzso beta chains of T zzso obtained from two babies who underwent in zzso transplantation because of severe combined zzso In view of the fact that in babies receiving transplants before birth, zzso zzso is consistently present, the zzso are likely to be under chronic zzso which may represent a relevant zzso stimulus for generating the observed zzso zzso zzso This possibility is supported by the finding that the highest number of zzso was identified in zzso expanded T zzso These results provide further support indicating that zzso of the zzso zzso genes may indeed occur, given the necessary zzso
