The zzso zzso protein genes from 24 zzso disease virus zzso zzso representing various zzso with different geographical and zzso origins were cloned and zzso The zzso region of the N protein to zzso 401 was highly zzso among zzso with several conservative zzso occurring that correlated with zzso zzso zzso of the N protein was detected in the zzso portion similar to what has been reported for other members of the zzso zzso acids previously identified as zzso or highly zzso in N proteins of other zzso were also present in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of N gene coding sequences among zzso zzso again demonstrated the existence of two major zzso One zzso contained viruses that included vaccine and virulent strains isolated in the USA prior to 1970 while a second zzso included vaccine and virulent viruses isolated zzso zzso of N protein zzso acid sequences among members of the zzso resulted in zzso and avian zzso 6 separating as a cluster distinct from the zzso zzso This provides further support for avian zzso being considered for their own zzso among the zzso
