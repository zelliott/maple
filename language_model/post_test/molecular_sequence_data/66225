The evolutionary history of plants in the southeast Tibetan zzso might be the most complicated around the world because of the area's extremely complex topography and climate induced by strong zzso activity in recent zzso In this research, we implemented a zzso study using zzso sequences zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso distributed in southwest China and adjacent areas including Myanmar zzso northeast India and northern zzso A total of zzso samples from 16 populations from the southeast Tibetan zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results revealed that zzso had 11 zzso for the two zzso zzso high genetic diversity zzso zzso zzso and high genetic differentiation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the component of zzso within zzso zzso was unexpectedly larger than the zzso component zzso which indicates that there is no justification for recognizing two species in zzso zzso of zzso genetic and geographical distances showed that zzso populations in the southeast Tibetan zzso may have suffered more habitat fragmentation than populations in the zzso zzso because of the zzso of the Tibetan zzso than populations in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 11 zzso formed two zzso three zzso and seven zzso zzso with eight zzso showing significant geographical zzso However, zzso 2-1 and 2-2 did not cluster together, although they are distributed in the same region zzso zzso and belong to the same species zzso zzso This led not only to zzso between zzso network and geographical distribution of zzso zzso but also to zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso and zzso may result from incomplete lineage sorting during the rapid and extreme zzso events of the Tibetan zzso The results reported here will no doubt provide new insights into the evolution of zzso on the Tibetan zzso and adjacent areas, and a historical framework for the conservation of zzso in this area, including zzso
