zzso zzso known to disrupt bacterial zzso are being developed as promising agents for therapeutic intervention against infectious zzso In the present study, we investigate zzso relationships in the bacterial membrane zzso zzso a zzso zzso For insight into which zzso acid zzso are functionally important, we zzso zzso zzso of zzso and assessed their ability to kill bacteria zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to neutralize zzso zzso zzso profiles were found to vary with the bacterial strain zzso zzso zzso and smaller zzso zzso zzso were crucial to optimal zzso activity against the zzso bacteria, whereas larger zzso and zzso zzso zzso optimal activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that both charge and zzso chain length mediate optimal zzso In terms of zzso zzso activity profiles were essentially the same against four species of zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and different for two others zzso zzso and zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso and, surprisingly, zzso zzso being functionally zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso demonstrated that an anti parallel zzso structure is the zzso zzso of zzso in terms of its zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso like the parent zzso do not lyse zzso zzso This research contributes to the development and design of novel zzso
