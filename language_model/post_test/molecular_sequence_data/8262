We have examined the possible linkage of zzso zzso zzso zzso to a reported putative zzso locus for bipolar illness zzso in 20 affected zzso Initially, zzso zzso of the gene were identified by zzso chain zzso stranded zzso zzso zzso and the gene was genetically mapped using both the Centre zzso du zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso used in this zzso We found that the zzso gene maps between zzso and zzso These zzso span a region of zzso 18 which, in a previous study zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso 1994) revealed a putative zzso locus to zzso through zzso methods of linkage zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was not zzso under zzso and zzso methods of zzso although affected zzso zzso method revealed an increase in zzso sharing among ill individuals, P zzso zzso Since this zzso is within a potential linkage region, zzso could be considered a candidate gene for zzso
