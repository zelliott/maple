Although recent claims implicating zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso have been zzso several reports suggest that another, zzso zzso zzso may be zzso We have developed and applied a novel zzso strategy to explore this zzso 

zzso zzso were used in a zzso format to amplify, from zzso zzso a region of the pol gene which is well zzso amongst all known zzso 

The zzso detection system was shown to be capable of detecting diverse zzso including human zzso human zzso zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso The zzso technique identified a novel zzso zzso designated zzso in the serum of an zzso patient and also in zzso zzso from zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso comparisons suggest that in the pol gene zzso is related zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso element zzso 

These findings lend further support to the concept of zzso involvement in zzso
