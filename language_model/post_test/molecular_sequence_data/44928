zzso transport into the nucleus is governed by the interaction of soluble transport factors with their import zzso and nuclear pore zzso Here, we identify a major distinct nuclear import pathway, zzso by a previously zzso zzso beta zzso zzso The zzso zzso for this zzso are zzso zzso which must be imported into the nucleus prior to assembly into zzso zzso binds directly to its transport zzso repeat zzso zzso and zzso We show that the related protein zzso is also a zzso and can functionally substitute for zzso both are capable of specifically directing a zzso nuclear zzso signal reporter to the nucleus in zzso
