We describe a simple, rapid technique for simultaneously zzso large numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso The technique makes use of a facile genetic selection performed in a strain of zzso zzso deleted for its zzso zzso zzso A zzso cloning zzso which carries a modified zzso gene lacking its leader sequence is used in conjunction with this zzso zzso zzso genes fused appropriately upstream of this defective zzso provide the necessary signals to restore zzso allowing the zzso to grow on zzso such as zzso or zzso This microbial growth selection zzso scanning zzso libraries containing millions of zzso enabling the wholesale identification of novel zzso proteins without the need for specific zzso The technique is similar to one previously described zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 93, zzso We describe results using a zzso library derived from activated human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Genes identified from this library zzso signal sequences of proteins of diverse structure, function, and cellular location such as zzso type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso and proteins found in zzso zzso In addition, a number of novel zzso proteins were identified, including a zzso and a novel zzso zzso Since signal sequences possess features zzso throughout evolution, the procedure can be used to isolate genes zzso zzso proteins from both zzso and zzso
