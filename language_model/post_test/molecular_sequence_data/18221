We determined the primary structure of a tobacco zzso zzso The zzso gene has a single large zzso and the zzso separates coding regions of the signal zzso and the mature zzso Analysis of the zzso region sequence revealed an 11 zzso zzso element with perfect zzso to the putative regulatory sequence of tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that levels of zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso increased in response to zzso and salicylic zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells is rapidly induced at late zzso growth zzso Members of the tobacco zzso gene families are classified into two zzso One of the zzso appeared to be zzso zzso
