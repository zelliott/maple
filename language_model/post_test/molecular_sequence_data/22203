Growth hormone zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso are key links to nutritional condition and growth regulation in zzso To understand the zzso mechanism of growth regulation in zzso we cloned the zzso for grouper zzso and zzso and examined their zzso expression during different nutritional zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso base pairs zzso long excluding the zzso zzso It contained untranslated regions of 85 and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso It has an open reading frame of zzso coding for a signal zzso of 17 zzso acids zzso and a mature hormone of zzso zzso Based on the zzso sequence of the mature hormone, grouper zzso shows higher sequence identity zzso to zzso of zzso than to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso which codes for zzso This is composed of zzso for the signal zzso zzso for the mature zzso zzso B, C, A, and D zzso and zzso for the E zzso zzso grouper zzso shows very high sequence identity to zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared to advanced groups of zzso such as chicken, zzso and human zzso Using DNA zzso specific for grouper zzso and zzso the changes in zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso were examined by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso level was observed after 2 weeks of food zzso and increased further after 3 and 4 weeks of zzso zzso zzso level in zzso did not change significantly during the same zzso zzso zzso zzso level decreased significantly starting after 1 week of zzso until the 4th zzso There was no significant change in zzso zzso levels in zzso One week of zzso can restore the zzso and zzso zzso back to its normal zzso zzso of food for zzso weeks also resulted in zzso of growth and decrease in condition zzso
