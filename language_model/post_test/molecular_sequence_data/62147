In zzso coli, the active transport of zzso is considered to be performed by two different systems, zzso and zzso However, a low level of zzso of zzso was observed in an aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso coli strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by this strain was significantly inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and transport studies revealed that the zzso system, which is a zzso zzso acid zzso consisting of two zzso binding zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso values for zzso in the zzso and zzso systems were determined to be 19 and 30 zzso M, zzso Competitive zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso was observed for the zzso system and, surprisingly, also for the zzso system, which has been assumed to be zzso specific on the basis of the results of binding studies with the zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso system is capable of transporting zzso and zzso with affinity comparable to that for zzso and that the zzso system is able to transport zzso with affinity lower than that seen with other zzso The zzso importance of the zzso system for zzso zzso was revealed in the growth of zzso zzso coli strains under various zzso
