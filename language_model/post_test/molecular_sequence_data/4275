To map the zzso of natural competence in the zzso zzso we used zzso to screen a number of zzso strains for the presence of the recently identified competence regulation zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This approach established that the zzso is present in strains belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups, but it was not detected in the other strains zzso zzso is induced in zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso With its unique primary structure, each zzso represents a separate zzso type zzso which is recognized by the zzso domain of the downstream zzso zzso zzso Thus, all bacteria induced to competence by a particular zzso belong to the same zzso In this study, we identified a number of new zzso by sequencing the genes zzso the zzso and its zzso from different zzso zzso We found that in several cases, these genes have a mosaic structure which must have arisen as the result of zzso between two distinct zzso zzso The observed mosaic blocks zzso the region zzso the zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso events have led to switches in zzso for the strains zzso This suggests a novel mechanism for the adaptation of naturally competent zzso to new environmental zzso
