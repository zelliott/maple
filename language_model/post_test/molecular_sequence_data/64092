zzso Collins syndrome zzso is characterized by an zzso in zzso development during early zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the gene zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are based on the previously reported 26 zzso of zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso (between zzso 6 and 7) and zzso zzso zzso (between zzso 16 and zzso zzso with zzso zzso are up to zzso more abundant than alternatively spliced zzso without zzso zzso but only minor zzso contain zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso sequence containing basic and zzso zzso similar to 10 other zzso of zzso Unlike the other zzso zzso zzso encodes a nuclear zzso signal zzso which does not, however, alter the zzso zzso of full-length zzso The discovery of zzso zzso and zzso is relevant to zzso analysis of the zzso gene in zzso patients, and to functional analysis of its gene zzso
