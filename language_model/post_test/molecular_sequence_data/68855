There is a mobile loop in the zzso zzso that contains the zzso signature sequence of class I zzso zzso As it has not been possible to determine the role of the mobile loop in zzso from X-ray zzso studies, we are investigating its importance by a series of zzso zzso and kinetic zzso Here we examine the role of zzso 234 zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso formation by zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso is the zzso zzso in the signature sequence and is either a zzso or zzso in eight of the ten class I zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso formation in the zzso zzso indicate that zzso the forward rate constant for the formation of zzso zzso is reduced zzso on zzso of zzso to zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso to zzso results in only a zzso decrease in zzso suggesting that the loss of the zzso group in the zzso zzso is responsible for its decreased reaction zzso zzso of the zzso group zzso the transition state for the formation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso The transition state is also zzso by zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso to zzso The effects of zzso of both zzso and zzso to zzso are less than zzso there is a zzso energy of zzso zzso in the transition zzso The effects of mutating zzso and zzso to zzso are also zzso in the zzso complex zzso energy zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
