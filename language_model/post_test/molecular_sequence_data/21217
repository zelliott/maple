Researchers conducting molecular zzso studies are frequently faced with the decision of what to do when weak branch support is obtained for key zzso of zzso As one solution, the researcher may choose to sequence additional zzso genes of appropriate evolutionary rate for the zzso in the zzso However, generating large, complete data zzso can become increasingly difficult as the number of characters zzso A few empirical studies have shown that zzso genes even for a subset of zzso can improve branch zzso However, because each study differs in the number of characters and zzso there is still a need for additional studies that examine whether incomplete sampling designs are likely to aid at increasing deep zzso zzso We target zzso a zzso zzso zzso group of zzso zzso to test whether the strategy of adding genes for a subset of zzso can improve branch support for deep zzso We initially zzso ten genes zzso zzso for 57 zzso that represent the major lineages of zzso plus zzso After finding that many deep zzso remained zzso supported, we zzso zzso additional genes zzso zzso for a zzso zzso We then compared results from different data sets to assess whether one sampling design can be favored over zzso The zzso data set zzso all genes and all zzso and three other data sets of different zzso and gene zzso design were analyzed with maximum zzso Each data set was subject to five different models and zzso schemes of zzso and synonymous zzso zzso significance of zzso was examined with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of genes led to high support for deep zzso especially when zzso changes were analyzed zzso zzso the number of zzso without an increase in number of characters led to lower zzso zzso increasing the number of characters without increasing the number of zzso generally increased zzso zzso More than three-quarters of zzso were supported with zzso values greater than zzso when all zzso and genes were zzso zzso zzso + zzso and zzso and zzso groups were strongly supported in nearly every zzso zzso group was well supported in some zzso but less so in zzso We find strong evidence for the exclusion of zzso from zzso zzso Davis and Robinson zzso Our results strongly support the zzso of a zzso zzso a group comprised of zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso when analyzed with zzso changes only, but this group was frequently split when synonymous and zzso zzso were analyzed zzso 

1) zzso or fully zzso a data set with more characters increased zzso support for particular deep zzso and this increase was dramatic when zzso changes were analyzed zzso Thus, the addition of sites that have low levels of zzso and compositional zzso can greatly improve zzso 2) zzso as defined by Davis and Robinson zzso clearly do not include zzso and changes to current zzso will be zzso 3) zzso were zzso in all analyses conducted, and nearly all species can be placed into one of six strongly supported zzso though relationships among these remain zzso 4) The difficulty in determining the zzso placement of zzso is probably attributable to compositional zzso at the third zzso zzso From our tests for compositional zzso and strong zzso values obtained when synonymous changes are zzso we tentatively conclude that zzso is closely related to zzso + zzso + zzso
