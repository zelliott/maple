zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, employs sophisticated means to survive in diverse zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated that acquisition of complement regulators factor H and factor zzso zzso zzso allows zzso to resist zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso express up to five distinct complement zzso surface proteins zzso that bind factor H and/or zzso In this study we have identified and characterized one of those zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso is distinct from the four previously identified factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The single copy of the gene zzso zzso zzso is located on the linear zzso zzso zzso is highly divergent from the factor zzso protein zzso and from members of the factor zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mapping analysis revealed that the factor zzso binding site is zzso and it was found that zzso zzso abrogate factor H and zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding site of both host complement regulators was mapped to the short consensus repeat 7 zzso zzso Factor H and zzso bound to zzso maintain zzso activity for factor zzso zzso zzso and accelerate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased resistance to zzso zzso The characterization of zzso now provides a complete picture of the three diverse complement zzso protein families of zzso zzso yielding new insights into the zzso of zzso zzso
