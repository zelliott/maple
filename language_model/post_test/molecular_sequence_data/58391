The zzso solution structure of an zzso zzso module of zzso zzso zzso has been determined and the kinetic and equilibrium folding zzso zzso Thirty molecular coordinates were calculated using a hybrid distance zzso zzso protocol based on zzso distance and 48 zzso zzso The atomic zzso zzso about the mean coordinate for the ensemble of structures is zzso zzso zzso A for backbone atoms and zzso zzso zzso A for all heavy zzso The protein has a zzso very similar to that of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and thus it falls into the I set of the zzso zzso The close agreement between the predicted and observed structures of zzso zzso demonstrates clearly that the I set profile can be applied in the structure prediction of zzso zzso of diverse modular zzso zzso studies reveal that the protein has relatively low zzso stability, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that the protein has considerable kinetic stability, the half life of the unfolding is greater than 40 minutes in the absence of zzso
