zzso DNA clones of zzso for sheep and goat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction method, and the complete zzso sequences of the coding and zzso regions of these zzso clones were zzso Comparative analysis using the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso clarified the zzso conservation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regions, confirming the results reported zzso During this study, we happened to identify an alternatively spliced zzso that completely lacks zzso 3, just adjacent to the zzso region of the sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso In the screening of other alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso derived from several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso of sheep and zzso only one kind of alternatively spliced zzso as described above was detected in sheep zzso Then, we constructed zzso coli expression systems for these two forms of zzso and analyzed their zzso zzso We found that the ability of the alternatively spliced zzso zzso protein to transfer electrons to zzso is completely abolished because zzso binding is zzso
