Members of the zzso box gene family play important roles in flower development from the early step of determining the identity of floral zzso to specifying the identity of floral organ zzso later in flower zzso We describe here the isolation and characterization of six additional members of this family, increasing the number of reported zzso zzso box genes to zzso All 11 members reported prior to this study are expressed in flowers, and the majority of them are floral zzso zzso expression analyses of the six genes reported here indicate that two zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso are zzso expressed in zzso but each has a distinct expression zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso with its onset at or before the zzso stage early in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all zzso expressed in root zzso and therefore represent the only characterized zzso box genes expressed in zzso zzso analyses showed that the two genes expressed in zzso are closely related to previously isolated zzso box zzso whereas the four genes showing zzso expression are more zzso zzso Data from this and previous studies indicate that in addition to their proven role in flower development, zzso box genes are likely to play roles in many other aspects of plant zzso
