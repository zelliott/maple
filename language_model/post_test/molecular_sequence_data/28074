We have previously reported that zzso T zzso a regulatory protein in muscle contraction, zzso a switch from the larger, zzso embryonic form to the smaller, basic adult form during rat heart development zzso zzso and Lin, zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the significance and the molecular mechanism of this zzso zzso zzso clones zzso rat cardiac zzso were obtained by screening a zzso library constructed from young rat cardiac zzso zzso using the expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be a full length clone containing 50 base pairs zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of coding zzso and 196 zzso plus zzso tail at the zzso zzso In the other zzso clone zzso the entire zzso sequence and most of the coding sequence were identical with that of zzso but an additional zzso insert was present in the coding region from zzso 18 to zzso This zzso sequence appeared to code for a zzso zzso highly enriched in zzso zzso acid zzso Thus, zzso might represent a clone zzso the embryonic zzso of rat cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that this region of the sequence is different in embryonic and adult zzso zzso These results suggest that both embryonic and adult zzso of rat cardiac zzso are generated from the same primary transcript by zzso regulated alternative zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and chicken cardiac zzso respectively, but less zzso zzso with the known skeletal zzso from human, zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, both the zzso and the zzso sequences of rat cardiac zzso zzso are completely different from those reported for rat skeletal zzso zzso suggesting that rat cardiac zzso is coded from a gene distinct from the rat skeletal zzso zzso
