zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with multiple zzso tails generated by alternative zzso zzso We report here the structural organization of the human zzso gene zzso The human zzso gene spanned more than 80 zzso and was composed of 10 zzso separated by nine zzso zzso 1 and the zzso zzso portion of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso the seven zzso zzso and 10 zzso acid zzso of the zzso tail, which are common to all zzso zzso The 3' zzso portion of zzso 2 zzso zzso or combinations of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso C zzso and formed their zzso regions by multiple fashions of alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, 6, and 10 contained zzso zzso The zzso gene formed nine distinct zzso zzso eight zzso zzso two of which were novel ones tentatively designated zzso and zzso The zzso initiation sites of the human zzso gene were mapped 227 to approximately 231 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The zzso zzso region contained a zzso zzso zzso a zzso box, and several zzso regulatory zzso The present study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso zzso
