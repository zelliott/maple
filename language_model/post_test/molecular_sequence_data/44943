zzso is transported into external zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a major regulator of zzso zzso has been shown to increase zzso zzso levels in zzso human colon zzso zzso To determine the molecular mechanisms of zzso regulation, zzso DNA containing the zzso region of the human zzso gene was isolated and a single start site of zzso in human zzso zzso cells was zzso Using zzso reporter plasmids containing zzso regions of the zzso zzso a segment of the zzso promoter which is necessary and sufficient for induction of zzso by zzso in zzso cells was zzso zzso the zzso promoter contains three motifs zzso to the zzso response element zzso two in the zzso region and one in zzso 1 of the zzso zzso The upstream zzso bind nuclear zzso which are zzso expressed by zzso cells, while the zzso 1 zzso binds zzso regulatory zzso zzso following stimulation with zzso Furthermore, induction of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso with induction of the zzso promoter by zzso It has previously been demonstrated that induction of zzso zzso by zzso requires de zzso protein zzso It is now shown that zzso is not detected in nuclear extracts from zzso cells zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso suggesting that de zzso synthesis of zzso is required for induction of zzso zzso by zzso
