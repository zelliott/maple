The zzso zzso which encodes zzso is known as a zzso gene for zzso and zzso hearing loss in zzso In the present study, zzso analysis of the zzso gene was performed in 62 Korean patients with zzso hearing zzso Two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified for the first time in the Korean zzso These zzso result in the substitution of zzso acids in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and show a zzso zzso which is a characteristic of zzso zzso in zzso dominant zzso hearing zzso Both zzso are located in highly zzso regions of zzso and were not found in 120 unrelated control subjects with normal zzso Based on this evidence, it is likely that both zzso are the zzso ones causing the hearing zzso This study provides useful information for the functional study of zzso hearing loss caused by zzso membrane zzso
