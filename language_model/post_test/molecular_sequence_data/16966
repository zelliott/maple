The recently identified human zzso zzso zzso a DNA zzso zzso specific for zzso damaged zzso shares structural features and reaction mechanism with the zzso coli DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso suggested it to have a zinc zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso motif present near the C zzso of zzso is distinct from the zinc finger motifs of zzso which are of the C4 zzso Here we show the presence of an zzso amount of zinc in zzso by zzso coupled plasma mass zzso Individual zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso candidate zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso by abolishing its DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also shown to lack bound zzso and a significant change in their secondary structure was revealed by CD zzso zzso zzso modeling revealed zzso of zzso to be a critical zzso in its zinc binding pocket, which is highly zzso throughout the zzso zzso A zzso zzso significantly reduced the activity of zzso We thereby conclude that the zinc finger motif in zzso is essential for its structural integrity and zzso zzso
