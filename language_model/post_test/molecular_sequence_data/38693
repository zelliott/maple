zzso that are zzso produced in developing zzso may play a substantial role in zzso To reveal the identity of these zzso comparative two-dimensional zzso gel zzso was performed on young zzso zzso mature zzso and bark of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso harvested at different times of the zzso The zzso zzso proteins were identified by zzso zzso For 17 of these proteins a putative function could be assigned based on similarity with previously characterized zzso and for 15 out of these corresponding expressed sequence tags zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso The identified zzso zzso defined by comparing the protein patterns from zzso and zzso were all involved in the zzso zzso two zzso A zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso five zzso zzso and one zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the biological function of the two zzso zzso proteins zzso and a zzso zzso remains zzso In addition, several zzso zzso were zzso two zzso two zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso one zzso and one zzso In comparison to the zzso zzso the zzso proteins were expressed at significant levels in the bark as zzso Also, several additional protein spots were detected for zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Our data show that for the study of zzso two-dimensional protein gel comparisons combined with systematic protein sequencing may yield information complementary to that from zzso sequencing zzso
