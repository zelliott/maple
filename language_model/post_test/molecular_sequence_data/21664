zzso zzso have been found to possess two characteristic zzso in their zzso the active zzso zzso and the inactive zzso zzso Recently, it has been very interesting to develop zzso zzso which target the zzso zzso and are more specific than the zzso zzso binding to the active zzso zzso However, solving crystal structures of zzso with the zzso zzso remains a challenge, and this seriously zzso the application of the zzso approaches in development of novel zzso zzso To overcome this zzso here we present a zzso approach for predicting the zzso inactive zzso using the zzso active structures, and develop related zzso selection protocols for the uses of the predicted zzso models in the binding pose prediction and virtual screening of zzso zzso With the zzso models, we predicted the binding poses for known zzso zzso and the results were found in good agreement with the X-ray crystal zzso We also tested the abilities of the zzso models to recognize their specific zzso zzso by screening a database of small zzso The zzso zzso under zzso results indicated that the predicted zzso models were selective toward their specific zzso zzso zzso the zzso approach and protocols presented in this study are very promising for the zzso design and screening of novel zzso zzso zzso
