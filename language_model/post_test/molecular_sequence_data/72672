The zzso protein zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso cell surface zzso known to bind and zzso several zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit binding of all known zzso zzso zzso studies have implicated distinct parts of zzso as specifically involved in zzso of binding of a multitude of zzso In the present paper we provide experimental evidence allowing assignment of elements of zzso internal sequence similarity in zzso noted previously zzso zzso zzso zzso & Schwartz, zzso zzso zzso Sites within the zzso protein important for regulating zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso to three structural zzso 1, 2 and 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso zzso shows that zzso 1 and 2 as separate zzso have similar secondary structures, consisting almost exclusively of zzso whereas domain 3 as a separate domain appears only to be marginally zzso zzso competition zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 and double zzso zzso and zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso for binding to zzso demonstrated zzso that functional integrity in single zzso is largely zzso and zzso that important zzso for the zzso of test zzso reside in the zzso regions of zzso 1 and zzso
