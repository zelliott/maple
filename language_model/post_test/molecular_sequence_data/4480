The zzso zzso gene from the zzso New Zealand isolate zzso was cloned and zzso Analysis of the gene revealed the presence of signature zzso indicating that strain zzso represents a new species of the zzso zzso Since the isolate zzso differed from other zzso in both its lower optimal zzso concentration and generally lower optimal temperature for growth, in its unusual zzso membrane zzso and in its sensitivity to zzso we propose that strain zzso represents a new species of zzso The proposed name is zzso zzso and the type strain is zzso zzso
