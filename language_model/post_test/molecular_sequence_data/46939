We have determined functional elements required for autonomous replication of the zzso zzso zzso that acts as an intrinsic zzso replication zzso Internal deletion analysis of a zzso zzso zzso showed three regions, I to III, to be required for autonomously replicating sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region I, composed of zzso of zzso on a DNA zzso resulted in a great reduction of zzso zzso zzso of region I with synthetic sequences showed that no specific sequence but rather repeats of three or more consecutive zzso or zzso without interruption by zzso or zzso are required for the zzso zzso The zzso region III contains 11 repeats of the zzso zzso while the zzso region II has short zzso or zzso stretches and a zzso and zzso region which enhances zzso zzso All three regions in zzso can be replaced with zzso zzso fragments without reduction of zzso zzso Although zzso regions in the zzso enhance zzso activity, all could be deleted when an zzso zzso zzso was added in place of region zzso Our results suggest that the origin activity of zzso zzso zzso depends on the number of zzso stretches, the extent of their zzso and presence of certain zzso zzso
