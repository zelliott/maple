zzso instability zzso is an indicator of DNA instability and is caused by abnormalities in DNA mismatch repair zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurs frequently in zzso cancer (in approximately zzso of zzso and zzso of gene zzso due to zzso may therefore have a major role in the mechanism of zzso zzso However, a responsible target gene has not been identified in zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed zzso in 11 zzso genes with zzso repeats susceptible to zzso in a coding region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 22 patients with zzso sporadic zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found most zzso at rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are common in zzso zzso cancer, occurred at rates of zzso and zzso respectively, which suggests that the zzso target gene may differ between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were correlated with reduced protein expression zzso and patients with these zzso had significantly more zzso in zzso repeats in other zzso genes compared to patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests the possibility of a novel cascade in zzso of zzso cancer in which zzso zzso zzso zzso increases gene instability, and leads to zzso of zzso in other zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that zzso zzso has an important role as an zzso target gene in sporadic zzso zzso
