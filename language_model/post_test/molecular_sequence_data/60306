The two light zzso zzso from rabbit smooth muscle were prepared as zzso proteins in zzso zzso These species which differed only by their zzso zzso showed the same circular zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of differential scanning zzso Their zzso properties were different at pH zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Their zzso formed at low pH differed by their aspect and zzso These data suggest a role for the zzso zzso of zzso heavy chains in the assembly of zzso molecules in filaments and consequently in the zzso of smooth zzso
