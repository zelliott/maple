The zzso neural cell zzso zzso zzso is known to exist in three zzso of different size, zzso zzso and zzso coded for by four transcripts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Since the differences between these zzso are due to alternative zzso in the coding region for the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso portion of zzso seemed to be shared by all three protein zzso Here we report that the coding region for zzso zzso of zzso also contains at least two sites of alternative zzso termed alpha and zzso Short additional sequences of 3, 18 and 30 zzso in length can be introduced at these sites, which are located in the zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the membrane attachment site and within the zzso domain IV, zzso Proof for at least eight different zzso has been found by sequencing and zzso zzso protection zzso of selected independent zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso If most combination of the zzso patterns identified so far in mouse brain occurred, 24 different zzso could be generated coding for 18 different zzso The shortest zzso found inserted at zzso site alpha consisted only of the zzso zzso raising questions about the mechanism of this particular zzso
