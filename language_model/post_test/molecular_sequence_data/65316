A zzso zzso zzso strain with slightly curved and straight zzso cells, strain zzso was isolated from coastal seawater (near zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso with zzso zzso as its closest relative zzso sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso was not associated with any known zzso in the family zzso The novel strain grew in the presence of zzso % sea zzso zzso at zzso degrees C and pH zzso The major cellular fatty acids consisted of zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso related zzso the fatty acid zzso : zzso was found only in strain zzso The DNA zzso content of the novel strain was zzso zzso According to zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene zzso fatty acid content and the zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species in a new zzso of the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
