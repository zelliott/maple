The rat diabetes zzso zzso zzso or zzso has been localized to zzso zzso to zzso are the genes zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso 1 zzso while zzso Y zzso is the closest zzso positioned zzso In human, the three genes are zzso on zzso but they are not on a zzso zzso zzso and zzso are localized to zzso while zzso is localized to zzso This raises the question whether the human zzso of zzso is linked to zzso or to zzso We present a comparative map of the zzso region in rat and human, assigning the gene to a zzso segment between zzso and zzso at zzso
