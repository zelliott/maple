Most genetic disruptions underlying human disease are zzso whereas gross zzso are rare with gross deletions being most frequently found zzso Similar observations have been made in primary zzso zzso such as zzso but for unknown reasons the zzso and zzso zzso gene defects frequently represent gross deletions ( approximately zzso We characterized the gross deletion zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso deletion zzso did not show involvement of zzso signal sequences or zzso switch zzso Instead, five zzso eight zzso and five unique zzso zzso were located in or near sequences derived from zzso elements zzso The zzso of four out of five disrupted zzso zzso were located in highly zzso regions, similar to zzso zzso deficiencies and zzso deletion zzso Nevertheless, these observations suggest a role for zzso in zzso gross zzso The identified gross deletion zzso were mostly located in TE zzso that were specifically overrepresented in the involved gene as compared to the average in the human zzso This concerned both long zzso and short zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a high total TE content zzso was associated with an increased frequency of gross zzso Both findings were further investigated and confirmed in a total set of 20 genes disrupted in human zzso Thus, to our knowledge for the first time, we provide evidence that a high TE content, irrespective of the type of element, results in the increased zzso of gross deletions as gene disruption underlying human zzso
