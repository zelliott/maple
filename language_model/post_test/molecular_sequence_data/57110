The structural protein zzso functions in red blood cells to link the zzso membrane skeleton to the plasma zzso zzso proteins are now known to occur in most cell types, and two distinct zzso genes have been identified zzso zzso and brain zzso We have characterized transcripts of the mouse zzso zzso gene by zzso cloning and DNA zzso zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso and a zzso transcript is found in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 13 additional mouse zzso has detected four novel zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso clones isolated from mouse zzso zzso and zzso libraries has identified zzso multiple zzso ends that indicate possible multiple zzso zzso alternative zzso sites that probably account for the zzso and zzso size difference; zzso a variety of small insertions and deletions that could produce transcripts (and ultimately zzso of nearly identical size, but different zzso and zzso clones with large deletions of coding sequence that account for the smaller transcripts seen in zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso
