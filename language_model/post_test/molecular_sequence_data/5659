Members of the zzso family of proteins are thought to play important roles in transforming growth factor beta zzso signal zzso In response to zzso specific zzso become zzso zzso form zzso with zzso and undergo nuclear zzso In addition, zzso of specific zzso combinations can mimic the zzso effect of zzso on both the zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso promoter and the reporter construct zzso Although these data suggest a role for zzso in regulating transcription, the precise nuclear function of these zzso zzso complexes remains largely zzso Here we show that in zzso cells zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso DNA binding complex that specifically recognizes a zzso binding site within zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso itself is a DNA binding protein which recognizes the same zzso Interestingly, zzso which eliminate the zzso DNA binding site do not interfere with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of adjacent zzso sites within this context eliminates both zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso sites, in isolation, are activated by zzso zzso and, to a certain extent, by zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso complex has at least two zzso nuclear zzso it forms a zzso yet transient zzso DNA binding complex, and it zzso zzso zzso zzso
