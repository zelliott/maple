Recently, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to accept both zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso To investigate the zzso mechanism of the zzso reduction of zzso zzso by zzso a series of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the most zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrates that it is the zzso zzso The second zzso zzso is not essential for zzso activity because the zzso zzso retained approximately zzso of the wild type zzso zzso Only one zzso of the zzso active site zzso is essential for zzso zzso indicating that zzso can act in this reaction either via a zzso or a zzso zzso The creation of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso confirms that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the two zzso involved in the zzso zzso The integration of a third zzso in position 152 of the zzso making it similar in sequence to the zzso human zzso zzso resulted in a protein that had no zzso activity with zzso but kept activity with zzso Based on these experimental results, a zzso mechanism is proposed to explain the zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso
