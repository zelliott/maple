Comparing zzso and zzso zzso variation is a promising approach to independently investigate paternal and maternal evolutionary histories in wild zzso zzso However, the difficulty of developing zzso genetic zzso because of its distinctive genetic architecture and the general low level of zzso observed on the Y zzso zzso usually an effective application of this zzso Here, we present a further method of the established Y zzso zzso anchored zzso sequences strategy to develop zzso markers by screening zzso of zzso region zzso genes for sequence zzso By applying zzso zzso using target zzso zzso adequate sequence information of several zzso in size can be zzso We applied this method in the snow zzso zzso zzso and obtained zzso zzso of zzso sequence data for nine males representing four populations in the Swiss zzso A total of 28 single zzso zzso four zzso zzso 1 zzso and one zzso zzso were identified in zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Based on this information, we developed a zzso zzso zzso and identified four different paternal lineages within one local snow zzso zzso The method we present is straightforward and as such will probably be suitable to detect adequate zzso diversity in a wide range of zzso zzso
