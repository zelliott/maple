The zzso zzso factors are key components of the zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso contains six functional zzso genes that are all expressed in cell suspension culture but show different patterns of expression during cell cycle zzso According to their structural and functional features, the six zzso can be divided into two distinct zzso although the three members of the first group, zzso zzso and zzso possess all the zzso zzso found in other plant and animal zzso the remaining zzso are novel zzso which reveal a zzso of the DNA binding domain but lack any other zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the first group are functional zzso factors that in association with zzso proteins can recognize specifically an zzso zzso and can zzso an zzso reporter gene in plant zzso In contrast, the zzso of the second group can bind specifically the zzso site without interacting with zzso partners but cannot activate gene expression and, instead, are able to inhibit zzso zzso of gene expression in zzso zzso These findings suggest distinctive roles for the plant zzso proteins and point to a complex concerted regulation of zzso gene expression in plant zzso
