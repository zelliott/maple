The zzso zzso zzso zzso domain is found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family members, including zzso protein 17 zzso However, the zzso acid sequence zzso extends beyond the zzso zzso We have termed this region the extended zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso coordinated membrane deformation with zzso zzso reorganization during zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso protein family members show weak zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso bound strongly to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the plasma membrane and zzso into narrow zzso Most zzso proteins possess an zzso domain that is known to bind to zzso and that recruited and activated neural zzso syndrome protein zzso at the plasma zzso zzso and/or zzso contributed to the formation of the protein complex, including zzso and zzso in the early stage of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso impaired zzso Our data indicate that zzso protein family members couple membrane deformation to zzso zzso reorganization in various cellular zzso
