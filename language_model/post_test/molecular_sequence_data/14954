zzso has zzso documented as a rich source for the supply of biologically active zzso This study characterizes the zzso effects of an egg white zzso hydrolysate zzso using a zzso mouse model of egg zzso Mice were orally zzso to egg white and subsequently zzso with zzso zzso results indicated significant reductions of both serum zzso and specific zzso zzso in zzso mice, accompanied by a repression of both zzso and zzso production in zzso cell zzso Similarly, real-time zzso analyses highlighted decreased zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso as well as lower ratios of zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, increased zzso expressions of zzso and zzso zzso were determined in zzso mice, suggesting induction of local regulatory zzso The presence of zzso zzso was proposed to be responsible for the zzso effects zzso
