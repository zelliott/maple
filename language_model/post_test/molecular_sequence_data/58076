A zzso in zzso zzso protocol was developed for the detection of dengue virus zzso in fixed zzso and zzso For this purpose a zzso was constructed from a 39 base zzso from the zzso protein coding region of the zzso which is zzso in the four dengue zzso The ability of this probe to specifically detect dengue zzso from each zzso was confirmed on brain sections from infected zzso zzso viral zzso was also detected in in zzso infected human primary zzso cells which release infectious virus without showing gross zzso zzso With clinical samples dengue viral zzso was detected in some preparations of white blood cells from dengue fever patients and in zzso autopsy sections following suspected death from dengue shock zzso For dengue samples of zzso zzso the sensitivity of the short probe was compared to that of an zzso mixture of long zzso zzso zzso from the envelope coding region of the four dengue zzso provided by zzso zzso zzso In those samples zzso sensitivity of the long probe mixture was greater and higher numbers of infected cells were zzso
