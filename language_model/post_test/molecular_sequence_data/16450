Six kinds of new zzso sequences zzso zzso to zzso a group II zzso zzso and an incomplete zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso of the extremely zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Of 19 zzso identified in the zzso zzso 7 were zzso indicating the occurrence of internal zzso of the zzso All zzso except zzso generated a zzso to zzso zzso of the target site zzso and these zzso carried zzso to zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso analysis revealed that four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were newly identified as belonging to separate IS families zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also characterized as new members of the zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso family as a new member, generated a zzso zzso of the target site sequence and carried complete zzso zzso Of the eight zzso sequences zzso identified in zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed a zzso gene zzso and two other zzso gene clusters were found in the zzso zzso Most of the zzso and the group II zzso widely distributed throughout the zzso were inserted in zzso regions, while two zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were inserted in the coding zzso
