We have identified an open reading frame with zzso to zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis let us propose that the zzso zzso has an zzso extension that functions as a transit zzso for import into the zzso Compared to zzso found in zzso zzso or found in bacteria that exhibit an zzso photosynthesis apparatus, zzso zzso has a zzso extension, which shows high zzso exclusively to the zzso of zzso zzso as well as to a hypothetical zzso in the zzso zzso This extension can be divided into a putative membrane anchor and a stretch of about 20 zzso acids with unknown function linking the common zzso fold to this zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli using a zzso zzso zzso system resulted in a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the iron form of zzso zzso suggest the existence of a native zzso iron zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of zzso zzso suggests the presence of a stable zzso fold similar to that of other zzso structures determined zzso
