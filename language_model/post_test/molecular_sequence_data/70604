The gene zzso a protective protein zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an important veterinary pathogen responsible for zzso in zzso and a variety of diseases in animals, was cloned and zzso The gene encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids plus a putative signal sequence of 29 zzso zzso resulting in a mature protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the gene product revealed a zzso region composed of nine tandem repeats of 20 zzso acids and a total sequence that is nearly identical to that of the zzso cell surface protein zzso of the zzso Because of this zzso the protein was designated zzso In this study, we examined whether the zzso protein could induce protective zzso and whether we could identify the region involved in protective zzso Both the mature zzso protein and its zzso repeat region, but not the zzso segment, were expressed in zzso coli and zzso as a zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the mature zzso protein passively protected mice from lethal challenge with a virulent zzso strain, zzso suggesting that protection is zzso by zzso zzso To determine which domain of the zzso protein is responsible for the observed protection, mice were actively zzso with either the mature zzso 1 protein or the zzso repeat region and then challenged with zzso The result showed that mice zzso with the mature zzso zzso but not the zzso repeat region, were protected, suggesting that the zzso zzso is located within the zzso two-thirds of the zzso zzso This was confirmed by passive zzso experiments in which the protective activity of rabbit zzso raised against mature zzso 1 zzso was not abolished by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso In addition, zzso specific for the zzso repeat region were unable to protect mice from lethal zzso These results show that the zzso two-thirds of the zzso zzso may constitute a good vaccine candidate against zzso
