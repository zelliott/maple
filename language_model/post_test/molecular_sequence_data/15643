The zzso layer of the zzso zzso cell wall is enriched with zzso zzso We have used a range of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are defective to varying degrees in cell wall protein zzso to investigate the role of the zzso layer of the zzso cell wall in zzso the zzso action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The degree of zzso loss, and zzso reduction in surface negative charge, from the series of zzso zzso correlated with reduced levels of zzso binding to the zzso In turn, the reduced zzso binding correlated with enhanced resistance to zzso To ascertain whether zzso binds to zzso charged zzso we studied the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a negative control, on the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso retarded the efficacy of zzso and this was attributed to the presence of zzso because addition of identical zzso of zzso zzso had little zzso effect on zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso with zzso zzso with zzso revealed that the zzso binds to the outer surface of the zzso cell, supporting our previous conclusion that the presence of exterior zzso is a major zzso of the zzso potency of zzso The binding of the zzso to the cell surface was a transient event that was followed by apparent zzso of zzso in the zzso or dissemination throughout the entire zzso The presence of zzso zzso clearly reduced the proportion of cells in the population that showed complete zzso zzso zzso that the binding and entry of the zzso into the zzso is significantly reduced due to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and reducing the amount of zzso able to bind to the surface zzso In conclusion, we present evidence that an zzso zzso similar to those employed by cells of the human immune system, has evolved to recognize molecular patterns on the surface of pathogens in order to maximize zzso
