zzso acid is zzso from zzso zzso in plant zzso An improved extraction procedure involving ammonium zzso zzso of membrane proteins from crude leaf zzso yielded a simple, quick method for determining tissue activities of zzso zzso zzso Total zzso zzso and zzso activity decreased with leaf zzso zzso zzso experiments using marker zzso demonstrated that zzso of the total zzso activity was located on the inner zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized a zzso zzso in extracts from the zzso zzso but failed to detect the equivalent zzso in zzso We demonstrate that isolated intact zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso electron transport zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso zzso zzso while cyanide inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso oxygen zzso was observed in isolated intact zzso This evidence suggests that zzso delivers electrons to the zzso electron transport chain between complexes III and zzso
