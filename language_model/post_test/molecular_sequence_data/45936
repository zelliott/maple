The zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso has a molecular weight of 66 zzso and was characterized with zzso point, pH and temperature optimum of zzso zzso and 70 degrees C, zzso In addition, the zzso energy is zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso The zzso was partially zzso on the protein level, and the complete zzso gene including its promoter (but excluding its zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso protein comprises zzso zzso acid zzso and shows zzso identity with the zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expression cloned into zzso zzso producing approximately zzso zzso It was concluded that alternative zzso zzso as it might occur in zzso zzso zzso is not responsible for the occurrence of different zzso zzso in zzso zzso
