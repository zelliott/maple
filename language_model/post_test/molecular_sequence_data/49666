Even though zzso are a common cause of human infection they can readily be isolated from a range of food sources, including various meat and dairy zzso An zzso strain, zzso which exhibits a broad spectrum of zzso against many zzso bacteria was recently isolated from an Irish raw milk zzso zzso of the zzso revealed that the strain exhibits zzso activity characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso and also produces a zzso zzso protein of 34 zzso The latter protein displayed cell wall zzso activity, as evidenced by zzso gels containing zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso protein yielded the sequence zzso which is 100 % identical to zzso A zzso zzso zzso a protein which shares 28 and 29 % identity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, zzso Indeed, amplification of zzso from zzso and sequencing revealed that the protein is 100 % identical to zzso zzso The zzso strain also contained the zzso associated with multiple zzso factors, including zzso zzso substance and multiple zzso zzso The linkage of this zzso zzso to other zzso factors in zzso may contribute to the competitiveness of zzso zzso when found in complex microbial environments such as food and the gastrointestinal zzso
