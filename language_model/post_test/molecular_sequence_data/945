zzso promote cellular invasion through a combination of activities, including zzso to an zzso zzso zzso which result in the generation of zzso signals that lead to changes in cell zzso Until now, there have been no data that identify a particular region of the zzso tail of zzso zzso as being responsible specifically for promoting the invasive activity of tumor zzso In this report, we show that zzso acids with the sequence zzso which are the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promote zzso invasion in a zzso zzso zzso zzso This same zzso zzso when expressed at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso was able to enhance zzso invasive and zzso activity of tumor cells in an zzso zzso Our results show that these 11 zzso zzso when expressed at the C zzso of the beta zzso are responsible for regulating the activity of zzso zzso zzso whereas the specific zzso involved in this cellular behavior is dependent on the context of the remainder of the beta zzso zzso
