The ability of a series of zzso zzso acids to act as zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by determining their ability to reduce the rate of zzso conversion of zzso or zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso The inclusion of a zzso zzso in a position zzso to the zzso group promoted the zzso zzso The zzso was found to be irreversible when an zzso double bond, alpha or beta to the zzso group, was present in the zzso the zzso appeared to be associated with a zzso interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso With zzso acid the zzso properties were manifest only in the presence of zzso of the zzso When zzso acid was used, the zzso was shown to be incorporated into protein that zzso with active zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso acid led to a decrease in the levels of zzso zzso activity and of zzso hormone, an zzso zzso produced by these zzso The zzso effects reached a maximum at approximately 15 h after which the zzso levels returned to the control values even though the concentration of zzso acid in the cells remained zzso The results indicate that a mechanism exists in these cells for regulation of zzso zzso
