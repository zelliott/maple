Delayed zzso zzso after transient global zzso is zzso at least in part, through the zzso of terminal zzso particularly zzso and the subsequent zzso degradation of critical cellular zzso zzso may be activated by the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso intrinsic zzso however, the precise role of these deduced zzso pathways in zzso zzso in zzso zzso remains zzso The authors cloned the zzso gene from the rat brain and investigated its potential role in zzso zzso zzso death in a rat model of transient global zzso zzso gene expression and zzso activity were extremely low in the adult brain, whereas they were zzso zzso in newborn rats, especially at zzso 12 weeks, a finding consistent with the theory of an essential role for zzso in zzso zzso during brain zzso After 15-minute transient global zzso zzso was zzso and zzso activated in the zzso zzso zzso at 8 to 72 hours of zzso The zzso profile of zzso zzso coincided with that of zzso c release and zzso zzso but preceded zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that there was enhanced formation of zzso complex in the zzso 8 and 24 hours after zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso infusion of the relatively specific zzso inhibitor zzso before zzso attenuated zzso activity and significantly enhanced zzso survival in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso activity had no significant effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso intrinsic zzso may be the primary mechanism responsible for the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
