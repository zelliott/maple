High molecular weight zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso in zzso rat zzso cells were reported previously from this zzso A zzso library prepared from Morris zzso zzso cells was screened with the zzso zzso against zzso zzso and a positive zzso clone zzso zzso was zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the zzso clone was identical to that of rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso against zzso zzso were shown to bind specifically to both rat plasma zzso and the fusion proteins zzso by zzso zzso A zzso zzso specific to rat plasma zzso also recognized high molecular weight zzso of zzso zzso in a pattern similar to that demonstrated with the zzso zzso These results suggest the existence of zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso preparations from rat zzso zzso The zzso proteins are localized in the zzso of zzso zzso of liver undergoing zzso
