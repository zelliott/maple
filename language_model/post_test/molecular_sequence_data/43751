A specific and sensitive test for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso small colony type zzso the zzso agent of contagious bovine zzso zzso was developed using two zzso zzso zzso The zzso reactions are based on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two specific zzso primer pairs were chosen to match those sequence segments of the zzso gene which differ most from the gene of the closely related zzso zzso of zzso zzso bovine group 7 zzso zzso The zzso zzso reacted with all of the 34 different strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso SC zzso and gave no amplification product with any of the closely related zzso tested, showing its high zzso In zzso zzso fluid zzso contaminated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso was able to detect as few as two viable cells per zzso using a simple zzso procedure prior to the amplification zzso With clinical samples, the sensitivity of the zzso zzso was about zzso higher than that of single zzso zzso performed under the same zzso The zzso was also successfully used to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso SC in zzso zzso fluid of zzso infected cattle and proved to be more sensitive than classical culture zzso
