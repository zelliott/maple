We have previously reported on zzso and characterization of an zzso zzso from culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso grown on zzso zzso The corresponding gene of zzso was cloned and characterized in this zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on cloning of the gene zzso zzso zzso This gene has no zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso containing a zzso signal of 28 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence to known proteins and zzso analysis indicated that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family zzso 2 and should be further classified into a new zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso when zzso zzso was grown on zzso suggesting that the expression of this gene may be regulated by a complex zzso in which multiple regulatory proteins are zzso Furthermore, zzso could be expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had the two molecular forms, zzso 105 and 100 zzso whose difference is caused by zzso Both of them had the same properties such as specific activity and zzso specificity and showed only the activity of zzso but not those of zzso zzso and zzso belonging to zzso
