We have mapped the cap site of the human zzso zzso by primer extension and zzso techniques and found that it is located at position zzso relative to the first zzso 97 bases upstream to the zzso end of the previously isolated zzso zzso Seven human zzso and non zzso cell lines and fresh liver cells were tested for human zzso zzso expression: the liver and the liver derived zzso cell line represent the major site of zzso zzso synthesis while the other cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show much lower zzso
