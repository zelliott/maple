The in zzso function of the 34 zzso zzso of zzso replication protein A zzso zzso by the zzso zzso has been studied by analyzing the effect of zzso depletion and by producing and characterizing zzso zzso zzso We show that unbalanced zzso of the zzso zzso does not affect cell growth and cell cycle progression until the level of zzso becomes zzso at which point cells arrest with a late zzso DNA zzso zzso is involved in DNA replication in zzso since zzso zzso zzso are defective in S phase progression and zzso zzso stability, and zzso zzso double zzso are zzso Moreover, when shifted to the restrictive temperature, about 50% of the zzso zzso cells rapidly die while zzso the S phase and the surviving cells arrest in late zzso at the zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso cells have a zzso and zzso zzso and are more sensitive to zzso and zzso than zzso zzso
