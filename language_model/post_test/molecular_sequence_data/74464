zzso acid zzso is a ubiquitous linear zzso in zzso and also is the capsule material of some zzso bacteria including group A and C zzso In bacteria, the zzso zzso occurs in an zzso zzso coding for zzso involved in the production of zzso zzso We report two new members of the has zzso family from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The has zzso of zzso zzso zzso in order, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas these genes are separated on two zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso start site and a zzso promoter were zzso identified 50 zzso upstream of zzso in zzso zzso We performed a zzso analysis of each of the has zzso genes to determine the evolutionary zzso of the zzso has zzso In contrast to other zzso and zzso zzso has zzso have undergone no zzso zzso lateral gene transfers in their construction, instead relying on zzso gene zzso for their zzso Specifically, zzso and zzso appear to have been duplicated into the zzso zzso has zzso from remotely located but zzso zzso most likely to improve zzso productivity by gene dosage in this zzso The zzso zzso appear to be ongoing events and the two has zzso of the zzso zzso subspecies represent two alternatives of the same gene zzso A scenario for the evolution of zzso has zzso is zzso
