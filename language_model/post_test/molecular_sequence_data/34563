Regular zzso surface layers zzso are widespread among zzso and probably represent the earliest cell wall zzso zzso genes have been found in approximately 400 different species of the zzso zzso bacteria and zzso zzso usually consist of a single zzso species with molecular masses ranging from about 40 to 200 zzso that form zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso The primary sequences of zzso zzso species exhibit some characteristic zzso Further adaptations to their specific environments occur by various zzso zzso such as linkage of zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups to the protein or by zzso zzso zzso zzso direct the zzso of the zzso to the underlying cell wall components and transport across the zzso zzso In addition to their zzso original role as protective coats in zzso and bacteria, they have adapted new functions, zzso as molecular zzso attachment sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
