To resolve the zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of India and determine the relationship between the Indian and western zzso zzso pools more precisely, a diverse subset of 75 zzso N lineages was chosen for complete sequencing from a collection of zzso zzso sequences sampled across zzso We identified five new zzso zzso zzso R8, zzso zzso and zzso and fully characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were previously described only by first zzso segment zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that the Indian zzso pool, even when restricted to zzso zzso harbors at least as many zzso lineages as the western zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the distribution of the earliest branches within zzso M, zzso and R across zzso and zzso provides additional evidence for a zzso scenario and a single migration route out of zzso
