zzso class switch zzso zzso deficiencies are rare primary zzso characterized by a lack of switched zzso zzso zzso or zzso production, zzso associated with abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may account for this zzso We previously described another zzso zzso zzso condition, characterized by a zzso in zzso downstream of the generation of zzso DNA breaks in switch zzso zzso zzso Further analysis performed with the cells of five affected patients showed that the zzso zzso zzso was associated with an abnormal formation of the S junctions characterized by zzso and with increased cell zzso In addition, zzso was skewed toward transitions at zzso zzso Overall, these findings suggest that a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso could be related to an zzso zzso in a DNA repair zzso involved in both zzso and zzso zzso
