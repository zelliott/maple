The plasma zzso zzso transfer protein zzso Mr zzso has a binding site for neutral zzso which can readily zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso Recently, a zzso zzso zzso was obtained which zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transfer activities of the zzso In this report, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been localized to a zzso zzso acid sequence at the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso fragments of zzso caused partial zzso zzso of zzso transfer and complete zzso of zzso transfer by the zzso Similarly, the zzso fragments inhibited zzso the binding of zzso to the zzso and abolished the binding of zzso to the zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso was also found to enhance the binding of zzso to plasma zzso and to zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer by blocking the zzso of zzso by zzso The zzso zzso may be in or near the neutral zzso binding zzso Occupancy of this site by zzso zzso fragments or by neutral zzso may result in a zzso change of zzso causing enhanced binding to zzso or zzso
