The zzso is a zzso complex which performs the crucial function of protein zzso Its role is to decode zzso within the cell and to zzso the corresponding zzso zzso protein zzso is located at the head of the small zzso zzso of the zzso and faces into the decoding zzso zzso is one of the primary zzso zzso proteins responsible for initiating the assembly of the head of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso has been shown to be the major protein component to zzso with zzso molecules bound at both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites of the zzso The zzso protein zzso clearly plays an important role in zzso zzso It was hoped that an zzso structure of this protein would aid our understanding of zzso zzso 

The structure of zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution using zzso anomalous zzso and zzso zzso The zzso consists of a zzso zzso core domain and a zzso arm extending from the zzso zzso The zzso core domain is composed of a pair of zzso zzso zzso the fold of the core is similar to that of a DNA architectural zzso zzso zzso basic and aromatic zzso are clustered on one face of the zzso zzso and create a zzso zzso contact zzso 

The molecular structure of zzso together with the results of previous zzso experiments, suggest how this zzso protein binds to the 3' major domain of zzso zzso and mediates the folding of zzso zzso to create the zzso decoding zzso
