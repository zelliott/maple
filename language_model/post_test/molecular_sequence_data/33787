In Japan and Korea, outbreaks of zzso have frequently occurred in Japanese flounder, zzso zzso zzso observations and small zzso zzso gene sequences have shown that the zzso agent of zzso in the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso differences between six Japanese zzso zzso zzso as an initial step toward developing an effective vaccine against the zzso Four Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso one spotted zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso and one zzso flounder, zzso zzso isolate zzso were subjected to zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were raised in rabbits and used for zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso showed that the six zzso could be divided into three groups, tentatively designated zzso I for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II for zzso and zzso III for zzso Western zzso results supported these three zzso with marked similarities in the zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were distinct from the zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were selected as representatives of each zzso were highly zzso to Japanese zzso by experimental zzso Based on these findings, we propose that there are at least three zzso zzso zzso in zzso
