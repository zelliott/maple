zzso III, the 8 zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso channel, was isolated and zzso from pea zzso for the purpose of studying its zzso zzso After zzso extraction and zzso zzso zzso zzso was accomplished using a zzso column which removes zzso and protein zzso The main components of protein contamination were two zzso proteins of near 4 zzso molecular mass, the zzso and zzso gene products associated with zzso and zzso reaction centers, zzso zzso zzso III as well as the zzso zzso soluble preparation were used in a zzso zzso zzso known to detect high affinity zzso sites in zzso zzso were separated with zzso and were transferred onto zzso zzso Treatment of the membrane with zzso in the presence of zzso excess of zzso and zzso excess zzso led to the labeling of only the 8 zzso zzso The zzso binding was inhibited after zzso zzso exposed zzso groups with a water soluble zzso plus a zzso after zzso of the zzso zzso or with a subsequent treatment with zzso zzso binding was maximum at pH zzso and was greatly decreased at zzso zzso zzso treatment (no zzso was zzso of zzso zzso which zzso the zzso located zzso decreased the zzso mobility of isolated zzso III but did not inhibit the zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso and probably the zzso group of the zzso III zzso zzso provide some of seven essential oxygen zzso normally required for defining a zzso site in zzso It is zzso but not yet established that an zzso form of zzso III zzso is essential for forming the zzso zzso Based on the accepted models for the hairpin zzso of the zzso III, it does seem clear that the zzso site can form on the zzso side of the membrane in the functional zzso zzso
