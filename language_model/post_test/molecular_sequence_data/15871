The zzso T cell zzso zzso family is organized in 4 gene clusters which zzso zzso joining and constant gene zzso Because the function of the zzso products is still zzso there is great interest in functional zzso of these zzso We searched for new variable zzso segments in the gamma zzso zzso The mapping and sequencing of a supposed new variable segment of a functionally spliced transcript from a zzso library of the zzso T cell clone zzso was zzso The results show that the supposed variable segment is a transcribed zzso zzso sequence zzso adjacent to the gamma zzso zzso With the gamma zzso sequence as a probe, strong signals could be shown in Northern analysis of the original T cell clone zzso and in other zzso T cell zzso Since all the T cell clones investigated did not show any zzso in the gamma zzso zzso the observed high zzso activity in this region could be involved functionally or as an intermediate in T cell zzso zzso
