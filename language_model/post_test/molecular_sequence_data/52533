A sequential zzso carrier of zzso peptides is zzso incorporating two zzso zzso in each repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso study, by zzso CD, and zzso transform zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso carrier displays a pronounced zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso carrier of the same approximately backbone zzso previously zzso One of the dominant zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso cellular zzso the zzso zzso was coupled to the zzso groups of the zzso zzso carrier and used as zzso zzso for detecting zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly specific for systemic lupus zzso while zzso are specific for mixed zzso tissue zzso The zzso zzso zzso was compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso provided that both zzso zzso possess the same amount of the zzso zzso The significance of the zzso positions along the zzso backbone of the carrier for a favorable zzso recognition of the anchored zzso is also zzso
