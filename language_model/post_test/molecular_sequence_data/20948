The zzso zzso that are exposed to zzso in the high-resolution X-ray structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 2, and zzso span a zzso range in zzso exchange rates which are predictable by zzso zzso zzso To facilitate analysis of zzso accessible zzso the zzso rate zzso for every backbone zzso of zzso were determined under near zzso zzso With the previously reported zzso molecular dynamics ensembles of zzso zzso codes zzso and zzso ) used as representations of the zzso zzso distribution, nearly all of the exchange rates for the highly exposed zzso were more accurately predicted than by use of the high-resolution X-ray zzso More zzso predictions for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso ensemble that become exposed to zzso in more than one but less than half of the 144 protein zzso in this ensemble were almost as zzso In marked contrast, the exchange rates for many of the analogous zzso in the residual zzso zzso zzso ensemble are substantially zzso as was particularly evident for the zzso 44 to zzso 48 segment which constitutes the primary interaction site for the zzso targeting zzso involved in zzso For both zzso zzso zzso zzso in this active site region having markedly elevated zzso zzso are represented at a population level that is zzso to zzso above what can exist in the zzso distribution of protein zzso These results indicate how a chemically consistent interpretation of zzso hydrogen exchange can provide insight into both the population and the detailed structure of transient protein zzso
