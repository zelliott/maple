zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels control zzso in a number of cell zzso BK channels are composed of alpha zzso which contain the zzso zzso and the zzso sensor zzso and form the zzso and often one of four types of beta zzso which zzso the channel in a zzso zzso beta 4 is expressed in zzso throughout the zzso zzso of beta 4 in mice causes zzso lobe zzso Compared with channels composed of alpha alone, channels composed of alpha and beta 4 activate and zzso more zzso We zzso the locations of the two beta 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso relative to the seven alpha TM zzso zzso from the extent of zzso bond formation between zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of these TM zzso We found that beta 4 zzso is close to alpha zzso and that beta 4 zzso is close to both alpha zzso and zzso At least at their zzso ends, zzso and zzso are not close to zzso In six of eight of the most highly zzso zzso pairs, four zzso from zzso to zzso and one each from zzso to zzso and zzso had small effects on the zzso and on the rates of zzso and zzso That zzso zzso caused only small functional zzso is consistent with the proximity of the zzso ends of zzso to zzso and of zzso to zzso and to zzso in both the open and closed zzso
