Using zzso biology, we have depicted the insulin zzso We have also analyzed the sequence alignment and sequence logos formation for both the insulin chain A and B for three groups zzso the zzso group, zzso group and fish zzso We have also analyzed zzso of insulin for the zzso zzso In accordance with that path zzso zzso for distance analysis, matching representation of zzso of the zzso and zzso between two zzso have been performed for both of the A and B chains of the zzso zzso Our results show that 12 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso for all groups and among them some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso This study shows a rapid method to calculate the zzso acid sequences in terms of evolutionary conservation rates as well as molecular zzso
