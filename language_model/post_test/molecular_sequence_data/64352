zzso zzso are used extensively in zzso to monitor and respond to changes in cellular and environmental zzso In zzso zzso zzso gene expression is controlled by a zzso zzso zzso that culminates in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a zzso checkpoint by zzso this zzso in response to DNA damage and replication zzso We show that zzso acts at the first step in the relay by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso which we determined using zzso comprises a zzso zzso A cluster of zzso zzso on one face of the hairpin mediates an interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This interaction zzso the zzso zzso and the two proteins form a stable zzso The data indicate that zzso forms a molecular zzso that zzso productive interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
