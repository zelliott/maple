The production of hydrogen zzso an end product of metabolism by the zzso bacteria zzso has been cited as a potential zzso agent in gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso from two gastrointestinal disease groups: zzso cancer zzso zzso and zzso individuals zzso zzso and two healthy control groups, elderly zzso zzso and young adults zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of zzso zzso diversity using the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as a molecular marker was also zzso zzso detected zzso zzso in all samples and no significant difference was observed for zzso zzso zzso with gene copy numbers of zzso zzso averaging at zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced numbers of zzso zzso were observed for zzso zzso zzso compared with both zzso and zzso groups zzso Diversity analysis indicated that a low zzso zzso diversity and the predominance of zzso zzso was a feature of both healthy and disease zzso In addition, a zzso gene sequence zzso related to a zzso zzso was also recovered, highlighting the importance of zzso techniques for zzso our understanding of the diversity of the human gastrointestinal zzso
