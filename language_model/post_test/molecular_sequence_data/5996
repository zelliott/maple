We studied mice expressing one of two H chain zzso Both zzso expressed the same zzso zzso zzso but differed in their constant zzso The zzso zzso efficiently induced tolerance and selected for a subset of zzso L chains that prevented zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso H chain allowed expression of a broad range of L zzso most of which yielded zzso zzso To deduce the features of L chains that affect DNA zzso we derived zzso from zzso zzso B cells from the two zzso lines and compared the V zzso sequences of zzso they zzso Identification of L chains with related sequences but different binding to zzso zzso and zzso allowed us to pinpoint L chain zzso that correlate with enhanced or reduced zzso zzso at the junction of V zzso 1 or V zzso 8 regions and J zzso 1, and zzso or zzso in zzso or zzso enhanced DNA zzso zzso charged zzso at the same positions were found to interfere with zzso Thus, we predict that appropriate zzso acids at these positions may form contacts with zzso The likely locations of contact zzso in the combining site were evaluated by inspection of previously determined zzso zzso Our results indicate that L chains in zzso zzso are able to zzso DNA binding and contribute contact sites for additional zzso on a complex zzso
