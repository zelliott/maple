The syndrome of zzso resistance to zzso D3 is due to defective function of the vitamin D zzso zzso The recent cloning and zzso sequence determination of the human zzso zzso gene have enabled a direct evaluation of the genetic basis for this disease in affected zzso In this report we employed zzso chain reaction techniques to amplify the gene zzso that zzso the zzso domain of the zzso from two zzso zzso patients whose receptors displayed defective binding to zzso zzso Although their families were apparently zzso each patient displayed an identical zzso point zzso within the third zzso a zzso that causes substitution of a zzso for an zzso zzso highly zzso within the entire steroid zzso zzso We introduced this base change into the normal zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso an expression zzso containing this zzso into cells, and examined the functional properties of the zzso zzso expression zzso The produced zzso zzso bound zzso D3 with normal zzso but displayed weak affinity for the nuclear fraction and for zzso zzso More importantly, the protein was inactive in promoting zzso in a zzso zzso employing a zzso zzso gene reporter fused zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso These results provide the genetic and functional basis for the zzso of zzso in this inherited zzso
