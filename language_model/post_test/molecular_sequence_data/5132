zzso zzso I and II zzso from zzso zzso zzso I and zzso II, zzso have quite different properties, and to zzso the zzso that determines the differences, zzso genes consisting of part zzso I and part zzso II were zzso When expressed under the control of the zzso promoter in zzso coli, several of the zzso zzso were zzso The only fully active zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso part of zzso II was exchanged for that of zzso I at a zzso restriction site and was zzso to zzso and zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso end of zzso II was replaced with that of zzso I, had very little activity and was only partially zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited higher activity than zzso zzso I and zzso II when zzso by the zzso a stimulation zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso specificity zzso for zzso rather than zzso and zzso capacity similar to zzso I, despite the fact that only the zzso zzso was from zzso I, suggesting that the zzso zzso may be involved in determining zzso specificity and zzso zzso In chain transfer experiments, zzso zzso zzso transferred more short chains (with a degree of zzso of around 6) in a fashion similar to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso transferred more long chains (with a degree of zzso of around zzso similar to zzso I, suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso may play a role in the size of zzso chain zzso This study challenges the notion that the zzso centers for branching zzso are exclusively located in the central portion of the zzso it suggests instead that the zzso and zzso zzso may also be involved in determining zzso zzso zzso capacity, and chain length zzso
