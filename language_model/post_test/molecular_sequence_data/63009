zzso plays critical roles in development of brain, spinal cord, neural zzso and skeletal zzso As a zzso zzso zzso factor, any direct functional role played by zzso during development is zzso through target gene zzso Thus, we have sought to identify genes targeted by zzso during embryonic development using an unbiased zzso zzso zzso cloning zzso to isolate zzso regions bound by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a library of zzso fragments bound by zzso has identified 34 candidate zzso target zzso with occupancy of a selection confirmed with independent zzso enrichment tests zzso To assess the capacity of zzso to regulate zzso from these zzso we have cloned alternate transcripts of zzso zzso significantly in their DNA binding zzso into expression zzso and zzso cultured cells with these zzso then analyzed target gene expression levels using zzso We show that zzso directly occupies sites within genes zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso the zzso zzso channel zzso and the signal zzso zzso zzso in zzso and regulates the zzso state of these genes in cultured zzso This analysis gives us greater insight into the direct functional role played by zzso during embryonic zzso
