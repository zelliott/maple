zzso disease virus zzso 1 zzso is an zzso zzso causing fatal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is characterized by the production of zzso transcripts zzso a family of zzso spliced zzso A cluster of four zzso zzso zzso was identified, but not formally zzso at the predicted zzso zzso zzso We established a zzso zzso library from zzso zzso cell line zzso We identified 22 highly variable zzso which were due to the extensive alternative zzso of a total of 14 zzso zzso zzso confirmed the predicted 3' end and allowed identification of the zzso end, 400 zzso upstream of the previously predicted zzso zzso The zzso share their zzso start site with the zzso transcript described zzso zzso the zzso to the first zzso zzso and identifying the zzso as the primary transcripts of the zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso as putative targets of zzso the third zzso of the cluster zzso zzso expressed zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso activity significantly when zzso elements from zzso or zzso were cloned in the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels were decreased by zzso when the zzso precursor was zzso with an zzso expression zzso Additionally, we showed a negative correlation between the decreased expression of zzso and an increase in zzso expression during virus zzso Our results suggest that, by targeting two zzso zzso zzso zzso produced from zzso transcripts may contribute to establish and/or maintain zzso
