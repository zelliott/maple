Development of the zzso zzso leads to the zzso of zzso zzso to form the zzso To identify cell surface proteins involved in this zzso step, changes in the zzso of zzso cell wall proteins were examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso synthesis of several zzso related zzso zzso and zzso zzso so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso sequences of zzso were obtained after zzso zzso These peptides were found in the predicted sequence of six closely related zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso represented about zzso of the zzso expressed zzso in zzso and are predicted to zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso There are no sequence zzso between zzso and previously identified zzso but they contain the zzso zzso motif found in zzso zzso zzso were observed on the zzso surface by zzso zzso They were also found in the host cell wall when zzso zzso attached to the root zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso level of zzso transcripts exhibited a drastic zzso when zzso zzso form the zzso These results suggest that zzso may form part of a zzso zzso system needed for zzso of zzso in zzso
