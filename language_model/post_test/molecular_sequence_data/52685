The gene zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein present abundantly in zzso of the zzso stages of zzso zzso was cloned and partially zzso A data base analysis showed sequence zzso to an earlier reported zzso zzso gene sequences reported in zzso and zzso The putative gene coding for zzso is of 500 zzso with an open reading frame of 117 zzso that included an zzso signal zzso sequence of 18 zzso There are three potential sites for zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso but no zzso sites in the zzso The coding region of zzso was amplified from zzso zzso cloned and expressed in bacterial and insect expression zzso The zzso zzso protein showed strong zzso with a zzso rabbit zzso zzso raised against the native zzso protein zzso zzso to earlier report, this gene appears to be not zzso zzso labeling studies suggested that zzso is zzso and is zzso by both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with human zzso a cell cycle regulatory zzso zzso was zzso However, when zzso with specific zzso no cross zzso was observed between zzso and human zzso
