zzso receptors zzso belong to the family of hormone receptors that are zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy provides effective treatment for prostate cancer until zzso arise that alter the zzso responsiveness of zzso In this study, structural models were developed for the functional zzso of human zzso by zzso modeling from crystal structures of closely related nuclear zzso These models were used to locate the sites of two frequently occurring zzso in prostate zzso The zzso that develop in zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso tumor cell lines are both located on zzso 11 that forms part of the zzso zzso However, the results suggest that these zzso influence zzso responsiveness by completely different zzso zzso 877 contacts the zzso directly, and substitution at this site alters the zzso of the binding zzso Thus, the zzso zzso apparently zzso the specificity of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is located down the zzso zzso projects away from the zzso pocket, and does not contact zzso The side chain of zzso zzso lies in a cavity between zzso 11 and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso in zzso tumors may affect a zzso change of zzso 12 and, thus, influence binding of zzso proteins and their regulatory effect on zzso zzso
