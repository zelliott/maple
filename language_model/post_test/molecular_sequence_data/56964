To study the zzso zzso acid zzso expression of receptors for insulin, zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso growth factor II zzso in human fetal zzso and zzso at 10, 15, 19, and 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to have zzso and zzso functions in the development of fetal zzso but receptors for these growth factors have never been studied in zzso zzso of the human female zzso 

zzso acid extracted from human fetal zzso zzso underwent reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The amplified complementary zzso acid zzso fragments were analyzed by gel zzso and restriction zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression consistent with both known forms of the insulin zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was observed in human fetal zzso and zzso at 10, 15, 19, and 22 zzso zzso The identity of the zzso amplified zzso and zzso DNA fragments were confirmed by zzso with the restriction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso for receptors for insulin, zzso and zzso are expressed in the fetal human female zzso zzso These receptors may have roles in fetal zzso tract zzso
