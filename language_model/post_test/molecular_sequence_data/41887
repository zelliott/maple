zzso amplification has enabled a variety of studies to be performed on the zzso zzso zzso Figure zzso displays a summary of the features of the zzso zzso zzso that have been described in this zzso The location of the zzso in the original zzso mouse is zzso as are the different spliced forms of the zzso zzso Also shown are the location of various zzso primer binding sites that were used to deduce the alternative zzso pattern of the zzso It is likely that conventional cloning efforts aimed at identifying the variety of zzso spliced forms would have taken years to perform, particularly since several of the zzso are expressed at levels significantly below the estimated zzso of total zzso that zzso represents in skeletal muscle zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso scanning methods for the identification of DNA sequence zzso Attempts to zzso and sequence the 14 zzso zzso to determine the zzso in separate strains of zzso mice are not likely to be time or cost zzso zzso enables these types of questions to be answered in a relatively short period of time, and similar types of analyses can be applied to human zzso zzso zzso of the transcript diversity displayed by the zzso gene will enable the role of these separate zzso to be zzso Despite considerable effort by a variety of laboratories over the last five years, the precise functional role played by zzso remains zzso and it can only be assumed that the separate zzso act to zzso the functional role of zzso in separate zzso or in response to differing zzso zzso zzso amplification of the zzso zzso has enabled the variable regions of the transcript to be zzso zzso et zzso zzso These clones have been used to reintroduce the variable regions into full-length zzso expression zzso which are currently being tested for functional activity through the generation of transgenic zzso zzso The transgenic mice can be easily identified through the zzso zzso described in this article, and the reverse zzso zzso zzso will enable a detailed analysis of the expression pattern of the introduced zzso It is hoped that such analyses will further attempts to determine the feasibility of using gene therapy as a treatment for zzso
