zzso acids are major and specific constituents of the cell envelope of zzso a zzso of bacterial species including several important human pathogens such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These zzso fatty acids are involved in the unusual architecture and zzso of the cell envelope of these zzso The zzso the zzso responsible for the final zzso step in zzso acid zzso has remained an zzso for zzso By in zzso analysis of various zzso zzso we identified a candidate zzso zzso that contains the four zzso zzso required for the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso were found in other zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain with a deletion in the zzso gene was shown to be deficient in zzso acid production whereas it was able to produce the fatty acids zzso This zzso strain displayed an altered cell envelope zzso We showed that the zzso gene was essential for the survival of zzso zzso A conditional zzso zzso zzso carrying its only copy of zzso on a zzso zzso exhibited zzso acid zzso zzso if grown at zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is the zzso a promising target for the development of new zzso drugs against zzso
