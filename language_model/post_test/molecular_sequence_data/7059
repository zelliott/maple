The zzso administration of zzso beta zzso zzso in rabbits caused a prompt rise of zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fluid followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta degrees zzso The zzso administration of an zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso derived from zzso 5, thereafter referred to as zzso zzso inhibited in a significant manner both the increase in zzso fluid zzso zzso and the zzso response induced by the zzso This zzso effect is probably due to interference by the zzso with zzso zzso zzso A control zzso zzso formed by the same zzso acids in a randomly shuffled sequence had no zzso These results show that, in addition to the zzso effect previously reported, the zzso zzso of zzso 5 zzso like zzso zzso zzso The research on zzso peptides may lead to the development of novel zzso and zzso zzso
