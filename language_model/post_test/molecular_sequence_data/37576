zzso proximity zzso zzso is a versatile homogeneous technique for radioactive zzso which eliminates the need for separation zzso In zzso zzso is incorporated into small zzso These zzso or zzso are constructed in such a way as to bind specific zzso If a radioactive zzso is bound to the zzso it is brought into close enough proximity that it can stimulate the zzso contained within to emit zzso Otherwise, the zzso zzso is too distant, the energy released is dissipated before reaching the zzso and these zzso are not zzso In this unit, the application of zzso technology to measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso domain binding to specific zzso zzso and zzso interactions are zzso Three other protocols discuss the application of zzso technology to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, protocols are given for preparation of zzso cells and cell zzso
