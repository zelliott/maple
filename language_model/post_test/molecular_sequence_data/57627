The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and found to be highly zzso to previously analyzed zzso zzso in zzso of the coding region and in zzso acid zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso was considerably zzso by heat zzso zzso extension analysis revealed that the zzso transcripts from cells under heat shock were initiated from the same promoter (a zzso zzso as transcripts from zzso cells, and no sequence zzso with the zzso coli heat shock promoters was zzso The DNA sequence downstream of the zzso start site contains an zzso repeat that has a strong similarity to other zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso bacteria (such as zzso and zzso This zzso region is thought to form a zzso structure and may play a role in gene regulation during heat zzso
