The zzso zzso zzso relaxation times for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with i zzso 2, 4, 6, and 8 were measured in zzso solution at 22 and 65 degrees C at a concentration zzso low enough to have removed zzso effects on the measured zzso zzso Separate zzso values were measured for each carbon in the zzso at the reducing end of the zzso in the zzso at the zzso end, and in the interior, zzso zzso zzso zzso data for the corresponding high zzso show that at 22 degrees C the relaxation times for the zzso of the interior zzso of the zzso have zzso to their high chain length zzso at about i zzso zzso This observation suggests that at room temperature zzso motions in the frequency domain effective for zzso zzso relaxation at a magnetic field strength of zzso T have a zzso of the order of 10 zzso The relaxation times characterizing the two ends of the chain are different, with longer zzso values for the zzso of the reducing end than for those of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the reducing end have shorter relaxation times than those of the corresponding zzso reducing zzso zzso of the interior zzso have zzso values shorter than the zzso of either type of terminal zzso For zzso of a given zzso there is no zzso difference between zzso of the Mi and zzso series at room zzso This observation is seemingly at odds with the great differences in the inherent zzso freedom of the zzso and zzso At elevated temperatures the zzso relaxation behavior of the two series of zzso measured by zzso zzso values show interesting differences, and in the case of the Mi series, structure develops in the chain length dependence of the zzso zzso
