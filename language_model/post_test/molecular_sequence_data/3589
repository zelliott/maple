The zzso zzso protein opens duplex DNA at the zzso coli origin of zzso leading to a series of initiation reactions in zzso When loaded on DNA, the DNA zzso III sliding clamp stimulates zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso thereby yielding zzso which is inactive for initiation in zzso This negative feedback regulation of zzso activity is proposed to play a crucial role in the replication zzso We here report that the zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso to zzso of bound zzso although its affinities for zzso and zzso remain zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso form, zzso zzso replication in zzso at a level similar to that seen for zzso zzso When expressed at moderate levels in zzso zzso zzso is predominantly in the zzso form, unlike the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which in zzso zzso zzso in a sliding zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso but not the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso These in zzso data support a crucial role for bound zzso in regulating the activity of zzso during zzso Based on a zzso modeling analysis, we suggest that the zzso zzso closely interacts with bound zzso
