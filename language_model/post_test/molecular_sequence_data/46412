zzso molecules generated by zzso protein engineering to bind the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso have in earlier studies proven to be promising zzso for zzso molecular imaging of zzso zzso acid extensions either at the zzso or zzso of these zzso zzso zzso have been successfully employed for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or other zzso which would be convenient for recovery purposes, should be avoided since they could zzso influence the tumor targeting efficacy and zzso properties of the zzso Using a new zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was isolated which bound a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso but not unrelated zzso zzso This suggests that the interacting area include the zzso surface of zzso This novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli, zzso and chemically coupled to a zzso zzso in order to generate an zzso affinity column, suitable for recovery of different zzso of zzso zzso zzso having a common binding surface for zzso Eight such zzso zzso zzso designed for future zzso zzso having different zzso zzso extensions aimed for zzso zzso were successfully produced and recovered in a single step to high purity using the zzso zzso zzso for the affinity zzso These results clearly suggest a potential for the development of zzso zzso zzso for efficient recovery of related zzso of a target protein that might have altered zzso properties, thus avoiding the cumbersome design of specific recovery schemes for each zzso of a target zzso
