We have developed a zzso display system that provides a means to select zzso of the zzso binding domain of zzso protein L that fold from large zzso zzso The premise underlying the selection scheme is that binding of protein L to zzso requires that the protein be properly zzso Using a combination of molecular biological and zzso methods, we show that this assumption is zzso First, the zzso selection procedure strongly selects against a point zzso in protein L that zzso folding but is not in the zzso binding zzso Second, zzso recovered from a library in which the first third of protein L was zzso are properly zzso The degree of sequence variation in the selected population is zzso the zzso have as many as nine zzso in the 14 zzso that were zzso The approach provides a selection for zzso that is potentially zzso to any small binding zzso
