zzso of zzso zzso that assemble from the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is one of the earliest zzso features of Alzheimer's zzso We have used zzso electron zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso and fiber X-ray zzso to examine the structure and properties of synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso protein of zzso zzso human and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cerebral zzso with zzso of the Dutch type zzso zzso with zzso As controls, we examined a reverse zzso sequence zzso and an extensively zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The assembly of these peptides was studied to understand the relationship between zzso zzso formation and zzso sequence and the effect of a naturally occurring point zzso of zzso The three zzso zzso acid differences between zzso and zzso had virtually no effect on the zzso or organization of the zzso formed by these zzso indicating that the lack of zzso deposits in zzso brain is not due directly to specific changes in its zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation, judged by zzso was zzso within the pH range 5-8 for zzso pH zzso for zzso and pH zzso for zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
