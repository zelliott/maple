There is growing evidence that certain components of complement systems in lower zzso are zzso in their modes of zzso through the classical or alternative zzso To better understand the evolution of the classical pathway, we have evaluated the degree of functional diversification of key components of the classical and alternative pathways in rainbow trout, an zzso relevant zzso zzso Trout C4 was zzso in two distinct forms zzso and zzso both exhibiting the presence of a zzso bond at the zzso and protein zzso zzso and zzso bound in a similar manner to trout zzso sheep zzso in the presence of zzso and both C4 molecules equally restored the classical zzso zzso activity of serum depleted of zzso and zzso zzso of activity was dependent on the presence of both zzso and zzso and on the presence of zzso bound to the sheep zzso A zzso zzso was shown to cleave specifically zzso zzso and zzso into zzso while failing to cleave trout zzso zzso The zzso preparation was unable to cleave trout factor zzso when added in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso Our results show a striking conservation of the mode of zzso of the classical zzso We also show that functional interchange between components of the classical and alternative zzso in zzso is more restricted than was zzso These data suggest that functional diversification between the two pathways must have occurred shortly after the gene zzso that gave rise to the earliest classical zzso zzso
