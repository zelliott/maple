In this study, we report the first cloning and characterization of a zzso acid zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso an insect in the zzso zzso The gene is zzso expressed at all stages of zzso development and in Schneider zzso Similar to the human zzso the gene encodes an zzso with dual zzso specificity that can use either zzso zzso or zzso zzso to generate zzso forms of both the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, respectively, when expressed in either bacterial or zzso expression zzso The identification of a functional zzso acid zzso in zzso indicates that insects have the zzso capability to produce zzso acids zzso Although zzso is widely distributed in organisms of the zzso zzso genetic evidence concerning the presence or absence of zzso acid metabolism in organisms of the zzso lineage has been zzso zzso searches of the zzso zzso identified putative zzso of other genes required for zzso of zzso
