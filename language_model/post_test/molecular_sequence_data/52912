zzso gene is often termed a zzso zzso gene because the zzso protein can suppress tumor cell invasion and zzso zzso of the zzso gene occurs in zzso solid tumors by both genetic and zzso zzso however, the role of zzso in zzso zzso is only now being zzso zzso expression is essential for zzso and zzso zzso yet expression is reduced or absent in zzso blast zzso This study examined the zzso zzso zzso and protein expression of the zzso gene in bone zzso and blood samples from normal donors and patients with zzso We found that all normal donor samples expressed zzso zzso whereas both samples of acute zzso leukemia and chronic zzso leukemia had a significant reduction or absence of zzso However, normal blast counterparts expressed only a low level of zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing was used to fully characterize the zzso patterns of the zzso island associated with the zzso gene promoter in those samples with matched zzso All of the normal control samples were essentially zzso however, 14 of 18 zzso of the leukemia samples had abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In fact both zzso of the zzso gene were often zzso We conclude the zzso gene is a common target for zzso in zzso zzso
