The mouse zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso and are critical structural components of the zzso The genes zzso mouse zzso are tightly clustered within 600 zzso of zzso 18, within a zzso zzso gene family also containing the three zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized a novel mouse zzso zzso highly zzso to both mouse and human zzso designated zzso 1 gamma zzso zzso gamma shares zzso zzso acid identity to the previously described mouse zzso now designated as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso identity to mouse zzso and 3, zzso The zzso gamma gene maps within the zzso gene zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of its zzso structure revealed a high level of evolutionary conservation with related family zzso In contrast to zzso alpha and zzso whose expression is largely restricted to the skin, zzso gamma is also expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, and liver, among other zzso and is thus more similar to zzso in its tissue zzso Interestingly, an zzso zzso gamma was not found in the human zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso gene cluster contracted during zzso zzso
