zzso are important molecules that serve as second zzso and bind to a complex array of proteins modulating their zzso location and zzso The zzso that metabolize zzso can in some cases serve to terminate the signaling actions of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso comprise a large protein family that zzso zzso from a variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We previously reported the identification of 15 putative zzso genes in zzso and have shown that zzso of the zzso gene can alter zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to zzso the zzso from zzso zzso zzso We have examined the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso which is one of the smallest predicted zzso found in any zzso We report here that the zzso gene encodes an active zzso zzso that can only zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso In addition to zzso known zzso of zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso from zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso gene is regulated by zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso suggesting a role for zzso action in these signal zzso zzso
