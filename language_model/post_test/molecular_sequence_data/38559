Two zzso were zzso by attaching zzso zzso zzso to a 20 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso acid to remove the zzso group and expose a zzso zzso The zzso group was coupled with zzso acid to produce zzso These were reacted with the zzso group of a zzso zzso zzso resulting in the formation of zzso in good yield that were characterized by zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso were able to bind to zzso DNA and form DNA zzso of approximately 110 zzso mean diameter with zzso potential of zzso zzso The resulting homogeneous zzso DNA zzso will be valuable as zzso zzso zzso
