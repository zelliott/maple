With the use of a sensitive sequence comparison algorithm, a zzso has been suggested between the primary structures of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso core protein and zzso disease virus zzso zzso coat zzso Since the zzso sequence is zzso to zzso zzso sequences with known three-dimensional architecture and since the zzso zzso sequence can be convincingly aligned with that from human zzso virus zzso it was possible to predict an zzso zzso fold for the zzso core zzso From zzso with the known environments of the zzso zzso zzso sequence spans could be predicted as likely candidates for zzso zzso These suggestions may be important for development of an AIDS zzso
