zzso are ubiquitous and abundant members of soil bacterial zzso However, an ecological understanding of this important zzso has remained elusive because its members have been difficult to culture and few molecular investigations have focused exclusively on this zzso We generated an unprecedented number of zzso DNA sequence data using zzso and clone libraries zzso and zzso zzso zzso to characterize the relative zzso diversity and composition of zzso communities across a range of soil zzso To gain insight into the ecological characteristics of zzso zzso we investigated the large-scale zzso patterns exhibited by zzso communities, and related soil and site characteristics to zzso community zzso zzso The 87 zzso analyzed by zzso contained more than zzso unique zzso zzso (at the zzso sequence similarity zzso One zzso belonging to zzso zzso 1, but not closely related to any cultured representatives, was particularly abundant, accounting for zzso of bacterial sequences and zzso of zzso zzso on average, across the zzso The abundance of zzso relative to other bacterial zzso was highly variable across the zzso zzso but correlated strongly with soil pH zzso zzso zzso pH was also the best predictor of zzso community zzso regardless of how the communities were zzso and the relative zzso of the dominant zzso zzso were readily zzso zzso communities were more zzso clustered as soil pH departed from neutrality, suggesting that pH is an effective habitat zzso restricting community membership to progressively more narrowly defined lineages as pH deviates from zzso
