Many proteins populate collapsed intermediate states during zzso In order to zzso the nature and importance of these species, we have mapped the structure of the zzso intermediate of the zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso changes it zzso as it folds to the native zzso zzso data for 29 zzso point zzso show that the intermediate contains three of the four zzso found in the native structure, packed around a specific zzso zzso However, the intermediate contains many non-native zzso as a result, zzso interactions become disrupted in the zzso transition state before the final zzso zzso onto the developing zzso The results of this study support a zzso mechanism of protein folding and explain why the zzso of zzso zzso The data also demonstrate that non-native interactions can play a significant role in zzso even for small proteins with simple zzso
