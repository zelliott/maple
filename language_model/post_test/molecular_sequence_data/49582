The zzso feature of zzso is enigmatic because spontaneous zzso often occurs in early stages of tumors of the patients under 1 year of age, while rapid growth usually occurs in the tumors of the patients over 1 year of zzso Such difference in the clinical behavior may be caused by the difference in the pattern of gene expression among the zzso of zzso To understand the molecular basis of zzso biology, we decided to identify the novel genes expressed zzso between favorable and zzso zzso The zzso zzso libraries were constructed from different zzso of zzso After random selection and DNA sequencing, the zzso expressed genes between favorable and zzso zzso were screened by reverse zzso The clinical significance of gene expression was evaluated based on the results of Northern zzso zzso We have identified a novel gene zzso zzso also cloned and termed by another group as zzso which encodes a new member of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso with unknown zzso We also cloned a zzso truncated zzso which is expressed only in zzso In primary zzso the alpha zzso is more zzso expressed than the beta zzso High levels of zzso expression were significantly correlated with a younger age zzso lower stages zzso high level of zzso expression zzso a single copy of zzso zzso and the tumors found by mass screening zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was significantly associated with poor prognosis zzso test: zzso The present results have shown that expression of zzso is a novel zzso marker of zzso Further analysis of the gene may also give a cue to the understanding of the role of zzso signaling in zzso and to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against aggressive zzso
