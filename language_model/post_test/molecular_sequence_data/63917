Genome sequencing has identified open reading frames which belong to the zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso family, but which are unlikely to be involved in transport zzso These frequently contain a pair of zzso binding zzso zzso with no associated zzso zzso The functions of many of these zzso proteins remain zzso In this zzso sequence analysis has been employed to zzso two families of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso to be zzso of zzso zzso are identified by two potential zzso zzso zzso in addition to two zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso are identified in numerous species which apparently lack an zzso zzso questioning the proposed function of these zzso The zzso proteins can be zzso into more than a dozen zzso zzso sequence similarity is shown between zzso zzso zzso which are involved in translation initiation and zzso and zzso zzso proteins which are implicated in resistance to zzso zzso of protein zzso
