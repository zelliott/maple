zzso disease, also known as juvenile zzso and zzso is an zzso zzso inherited disorder that results in zzso due to retinal zzso The zzso gene has been identified, but the function of the protein that this gene encodes is zzso zzso were conducted to determine where the zzso protein is localized in the mouse zzso zzso should provide a clue in evaluating potential functions of this zzso 

Using zzso zzso based on the reported human zzso zzso zzso the mouse zzso zzso sequence was determined from products of the reverse zzso chain reaction and 3' rapid amplification of zzso zzso A synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to an internal zzso region of the predicted zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso protein was used to zzso zzso The resulting zzso was used in zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso and in electron microscopic zzso labeling of mouse zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso labeled a single protein band of approximately 50 zzso on zzso of mouse zzso zzso No labeling was detected with zzso from human zzso The zzso specifically labeled zzso of zzso cells and inner retinal zzso Little labeling was observed in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of other cell types, including the retinal zzso zzso and zzso cells, were not zzso 

The retinal zzso protein appears to be localized almost exclusively in the zzso but was detected only in certain cell zzso zzso disease is characterized by massive zzso zzso of a small inner zzso membrane protein zzso c of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein suggests that it may play a role in the normal processing of zzso zzso
