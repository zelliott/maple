The question of which zzso V zzso genes are expressed was studied by sequencing 70 different zzso clones from a human zzso library and one clone from a fetal liver zzso The sequences were compared to a data base containing all zzso V zzso gene and zzso zzso In addition, 51 rearranged zzso V zzso zzso 170 zzso and 74 zzso proteins from the literature were assigned to specific zzso V zzso genes and included in the zzso Not all the known, potentially functional V zzso genes were found to be zzso while some genes with minor defects zzso The total number of expressed genes is smaller than zzso so far 21 zzso genes and 5 pairs of duplicated identical genes are known to be zzso The corresponding numbers for rearranged zzso V zzso genes and zzso proteins are 17 plus 4 and 7 plus 7, zzso A second aim of the study was to find out whether the expressed repertoire contains derivatives of zzso V zzso genes still missing in our data zzso no evidence for the existence of such genes was zzso Several zzso clones contained additional zzso between the V zzso and J zzso gene zzso which may be zzso zzso inserted by terminal zzso zzso or introduced by other zzso zzso gene conversion seems not to play a major role in creating the human zzso gene zzso Various aspects of the zzso of zzso genes are discussed and the formation of block zzso zzso the zzso of two or more adjacent zzso is stressed as a remarkable feature of the zzso
