zzso of the zzso nerve caused a rapid increase in zzso and zzso zzso that was followed about 2 zzso later by an increase in nerve growth factor zzso zzso To evaluate whether the initial increase in zzso zzso is zzso related to the subsequent increase in zzso zzso we performed experiments with zzso of transgenic mice carrying an zzso zzso gene under the control of a zzso zzso In primary cultures of these zzso zzso evoked a rapid increase in zzso zzso zzso followed immediately by an increase in zzso zzso zzso and with a slight delay by an increase in zzso zzso In zzso of zzso control mice, zzso had no effect on the zzso levels of the zzso zzso and zzso or of zzso Additional evidence for a zzso relationship between zzso induction and the subsequent increase in zzso zzso was obtained in zzso zzso zzso of zzso control mice were zzso with a zzso zzso expression zzso and a zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso resulted in increased activity of the zzso zzso zzso I footprint experiments demonstrated that a binding site for zzso factor zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso of the zzso gene was protected following zzso zzso That this protected zzso site indeed was functional in the regulation of zzso expression was verified by deletion experiments and by a point zzso in the corresponding zzso binding region in the zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso
