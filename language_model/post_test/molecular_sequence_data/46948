Independent but closely spaced DNA binding sites for zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso function in a number of zzso including the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso response zzso zzso In addition, a physical interaction of zzso with zzso based on zzso zzso interaction experiments, has been zzso Here we confirm the existence of an interaction between zzso and zzso both in zzso with zzso zzso and in zzso during transient zzso Using fragments of both zzso we mapped the interactive sites to the zzso region of zzso and to two regions in zzso within the zzso domain and in a portion of the DNA binding domain distant from DNA contact zzso In zzso experiments with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cooperated to yield zzso zzso zzso Point zzso of zzso within the interacting zzso blocked both physical interaction of zzso with zzso and their cooperation in zzso zzso directed by the zzso zzso While the zzso acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of zzso and zzso zzso are very similar, fragments of zzso failed to bind zzso in zzso Although zzso binds in zzso to the gamma zzso gene response zzso element in the zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate transcription, nor did zzso and zzso cooperate in driving zzso controlled by the zzso zzso
