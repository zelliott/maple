zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene of the zzso zzso system, plays an important role in regulating zzso metabolism in zzso coli zzso zzso One function involves zzso of zzso transport systems zzso zzso and with zzso zzso a zzso is required for zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Sun, zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 96, zzso With zzso membrane zzso containing the zzso zzso binding promoted by zzso exhibits an affinity zzso of approximately 1 zzso and a zzso of one mole of zzso per six zzso of zzso zzso Both the quantity of zzso bound and the sugar concentration required for zzso zzso binding zzso was measured for eight zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding are observed, and the zzso does not correlate with the affinity of zzso for zzso Furthermore, zzso does not correlate with sugar affinities for various zzso zzso zzso does not bind to a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is locked in an zzso facing zzso binds with increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and binds only zzso to two other zzso which appear to be predominantly in either an zzso or an inwardly facing zzso When the latter two zzso are combined, zzso zzso binding returns to near zzso zzso The findings suggest that binding of various zzso to zzso zzso results in a collection of unique zzso each of which presents a specific surface toward the inner face of the membrane that can interact to varying degrees with zzso
