We describe an approach for typing zzso of the zzso locus by using automated sequencing zzso The zzso 2 and zzso 3 zzso sequence of each zzso is determined directly from zzso DNA in two zzso In the first step, zzso zzso 2, zzso 2 and zzso 3 sequences are amplified with one or two primer pairs out of a panel of 5 primer pairs that describe all known zzso zzso In the second step, templates are zzso in zzso and 3' zzso in a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso to incorporate fluorescent zzso zzso into each new strand zzso zzso zzso of the labeled products is performed in an automated DNA zzso The derived sequences are aligned against reference sequences and each zzso position is evaluated for zzso to consensus zzso Using this strategy, the zzso zzso sequence is directly zzso with precision and zzso The automated sequencing strategy can be readily applied in the clinical laboratory as a practical tool for high resolution typing of zzso zzso
