The zzso function of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was investigated by the zzso sequence analysis, and zzso of its structural zzso called zzso The DNA region surrounding zzso was zzso and the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso was zzso zzso is preceded by a sequence that is very similar to a zzso recognition site and is followed by a putative zzso stop zzso suggesting that zzso forms a separate zzso Two open reading frames were identified upstream and downstream of zzso and were named zzso and zzso zzso The former may zzso a zzso having zzso similarity with zzso a zzso zzso found in enteric zzso zzso is zzso to zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was unsuccessful when attempted on the zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso could be achieved only in strains harboring an additional copy of zzso on a zzso zzso obtained in this way and carrying a zzso copy of zzso under the control of the zzso promoter grew only in zzso zzso thus demonstrating that zzso expression is required for zzso Nevertheless, such zzso were found to spontaneously zzso at a frequency of 5 zzso zzso to an apparent zzso zzso although they contained no zzso amount of zzso Taken together, the results indicate that zzso is required for an essential zzso function in zzso zzso and that this zzso dependence could be relieved by a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso
