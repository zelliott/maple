To study the structure and function of a zzso zzso gene zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing was performed on zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso in zzso zzso was used in zzso mapping of zzso zzso of zzso in various cancer cell lines and differential expression between normal zzso and zzso cancer tissue were examined by Northern zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was detected by in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso 

Open reading frame prediction showed that zzso encodes a zzso identical to the constant region of an zzso zzso in the zzso The gene was mapped to human zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cancer tissue and that in normal zzso was different zzso zzso zzso zzso was lowly expressed in zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso expression may be a potential genetic marker for the development of zzso zzso An zzso zzso gene can be expressed in zzso zzso
