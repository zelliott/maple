To facilitate the cloning of zzso zzso the product of which is a major lens protein present in the avian and zzso lenses, zzso chain reaction zzso was employed to amplify zzso constructed from the zzso of goose zzso The zzso product was then zzso into zzso zzso and transformed in zzso coli strain zzso zzso zzso from the positive clones were prepared for zzso sequencing by zzso zzso zzso zzso several clones containing zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso constructed a complete and zzso full-length reading frame of zzso base pairs covering a deduced protein sequence of 465 zzso acids excluding the universal zzso zzso The goose zzso shows 88, 94, 88 and zzso sequence identity to pigeon zzso duck delta 2, chicken delta 1 zzso and human zzso zzso zzso It is also shown that, similar to duck delta 2 and in contrast to pigeon delta zzso goose zzso appears to possess high zzso zzso activity despite the fact that a highly zzso structure is shared among these zzso zzso zzso analysis and comparison of these closely related zzso zzso with or without zzso activity should be of value in unraveling the intriguing evolutionary process leading to the development and evolution of active zzso zzso in the zzso of certain avian zzso
