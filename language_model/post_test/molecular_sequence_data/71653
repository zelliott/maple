A method was developed for effective isolation of zzso repeats from zzso zzso This method is based on the DNA zzso reaction, which is restricted with only two or three zzso zzso and primed by zzso zzso zzso zzso are then isolated by a zzso zzso zzso More than zzso of the clones from each library contained more than eight zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the characteristic zzso zzso sequences usually confronting various zzso repeats are not found in the vicinity of zzso repeats, suggesting that zzso repeats may have been generated through a mechanism different from that of other zzso zzso
