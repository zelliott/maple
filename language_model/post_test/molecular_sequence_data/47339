The zzso zzso calcium channels play a significant role in neurotransmitter zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso calcium channel functions as the primary zzso that forms the pore and contains the structural motifs that mediate the pharmacological and gating properties of the zzso We report on an zzso of the zzso zzso that is zzso expressed by the zzso zzso of the rat zzso This zzso contains a zzso acid cassette in the zzso site present in the zzso loop between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso tissue was used to show preferential expression of this zzso in regions of the brain containing zzso zzso and to a lesser extent in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was used to show expression of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The expression of two distinct zzso calcium channels containing these zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso may provide for zzso regulation of neurotransmitter zzso
