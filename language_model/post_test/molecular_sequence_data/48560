zzso zzso type 1 is an zzso dominant zzso zzso associated with the expansion of a zzso tract within the zzso zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that understanding the normal function of zzso in cellular processes is essential to decipher the zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso type zzso We found an alternative translation initiation zzso zzso in the zzso reading frame of human zzso starting 30 zzso downstream of the initiation zzso for zzso and ending at zzso zzso This novel overlapping open reading frame zzso encodes a zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso with a completely different zzso acid sequence from zzso We introduced a zzso tag zzso with zzso in zzso zzso and showed in cell culture the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in nuclear zzso In contrast, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso displays a zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and its nuclear zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso confirmed the expression of zzso in human zzso expressing zzso These results demonstrate that human zzso gene is a dual coding sequence and that zzso interacts with and controls the zzso distribution of zzso
