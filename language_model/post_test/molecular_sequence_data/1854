To gain insight into the regulation of zzso zzso we cloned a human zzso DNA zzso containing one of the two zzso promoters and consisting of zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso of zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso promoter region contains a zzso island but lacks an identifiable zzso element, zzso sequence and downstream promoter zzso This zzso DNA was able to direct zzso of a zzso reporter gene in a variety of human cell lines, and the minimal promoter was shown to be located zzso zzso Several putative zzso binding sites were identified, and we show that zzso can bind to the zzso minimal promoter and increase transcription, suggesting that the level of zzso expression may depend on the availability of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso from the minimal promoter by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that both zzso and zzso are associated with the zzso of the zzso promoter and that zzso of zzso in cell lines that allow zzso expression resulted in loss of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which this occurs does not involve binding of zzso to zzso zzso Instead, we show that zzso physically associates with zzso and that zzso complexes containing the two proteins could be detected in zzso Furthermore, zzso specifically interferes with binding of zzso to the zzso minimal promoter as well as to an zzso consensus zzso zzso analysis revealed that this interaction occurs through a region containing the zzso domain of zzso Together, these data reveal a functional role for the zzso domain in the action of zzso regulatory factors and suggest that the association of zzso with zzso represents a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of zzso target zzso
