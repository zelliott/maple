The zzso zzso was identified initially as a zzso of zzso zzso that had an elevated rate of zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso gene predicts that its product zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso against zzso protein detect a protein with mobility of 165 zzso Analysis of the primary and putative secondary structure of zzso suggests that it contains two central zzso regions flanked by an zzso zzso zzso zzso head and a zzso zzso zzso These analyses also indicate that zzso is an evolutionary zzso protein and is a member of a new family of proteins ubiquitous among zzso and zzso The zzso gene is essential for zzso Several zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso of zzso gene indicate that its product is involved in some aspects of nuclear zzso most likely in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso have a dramatic increase in zzso loss of a zzso zzso and zzso III, respectively, but have no increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso function in the zzso zzso zzso causes a dramatic zzso zzso zzso cells have a zzso in nuclear division as evidenced by the absence of zzso zzso This zzso of the zzso zzso is not zzso zzso Based upon the facts that zzso is a member of a ubiquitous family, and it is essential for zzso nuclear division, we propose that zzso and zzso proteins function in a fundamental aspect of zzso and zzso cell zzso
