zzso concentrate and store iron as a mineral in all zzso plant, and animal zzso The two zzso zzso types, H or M zzso and L zzso differ in rates of iron zzso and zzso and assemble in zzso to form zzso protein shells made up of 24 zzso zzso zzso ratios reflect cell specificity of H and L zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso species that is the initial reaction product of zzso in zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso and methane zzso zzso zzso has recently been zzso exploiting the relatively high zzso of the zzso intermediate in zzso zzso type zzso zzso with the M zzso The stability of the zzso reaction centers in zzso and zzso contrasts with the instability of zzso centers in zzso which are precursors of the zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso of zzso zzso M zzso in two crystal zzso zzso a zzso b zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso b zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso zzso The structural model for the zzso form was refined to a zzso R value of zzso zzso zzso zzso the two structures have an zzso of approximately zzso A for all C alpha zzso zzso with the previously determined crystal structure of zzso L zzso indicates that the zzso interface at the molecular twofold axes is most zzso which may relate to the presence of the zzso site in zzso zzso zzso Two metal zzso zzso from the zzso buffer were found in the zzso site of the M zzso zzso and interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, unique to the M zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso and zzso are a zzso of the second zzso site, resulting from single zzso zzso of zzso and His zzso and giving rise to zzso or zzso present in other zzso zzso zzso by additional single zzso zzso The observation of the zzso site in the zzso M zzso accounts for both the instability of the zzso zzso complexes in zzso compared to zzso and zzso and the observed kinetic zzso of the zzso zzso species in different zzso zzso zzso
