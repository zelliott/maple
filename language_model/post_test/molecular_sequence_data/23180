We report the identification of two distinct zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions to antagonize zzso signaling in many zzso zzso and much work has explored its role in early zzso zzso We have identified two zzso genes in the tropical clawed frog, zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is being explored for its potential as a genetic model system for early zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have distinct expression zzso in the early zzso with one overlapping domain in the anterior neural zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is very similar to that of zzso in zzso zzso with expression beginning in the zzso organizer region and continuing through zzso and zzso in the organizer and zzso Later, it is also expressed in the anterior neural zzso and subsequent zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso arches after neural tube zzso At the zzso stage expression is maintained in the zzso neural tube and is present in the zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso is much more similar to the expression of zzso in zzso zzso with expression in the zzso zzso and zzso but unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the heart by stage zzso This work presents the first example of a zzso with at least two zzso zzso
