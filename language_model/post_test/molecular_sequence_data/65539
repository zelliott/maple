zzso type 1 zzso is one of the most common zzso zzso dominant zzso Alternative zzso zzso the function of zzso the zzso gene product, by inserting the zzso zzso zzso into the region of zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso zzso This zzso which is predominantly skipped in zzso reduces the ability of zzso to regulate Ras by zzso Here, we report that the zzso Hu proteins control the production of the short protein zzso by suppressing inclusion of zzso zzso zzso while zzso proteins promote inclusion of this zzso We identify two binding sites for Hu zzso located upstream and downstream of the regulated zzso and provide zzso evidence that Hu proteins specifically block zzso definition by preventing binding of essential zzso zzso In zzso analyses using nuclear extracts show that at the downstream site, Hu proteins prevent binding of zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso site, while zzso increases zzso Hu proteins also decrease zzso binding at the 3' zzso site located upstream of zzso zzso In addition to providing the first zzso insight into zzso control of zzso zzso these studies establish a novel strategy zzso Hu proteins regulate zzso zzso
