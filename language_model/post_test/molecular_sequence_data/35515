zzso zzso is the zzso agent of Dutch zzso disease zzso It is an zzso zzso fungus that ranks as the third most devastating zzso pathogen in zzso The disease front has spread eastward and westward from the zzso in Ontario and Quebec and is threatening zzso populations across the zzso Numerous zzso strategies have been tried to eradicate this zzso but success has thus far been zzso An alternative approach might zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been reported to induce zzso in other zzso 

Using a modified single primer amplification technique zzso in combination with zzso walking, we have determined the zzso sequence of two zzso zzso zzso viruses from an zzso zzso isolate zzso collected from the disease front in zzso 

We propose that these zzso which we have named zzso and zzso based on sequence similarity to other zzso zzso are two new members of the zzso zzso in the family zzso 

The discovery of such zzso elements raises the potential for engineering these viruses to include other genetic zzso such as zzso or interfering zzso to create novel and highly specific biological zzso zzso zzso hosts could be infected with both the engineered zzso and a helper zzso zzso an zzso which would provide replication capacity for both zzso
