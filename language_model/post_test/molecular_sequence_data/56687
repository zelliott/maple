The effect of zzso zzso on zzso in a partially zzso defined zzso zzso has been studied under zzso conditions of unmodified zzso and over an extended time period, using the zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso zzso The sequence surrounding zzso has zzso zzso zzso and the initial zzso zzso have been zzso When the primer was zzso so that the first base to be zzso was zzso replication was virtually complete in approximately 5 zzso although the reaction appears zzso When zzso with a primer where zzso or zzso is paired opposite template zzso about half the molecules were zzso in the first 15 zzso and no significant further replication was seen over a zzso zzso When zzso was zzso by zzso replication was rapid with no zzso These data suggest that there can be two (or more) zzso of zzso In these studies the term zzso refers to zzso interfering with zzso whereas anti refers to those allowing such zzso Previous physical studies by others indicate that zzso and zzso of the zzso group relative to the zzso of zzso are zzso Here molecular zzso studies are zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso can be of similar energy in DNA, and, therefore, these two zzso may explain the two types of species observed during in zzso zzso An alternative explanation could be the possibility that the different species may manifest differential interactions of zzso with zzso zzso These results may provide a rationale for why zzso zzso in zzso have been reported to be lethal as well as zzso
