Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso harboring the zzso zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso gene were identified by screening about zzso X zzso zzso plaques from the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso had the zzso box on zzso zzso from the zzso initiation site zzso however, the zzso box was not zzso The primer extension and rapid amplification of zzso end showed that zzso is transcribed at a zzso extending 12 zzso upstream of the reported zzso zzso The sequences of zzso zzso region in zzso zzso size of human zzso showed zzso zzso with those of zzso however, no zzso was found in the zzso 1 and zzso 1 zzso Several consensus zzso including four zzso binding sites, were found in the zzso zzso region of this zzso The promoter activity was zzso by zzso the 3' or zzso deletion clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso The clone that contains the part of the first zzso sequences from zzso to zzso zzso showed the highest zzso activity in the transient zzso zzso High promoter activities were maintained until the zzso initiation site was zzso It is suggested that the sequences from zzso to zzso which contain three zzso zzso zzso box, and the zzso initiation site were necessary as a mean of for exerting the zzso promoter activity of zzso zzso
