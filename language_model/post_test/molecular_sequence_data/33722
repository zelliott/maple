The exchange rates for the zzso zzso of zzso the protein responsible for zzso zzso were measured under native conditions at different temperatures ranging from 301 to 315 zzso The pattern of protection factors within different regions of the protein zzso well with the zzso pattern of the deposited zzso Analysis of the exchange rates indicates the presence of mixed zzso and zzso zzso The measured parameters are consistent with a zzso model in which two competing zzso zzso global unfolding in the core region and partial openings of the native state, determine the observed exchange zzso These findings are analyzed with respect to the zzso properties of the zzso
