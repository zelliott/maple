zzso zzso zzso are zzso that cause disease on a wide range of important zzso Plant resistance zzso zzso which induce host zzso against powdery zzso zzso proteins that zzso zzso zzso molecules from the zzso in a zzso zzso To gain insight into how zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso associations between segregating zzso genes were zzso As a prerequisite to the isolation of zzso zzso two zzso were selected for further zzso zzso is located in a tightly linked cluster zzso zzso and zzso as well as up to five other zzso zzso The ratio between physical and genetic distance in the cluster ranged between zzso and 35 zzso The zzso locus was zzso by the previously isolated gene zzso and two zzso amplified zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso By contrast, zzso was not linked to other zzso genes in two zzso Bulk zzso analysis of over 100,000 zzso fragments yielded two zzso zzso and zzso mapping 10 and zzso from zzso respectively, thus zzso zzso on one zzso All markers obtained for zzso mapped zzso to it, indicating that the gene is located at the end of a zzso Three more zzso zzso were identified at the locus zzso among genes for zzso zzso and abundant repetitive zzso especially those zzso to the zzso class of zzso The zzso and close markers obtained will facilitate the isolation of zzso and zzso and provide useful tools for studies of the evolution of powdery zzso zzso in agriculture and zzso
