The human zzso protein contains zzso and zzso zzso which are responsible for its cell transforming zzso Despite its biomedical importance, the contribution of the zzso domain to zzso activity remains unclear and no three zzso structure is available to zzso Here we report the backbone and side chain zzso zzso and zzso resonance assignments of a 20 zzso construct zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso domain and an associated zzso from the zzso domain which is required for its stable zzso zzso assignment has been achieved using conventional triple resonance zzso zzso of all back bone zzso and more than zzso of side chain zzso have been successfully zzso The zzso zzso and zzso chemical shifts have been deposited in zzso with zzso number of zzso
