Human zzso initiation factor zzso contains the zzso protein zzso and several zzso factors zzso To investigate the structural organization and function of zzso we have cloned and expressed a DNA zzso the third largest human zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is an integral zzso that is associated with all zzso forms of zzso They further suggest that at least part of the zzso region lies on the surface of zzso while a zzso region containing zzso zzso repeats appears zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso indicate that zzso interacts strongly with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as well as a stable complex comprised of both zzso and zzso Apparently weaker interactions of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso also have been zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in stabilizing interactions of zzso especially the zzso zzso in zzso In addition, functional studies show that zzso zzso selectively inhibit zzso zzso from a zzso zzso promoter, relative to a zzso promoter, suggesting a possible core zzso function for zzso
