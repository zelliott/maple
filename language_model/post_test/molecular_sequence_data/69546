A novel zzso method for comparing molecular shapes by zzso the intersection of molecular zzso has been zzso This method provides a quantitative measure of the shape similarity by maximizing the intersection volume of molecular surfaces with a finite zzso a molecular zzso We report shape matching of a small zzso inhibitor zzso of zzso class proteins with the 56 zzso turkey zzso inhibitor zzso To match a large zzso inhibitor such as zzso with a small inhibitor or drug, we found that it is necessary to use a skin match rather than molecular zzso zzso based comparisons of zzso protein with zzso successfully found the alignment expected from comparison of their respective zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso complex and zzso zzso In the skin comparison of the zzso with the zzso zzso blind searching for skin matches involved zzso of the skin intersection from zzso starting positions randomly selected from a set of 500 points on the zzso van der zzso surface zzso zzso A of the zzso on the zzso binding loop (1 zzso The zzso center of mass was placed at these points and its orientation was zzso before zzso was zzso The best skin intersection, zzso A3, was found three times and zzso to the experimental zzso The next best skin intersection was zzso A3 giving a discrimination factor in this case of zzso zzso over the entire surface of the zzso protein did not identify any new matches with skin intersection greater than zzso zzso zzso the zzso with a zzso structure relaxed from its crystal zzso by molecular dynamics gives similar zzso
