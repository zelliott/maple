zzso receptors zzso by the zzso genes are implicated in zzso as well as in embryonic zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso domain, has been cloned and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was investigated by using three zzso specific zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso and a part of the coding zzso zzso corresponding to a part of the coding zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was the major transcript in fetal brain and adult zzso while the zzso zzso zzso was the major transcript in adult zzso and many cancer cell lines zzso The zzso zzso zzso alternatively zzso by the internal zzso signal in the coding region, is predicted to zzso the truncated zzso protein lacking the region through the second zzso loop to the zzso tail, and might function as the zzso zzso for zzso The zzso gene consists of 8 zzso and has been mapped to human zzso zzso
