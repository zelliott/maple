The role of zzso in regulating human zzso zzso replication and gene zzso remains zzso zzso functional zzso response elements exist in the major zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso suggesting a possible requirement for this zzso factor in zzso viral zzso Here we demonstrate by generating and analyzing zzso with zzso in the zzso that, although this region is essential for zzso growth, none of the four zzso response elements contained within the zzso are required for zzso gene expression or zzso replication in multiple cell zzso These data reveal the zzso of the regulatory network controlling the zzso zzso
