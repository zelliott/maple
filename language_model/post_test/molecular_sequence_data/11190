The zzso D3 1 zzso (1 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso D3 to 1 zzso zzso This zzso plays an important role in calcium zzso Here we report the molecular cloning of zzso and gene for human 1 zzso The zzso clone was obtained from a human kidney zzso library by zzso with a previously cloned rat zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 508 zzso acids that shows zzso sequence identity with the rat zzso A zzso zzso search revealed that 1 zzso shares a relatively high zzso with vitamin D3 zzso (about zzso zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso is most abundant in zzso The gene for human 1 zzso spans approximately 6 zzso is composed of nine zzso and is present as a single zzso This molecular cloning makes it possible to investigate the genetic mechanism of diseases related to calcium zzso including vitamin zzso zzso type zzso
