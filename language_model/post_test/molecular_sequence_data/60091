zzso is a zzso zzso protein and tumor zzso A novel protein termed zzso was identified through its ability to interact with a region of zzso required to inhibit zzso cell transformation by certain zzso zzso is a zzso form of zzso one of two related zzso proteins that are proposed to link zzso zzso zzso sites with the growth regulatory zzso zzso zzso lacks zzso and zzso zzso found in zzso but includes zzso zzso that are part of its central domain as well as additional sequences not found in zzso zzso with zzso requires the presence of the zzso region which is alternately spliced in muscle zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus and zzso Like zzso zzso can suppress zzso transformation and inhibit tumor cell zzso We suggest that zzso may link zzso to the zzso system in muscle and other cells, perhaps providing a mechanism to influence zzso signals which affect cell zzso
