zzso circular zzso zzso of bovine lung zzso zzso dependent protein zzso zzso show that the zzso contains zzso and zzso sheet zzso zzso of zzso zzso changes the zzso in a way consistent with the induction of zzso from random zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso indicates the presence of a strongly zzso segment with several features in common with the zzso zzso zzso We propose that this sequence may be the important part of the zzso domain of the zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of zzso has a strongly zzso CD spectrum, supporting the predicted secondary structure of this zzso zzso In contrast to the native zzso a structure reduced in zzso was found when a zzso active form of zzso which lacks zzso acids zzso was zzso
