The internal mobility of the protein zzso c is characterized with spectral density functions of the zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso relaxation at multiple field strengths zzso zzso and zzso zzso The spectral density functions, zzso describe the frequency spectrum of the zzso fluctuations of the zzso bond zzso zzso and zzso The spectral zzso approach zzso zzso zzso & Wagner, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 98, zzso zzso zzso zzso & Wagner, G zzso zzso 31, zzso permits the direct evaluation of zzso at the five zzso 0, omega zzso magnitude of omega H - magnitude of omega X, omega zzso and magnitude of omega H + magnitude of omega zzso The zzso relaxation zzso from three field strengths on zzso zzso c resulted in 18 relaxation rate zzso per zzso bond and 13 unique evaluations of each zzso spectral density zzso Dynamic zzso along the protein backbone is zzso most clearly in spectral density values at lower zzso zzso 100 zzso The effective value of zzso zzso is the most sensitive probe of dynamics as it is affected by both rapid internal motions and slow chemical exchange zzso Low zzso and zzso N) values are correlated with fast zzso zzso exchange zzso the zzso however, is not zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of omega H zzso magnitude of omega N) observed in the first applications of the zzso approach are now attributable to the high sensitivity of these values to small errors in the rate zzso These anomalies can be reduced by the use of a reduced zzso zzso The use of multiple field strengths allows the identification of slow exchange processes zzso as an increase of zzso with zzso field zzso
