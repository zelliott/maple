zzso zzso zzso comprises a clinically and genetically zzso group of diseases that zzso approximately zzso million people zzso zzso individuals suffer from a progressive zzso of the zzso eventually resulting in severe visual zzso To isolate candidate genes for zzso diseases, we cloned zzso specifically or zzso expressed in the human zzso and the retinal zzso zzso zzso through a novel suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso a region zzso a gene involved in a severe form of zzso zzso zzso characterized by a typical preservation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso encodes an zzso protein with 19 zzso zzso 3 zzso A zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso This protein is zzso to the zzso zzso protein crumbs zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In ten unrelated zzso patients with preserved zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso the ORF, five zzso zzso zzso and four compound zzso zzso in zzso The similarity to zzso suggests a role for zzso in zzso interaction and possibly in the maintenance of cell polarity in the zzso The distinct zzso abnormalities observed in zzso patients suggest that zzso zzso trigger a novel mechanism of zzso zzso
