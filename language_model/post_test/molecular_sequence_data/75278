zzso in the single-minded zzso gene of zzso result in the loss of the precursor cells giving rise to the zzso cells of the embryonic central nervous zzso We have examined the structure of the zzso product by sequencing a zzso zzso zzso and have also determined the zzso zzso of the protein and its zzso expression by zzso zzso with an zzso against a zzso fusion zzso The results indicate that zzso is a nuclear protein specifically expressed along the zzso of the zzso the same subset of cells that are missing in the zzso No similarity is observed between zzso and any known nuclear zzso but, surprisingly, it is similar to the zzso period zzso locus gene product, which controls the zzso of biological zzso
