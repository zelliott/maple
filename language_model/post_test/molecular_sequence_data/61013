zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess zzso identical zzso We built a zzso model of the zzso zzso on the basis of the known three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso which revealed an oval rim of the active site zzso with an additional hollow which could accept small charged zzso more firmly than the corresponding surface in the zzso zzso This difference at the peripheral site, together with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso suggests coordinate action of important zzso zzso that form the active site zzso during the zzso zzso It may also account for the zzso kinetic pattern which is characteristic for the insect zzso
