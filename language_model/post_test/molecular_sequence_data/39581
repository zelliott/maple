zzso of zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were isolated by utilizing the zzso sequence information and by screening of a zzso library, zzso Two reporter zzso zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso were placed under the control of the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso and transgenic roots of zzso zzso and expression patterns of the reporter genes were zzso in plants grown under different zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was only observed in root zzso and the levels of expression decreased with increasing zzso of zzso zzso activities in roots of transgenic plants decreased zzso when the plants were transferred from 10 zzso to 2 zzso zzso conditions, however, when the plants were transferred back to 10 zzso zzso conditions, zzso expression reversed back to the original zzso The two promoters lead to different expression patterns inside root zzso The zzso promoter leads to preferential expression in root zzso and zzso cells, while zzso promoter results in strong expression in the vascular cylinder in the center of zzso zzso deletion analyses revealed possible sequences involved in root specificity and zzso zzso The promoters are valuable tools for defined engineering of plants, particularly for zzso expression of zzso
