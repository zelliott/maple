We have investigated the biological role of the cellular counterpart of the zzso zzso gene by cloning the rat zzso zzso zzso and defining the regulation of an anterior zzso zzso transcript that is expressed in a sexually zzso zzso zzso of this transcript is zzso after zzso in females and can be subsequently zzso in adults by zzso zzso replacement studies have provided direct evidence that zzso zzso expression is suppressed by zzso zzso the zzso zzso anterior zzso transcript has shown that it zzso in size to the zzso zzso zzso which contains an open reading frame zzso that is truncated compared with the human zzso ORF, but encodes a previously defined zzso zzso zzso Thus, the cellular zzso gene is alternatively expressed in a manner that reflects the presence of zzso functionally active zzso zzso sequences in zzso Using a novel zzso raised against a zzso zzso we have also demonstrated zzso and zzso expression of a nuclear 41 zzso anterior zzso protein and have localized this protein to a major population of growth hormone zzso zzso By zzso the expression and defining the zzso regulation of zzso our studies have provided novel insights into the zzso gene that will facilitate an understanding of both zzso and zzso zzso
