The zzso coli zzso host factor I zzso protein is thought to function in zzso regulation by modulating the function of small regulatory zzso zzso also interferes with zzso binding on zzso coli zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso also interacts with zzso In this study, we have used stimulation of group I zzso zzso in zzso and a modified in zzso zzso zzso to determine whether zzso acts as an zzso zzso zzso was able to rescue an zzso zzso zzso in a zzso defective T4 zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso affects the accessibility of the zzso start zzso as well as other bases within the zzso site, explaining its negative effect on zzso zzso We also show that the zzso structural changes in zzso zzso are maintained after zzso zzso of the zzso which zzso zzso as an zzso zzso
