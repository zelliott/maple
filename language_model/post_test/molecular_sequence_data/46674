zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that forms part of the wingless signaling zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso in zzso and in cell zzso zzso is the principal component of the paired zzso filaments zzso found in the brains of patients with zzso disease, and zzso is zzso zzso is therefore one of the candidate zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso regulated by zzso on zzso 9 and positively regulated by zzso on zzso zzso However, since zzso of zzso by zzso leads to increased activity in the absence of any zzso zzso activity may also be regulated at the zzso zzso Indeed, increased zzso protein levels are found in zzso disease zzso and zzso is found associated with zzso in zzso zzso To understand how zzso activity may be regulated at the zzso level, we have isolated the human zzso zzso The zzso promoter does not contain a conventional zzso box although several other zzso factor binding sites were zzso A putative zzso start site was mapped by zzso zzso zzso of various zzso promoter zzso reporter genes into both zzso cells and zzso zzso cells revealed that the zzso promoter is more active in zzso zzso Such zzso studies involving promoter deletion zzso revealed that a negative zzso response element may be present at position zzso to zzso and an zzso sequence at position zzso to zzso zzso binding sites were also present within the zzso zzso has recently been shown to interact with the zzso disease zzso precursor protein binding protein zzso The significance of these results with respect to zzso disease zzso are zzso
