zzso in zzso cause zzso syndrome, a zzso disorder of zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our objective was to zzso the extent that variation in zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso zzso we scanned each of its 64 internal zzso in a set of pooled human brain zzso zzso zzso zzso is generally efficient as we identified only two zzso Neither zzso has previously been reported in the literature and include zzso an zzso which contains a cryptic 105 zzso zzso between zzso 54 and 55 zzso and zzso an zzso which contains a cryptic 62 zzso zzso between zzso 57 and 58 zzso We compared zzso and zzso expression in multiple human zzso including adult skeletal muscle and brain, as well as fetal skeletal muscle, brain, liver, zzso zzso skin, and zzso zzso represents zzso of zzso zzso and varies in a zzso and zzso zzso In adult brain, zzso represented zzso zzso zzso of total zzso zzso In contrast, zzso represented zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in skeletal zzso In fetal zzso the zzso proportion was highest in brain zzso and low elsewhere, zzso skin, zzso and lung zzso In zzso a significant proportion of zzso is expressed as zzso and this proportion varies in a zzso and zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso creates a premature stop zzso that mimics zzso zzso the protein zzso by zzso is likely to not be zzso These results suggest that altered zzso may zzso disease severity, regulate zzso zzso and potentially represent a therapeutic zzso
