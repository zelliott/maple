The highly organized pattern of gene expression leading to the determination of cellular zzso derives from the interplay between genetic and zzso zzso This is zzso in part by distinctive DNA sequence motifs present in the regulatory regions of various genes and the zzso factors with which they zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is determined in part by the selective expression of novel zzso of several genes involved in zzso zzso To characterize the mechanisms determining zzso zzso zzso we have been studying the zzso marker protein zzso the first zzso protein to be isolated and zzso The zzso and spatial expression of zzso is regulated zzso and is highly restricted to mature zzso zzso in all zzso from zzso to zzso Identification of the specific elements responsible for regulating the expression of the zzso gene will zzso the mechanisms leading to the determination of zzso zzso zzso Using a combined in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso approach, we have identified and characterized a novel zzso motif that binds an zzso tissue nuclear zzso that we designate zzso We propose that zzso is a novel zzso zzso factor responsible for directing the expression of genes containing the zzso motif in zzso zzso Thus it may play a role in regulating the expression of genes associated with zzso turnover and zzso zzso
