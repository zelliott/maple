The zzso zzso zzso contains 18 sequences related to zzso core zzso zzso The six most closely related genes zzso and zzso to zzso likely zzso active zzso because are all transcribed and do not appear to be zzso zzso divergence and the gene structures are both zzso with a common zzso at the time of radiation from zzso that underwent three rounds of zzso and, most recently, a tandem zzso zzso alignments with zzso zzso do not indicate whether the zzso zzso are core 2, 4, or zzso or novel, but do clearly demonstrate the secondary structure characteristics of zzso The six zzso have essentially zzso expression patterns, unrelated by tissue type or cell zzso The extent varies zzso zzso is expressed only in two zzso cells, whereas zzso is broadly expressed in diverse cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed during zzso zzso and zzso appear to be restricted to embryonic or early zzso zzso The zzso interpretation of the expression pattern and sequence data is that the zzso activities are similar but with zzso zzso zzso zzso of three of the genes were generated without causing gross zzso in zzso zzso zzso interference experiments also failed to induce defects in the four genes zzso Nevertheless, the zzso has evolved six zzso core 2 zzso zzso and we zzso that these arose in response to selection pressures to which zzso zzso is not zzso subjected in the zzso
