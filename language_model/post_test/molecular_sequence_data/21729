The human zzso zzso regulator 1 zzso with its modular architecture of 3 WW and 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso through these WW and zzso zzso and interacts with zzso zzso factors such as zzso U2 zzso and zzso WW zzso are known as the smallest naturally zzso zzso triple zzso zzso zzso structures, generally spanning only about 40 zzso zzso The first and second WW zzso of zzso have been zzso and successfully applied for screening cellular zzso In contrast, until now zzso of the third WW domain yielded zzso with an undefined fold, proving useless for screening cellular zzso This implied that sequence zzso to include the zzso structure is crucial for proper zzso We describe here the chemical synthesis of such a 53 zzso long zzso zzso domain sequence that exhibits the typical WW domain fold, and could be useful for discovering cellular zzso
