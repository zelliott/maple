The first part of this work presents the sequence of the first 20 zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso the major surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso A synthetic zzso zzso zzso has been prepared both in linear form and as a multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice and rats with the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso that recognize both the linear zzso and the zzso construct in zzso and zzso in Western blots of zzso zzso zzso Because these zzso are negative in zzso zzso with whole zzso it seems that zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso although recognizing the zzso structure, are unable to recognize the native zzso However, the protective effect of both zzso has then been studied in mice and nude zzso Whereas zzso of mice with the zzso zzso does not zzso any protection against oral infection with 1200 zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso within 11 zzso zzso of mice zzso with the zzso construct survived up to 75 days after zzso zzso rats were passively transferred with 5 zzso zzso T zzso from zzso zzso zzso Fischer rats before infection with 5 zzso zzso zzso strain zzso They survived up to 40 days after infection and raised an intense zzso zzso response against zzso whereas nude rats transferred with control zzso died within 21 zzso This shows that zzso with zzso zzso zzso also zzso an efficient T cell immune zzso The present work confirms the recently demonstrated role of zzso in protective immunity and shows the interest of zzso zzso constructions as zzso of partially protective immune responses in zzso as already demonstrated in zzso
