We have previously shown that type I zzso zzso chains from an osteogenesis imperfecta patient zzso with a zzso zzso resulting in a truncated zzso have impaired zzso and are zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chan, zzso Cole, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further explore the degradation of zzso chains with zzso zzso mouse zzso cells, which produce no zzso zzso were zzso zzso with a zzso expression construct containing a zzso zzso that predicts the synthesis of a protein 85 zzso longer than zzso Despite high levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, only minute amounts of zzso zzso could be detected indicating that the majority of the zzso zzso chains zzso are targeted for rapid zzso zzso zzso was not prevented by zzso A, zzso or zzso agents that interfere with zzso transport or zzso zzso However, zzso zzso chains in both zzso zzso cells and zzso cells were protected from zzso by specific zzso zzso Together these data demonstrate for the first time that zzso chains containing zzso zzso that impair assembly are zzso by the zzso zzso complex, and that the previously identified zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso in zzso is zzso by zzso
