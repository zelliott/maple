The factors controlling the expression of the zzso zzso zzso releasing hormone zzso are poorly zzso We have used a mouse anterior zzso cell line, zzso permanently zzso with the human zzso gene as a model for studying the regulation of the zzso gene by zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that in this system the zzso gene is correctly expressed and appropriately zzso regulated by zzso Treatment of five zzso cell lines with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso caused a zzso and specific increase in the amount of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso protection analysis revealed that the zzso gene was transcribed from multiple zzso initiation sites located over several hundred zzso zzso treatment resulted in a specific increase in the zzso zzso transcripts initiating from one of these many zzso start zzso
