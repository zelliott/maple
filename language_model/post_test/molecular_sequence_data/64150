To assess the structural requirements for zzso zzso by zzso E receptors zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors were used to generate hybrid zzso zzso of the whole zzso loop and its zzso half zzso had no effect on the binding of both receptors expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was observed in wild type zzso but not in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Wild type zzso left zzso levels zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso gained zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the ability to stimulate zzso formation was lost by zzso of zzso into Ala but retained by zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso with this zzso substitution of the equivalent zzso enabled zzso to stimulate zzso formation with the rank order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The point zzso of zzso into zzso was effective in another zzso zzso in which its zzso tail is different or zzso zzso zzso of the adjacent zzso to Ala but not at the following zzso weakened the acquired ability to stimulate zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso at adjacent zzso to Ala but not at zzso reduced the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso In Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso formation was observed, and zzso toxin markedly zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a cluster of zzso aromatic zzso acids in the zzso loop plays a key role for zzso zzso
