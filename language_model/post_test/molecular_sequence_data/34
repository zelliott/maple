zzso zzso is an zzso that specifically degrades zzso zzso which is an abundant zzso of the pig zzso The aim of the present study was to clone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the expression level and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso were collected from litters on Days 25, 45, 65, 85 and 105 of zzso Three transcript zzso similar to zzso were identified in the pig zzso In addition, the zzso gene was mapped to pig zzso 8 in close proximity to quantitative trait zzso for litter size and prenatal zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso were used to zzso the expression of two zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso in the pig zzso throughout zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso during very early gestation zzso 25) as well as during late gestation zzso 85 and zzso Finally, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to the zzso zzso cells of the folded zzso located nearest to the maternal zzso These findings illustrate that zzso likely plays a role in the development and modification of the pig zzso which has implications for litter size and prenatal zzso
