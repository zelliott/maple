zzso in the gene zzso the adrenal zzso steroid zzso zzso result in defective adrenal cortisol zzso often accompanied by zzso zzso The symptoms range from severe zzso disease to zzso symptoms in adulthood depending on the nature of the zzso The zzso gene is present in close proximity to a highly zzso zzso and both genes show variation in copy number between zzso For complete DNA sequence zzso we have applied selective zzso chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of all full-length steroid zzso genes present in zzso Using healthy individuals with only one remaining steroid zzso zzso as normal references, a new zzso was found in two siblings, in whom clinical and laboratory findings demonstrated moderate zzso zzso zzso sequencing of this zzso displayed an zzso 484 to Pro zzso change in zzso 10, in the same position as a previously identified zzso to C zzso found in a patient with severe zzso zzso zzso 484 is located within a stretch of zzso acids that are highly zzso between zzso zzso The finding of the presently reported zzso zzso indicates that the zzso to C zzso from the severely affected patient has arisen by a zzso zzso consisting of a G to C zzso accompanied by an adjacent G zzso When sequencing 26 zzso both these zzso which are not present in the zzso zzso reported, were found at low frequency together with a number of other zzso Thus, also rare zzso can spread via the zzso and can therefore be expected to arise independently in unrelated zzso
