The use of zzso that are designed to allow positive selection of zzso zzso cloning experiments in zzso zzso Using kid, a lethal gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso leading to high selective efficiency of zzso zzso than zzso The zzso coli bacterial host used to zzso these zzso produces the zzso zzso the natural zzso of zzso This new zzso system exhibits the same efficiency as the original zzso selection zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso and kid systems are zzso This property increases the potential of zzso zzso systems for genetic applications and opens the door to a generation of new zzso containing the two selection zzso
