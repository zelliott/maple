The gamma chain of human zzso is zzso in length at the zzso due to differential zzso processing of the gamma zzso primary zzso We have produced two specific zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso generated by this alternative processing zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with gamma zzso and gamma 55 zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso with gamma 50 zzso Using these zzso we have studied the expression of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and have determined that gamma zzso zzso is expressed in zzso but is absent or present in significantly reduced amounts in zzso Therefore the gamma 50 chain is found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the gamma zzso chain is found only in plasma zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of gamma 55 includes the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have determined that gamma 55, which is a zzso modified gamma zzso chain, is found only in plasma zzso and is absent or present in markedly reduced amounts in zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso is preserved in gamma 55, as determined by Western zzso zzso The zzso expression of the gamma zzso zzso and the zzso modification to gamma 55 result in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso This is suggestive of different mechanisms regulating human zzso zzso gene expression in zzso v zzso that may operate in a zzso manner at the level of 3' zzso processing zzso
