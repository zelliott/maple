zzso molecules are cell surface receptors for zzso zzso To define regions of the zzso domain of zzso that are important for zzso zzso we have studied the ability of zzso zzso zzso to bind to zzso from a variety of zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 21 studied were identified that at least partially blocked zzso zzso zzso binding to the standard form of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso of zzso zzso zzso defined three distinct zzso Lack of zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso fusion protein zzso containing an zzso zzso of 20 zzso acids zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso 1 to zzso was involved in zzso zzso zzso A zzso cell line, zzso derived from the zzso cell line, zzso did not bind zzso zzso nor bind zzso whereas zzso zzso did bind zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a G to A point zzso at position zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso resulting in an zzso to zzso zzso at zzso position zzso Taken together, our studies demonstrated that there are three zzso to which zzso zzso bind in the zzso domain of zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso and central regions are two regions in the zzso domain of zzso that may interact and either mediate or regulate zzso binding to cell surface zzso
