We cloned and expressed the sequences zzso the structural proteins of the zzso C virus in a zzso zzso expression zzso Four zzso zzso expressed sufficient zzso C zzso proteins in insect cell culture to allow analysis of protein zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso analysis, we detected a zzso protein corresponding to the zzso C virus zzso protein zzso from a larger zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso envelope zzso protein produced products ranging from 30 to 35 zzso whereas zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein expressed products ranging in size from 68 to 73 zzso The zzso envelope proteins were zzso as shown by sensitivity to zzso F zzso whereas the zzso was zzso We examined the zzso of these zzso proteins using zzso from 50 patients chronically infected with zzso zzso of 50 of these zzso contained zzso against the zzso 14 zzso also had zzso against E1 and at least 5 zzso had zzso against zzso zzso of 50 zzso zzso were zzso as determined on zzso C virus zzso chain zzso The three zzso that were zzso C virus zzso chain reaction negative did not have envelope zzso whereas all zzso that had envelope zzso were also zzso C virus zzso chain reaction zzso Thus zzso to zzso zzso C virus structural zzso including E1 and zzso are found in the presence of zzso
