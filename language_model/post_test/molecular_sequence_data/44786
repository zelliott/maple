The orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in regulating the expression of the rat zzso gene in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Other DNA zzso not bound by zzso are also involved in zzso regulation of the rat zzso gene in both cell zzso The region from zzso or from zzso increased both zzso and zzso transcription, and the region from zzso increased zzso zzso to a greater extent than the intact zzso zzso The zzso DNA sequence contains three imperfect copies of the orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso and at least three known orphan nuclear zzso chicken zzso upstream promoter zzso factor zzso zzso and an early response gene induced by nerve growth factor zzso bind to zzso zzso The zzso zzso is bound by one set of nuclear proteins when these three elements are zzso and is bound by a different set of proteins when these elements are zzso When the elements are zzso zzso no longer zzso and the region zzso is bound by a protein that greatly stimulates zzso zzso The region zzso is bound by two different proteins that mediate both zzso and zzso zzso We call the protein binding to zzso zzso factor zzso of zzso zzso and one of the proteins binding to zzso zzso zzso binds to a second zzso element in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both found in zzso and adrenal cells, and zzso regulation is similar in both cell zzso zzso and zzso may increase zzso by zzso zzso (a zzso zzso because these proteins share zzso zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso alone, binding as zzso increases zzso Rather, these proteins must interact with another zzso zzso zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso also requires interaction with zzso (or zzso bound to DNA and cannot increase zzso by zzso This mechanism of action is different from the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso from the zzso region of the rat zzso zzso Thus, we have defined a novel mechanism of action for orphan nuclear receptors that bind to DNA as zzso
