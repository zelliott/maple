zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the greater zzso family of molecules with various functions, zzso in zzso zzso regulation of gene zzso and has been implicated to play a role in the zzso development of zzso zzso and prostate zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso has a functional role for the zzso shuttling of the zzso zzso Using various combinations of in zzso zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter zzso experiments we were able to show that while the deletion of zzso leads to a decreased stability and enhanced degradation of the zzso the selective zzso of a zzso zzso zzso site zzso prevents the zzso protein from entering the zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso zzso is a necessary and functional prerequisite for zzso transport into the nucleus reminding of comparable data from a related zzso zzso zzso
