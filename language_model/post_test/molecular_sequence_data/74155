Current experimental techniques, especially those applying liquid zzso mass zzso have made zzso zzso studies zzso The increase in zzso however also raises concerns on the accuracy of identification or zzso Most experimental procedures select in a given zzso scan only a few relatively most intense parent zzso each to be fragmented zzso zzso and most other minor zzso peptides that have similar zzso retention times are ignored and their information zzso 

We have zzso investigated the possibility of enhancing the information retrieval during a given zzso experiment by selecting the two or three most intense parent zzso for simultaneous zzso A set of zzso is created via zzso a number of zzso zzso each can be identified by all search methods tested with high confidence, to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso The generated convoluted zzso were used to evaluate the capability of several database search methods - zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso - in identifying true peptides from superimposed zzso of zzso zzso We show that using these simulated zzso all the database search methods will gain eventually in the number of true peptides identified by using the compound zzso of zzso zzso
