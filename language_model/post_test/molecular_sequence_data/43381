A zzso zzso the complete precursor of a zzso zzso zzso L zzso was isolated and zzso zzso active zzso was expressed and zzso by zzso zzso transformed with a zzso carrying the complete zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso is zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso transformed with a truncated zzso which lacked the zzso and most of the zzso zzso did not express zzso active zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso properties in common with the native zzso including, pH optimum for activity, stability at 37 degrees C and ability to cleave gelatin and zzso zzso kinetic data showed that the native and zzso zzso zzso have similar zzso for zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This is the first report of the functional expression of a zzso L zzso in zzso zzso that did not require the use of zzso zzso signal zzso
