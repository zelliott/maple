In order to isolate very strong promoters from bacteria and zzso a zzso named zzso was zzso It possesses an origin zzso for replication in zzso bacteria, an zzso for replication in zzso bacteria, a zzso zzso resistance gene with a multiple cloning site zzso in the position formerly occupied by the zzso promoter, a zzso resistance gene for selection in zzso bacteria and a zzso resistance gene for selection in zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of DNA fragments of zzso zzso zzso resulted in isolation of several clones very resistant to zzso The DNA fragments inserted in these zzso plasmids were zzso and all of them contained putative promoter zzso zzso measurement of the zzso activity indicated that one of the isolated promoters could be included within a group of the stronger known zzso zzso According to these results zzso is a powerful tool to perform studies on promoter strength and for industrial zzso
