zzso characteristics of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and its effects on slow zzso responses of zzso zzso roots evoked by primary zzso stimulation were examined in isolated spinal zzso preparations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso rightward shifts of the zzso zzso for substance zzso substance P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A in normal artificial zzso fluid and those for substance P zzso zzso zzso and zzso A in the presence of zzso zzso (10 zzso did not evoke zzso acid zzso release from spinal cords of zzso rats, whereas zzso zzso P zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly depressed the slow zzso response of zzso roots, referred to as slow zzso root potential, evoked by the stimulation of the zzso zzso root or the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso 1 zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso zzso slow zzso root potential and did not antagonize the action of zzso A to induce zzso root zzso The present results provide further evidence for the involvement of substance zzso zzso A and zzso zzso receptors in the primary zzso slow zzso root zzso
