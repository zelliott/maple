White spot syndrome virus zzso is a zzso zzso virus which causes a disease in zzso zzso A zzso zzso long open reading frame zzso was found on a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the DNA zzso of zzso located adjacent to the zzso zzso small zzso zzso This putative zzso showed zzso to zzso and zzso zzso which contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso with viral and zzso zzso zzso revealed that most zzso and structurally important zzso acid zzso were present in the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso tree of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso was located in a well zzso supported zzso containing only zzso including one of zzso natural zzso zzso zzso A similar conjunction was found for the only other viral zzso present in zzso virus, which was also found in a well zzso zzso with its natural host, zzso zzso This zzso of virus and host suggests that both zzso and zzso virus may have acquired their zzso genes from their respective natural zzso Because the motif for zzso zzso is found in only two zzso this gene cannot be used to clarify the zzso position of zzso However, the presence of this type of zzso rarely found in viruses adds a novel feature to zzso
