zzso muscle genes are important potentially functional candidate genes for livestock production and meat zzso zzso regulatory light chain zzso regulates zzso zzso via zzso by zzso dependent zzso light chain zzso The zzso of the zzso light chain, zzso fast skeletal muscle zzso gene from the zzso zzso of zzso goat was cloned and zzso The results showed that zzso full-length coding sequence consists of zzso zzso and encodes 170 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso domain of zzso gene zzso between zzso and other zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared significant identity with the zzso from other zzso A zzso tree analysis revealed that the zzso zzso protein has a close genetic relationship and zzso distance with zzso in other zzso Analysis by zzso showed that the zzso zzso was detected in heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal muscle and zzso zzso In particular, high expression levels of zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso and abdominal muscle, and low level of expressions were observed in liver, zzso lung and zzso In addition, the zzso expression analysis further showed zzso expression decreased gradually with age in the skeletal zzso This may be important as muscle growth occurs mainly in young age in zzso Western zzso results detected the zzso protein in four of the zzso in which zzso was shown to be zzso the four exceptions were liver, zzso lung and zzso
