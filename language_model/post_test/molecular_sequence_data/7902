zzso zzso C zzso is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of many cell zzso In human zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso alpha and beta II play distinct functional zzso alpha zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas beta II zzso is required for zzso To identify regions within alpha and beta II zzso that allow participation in these divergent zzso we constructed zzso in which the regulatory and zzso zzso of alpha and beta II zzso were zzso These zzso zzso can be zzso zzso exhibit zzso properties similar to native alpha and beta II zzso in zzso and participate in alpha and beta II zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same manner as zzso of zzso alpha zzso In contrast, the zzso II zzso zzso like zzso beta II zzso selectively zzso to the nucleus and leads to increased zzso of the nuclear envelope zzso zzso B in response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of alpha and beta II zzso contain zzso important for alpha and beta II zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain represents a potential target for modulating zzso zzso activity in zzso
