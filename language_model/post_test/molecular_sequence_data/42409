A three-dimensional zzso model of the peripheral zzso zzso zzso has been built using molecular dynamics zzso The zzso domain of the zzso has been modeled as five zzso which are not long enough to cross the entire zzso membrane but zzso approximately to only one zzso zzso The zzso model has also been tested as a cholesterol carrier, and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that it could indeed accommodate a cholesterol zzso within the five zzso All three known zzso sequences have been zzso and no significant difference has been found between zzso
