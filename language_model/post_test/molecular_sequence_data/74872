Despite its zzso zzso protein zzso function, the putative zzso inhibitor zzso activity of the zzso zzso drought 22 zzso zzso protein and its zzso function in young leaves during leaf nitrogen zzso zzso promoted by stressful conditions remains an zzso zzso our objectives were to determine zzso if zzso is related to the zzso zzso previously detected in zzso zzso young leaves, and zzso if the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in young leaves are associated with plant responses to stress conditions (N zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that are able to zzso leaf zzso Compared to control, N zzso delayed initiation of zzso and induced zzso zzso activity in the young zzso After 3 d with zzso the zzso zzso activity was zzso higher than the zzso Using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso liquid zzso tandem mass zzso analysis, it was demonstrated that two zzso proteins with zzso points zzso and zzso harboring zzso activity zzso to zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso activities, and zzso protein presented similar zzso Using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso six zzso separated by two-dimensional zzso were detected in young leaves treated with zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso tandem mass zzso analysis of six zzso confirms their zzso with zzso zzso suggest that zzso possesses dual functions zzso and zzso that lead to the protection of younger zzso from adverse conditions by maintaining metabolism zzso integrity and zzso By sustaining sink growth of stressed plants, zzso may contribute to a better zzso of recycling N from sources, a zzso trait that improves zzso zzso
