It has been proposed that zzso zzso in several zzso zzso depends on the zzso zzso for conversion of zzso zzso A to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key reaction in this zzso In this study the zzso from zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, isolated in a highly zzso form, and zzso The overall zzso acid sequence of this zzso was very zzso compared with the sequences of zzso zzso zzso Analysis by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso suggested that the native zzso is a zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 33 zzso The specific activity was 12 zzso and the pH optimum was zzso to zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso were 41 and 339 zzso M, zzso There was substantial zzso zzso at zzso levels of zzso The sensitivity to feedback zzso by zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso These compounds were competitive zzso with respect to zzso the zzso values were 46 and 45 zzso M for zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Parallel zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso is much less sensitive to feedback zzso zzso difference, 3 orders of zzso than the human zzso In contrast, both zzso tightly bound zzso a fluorescent zzso zzso suggesting that there are similarities in structural features that are important for zzso zzso
