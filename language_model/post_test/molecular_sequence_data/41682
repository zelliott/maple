zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that assemble in elastic fibers and basement zzso zzso zzso has a single zzso gene that produces zzso of zzso zzso C and D zzso zzso In a zzso analysis of zzso zzso a series of deletion zzso show that zzso repeats 4 and 5 are required for the zzso assembly and function of zzso in native zzso In contrast, zzso missing the second zzso repeat of zzso zzso assemble in zzso locations in a zzso dependent zzso zzso that contain zzso are zzso into two fragments, but zzso with zzso missing are not, suggesting that a zzso binds and/or zzso zzso at a site that is likely within zzso Together, the data suggests that zzso repeats 4 and 5 promote interaction with zzso while a region within zzso suppresses zzso interactions with zzso and this suppression may be zzso zzso
