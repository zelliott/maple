zzso zzso is associated with a number of human zzso including Alzheimer's and zzso diseases and the systemic zzso In this study, we used the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the mechanism of zzso under conditions in which the protein maintains a folded zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to form zzso able to bind specific zzso such as zzso zzso zzso red, and zzso zzso The presence of zzso was confirmed by circular zzso and dynamic light zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of small zzso generally referred to as zzso zzso The zzso form adopted by zzso zzso prior to zzso under these conditions retained zzso zzso in addition, folding was remarkably faster than zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso adopts a zzso although possibly zzso zzso prior to zzso Most important, zzso appeared to be zzso faster than unfolding under these zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso was faster at higher zzso zzso in which the protein adopted a partially unfolded zzso these findings suggest that the early events of zzso zzso formation may involve an zzso process consisting of the assembly of protein molecules in their folded zzso This conclusion has a biological relevance as zzso proteins normally spend most of their lifetime in folded zzso
