The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso from chicken liver is zzso The primary structure was determined by automated sequence analysis of peptides produced by limited acid zzso and by zzso zzso The comparative zzso of chicken zzso was determined by zzso using rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso Chicken zzso consists of 63 zzso acids as compared to 61 found in zzso from zzso One zzso (and two zzso occurs in the zzso region, a region considered zzso among zzso zzso zzso of the 20 zzso in chicken zzso were aligned with zzso from other zzso zzso Two zzso near the zzso zzso are shifted by one zzso due to the zzso of zzso in that zzso Overall, the chicken protein showed approximately equal to zzso sequence identity in a comparison with various zzso zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso for chicken zzso was decreased by 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This reduced affinity is attributed to major zzso in chicken zzso in the regions of the principal zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the primary structure predicted the secondary structure to consist of reverse turns and random coils with no stable beta or zzso zzso There is no evidence that chicken zzso differs functionally from zzso zzso
