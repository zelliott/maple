A zzso clone zzso the mouse zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso was isolated from a mouse fetal zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso full-length zzso contains a zzso open reading frame which encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso analysis reveals seven putative zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso was demonstrated in zzso of zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso analysis and zzso displacement profile were typical of the zzso zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso was expressed abundantly in fetus and in a lesser amount in adult zzso Analysis of the mouse zzso zzso gene reveals that the mouse zzso zzso locus exists as a single copy in the zzso and that the gene does not contain zzso in the coding zzso
