We previously reported that zzso is a novel zzso DNA zzso showing structural similarity with the bacterial zzso factor zzso In this study, we isolated a new zzso zzso termed zzso from human and zzso zzso zzso also resembled zzso thus suggesting that zzso and zzso are included in a gene zzso Like zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was an zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso Most of the zzso properties of zzso were the same as those of zzso whereas the polarity of zzso DNA zzso activity zzso to zzso was the opposite to that of zzso zzso and zzso bound to each other and were included in the same complex of approximately 700 zzso in a zzso We found that zzso was an essential gene for the growth of zzso zzso as is the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso does not complement the zzso function and vice zzso From these zzso we suggest that zzso plays an essential role in the cellular processes involved in DNA zzso
