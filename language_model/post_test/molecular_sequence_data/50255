The complete zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a freshwater zzso from mountain stream of Taiwan, has been cloned and zzso This fish zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso encodes genes for 13 zzso two zzso and 22 zzso in addition to a regulatory sequence for replication and zzso zzso is similar to those of the other zzso in both the order and orientation of these zzso The zzso and zzso zzso genes are highly zzso both in size and zzso to their counterparts in zzso birds, zzso and zzso and using essentially the same set of zzso including both the initiation and termination signals, and the zzso zzso do exist, however, in the lengths and sequences of the zzso regions, and in space between zzso which account for the variations in total lengths of the zzso Our observations provide evidence for the first time for the conservation of genetic information in the fish zzso zzso especially among the zzso
