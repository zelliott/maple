zzso are diverse compounds that have their zzso origin in the initial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso that can be zzso by the addition of subsequent zzso zzso zzso These reactions are zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso The synthesis of volatile zzso in plants typically proceeds through either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to yield zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in zzso zzso of tomato zzso zzso and related wild relatives also occurs via the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso by the zzso zzso locus in tomato and zzso zzso zzso In this study, comparative sequence analysis of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso that zzso either zzso or zzso was performed to identify zzso acid zzso that correlate with the ability to zzso zzso or zzso zzso structural zzso coupled with zzso zzso highlighted the importance of four zzso acids located within zzso domain II of zzso zzso that form part of the second zzso for determining zzso and product specificity of these zzso In particular, the relative positioning of aromatic zzso acid zzso at positions 100 and 107 determines the ability of these zzso to zzso zzso or zzso This study provides insight into the zzso evolution of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
