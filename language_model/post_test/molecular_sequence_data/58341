We characterized the action of zzso and zzso on current through the zzso zzso channel zzso mouse zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso technique was used to examine the channel properties after injection of in zzso transcribed zzso into rat zzso leukemia zzso The action of zzso on current through zzso channels could be separated into an acceleration of the rate of current zzso during zzso zzso and a reduction of steady state peak current when applied either zzso or zzso Both effects were greatly reduced when the zzso zzso was applied zzso but it affected current through zzso channels similar to zzso if applied to the zzso side of the zzso zzso in the outer zzso of the zzso channel did not change the ability of zzso to accelerate the zzso current zzso during zzso zzso whereas the reduction of the steady state peak current by zzso applied either zzso and zzso and by zzso applied zzso was decreased approximately zzso in all three zzso Substances known to interact with an zzso site of the channel zzso zzso applied zzso or zzso did not compete with zzso applied zzso on blocking steady state peak zzso whereas zzso applied zzso which is known to interact with an zzso site of the channel, was able to reduce the effect of zzso applied zzso on blocking steady state peak zzso suggesting competition for a common binding site between zzso and zzso applied zzso The results from the competition experiments as well as from the zzso in the outer zzso of zzso are compatible with the idea that zzso applied zzso moves through the membrane to reach its internal binding site on the zzso zzso
