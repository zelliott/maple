zzso bacterial diversity of zzso zzso zzso an Arctic zzso was studied using 12 zzso samples collected from different points, along a zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso up to the convergence point of the melt water stream with the zzso zzso abundance appeared to be closer to the convergence point of the glacial melt water stream with the sea than at the zzso of the zzso A total of 117 bacterial strains were isolated from the zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso the zzso zzso could be zzso in to 32 groups, with each group representing a different zzso belonging to 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Representatives of the 32 groups varied in their growth temperature range zzso degrees zzso in their tolerance to zzso zzso zzso and in the growth pH range zzso Only 14 of 32 representative strains exhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity and only one isolate zzso showed all three zzso activities at 5 and 20 degrees C zzso More than half of the zzso were zzso zzso acid profile studies indicated that zzso fatty zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids are zzso in the zzso zzso
