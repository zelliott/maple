Complete primary structure of an zzso low molecular mass zzso of zzso zzso was determined using zzso degradation and zzso analysis of individual peptides obtained after zzso of the protein by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The peptides were isolated and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso consists of 109 zzso acid zzso zzso 8, zzso 6, zzso 6, zzso 10, zzso 3, zzso 1, Pro 3, zzso 9, Ala 12, Val 7, zzso 7, zzso 7, zzso 7, zzso 4, His 1, zzso 10, zzso 3 and zzso 5) and has a molecular weight of zzso zzso A single difference was detected between primary structures of the zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso
