zzso in human DNA repair proteins can give rise to the zzso zzso disorders zzso zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso sometimes even zzso Seven XP and three zzso zzso groups have been identified that are thought to be due to zzso in genes from the zzso zzso repair zzso Here we isolate zzso and human complementary zzso that zzso proteins resembling zzso a protein involved in this zzso in zzso zzso of these three zzso together with two other zzso related zzso reveals that their zzso sequences are largely confined to two zzso zzso of the human zzso in zzso restores to normal the sensitivity to ultraviolet light and unscheduled DNA synthesis of zzso cells from XP group G, but not zzso group zzso The zzso correcting protein zzso is generated from a zzso zzso of approximately 4 zzso that is present in normal amounts in the zzso cell zzso
