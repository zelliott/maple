The generation of broadly zzso zzso is a priority in the design of vaccines against zzso Unfortunately, most zzso to zzso are narrow in their zzso and a basic understanding of how to develop zzso with broad zzso activity is zzso zzso methods to target zzso to zzso zzso zzso may allow for the generation of broadly zzso zzso and aid the global fight against AIDS by providing new approaches to block zzso zzso Using a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso as a template, we sought to identify features of zzso that would enhance exposure of zzso zzso zzso 

Within a cohort study of high-risk women in zzso Kenya, we previously identified a zzso A zzso zzso zzso in one participant that was unusually sensitive to zzso Using zzso zzso the unusual zzso sensitivity of this zzso was mapped to two zzso acid zzso within zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These two zzso when introduced into a zzso zzso from the same zzso resulted in 3- to zzso enhanced zzso by zzso zzso specific for zzso regions of both zzso and the zzso surface zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso by soluble zzso and zzso enhanced zzso by the zzso found within a pool of zzso from unrelated zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was not explained by differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or apparent differences in fusion zzso Furthermore, introduction of these zzso into unrelated viral zzso zzso including those from both another zzso A zzso and a zzso B zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and to plasma zzso This enhanced zzso sensitivity exceeded zzso in several zzso 

Two zzso acid zzso within zzso were identified that expose multiple zzso zzso zzso on diverse zzso zzso zzso These exposed zzso were zzso on the unmodified viral zzso zzso and several of the exposed zzso zzso desired target regions for protective zzso zzso proteins containing these modifications could act as a scaffold for presentation of such zzso zzso and may aid in developing methods to target zzso to such zzso
