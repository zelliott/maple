The zzso zzso zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso strain zzso The gene contains one zzso of 108 zzso and codes for a protein of 223 zzso acids in which two putative zzso target sites were zzso Three different zzso zzso strains were transformed by targeting a construct composed of the zzso zzso including its promoter, to the zzso zzso zzso zzso overall production levels of zzso were obtained using zzso zzso zzso a genetically engineered strain, as a zzso zzso into the zzso locus was not required for enhanced expression under control of the zzso zzso
