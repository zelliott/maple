zzso recognition of zzso has been implicated as the major mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides that are presented in the context of human zzso zzso The zzso class zzso peptides that bind zzso a representative of the zzso zzso were predicted using a zzso zzso The candidate peptides were zzso and their binding capacities to zzso were compared in a competitive zzso using zzso zzso reporter peptides zzso zzso zzso was determined to exhibit the most potent binding capacity to zzso in zzso and thus selected for in zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso potent zzso zzso zzso zzso shares zzso to zzso zzso of three zzso zzso six zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso Thus, this study has important implications not only for the identification of an zzso indirect zzso shared by diverse zzso class I zzso but also for the development of zzso zzso zzso
