We have examined the zzso zzso of zzso myosin, the zzso unfolding profiles of zzso rod and light zzso zzso and the zzso properties of the zzso zzso Two major zzso sites were found, located at the zzso junction and the heavy zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso rod produced the zzso zzso zzso and short zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso which were similar to those of gizzard zzso rod and differed from the short zzso zzso zzso and long zzso zzso zzso segments produced from zzso zzso The zzso unfolding profile of zzso zzso rods exhibited three zzso zzso at zzso 51 and 54 degrees C, similar to those of gizzard rods yet different from those of zzso zzso There was a dramatic difference in the zzso of zzso zzso fragments of various molecular mass, as for gizzard zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso fragments of molecular mass 77 zzso or more were completely zzso in zzso zzso whereas zzso fragments of molecular mass 73 zzso or less were completely soluble in zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso showed two additional zzso sites located 13 and 30 zzso from the ends of the zzso zzso This suggests the existence of flexible regions within the zzso zzso which may be responsible for the folded form of zzso zzso
