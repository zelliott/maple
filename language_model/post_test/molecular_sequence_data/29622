A new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso related to zzso has been zzso In addition to a zzso domain in the C zzso these proteins have an zzso domain similar to the zzso domain of zzso radical zzso zzso organization is preserved in evolution, suggesting that both zzso activities are functionally or mechanistically coupled and directed towards highly zzso zzso The functional implications of this similarity and a possible role for zzso proteins as zzso zzso are zzso
