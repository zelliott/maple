The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso is a zzso zzso composed of 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for all zzso in both reaction directions at pH 7 and at 75 degrees zzso Rate dependence zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with a zzso zzso constant ( zzso of zzso zzso and a Hill zzso of zzso The apparent zzso for zzso was zzso zzso and the apparent zzso value was about 360 zzso The zzso also zzso in zzso the reverse reaction with an apparent zzso for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and an apparent zzso of about 13 zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso which was most effective, could partially be replaced by zzso and zzso zzso activity was zzso regulated by classical zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso it was activated by zzso and inhibited by zzso The zzso had a temperature optimum of 93 degrees C and showed a significant zzso up to 100 degrees zzso Using the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso the zzso gene coding for zzso was identified and functionally zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had identical kinetic and zzso properties as the native zzso zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high sequence similarity to members of the zzso zzso In accordance with its zzso properties, zzso of zzso zzso contained the zzso zzso zzso sites for zzso and zzso
