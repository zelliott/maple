The zzso zzso zzso zzso locus acts as a zzso and zzso regulator in the development of zzso zzso and the zzso It consists of two structurally and functionally related zzso zzso and zzso each of which encodes a single nuclear zzso zzso and zzso have two zzso zzso in common, a zzso domain and a zzso domain, a motif that characterizes a zzso of zzso domain proteins in zzso The tissue distribution of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso being expressed in a zzso of zzso Analysis of a series of zzso indicates that the two zzso genes have zzso distinct and redundant functions during zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso traits that are sexually zzso or show diversity among zzso species are highly sensitive to changes in the zzso gene dose, suggesting that zzso in zzso activity may contribute to evolutionary modification of sex-related zzso
