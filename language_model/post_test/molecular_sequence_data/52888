The zzso zzso crystal zzso protein is found in human zzso and zzso where it comprises zzso of the cellular protein zzso Previous work from our laboratory has identified the motif zzso as a powerful zzso of gene zzso ill two zzso zzso zzso To evaluate a potentially larger role for this motif in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso we have isolated zzso zzso zzso to the zzso start site of the gene zzso zzso protein and identified a functionally active promoter that includes three distinct copies of the zzso zzso zzso of only one of the three motifs by zzso zzso resulted in loss of promoter activity zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this core motif is necessary but not sufficient to support enhanced zzso zzso zzso comparisons and zzso zzso has permitted further zzso of this zzso element which, as a result of this work, is now defined as zzso zzso shift zzso demonstrated specific binding of nuclear zzso from an zzso zzso nuclear extract to this extended zzso Similar analysis of a zzso binding site demonstrated zzso activity, with zzso resulting in a 94 zzso zzso reduction in activity, whereas the zzso site functioned as a gene zzso
