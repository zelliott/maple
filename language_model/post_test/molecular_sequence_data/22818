We examined zzso genetic variation in house mice zzso zzso zzso from the northern third of the Japanese Islands, in order to obtain evidence of the history of mouse colonization that might have shaped the current genetic zzso We extended the previous sampling of zzso zzso b sequence and added information from the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso gene zzso We distinguish zzso zzso characteristic of the North Asian zzso subspecies group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso and that of the Southeast Asian zzso subspecies group as zzso (although the mice resemble zzso zzso There was a clear geographic partition of zzso and zzso types into southern and northern zzso zzso zzso on zzso the zzso and zzso types were zzso without clear geographic zzso In contrast to the zzso data, all zzso and zzso mice examined were found to possess a unique type for the zzso zzso zzso specific to Korea and zzso zzso site analysis of nuclear zzso probe showed a consistent distribution of zzso and zzso types, as major and minor zzso respectively, in the zzso and zzso zzso These data support the previous notion that the zzso and zzso mice experienced genetic zzso between primary residents of zzso origin and zzso newcomers arriving via a southern zzso The invasion of the zzso type could zzso with the evidence for arrival of prehistoric zzso There are, however, alternative zzso including genetic zzso between zzso arriving by a southern route and zzso from a northern zzso
