During the last few years the subject of zzso zzso in zzso zzso has gained increasing zzso One reason for this may be that zzso zzso provide new insights into the biological diversity of zzso with the potential of discovering alternative models of structural and functional zzso Four groups of zzso zzso have been studied in detail, namely zzso insects, snails and zzso with the present article focusing on zzso from the latter two zzso zzso are interesting because they possess distinct zzso zzso involved in different zzso zzso In the Roman snail zzso zzso for example, one zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso accounting for the zzso binding and zzso of zzso The second zzso which is present in the zzso zzso is substantially different regarding its primary zzso Furthermore, it binds nearly exclusively copper, and thus is probably involved in the zzso regulation of essential trace zzso zzso zzso merit our attention because of another zzso they seem to be much more unstable than snail zzso particularly under conventional conditions of zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for instance, codes for a putative zzso which is about twice the size of the actual zzso The isolated zzso zzso binds four zzso zzso and represents a zzso zzso entity that is stable and functional in zzso This strongly suggests that earthworm zzso are either zzso zzso or subjected to zzso zzso during zzso Both snail and earthworm zzso are zzso by metal exposure, especially by cadmium, thus supporting the idea of using them as potential zzso for environmental metal zzso zzso snail zzso have already been tested in this respect with some success, the use of earthworm zzso as zzso still remains to be zzso especially in the light of the unknown significance of their zzso zzso
