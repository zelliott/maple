The identification of zzso modifications is difficult especially for zzso membrane zzso Here we present the identification of several types of protein modifications on membrane proteins isolated from zzso outer zzso We show, in zzso that the mature rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso on two zzso zzso and zzso on two zzso zzso We show that long chain zzso zzso 1 is zzso at both the zzso end and at a zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found to be zzso and zzso For the three zzso zzso channel zzso present in the zzso the zzso regions of the protein were determined and sites of zzso were zzso These novel findings raise questions about regulatory aspects of zzso zzso long chain zzso zzso and zzso dependent zzso channel and further studies should advance our understanding about regulation of zzso fatty acid zzso in general and these three proteins in zzso
