zzso the mechanisms of plant zzso tolerance can facilitate plant engineering for enhanced salt stress zzso Sugar beet zzso addition line zzso obtained from the zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibits tolerance to salt zzso Here we report the zzso characteristics of the zzso plants under 0, zzso and 400 zzso zzso conditions using quantitative zzso zzso zzso from control and the salt treated zzso plants were separated using zzso Eighty-six protein spots representing 67 unique proteins in leaves and 22 protein spots representing 22 unique proteins in roots were zzso In addition, zzso zzso was employed to identify and zzso zzso expressed proteins under salt zzso Seventy-five zzso expressed proteins in leaves and 43 zzso expressed proteins in roots were zzso The proteins were mainly involved in photosynthesis, energy, zzso protein folding and degradation, and stress and zzso Moreover, gene zzso data obtained from the same samples were compared to the corresponding protein zzso Thirteen proteins in leaves and 12 in roots showed significant correlation in gene expression and protein zzso These results suggest the important processes for the zzso tolerance to salt stress include enhancement of photosynthesis and energy zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and regulation of zzso metabolism and zzso zzso
