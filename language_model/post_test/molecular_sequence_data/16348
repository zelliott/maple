The zzso induction of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso cells is diminished by zzso protein zzso We now show that the zzso zzso region contains a DNA sequence zzso zzso to zzso exhibiting a high degree of zzso to the zzso regulatory element zzso consensus sequence zzso which serves to specifically bind zzso rat zzso zzso in zzso A 15 base pair zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness on a zzso zzso such regulation is not diminished by concurrent zzso of protein zzso However, inclusion of the zzso sequences immediately downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso renders the hormonal induction sensitive to zzso of protein zzso Furthermore, inclusion of these downstream sequences results in a more pronounced induction zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment using nuclear extracts prepared from zzso zzso cells generate zzso that indicate the presence of zzso interactions spanning the region from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso We propose that one or more zzso factors acting within this domain, immediately downstream of the zzso is required for efficient zzso at the zzso zzso
