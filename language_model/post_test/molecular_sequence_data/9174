zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso genes are capable of reducing the zzso zzso of a variety of zzso zzso zzso and activity data of zzso zzso were used to define a set of zzso possibly responsible for the large differences in zzso activity seen between zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as hot spots in the zzso responsible for its low zzso zzso These positions were individually zzso for zzso acids found in the strong zzso in the corresponding zzso zzso zzso were determined for zzso and its zzso as well as for zzso using zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso for zzso or zzso showed considerably lower zzso and higher zzso values than the zzso zzso approaching the zzso efficiency of strong zzso The introduced zzso not only lead to an improved capability to reduce zzso but also to altered zzso zzso Our findings provided structural insights into the differences seen among the natural zzso with regard to their zzso preferences and zzso zzso
