The vinegar fly, zzso zzso is a popular model for the study of zzso zzso immune zzso Several zzso viruses are commonly found in both wild and laboratory populations of zzso zzso The zzso and most zzso of these is the zzso zzso C zzso Among the zzso small zzso viruses of zzso zzso zzso A virus zzso is the least zzso Historically, zzso has been zzso as a zzso virus based on its particle size and the content of its zzso zzso Here, we describe the characterization of both the zzso and the zzso structure of zzso zzso the zzso zzso was shown to zzso a circular zzso in the zzso motifs of the zzso zzso zzso This arrangement has only been described previously for a subset of viruses from the zzso zzso virus family zzso and the zzso zzso zzso virus family zzso The 8 A zzso zzso zzso zzso structure zzso from zzso zzso and image reconstruction indicates that the virus structural protein forms two discrete zzso within the zzso The inner domain is formed from a clear zzso lattice with similarity to the zzso domain of tomato bushy stunt virus, whilst the outer domain is not ordered zzso but forms a zzso structure that surrounds the core zzso Taken together, this indicates that zzso is highly divergent from previously described zzso
