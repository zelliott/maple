Two recent studies have presented conflicting views on variation present within the zzso base third domain of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso One study suggested that this gene is highly zzso across the zzso while another recovered 22 distinct zzso from 22 strains of zzso zzso We have zzso this gene in numerous lines of zzso zzso and its relatives, noting only two zzso in the third domain, and we failed to confirm any of the published zzso Second, we note that the published sequence divergence between strains of zzso zzso was as great as that documented between zzso related zzso zzso Third, we show that the published zzso of this region within zzso zzso would disrupt the secondary structure of the resulting zzso We conclude that the published zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso do not accurately reflect zzso of the functional zzso and that this gene is relatively zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
