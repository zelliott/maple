Most zzso zzso exit the nucleus with a zzso zzso tail and are zzso to yield zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso on any given zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso and zzso have an unusually short, discrete zzso zzso tail and showed that regulation of zzso length is controlled independently by two zzso zzso elements zzso A and zzso zzso located in the terminal zzso The present study sought to determine the zzso of this regulatory zzso zzso zzso also has a discrete zzso zzso tail, and deletion mapping experiments identified an element zzso to the zzso gene zzso B within the terminal zzso of the zzso gene that zzso zzso length regulation on a zzso reporter zzso Based on this similarity the zzso B sequence was used in a database search to identify candidate zzso targets for regulated zzso Of the several hundred sequences identified in this manner we focused on zzso a member of a family of genes zzso related zinc finger zzso zzso A striking feature of the zzso element in these genes is its location zzso zzso upstream of the translation stop zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso has a zzso zzso tail, for which the identified zzso sequence is zzso These results indicate that the presence of a zzso can predict zzso with zzso zzso tails, and that nuclear regulation of zzso tail length is a feature of many zzso
