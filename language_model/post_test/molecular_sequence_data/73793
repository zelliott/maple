Many zzso species zzso zzso zzso two zzso different zzso zzso zzso associated with gut zzso primary zzso and secondary zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso in specialized zzso cells, zzso which form a structure zzso in the anterior portion of the zzso zzso characterization of zzso from the three zzso of zzso zzso has shown that these organisms constitute a distinct lineage within the zzso of zzso and have evolved zzso with their insect host species, suggesting an zzso ancient association for this zzso The zzso is a smaller zzso zzso zzso rod and is zzso in zzso zzso zzso Its zzso characterization from zzso zzso zzso had shown that it is a member of the family zzso within the zzso subdivision of the zzso closely related to enteric zzso Some zzso species zzso a third zzso in their zzso zzso which was shown zzso to belong to to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here, we show that zzso from five zzso species, representing all three zzso form a cluster of closely related zzso based on their almost identical zzso zzso gene zzso The high similarity provides strong evidence of recent independent acquisition of zzso by individual zzso species, unlike zzso which displays zzso evolution with host insect zzso A zzso zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis was developed to zzso the zzso and zzso in zzso egg, zzso and zzso zzso in order to investigate the potential routes for the vertical transmission of these zzso to the zzso zzso Only zzso were found to zzso milk zzso zzso suggesting that milk zzso zzso represent a route of transmission for these zzso into the developing zzso The zzso tissue was found to zzso only zzso confirming its zzso transmission, whereas the mode of transmission of zzso remains zzso
