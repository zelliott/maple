A zzso clone zzso a novel zinc finger protein expressed in zzso cells has been zzso This protein contains 5 repeats of the zzso motif previously described in the zzso gap zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso this protein is expressed at high levels in a variety of zzso cell lines, at lower levels in some B cells, but is not observed in zzso zzso Within the T zzso the zzso is found at high levels in both alpha beta and gamma delta T zzso These data suggest that this zzso designated zzso represents a gene that may contribute to the determination of the differentiation and the specificity within zzso zzso
