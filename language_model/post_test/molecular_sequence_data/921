Eight novel small zzso that were zzso in the regions corresponding to the zzso of zzso genes were isolated from zzso zzso Seven of them showed a typical zzso secondary zzso one zzso zzso and six zzso zzso The remaining one zzso did not show any zzso to other zzso in a zzso Four of the seven isolated zzso could form base pairings with parts of zzso suggesting that they are potential zzso sites and zzso zzso The results of our study suggest that there are more zzso small zzso of which genes are located in the zzso regions of zzso genes in zzso zzso
