A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a tidal flat zzso on the southern coast of zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso clustered with zzso zzso zzso by a high zzso zzso value of zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence similarity to the sequences of type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids detected in strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso properties and zzso distinctiveness of strain zzso demonstrated that this strain is distinguishable from the sole recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
