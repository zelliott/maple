We have designed a screen for zzso affected in 3' maturation of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We inserted a zzso resistance zzso zzso in a peripheral domain of zzso the gene for a small zzso zzso involved in zzso of zzso Depending on the orientation of the zzso a polar effect was observed which was due to processing at the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was truncated and zzso of zzso was zzso We selected zzso zzso of this zzso zzso that restored zzso zzso which correlated with the presence of zzso transcripts that regained the 3' part of zzso We analyzed two nuclear and six zzso zzso Five zzso zzso altered a short element in the center of the second zzso repeat in the zzso zzso and one deleted a larger region including this zzso These zzso revealed a zzso element in zzso which is required for 3' zzso When the same zzso were inserted in the 3' untranslated region zzso of the native zzso zzso the zzso zzso accumulated to normal levels, but in strong zzso its 3' end was located upstream, near the end of the first zzso repeat zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso allowed stable zzso of zzso zzso but deletion of both resulted in its complete zzso This indicated that the two zzso repeats function as redundant zzso stability zzso in the 3' zzso of zzso
