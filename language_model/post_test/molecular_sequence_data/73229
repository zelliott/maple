zzso peptides are zzso in nature and have been shown to have the potential to interact at the membrane zzso possibly by lying parallel to the membrane zzso Present methodology for the identification of these zzso uses a fixed window size, is based on a two-dimensional sum of zzso zzso and gives no measure of the statistical significance for any region identified as zzso Identification of zzso zzso structures is difficult and here we have attempted to remedy this by introducing an zzso which considers three-dimensional zzso and variable window zzso 

A new measure of zzso potential is proposed, called the zzso inserted zzso zzso which is based on the zzso of zzso zzso within a zzso zzso such as that produced by a membrane zzso A statistical significance for this measure has been derived using zzso Carlo zzso The zzso is applied to a set of proteins which are thought to anchor to the membrane via zzso zzso alpha zzso The zzso measure appears to allow the identification of this category of zzso zzso which lie near the boundary of the zzso moment plot and which have previously been hard to zzso
