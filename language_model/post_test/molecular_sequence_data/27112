zzso are a family of proteins within the zzso zzso zzso In addition to their zzso role at the zzso organizing center zzso zzso have acquired multiple zzso throughout the course of zzso For example, zzso have been linked to different nuclear activities, including zzso export and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso B is a divergent member of the zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso shows 51% identity with its closest relative and only zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso and divergent group within the zzso family of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso versions of zzso were not found at the zzso (in whole cells or in isolated zzso Instead, zzso localized to the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso disappeared as the cells entered zzso although zzso cells undergo a closed zzso in which the nuclear envelope zzso does not break zzso zzso knockout cells exhibited zzso nuclear architecture, characterized by enlarged and zzso zzso and loss of proper zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso At the zzso loss of zzso resulted in defects in the organization and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The multiple defects that the loss of zzso generated at the zzso can be explained by its zzso division cycle, transitioning into the zzso as it divides at zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose that zzso is required at zzso to maintain proper nuclear architecture, and before zzso from the nucleus, zzso is part of the zzso zzso zzso
