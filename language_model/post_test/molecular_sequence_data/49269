zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso which consists of a zzso zzso zzso and an accessory zzso escort protein zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso to zzso has been solved to zzso A zzso The complex interface zzso a surprisingly small surface area of zzso zzso A and is unexpectedly formed by zzso 8, 10, and 12 of the zzso alpha zzso and zzso D and E of zzso We demonstrate that the affinity of zzso for zzso is zzso regulated by zzso via a long-range zzso signal zzso zzso Comparing the structure of zzso with the closely related zzso we conclude that the specificity of the zzso interaction is defined by differently positioned zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso
