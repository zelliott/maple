We have used reporter gene zzso to study the zzso regulation of the zzso gene zzso zzso in transgenic zzso We identified a 5 zzso regulatory unit, which was able to reproduce important aspects of the initial zzso of the gene along the major body zzso The comparison of the zzso sequence of this DNA zzso with the corresponding avian zzso region revealed the presence of seven highly zzso stretches of DNA outside the protein coding zzso In particular, the 3' zzso region contained two such zzso that are required to mediate the embryonic zzso A zzso construct containing the two short zzso regions from the chicken gene could replace the complete zzso zzso thus demonstrating that the zzso zzso carry the main regulatory elements involved in this zzso The first half of this zzso regulatory region has zzso activity when tested with a zzso promoter, while the second half is required to restrict the zzso activity to the proper expression zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso cooperation between regulatory elements is required to control properly the activity of the zzso zzso
