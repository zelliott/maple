A linear zzso zzso construct with an upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' protruding single zzso zzso and a downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso mouse zzso The injected DNA fragments integrated into the mouse zzso primarily as a zzso tandem zzso zzso junctions were obtained from seven of eight transgenic zzso All of the junctions occurred in the proximity of a zzso zzso end; a maximum loss of 8 zzso from the zzso zzso was zzso Two of these junctions completely preserved the zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso junctions from two animals were zzso zzso junctions that completely preserved both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 3' zzso were found in each zzso These are the first examples of complete zzso preservation at junctions formed between a zzso zzso zzso and a 3' zzso zzso in transgenic zzso The data are consistent with the zzso model of zzso et zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso in which alignment proteins zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso DNA zzso then zzso the recessed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as a primer to zzso DNA across the zzso This mechanism results in the formation of junctions with no loss of zzso The results described in the present paper suggest that this mechanism may be involved in the formation of junctions in transgenic zzso
