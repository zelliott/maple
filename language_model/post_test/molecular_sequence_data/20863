It is a classical result of Stein and zzso that the zzso number of zzso secondary structures is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we study zzso zzso for two special zzso of zzso secondary structures - zzso and saturated zzso zzso secondary structures are defined to have no lonely zzso base zzso This class of secondary structures was introduced by zzso et zzso who noted that the run time of Vienna zzso Package is substantially reduced when restricting zzso to zzso zzso Here we provide an explanation for the zzso by proving that the zzso number of zzso zzso secondary structures is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that the expected number of base pairs in a zzso secondary structure is zzso zzso zzso The zzso number of zzso secondary structures was obtained much earlier by zzso Schuster and zzso using a different zzso zzso secondary structures have the property that no base pairs can be added without violating the definition of secondary structure zzso introducing a zzso or base zzso Here we show that the zzso number of saturated structures is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso expected number of base pairs is zzso zzso zzso and the zzso number of saturated zzso structures is zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the number zzso - 2) of zzso zzso structures as classically zzso by Stein and zzso Finally, we apply the work of zzso to show that the density of states for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary structures is zzso zzso We introduce a zzso greedy method to sample random saturated structures, called zzso saturated structures, and show that the expected number of base pairs is zzso zzso zzso
