zzso are the most common infectious agents of zzso They are the principal zzso agents of zzso viral zzso infections (the common zzso Human zzso zzso comprise a zzso within the family zzso There are zzso zzso distinct members of this zzso In order to better understand their zzso relationship, the zzso sequence for the major surface protein of the virus zzso zzso was determined for all known zzso zzso and one zzso isolate zzso zzso analysis of deduced zzso acid sequence data support previous studies zzso the zzso into two species containing all but one zzso zzso zzso Seventy-five zzso zzso and zzso belong to species zzso and zzso zzso zzso belong to species zzso Located within zzso is a zzso pocket into which zzso zzso compounds such as zzso bind and inhibit functions associated with the virus zzso zzso of the zzso acids that constitute this pocket indicate that the sequence zzso strongly with virus zzso to zzso zzso Further, zzso acid changes observed in reduced zzso zzso viruses recovered from patients enrolled in clinical trials with zzso were distinct from those that zzso natural zzso resistance to the zzso These observations suggest that it is possible to differentiate zzso naturally resistant to zzso function zzso from those that emerge from susceptible virus populations as a result of zzso drug selection pressure based on sequence analysis of the zzso zzso
