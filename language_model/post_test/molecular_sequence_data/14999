The ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso formation while preventing zzso deletion is believed to be crucial to maintain zzso integrity in zzso However, little is known on the molecular mechanisms behind these properties of zzso In this report, we show that zzso greatly increases the rate of Holliday junction zzso formation and blocks the zzso by various types of zzso resolving activities, including the newly identified human zzso zzso By using zzso zzso probing and differential scanning zzso we reveal that the basic domain of zzso zzso structural changes to the zzso We propose that zzso contributes to zzso zzso by stimulating zzso formation and by preventing zzso zzso These findings provide novel insights into the interplay between zzso protection and zzso zzso and suggest a general model in which zzso maintains zzso integrity by controlling the turnover of zzso at zzso and at zzso replication zzso
