A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously identified by us as being defective in nuclear export of zzso zzso when grown at restrictive zzso Here, we report the isolation of the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes are highly zzso in evolution in both structure and zzso The human zzso zzso when expressed from the zzso can suppress partially the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso This is also reflected by increased zzso zzso export at a restrictive zzso An zzso zzso human zzso zzso to both the nucleus and the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the potential role of zzso in nuclear zzso trafficking in zzso and higher zzso zzso
