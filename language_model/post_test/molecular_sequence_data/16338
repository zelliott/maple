The genes coding for zzso N zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso libraries using the zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene has an open reading frame coding for zzso zzso zzso identical in size to that of the previously cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso A partial zzso sequence was also determined for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences of all three zzso zzso proteins shows that they exhibit more than zzso zzso close to that found in comparisons among zzso zzso proteins and significantly greater than that found, approximately zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso of a single family of microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso genes of the above zzso species were used to detect analogous genes in eight other strains that included both zzso and zzso producers and zzso Each producer strain responded with all three zzso zzso the presence of an zzso zzso Surprisingly, several zzso strains also responded with one or two of the zzso Our results suggest that zzso genes may be more prevalent in zzso than previously zzso
