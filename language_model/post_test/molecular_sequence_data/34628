zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play a key role in the zzso zzso of aromatic zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso We have developed a system in which the zzso of zzso by zzso human zzso expressed in zzso coli, can be detected by the appearance of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is based on the zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the host strain for the zzso is devoid of zzso zzso activity and a zzso zzso is used for expression of human zzso A zzso version of the zzso zzso rapid screening of pools of zzso zzso generated (for example) by random zzso Along with the methods for these zzso we present selected results of a screening effort in which zzso along the length of the zzso sequence have been zzso zzso modeling and simulated zzso have been used to analyze the potential effects of these zzso on structural integrity and zzso zzso
