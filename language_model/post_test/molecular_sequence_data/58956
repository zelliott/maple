The zzso mating type locus B alpha 1 of zzso commune encodes a zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso A comparison of two zzso zzso receptors that share the same specificity B alpha 1 was performed using strains of different geographic zzso The zzso acid sequence alignment revealed strong conservation of the largest part of the zzso Only in the zzso zzso major zzso acid was divergence zzso This zzso region of 117 of the total of zzso zzso acids was shown to be unnecessary for function in zzso by transformation zzso
