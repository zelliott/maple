Following zzso transplantation in adult zzso Fischer 344 rats, zzso cultured rat liver zzso cells zzso modified to carry the zzso coli zzso reporter gene and/or the fluorescent membrane dye zzso integrate into zzso plates and acquire the size and nuclear structure of mature zzso Additionally, of two zzso zzso transformed derivatives of zzso cells, both of which produce aggressively growing tumors when transplanted zzso cells of one line zzso do not produce tumors in the liver but integrate into zzso plates and zzso zzso The other transformed line zzso retains zzso in the liver, but cells in the zzso tumors are more differentiated zzso than are tumors at subcutaneous zzso These results suggest that zzso cells are zzso cells for zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso them to incorporate into zzso plates and zzso Our results also suggest that the zzso zzso regulates the differentiation of some zzso transformed zzso zzso cells, thereby eliminating or reducing their zzso zzso
