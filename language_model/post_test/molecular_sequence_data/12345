We investigated whether zzso genes were activated in human zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from six lung zzso and seven zzso zzso were extracted by mechanical disruption and isolated by double density zzso of zzso We performed zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso on these fresh zzso zzso and zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso using zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we compared patients' zzso and zzso populations with healthy normal and zzso activated zzso as an zzso activated reference zzso zzso bands of zzso products were zzso in relative units zzso as a function of their size and intensity by computerized zzso Lung and brain patients' zzso showed zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso expressed in the average of zzso zzso but not significantly different from zzso and normal healthy zzso zzso zzso and zzso also did not appear expressed in the zzso at higher levels than in zzso or healthy normal zzso However in two thirds of patients, lung zzso could be distinguished from zzso zzso by specific expression of zzso and from healthy normal zzso by expression of zzso Similarly, most brain zzso expressed zzso significantly above healthy normal zzso for zzso and zzso In comparison with zzso activated healthy zzso our results suggest that lung and brain zzso had zzso zzso zzso but they seemed poorly activated in total number of genes and amount of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
