We have identified a family of repetitive zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso They vary greatly in size (in a zzso zzso zzso and appear to represent 3' terminal fragments of a larger zzso Two zzso were zzso on the basis of zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso as well as a very low sequence zzso Most copies are flanked by terminal direct repeats, suggesting that their spreading involves zzso events rather than zzso zzso are found in very few copies in zzso zzso The spreading of these sequences within the zzso zzso is zzso
