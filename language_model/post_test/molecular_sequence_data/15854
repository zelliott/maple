The crystal and molecular structure of zzso K was determined by X-ray zzso data to zzso zzso The zzso belongs to the zzso family with an zzso zzso zzso zzso but is a representative of a zzso with a free zzso close to and zzso the active zzso Besides this zzso zzso K has two zzso bonds, zzso and zzso which contribute to the stability of the zzso structure consisting of an extended central parallel zzso decorated by six zzso three short zzso zzso 18 zzso and involving several zzso structurally important water zzso zzso K exhibits two zzso sites, one very strong and the other weak, which were the sites of the heavy atoms zzso zzso used to solve the crystal zzso The weak binding site is zzso to the N and C zzso zzso and zzso and is only incompletely coordinated by oxygen zzso The strong binding site is coordinated in the form of a zzso zzso with the side chain zzso of zzso and the C zzso O of zzso as zzso and C zzso O of zzso and four water molecules in the equatorial zzso Upon removal of this zzso zzso K loses activity which is interpreted in terms of a local structural deformation involving the zzso site zzso probably associated with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Several water molecules are located in the active zzso One, zzso is positioned in the zzso zzso and is displaced by the C zzso O of the zzso zzso bond of the zzso as indicated by zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso Based on these experiments, a reaction mechanism is proposed where the zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso zzso sheet with the recognition site of zzso K consisting of zzso on one side and zzso on the other, followed by expulsion of the zzso hole water zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso These latter zzso display low zzso motion corresponding to zzso geometry and are hardly accessible to zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso acids are more flexible and partially exposed to zzso
