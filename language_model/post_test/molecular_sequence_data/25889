The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso 4 and 7 zzso zzso A zzso library was constructed using zzso from maturing zzso bean zzso as zzso zzso containing sequences complementary to zzso zzso were isolated by zzso using as a probe a mixture of synthetic zzso representing sequences predicted for a zzso present in the zzso zzso large zzso The zzso sequence contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso of 258 zzso acid zzso The zzso included both zzso of the previously zzso zzso zzso In addition, this precursor included two further zzso sequences which, in term of their size and zzso zzso zzso typically found in seed proteins of the zzso zzso zzso possible represent the small and large zzso zzso of a second zzso storage zzso A zzso processing scheme is proposed which would result in a single zzso generating two distinct zzso zzso zzso The generation of a second zzso seems likely since zzso candidates for its small and large zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein sequencing confirmed the existence of the putative small zzso
