In zzso zzso an zzso binding protein called zzso regulates both zzso and translation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso species that grows at high zzso Previous studies of this zzso have focused on mechanisms of adaptation for growth in alkaline zzso We have characterized the regulation of the zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso and compared it to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the first zzso in the zzso to zzso is regulated significantly less in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso shows that only zzso is zzso whereas in zzso zzso both zzso of the zzso and translation of zzso are zzso The zzso mechanism that controls zzso in zzso zzso is similar to that in zzso zzso but there are some differences in the predicted zzso secondary structures in the zzso zzso zzso leader region, including the presence of a potential zzso zzso zzso of zzso which is within the folate zzso in both zzso is regulated similarly in the two zzso
