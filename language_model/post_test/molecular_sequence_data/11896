The zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the first component of complement, zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that zzso is a membrane protein of guinea pig zzso zzso zzso zzso To extend this observation as a general zzso characteristic of M zzso we investigated human zzso zzso M zzso Interestingly, surface labeling with the zzso zzso zzso of M zzso freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso occurs only on the surface of M zzso and not on the surface of the other cells zzso zzso zzso appears to be a marker for differentiation into M zzso zzso fixed zzso zzso coupled to membrane zzso via a zzso zzso zzso were used to demonstrate that membrane zzso is capable of zzso zzso Various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso M zzso is tightly bound to or located in the intact zzso since treatment of cells with zzso buffers zzso zzso failed to remove zzso from the cell zzso However, repeated freezing and zzso of cells and washing of zzso zzso with buffer containing 1 M zzso and 3 M zzso brought about a marked release of membrane zzso
