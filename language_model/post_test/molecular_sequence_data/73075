The zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein which organizes the zzso zzso in a large complex, called the zzso zzso comprises a series of functional zzso amongst which is a single zzso domain and nine zzso zzso which are responsible for zzso the individual zzso zzso into the zzso The zzso zzso are highly zzso in their primary zzso acid zzso These zzso interact with a complementary domain, termed the zzso domain, one of which is located on each zzso zzso The zzso interaction is the crucial interaction for complex formation in the zzso The determination of structural information about the zzso domain will provide insights into zzso assembly and zzso 

We have determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of one of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 2) at zzso A zzso The domain forms a zzso beta sandwich with a zzso zzso somewhat similar to the fold displayed by its neighboring zzso zzso 

The compact nature of the zzso structure and its lack of a defined binding pocket suggests that binding between the zzso and zzso zzso is characterized by interactions between exposed surface zzso As the zzso interaction appears to be rather zzso the binding face would presumably be characterized by surface zzso which exhibit both zzso conservation and zzso zzso Within the same species, zzso surface zzso may reflect the position of a given zzso domain within the zzso zzso its orientation and interactions with neighboring zzso
