Southern zzso and zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso clones indicate that this zzso fungus contains at least six genes with significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso I gene zzso Using zzso gel zzso to separate zzso zzso zzso the six zzso genes were found to zzso to at least three different zzso one of which is zzso The organization of these genes was similar in another zzso zzso strain, ME zzso It is clear that, unlike zzso zzso the most well-studied zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a complex, zzso gene zzso
