Among zzso zzso strains isolated from various plant leaves collected from zzso forests in eastern and central China, four strains forming cream to zzso zzso colonies were revealed to represent three novel zzso species by conventional and molecular zzso zzso analysis based on combined sequences of the internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso domain showed that strains zzso and zzso were zzso and closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the branch formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with strong zzso zzso zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso The strains differed significantly from their close relatives in zzso and ITS sequences and in zzso zzso Three novel species are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
