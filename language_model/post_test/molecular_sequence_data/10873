The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso complexes involved in the recognition of sorting signals present within the zzso domain of integral membrane zzso The medium chains of these complexes, zzso and zzso have been implicated in two types of zzso assembly with the zzso and zzso chains of the corresponding complexes and recognition of zzso sorting zzso In this study, we report the results of a zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso chains aimed at identifying regions of the molecules that are responsible for each of the two zzso zzso using the zzso zzso system and zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso and zzso have a zzso structure, with the zzso one-third zzso zzso of zzso and zzso being involved in assembly with the beta chains and the zzso two-thirds zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso binding zzso sorting zzso These observations support a model in which the zzso one-third of zzso is embedded within the core of the zzso complex, while the zzso two-thirds of the protein are exposed to the zzso placing this region in a position to interact with zzso sorting zzso
