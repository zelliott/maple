No zzso parameters of in zzso or zzso vertical transmission of zzso to newborns are known at zzso zzso transmission may be related to several biological parameters of maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso the concentration of viral particles and/or infected zzso and zzso the selection of zzso subspecies of particular cellular zzso The present study was designed to examine the relationship between cellular viral burden and transmission, and between maternal viral burden and zzso cell count and clinical status at zzso 

We investigated zzso zzso transmission at delivery in a cohort of 51 pairs of mothers and zzso Twelve infants were zzso as determined by successive zzso chain reaction and culture zzso within the first 6 months of life, and nine of these were diagnosed as zzso during the first week of zzso We determined peripheral blood zzso cell zzso DNA burden using a quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso chain reaction was performed in the zzso gag zzso using zzso zzso External standard DNA samples were from the zzso zzso cell line, which contains a unique defective zzso DNA zzso 

There was a linear relationship between the zzso of zzso and the number of zzso DNA zzso 

We have previously reported that the number of zzso zzso copies in maternal blood cells is related to transmission of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction may be used as a zzso zzso of vertical transmission if accompanied by an exhaustive clinical and biological follow-up during zzso
