zzso zzso factor zzso affects the development of many types of cells, including zzso and retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of at least three zzso zzso zzso and zzso differing at their zzso and expression zzso Here, we characterize the structural organization of the human zzso zzso The gene contains at least four zzso first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso to 3' direction, each of which encodes the unique zzso of a given zzso including newly identified zzso The zzso regions of these zzso zzso are termed promoters A, zzso B and M, respectively, which showed different promoter activities, as judged by transient zzso zzso zzso A directs the expression of a reporter gene in zzso cervical cancer and melanoma cells, whereas promoter M is functional only in melanoma zzso zzso H showed the significant activity in zzso and cervical cancer cells but not in melanoma zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso showed no noticeable promoter activity in these cell zzso zzso alternative promoters provide the zzso gene with the diversity in zzso regulation and the capability of generating structurally different protein zzso
