zzso is a single zzso chain of zzso zzso acids that is folded into two zzso zzso of nearly equal size that are connected by a 16 zzso acid zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso were inserted into the zzso zzso through zzso zzso to produce the new zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso when zzso was virtually zzso in all properties tested and gave a specific activity that was at least zzso of the zzso However, the zzso zzso was considerably less stable to zzso compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso surfaces in the zzso were more easily exposed, and the formation of intermediate folding states was zzso The rate of zzso zzso was slightly less for the zzso and the yield of active zzso was somewhat zzso The zzso introduced a new zzso zzso zzso site, but this site was not accessible in the native zzso which was as resistant to zzso as the zzso zzso However, zzso with low zzso of zzso that could form folding zzso allowed facile zzso of the zzso to give fragments that appeared to represent the individual zzso In addition, the zzso zzso could be zzso close to one end of the zzso a position that is far from the site of zzso and which was not readily zzso in the zzso zzso or the native form of the zzso These results indicate that zzso in the zzso zzso can have dramatic effects on the stability and zzso transitions of zzso
