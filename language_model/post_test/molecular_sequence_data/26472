Many clinical approaches for the treatment of zzso tumors are being developed based on zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso axis forms the basis for zzso applications of zzso zzso like zzso and new zzso zzso free of zzso effects such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso have been used in patients with prostate cancer and might be also beneficial for the treatment of breast cancer and zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso Some of the effects of zzso zzso can be due to direct action since zzso receptors have been found in these zzso The use of sustained delivery systems based on zzso of zzso makes the treatment more zzso zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso and related zzso were designed specifically for zzso zzso These zzso zzso by virtue of having a wide spectrum of activities appear to inhibit various tumors through multiple zzso zzso zzso actions of zzso zzso appear to be zzso by specific receptors located on tumor zzso High affinity binding sites for zzso and related zzso have been found in human zzso zzso breast and zzso zzso and brain tumors such as zzso In zzso administration of analog zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso prostate zzso in rats, zzso zzso tumors in mice and zzso zzso pancreatic zzso in zzso Combination of zzso of zzso with zzso results in synergistic zzso of the zzso of these zzso zzso analog zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the object of further experimental studies and clinical trials aimed at the exploration of their zzso effects on the processes of zzso zzso
