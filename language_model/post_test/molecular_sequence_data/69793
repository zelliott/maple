zzso plasmids containing zzso copies of different zzso replacement zzso of wheat dwarf virus zzso were used to study the mechanism leading to the release of replicating zzso molecules in suspension culture cells of zzso zzso For plasmids bearing two complete zzso the viral unit bracketed by the two large zzso regions zzso becomes zzso zzso zzso of a third copy of the zzso on the zzso zzso is necessary for release of both zzso zzso with the same zzso Using plasmids containing a single viral zzso flanked by two different hybrid zzso we show that the sequence zzso which is part of the zzso zzso zzso motif of the potential hairpin structure, is the region of the zzso within which the release of zzso molecules zzso Moreover, the data suggest that this release results primarily from zzso zzso also in situations where zzso zzso zzso is simultaneously zzso
