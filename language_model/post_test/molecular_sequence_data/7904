The zzso gene products are zzso zzso containing a zzso which function as a class of master control proteins establishing the body plan in organisms as diverse as zzso and zzso zzso proteins have recently been shown to bind zzso to DNA with another class of zzso proteins that include zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene products contain a highly zzso zzso connected by a zzso of variable length to the zzso We show that the zzso and the zzso region are required for zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Many of the zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso are required to zzso the DNA binding of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso relative to the zzso is zzso Although deletions of two and four zzso of the zzso zzso still show cooperative DNA zzso removal of all six zzso zzso strongly reduces zzso In addition, an zzso of 10 zzso within the zzso zzso significantly lowers cooperative DNA zzso These results show that the zzso and the position of the zzso relative to the zzso are important zzso to allow cooperative DNA binding involving zzso and zzso gene zzso
