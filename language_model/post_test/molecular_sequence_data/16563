The zzso zzso are zzso zzso that transport zzso and zzso across the membrane generating chemical and electrical zzso essential to maintain the resting potential for the zzso of zzso and zzso and for transport of zzso The zzso zzso a full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso acids and a predicted molecular mass of zzso The protein displays strong sequence zzso and zzso motifs typical of zzso zzso zzso Northern and Southern zzso reveal a zzso zzso of about zzso which is zzso by a single zzso zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of zzso recognized a zzso zzso in the membrane fraction of adult and zzso stages of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso studies using the same zzso revealed that the zzso is zzso localized in muscle cells and zzso zzso and in small quantities in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
