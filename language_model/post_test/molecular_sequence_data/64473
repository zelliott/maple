zzso pig zzso hormone zzso is predicted to have a unique structure among all known forms of zzso zzso zzso 138 (1997) zzso and it is of great interest to determine whether the unique structure of zzso is zzso in the characteristics of the guinea pig zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated a full-length zzso for a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the guinea zzso The putative guinea pig zzso zzso protein has an zzso acid identity of zzso with zzso type I zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso which have been demonstrated to be important for zzso binding and signal zzso were zzso in the guinea pig zzso zzso However, there are several specific zzso acid zzso among zzso type I zzso zzso Moreover, though the guinea pig has generally been classified as a zzso the putative zzso zzso protein did not have some zzso zzso Total zzso zzso demonstrated that the cloned guinea pig zzso zzso is a functional zzso zzso and that it shows different preference of zzso sensitivities from the rat zzso zzso
