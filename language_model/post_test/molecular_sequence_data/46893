The zzso zzso in zzso zzso was designed to investigate differences between two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso localized in the zzso active site region, zzso is replaced by zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso acid zzso are the only two known to occupy this position in the zzso zzso zzso The data from the kinetic analysis revealed that replacement of zzso with zzso in zzso zzso decreased the zzso towards all zzso tested to values comparable with those of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso appeared to be less stable compared to the zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the interaction with the inhibitor zzso indicated differences in the binding between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso although less active, binds zzso stronger zzso zzso with zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso In all zzso zzso the binding of zzso was clearly driven by zzso with a slightly favorable zzso zzso The binding of another zzso zzso zzso was about zzso orders of magnitude weaker zzso zzso with zzso than that of zzso From comparison of kinetic parameters for the zzso and zzso zzso it can be deduced that the zzso does not play a critical role in zzso zzso However, results from differential scanning zzso demonstrate an important role of the zzso zzso in the zzso stability of zzso
