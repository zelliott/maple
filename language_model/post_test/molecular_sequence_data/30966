Six groups, designated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the envelope zzso zzso of zzso Forest virus zzso have been used to analyze zzso changes caused by differences in the zzso chain composition of the envelope zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of terminal zzso acids as observed in virus progeny from zzso cells did not affect zzso zzso zzso of the trimming zzso in infected chicken cells by the zzso I inhibitor zzso led to infectious virus particles containing zzso zzso of the composition zzso in the envelope zzso This zzso had no effect on zzso If zzso was, however, performed with zzso which acts on zzso giving rise to zzso with zzso containing three additional zzso zzso in the zzso chains zzso significant zzso changes were zzso The six zzso were differently affected by the underlying structural change and the pattern of zzso of zzso was not identical with that observed after zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso rate of zzso the zzso precursor zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the virus zzso was reduced causing a reduction of virus zzso It is concluded that the existence of zzso zzso chains is sufficient to allow zzso zzso The trimming reactions improve this process in a matter suggesting that the zzso chains influence zzso traffic zzso of the respective zzso
