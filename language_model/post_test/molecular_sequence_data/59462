zzso zzso the agent of zzso cannot be continuously cultivated in zzso To identify zzso genes zzso exported zzso we performed zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso DNA library in zzso zzso zzso zzso was chosen for further study based on partial zzso sequence obtained from zzso containing a zzso zzso A complete open reading frame zzso and a truncated zzso zzso were identified in the zzso DNA of zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of 531 zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has zzso to the zzso proteins of zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso motif that is found in integral zzso membrane proteins of zzso cassette (ABC) transport zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has zzso to the zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located downstream of zzso consistent with the gene order of previously identified zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the first zzso ABC transport system identified in this zzso
