We have developed a convenient procedure to measure the activity of zzso zzso and other zzso with zzso zzso zzso The method is based on the use of a zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso activity is directly determined by measuring the release of zzso from the zzso This method should prove useful in the study of the molecular mechanism of action of zzso A and other zzso zzso
