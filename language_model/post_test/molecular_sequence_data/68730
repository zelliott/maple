zzso zzso factors can be identified and classified according to zzso zzso motifs and zzso regulatory zzso The functional and structural analysis, and the conservation of these genes among zzso emphasizes the importance of these zzso proteins in development and zzso In order to identify genes with common zzso motifs in the zzso of zzso zzso we have cloned a zinc finger zzso gene of the structure zzso Using the zzso zzso sex determining zzso gene as a probe we have identified two zzso related genes in the zzso of zzso zzso The zinc finger region of one of these genes zzso was zzso and zzso The predicted protein has at least eight consecutive zinc fingers and each finger possesses the characteristic paired zzso and zzso zzso and the proper spacing of the zzso acids between the zzso zzso
