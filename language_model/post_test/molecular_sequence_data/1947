zzso of zzso at the zzso of zzso resulted in a large decrease of both zzso and zzso zzso Thus, this zzso localized outside the binding pocket, seems to play a key role in supporting the proper structure and shape of the binding zzso In addition, zzso of zzso also caused a large decrease of both zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of our computer model, we hypothesized that a hydrogen bond between zzso and zzso supports the connection of two opposite halves of the zzso zzso To verify this hypothesis, we have also prepared the construct containing both these zzso zzso of neither zzso nor zzso to this double zzso differed from binding to any of the single zzso This strongly supported the existence of the hydrogen bond between zzso and zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso seems to be substantial for the proper interaction of the third and fourth zzso of the zzso which both contain zzso that take part in zzso zzso zzso of zzso affected only zzso but not zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso adopt different positions in the zzso zzso On the basis of a recently published crystal structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we improved our model and zzso the interaction of these two zzso with the zzso This model is in good agreement with all previously reported zzso data and revealed that zzso forms a hydrogen bond with the zzso group of the zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso
