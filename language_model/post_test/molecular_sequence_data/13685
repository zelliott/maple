We have previously shown that the zzso expression of muscle zzso zzso is decreased in zzso diabetic zzso zzso the objective of the present protocol was to examine whether the gene expression of muscle zzso zzso in zzso is affected by chronic zzso zzso Ten obese patients with zzso were studied before and after 8 weeks of treatment with a zzso diet in combination with the zzso zzso zzso treatment was associated with significant reductions in zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso as well as enhanced zzso responses to an oral zzso zzso During zzso zzso clamp (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with indirect zzso a zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso disposal rate, predominantly due to an increased zzso zzso metabolism zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso patients when compared to zzso zzso In zzso obtained from zzso zzso muscle during insulin infusion, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was achieved at a significantly lower concentration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, despite significant increases in both zzso zzso zzso metabolism and muscle zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients no changes were found in levels of zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein in zzso In conclusion, improved blood zzso control in zzso obese zzso patients has no impact on the gene expression of muscle zzso zzso
