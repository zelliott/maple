The effect of a synthetic zzso zzso sequence of human growth hormone, zzso zzso zzso on zzso transport in zzso isolated from zzso zzso rats was zzso The results showed that the synthetic zzso induced a reduction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso In comparison with the intact zzso of human growth hormone zzso the synthetic zzso at zzso zzso was found to be more zzso These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the functional domain responsible for the zzso activity of zzso resides in the zzso region of the zzso zzso and the effect on zzso transport may zzso at least in part, to the zzso property of the zzso zzso zzso as well as of the intact zzso
