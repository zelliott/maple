zzso zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso family zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the regulation of cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso proteins were reported to mediate their zzso membrane zzso and to be essential for their zzso To further dissect the mechanism of the plasma membrane zzso of zzso we introduced various zzso of zzso into cultured cells and observed the zzso zzso When an zzso domain zzso lacking zzso acid zzso zzso at the zzso zzso terminal region was zzso in cells, the zzso did not zzso at the plasma zzso but localized in the zzso We found that zzso 14 and 16 at the zzso region of zzso are in zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso 14 and/or zzso 16 were changed to zzso did not zzso at the plasma zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso is necessary for its plasma membrane zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso which lacked the latter half of zzso was zzso but did not zzso at the plasma zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso are required for the plasma membrane zzso of zzso
