Class 1 outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso group B is considered a promising vaccine candidate because zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be protective in an animal zzso We have previously described the production of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as zzso inclusion bodies, from which the protein zzso is easily zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1992, zzso We show here that the zzso zzso can be zzso into zzso zzso with the formation of the native zzso surface zzso The zzso completely zzso zzso was fused with zzso zzso during zzso removal by dialysis or gel zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso When mice were zzso with these zzso they produced high zzso of zzso reacting in a zzso zzso manner with zzso cells indicating the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The results suggest that a vaccine candidate for zzso disease could be developed from the zzso They zzso demonstrate the feasibility of zzso a zzso outer membrane zzso which has never been exposed to zzso into a zzso zzso
