In zzso mouse zzso cells, zzso type alkaline zzso zzso zzso activity is induced by zzso acid at zzso between zzso and zzso zzso At lower zzso zzso acid is incapable of inducing this zzso activity per se, but increases zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect is observed after incubation of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso is dependent on the order of addition of zzso acid and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso addition of the two agents, or addition of zzso prior to zzso acid (but not addition of zzso acid before zzso is necessary to produce this synergistic zzso The zzso results in increased zzso levels of zzso zzso and it is the consequence of increased zzso activity of the zzso The expression of the mouse zzso gene is regulated by the presence of two leader zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the synthesis of two alternatively spliced zzso that are different only in part of their zzso untranslated region zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification and nuclear zzso experiments performed using zzso specific for each leader zzso demonstrate that treatment of these cells with zzso acid, zzso or zzso zzso and with the combination of the zzso and one of the zzso agents, leads to the zzso of nascent and mature zzso zzso containing zzso zzso The synergistic induction of the zzso of the zzso gene is well correlated with quantitative and qualitative changes of zzso zzso zzso by zzso
