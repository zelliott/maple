zzso is a novel zzso zzso protein that exhibits significant sequence similarity with the members of the sugar transport zzso family zzso of zzso acids identical with zzso Human and mouse sequence zzso identical zzso zzso comprise 12 putative zzso zzso and several zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso which have previously been shown to be essential for transport activity, zzso zzso in loop 2, zzso in loop 6, zzso in zzso 7, zzso in loop 8, zzso in zzso 10, and zzso in the zzso zzso An expressed sequence tag zzso zzso corresponding with the zzso region of zzso has previously been mapped to human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso expressed a zzso protein exhibiting specific, zzso zzso B binding zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso and zzso zzso transport activity zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso protein zzso 10 zzso versus zzso zzso zzso in control zzso In human zzso a zzso pair transcript was predominantly found in zzso but not in zzso zzso Lower amounts of the zzso were detected in most other zzso including skeletal muscle, heart, small zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso from adult, but not from zzso zzso its expression in human zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is a sugar transport zzso with zzso transport activity and a zzso regulated zzso zzso
