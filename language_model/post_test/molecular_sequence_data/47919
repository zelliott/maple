An zzso gene zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is activated in all zzso zzso by the zzso zzso To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the timing of zzso of zzso we studied the zzso organization and the zzso upstream sequences of zzso associated with specific zzso expression of the zzso The restriction site mapping and sequencing of zzso clones showed that the zzso zzso zzso contained two copies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso aligned zzso in about 8 zzso of the zzso Analysis of various deletion zzso with the zzso zzso sequences of zzso revealed that 103 zzso of the zzso zzso region was sufficient for the minimal zzso expression of zzso and that the region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region was associated with the amplification of the minimal expression of the reporter gene in the zzso This module between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also shown to be associated with the timing of the zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso We discussed how the zzso expression pattern of zzso is regulated by the two zzso
