Marine zzso collections have historically been maintained in ethanol following fixation in zzso These collections may represent rare or extinct species or zzso provide detailed zzso samples, or come from presently zzso or zzso zzso We tested the viability of obtaining DNA sequence data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes can be recovered from zzso collections of varying age, and that these sequences are unmodified compared with those derived from frozen zzso These results were zzso among multiple specimens and collections for several zzso Our results indicate that in the absence of fresh or frozen zzso zzso zzso specimens may prove a useful source of material for analysis of gene sequence data by zzso chain reaction zzso and direct zzso
