The evolutionary history and geographical isolation of the Antarctic continent have produced a unique environment rich in endemic zzso In many regions of zzso zzso are the dominant zzso in both aquatic and zzso zzso We have used microscopic and molecular approaches to examine the zzso diversity of zzso at two inland zzso Antarctic sites zzso These are among the most zzso locations where zzso zzso are zzso The results showed a low zzso diversity, with only zzso operational zzso units zzso per sample obtained by a combination of strain zzso clone libraries and zzso zzso gel zzso based on zzso zzso zzso One zzso was potentially endemic to zzso and is present in several regions of the zzso Four zzso were shared by the samples from zzso Pond and the surrounding zzso zzso Only one zzso but no internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso was common to zzso Pond and zzso zzso The ITS sequences were shown to further discriminate different zzso within the zzso ITS sequences from Antarctic locations appear to be more closely related to each other than to zzso zzso Future research in inland zzso zzso will shed more light on the geographical distribution and evolutionary isolation of zzso in these extreme zzso
