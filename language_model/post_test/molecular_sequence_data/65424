zzso 40 zzso is a zzso protein expressed in the heart where it mediates the coordinated electrical zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and provides pathways for direct zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso mice have cardiac zzso abnormalities with a very high zzso of cardiac zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso animals, indicating that zzso plays a vital role in zzso Since several inherited cardiac zzso defects have also been found in dogs, we hypothesized that the clinical findings are genetically linked to a zzso zzso or zzso in the canine zzso zzso We therefore screened the zzso gene in dogs with inherited cardiac zzso defects for zzso In this study, we have identified three zzso base changes zzso zzso zzso in the dogs screened and determined them to be synonymous zzso These zzso however, have recently been found in an unrelated group of normal zzso
