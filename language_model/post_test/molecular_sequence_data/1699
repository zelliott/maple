zzso zzso zzso analysis provides a useful tool for understanding the stages at which zzso differentiate from normal zzso zzso precursor zzso are considered to be zzso zzso However, the variable frequency of zzso of the variable region zzso genes has been described in cases of precursor zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso To better characterize zzso based on the differentiation stage, we investigated the zzso of the zzso genes expressed by tumor cells of the surface zzso zzso zzso cell line derived from childhood zzso In the zzso cell line, the rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso gene sequence showed no zzso in the zzso regions of 1, 2, and 3, or in the framework regions of 1, 2, and 3 relative to the putative zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, the zzso segment of zzso cells showed no zzso sequence zzso indicating ongoing zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso cells express zzso and zzso regulated zzso of zzso genes at the stage of zzso precursor zzso zzso cells, which are derived only from the zzso zzso showed that zzso cannot be recognized in zzso genes of tumor cells before the expression of zzso
