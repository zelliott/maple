The zzso zzso resistance inducing zzso zzso a 34 zzso basic zzso plays a key role in inducing strong systemic resistance in susceptible plants against various plant viruses zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso leaves using zzso raised against the zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso of the zzso zzso The full-length zzso consisted of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso protein showed varying zzso zzso from 11 to zzso to the zzso zzso proteins zzso from other plant zzso zzso inhibited in zzso protein synthesis both in rabbit zzso zzso and wheat germ zzso but not in zzso coli in zzso translation zzso The zzso open reading frame was expressed in an zzso coli expression zzso and the zzso zzso protein inhibited protein synthesis in rabbit zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene may be present in low copy zzso
