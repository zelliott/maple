We recently reported the cloning and sequencing of the alpha 7 zzso chain and its regulated expression during the development of skeletal muscle zzso et zzso (1992) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso The alpha 7 chain is expressed during the development of the zzso lineage and on adult muscle fibers and this suggests that it zzso in multiple and diverse functions at different times during muscle zzso One interesting portion of this zzso is its zzso zzso comprised of 77 zzso acids it is the largest in the alpha chains thus zzso In these experiments we begin to study the potential functions of the alpha 7 zzso domain by analyzing zzso between the rat and human zzso by zzso studies using an zzso domain zzso and by identifying two alternate zzso In keeping with the nomenclature used to describe the alpha 3 and alpha 6 alternate zzso zzso we refer to the originally reported species as alpha zzso and the two additional forms as alpha zzso and alpha zzso These three zzso zzso likely arise as a consequence of alternate zzso A zzso site at the junctions of the zzso and zzso zzso is used to generate the alpha 3, alpha 6 and alpha 7 A and B zzso The alpha zzso form zzso contains an additional 113 zzso compared to the B form, and a common coding region in the A and B form zzso is used in alternate reading zzso Part of the coding region of alpha zzso appears to be used as the zzso region of the alpha zzso zzso The alpha zzso zzso is zzso zzso smaller than the alpha zzso zzso and part of the zzso region of the alpha zzso zzso is used as coding sequence in alpha zzso There is zzso specificity in expression of these alternate zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso transcripts are found upon terminal zzso differentiation whereas alpha zzso is present earlier in replicating cells and diminishes upon zzso We suggest this selective expression of the alpha 7 zzso zzso zzso the diversity in function of the alpha 7 beta 1 zzso at different stages of muscle zzso zzso analyses indicate that the alpha zzso zzso domain zzso a change in zzso in response to binding zzso or upon zzso initiated with zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso also promotes association of the zzso with the cell zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
