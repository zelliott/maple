zzso zzso comprise the zzso machinery that drives progress through the cell cycle, but how they do this in zzso cells is still zzso To identify the mechanisms by which zzso control the cell cycle, we performed a zzso analysis of the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and B1 by quantitative mass zzso This global analysis of zzso protein interactions reveals the zzso dynamics of zzso function in which networks of zzso interactions vary according to the type of zzso and zzso zzso Our results explain the zzso specificity of the zzso machinery, thereby providing a zzso mechanism for the genetic requirement for multiple zzso in zzso and reveal how the actions of specific zzso are coordinated to control the cell zzso Furthermore, we identify key zzso zzso and zzso that reveal how zzso A is able to promote both DNA replication and zzso
