zzso zzso fetal mouse spinal zzso cultures were used to study the mechanisms underlying the differences in persistence of zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Spinal zzso cultures were exposed to zzso zzso zzso for 2-3 days, which converted approximately half of the zzso to an altered form lacking the final nine zzso zzso The distribution of zzso to control zzso remained relatively unchanged for up to 80 days zzso Application of a high concentration of zzso zzso zzso either 25 or 60 days following initial intoxication with zzso converted both normal and zzso zzso into a single population lacking the final 26 zzso zzso Excess zzso was removed by zzso and recovery of intact zzso was monitored by Western zzso zzso The zzso species gradually diminished during the ensuing 18 days, accompanied by the reappearance of both normal and zzso zzso Return of zzso zzso was observed in spite of the absence of zzso in the culture medium during all but the first 3 days of zzso These results indicate that zzso activity associated with the zzso light chain persists inside cells for zzso 11 weeks, while recovery from zzso is complete in zzso 3 zzso This longer duration of zzso activity appears to account for the persistence of zzso A zzso
