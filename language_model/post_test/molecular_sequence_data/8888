zzso zzso and hormones are released through regulated zzso of synaptic zzso and large dense core zzso This complex and highly regulated process is orchestrated by zzso and their associated zzso The triggering signal for regulated zzso is usually an increase in zzso calcium zzso Besides the triggering role, calcium signaling zzso the precise amount and zzso of zzso zzso Thus, it is a central question to understand the molecular zzso responsible for calcium sensing in zzso Here we provide an overview of our current understanding of calcium sensing in neurotransmitter release and hormone zzso
