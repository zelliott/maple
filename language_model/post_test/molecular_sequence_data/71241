zzso is a novel human plasma zzso protein that is zzso by zzso zzso expressed specifically in zzso zzso Three overlapping clones zzso zzso clones and one zzso zzso containing the human plasma zzso protein zzso gene were isolated and zzso The zzso gene spans zzso and is composed of three zzso from zzso to zzso in size with consensus zzso zzso The sizes of the two zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso regulatory sequences contain putative promoter zzso but no typical zzso zzso The third zzso of this gene contains a long zzso sequence containing three zzso zzso The zzso organization of this gene was very similar to that of obese zzso zzso zzso We also report the zzso mapping of this gene by zzso in zzso zzso zzso using a zzso DNA zzso as a zzso The zzso gene was located on human zzso zzso The zzso sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the zzso zzso sequence databases with the zzso numbers zzso zzso or zzso
