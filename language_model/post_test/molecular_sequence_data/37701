zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso with two different, but structurally zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso to study similarities and differences between independently evolved zzso zzso and sequence analysis coupled with zzso zzso and modeling studies reveal that the defining event in the evolution of these zzso was a zzso zzso that placed a zzso zzso in a deep, yet otherwise zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso may be as readily selected from the immune repertoire as the traditional zzso interactions that have formed the basis of zzso until this zzso Further, we believe that these experiments zzso the defining events in the evolution of nature's zzso particularly as they relate to chemical zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso
