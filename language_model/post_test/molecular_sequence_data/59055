In a screen for genes that interact with the zzso zzso we have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso studied to date, zzso is essential for normal embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso during eye development interferes with cell cycle progression and interacts genetically with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso parallels the exit of cells from the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso delay the normal cell cycle exit during zzso many cells complete an additional cycle and subsequently become zzso Thus, zzso functions during zzso to achieve a precisely timed exit from the cell zzso
