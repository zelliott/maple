zzso cells induced to differentiate with zzso acid zzso increase zzso of the tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso Further treatment of these cells with zzso zzso zzso results in an additional stimulation of zzso gene zzso To investigate the mechanism of this zzso regulation, 4 zzso pairs zzso of zzso sequence from the zzso zzso gene was zzso Two major start sites for zzso were found, neither of which depended on a classical zzso motif for correct zzso By using transient zzso zzso it was determined that zzso of zzso sequence could zzso on reporter genes the same zzso zzso expression as was observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of this zzso zzso showed that 190 zzso of zzso sequence was sufficient to bestow the same degree of zzso regulation on reporter gene zzso Within this region of DNA, sequence analysis revealed a possible zzso regulatory element, a zzso recognition zzso two potential zzso sites, and five potential binding sites for zzso factor zzso The deletion experiments, coupled with the positions of these potential zzso zzso suggest that multiple zzso factors, including those that bind to zzso regulatory element, zzso zzso and zzso sites, may be involved in regulation of the zzso gene during zzso cell zzso
