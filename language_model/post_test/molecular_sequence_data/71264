To clarify the role of Clock in the zzso signal zzso of rat zzso clock, we cloned and zzso rat Clock and examined the effect of a single light pulse on the Clock zzso expression in the zzso nucleus zzso by in zzso zzso zzso were exposed to a 30 zzso light pulse ( approximately 300 zzso at one of six zzso zzso in constant darkness zzso and sacrificed 60 zzso after the light zzso In the rats without light exposure, the zzso level in the zzso was high at zzso zzso zzso 6 and low at zzso 18 and zzso Light exposure increased Clock zzso level in the zzso in phase dependent zzso The zzso level was significantly increased during the zzso night zzso The light had no effect on the zzso level during the zzso day zzso and zzso The Clock zzso was also detected in the zzso zzso zzso and increased by light at zzso These results suggest that Clock zzso in the zzso is involved in the zzso signal zzso of zzso clock in zzso
