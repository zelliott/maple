zzso zzso zzso zzso were first identified in bacterial zzso and they were regarded as involved in stable zzso maintenance by a so-called zzso zzso Later, zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified and their function ascribed to survival mechanisms when bacteria were subjected to zzso In the search for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso bacteria, we identified various in the pathogen zzso zzso Two of these zzso sharing zzso with the zzso coli zzso locus were cloned and tested for their zzso The zzso locus resulted to be a bona fide zzso zzso The toxin exhibited high toxicity towards zzso coli and zzso pneumoniae, although in the latter, the zzso copy of the antitoxin zzso gene had to be zzso to detect full zzso Cell growth arrest caused by expression of the zzso toxin gene could be reverted by expression of the zzso antitoxin, zzso although prolonged zzso to the toxin led to cell zzso The zzso zzso locus is the first instance of a zzso zzso zzso system from zzso bacteria characterized in its own zzso We have developed a zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso to detect the interactions between the zzso antitoxin and the zzso toxin in zzso This technique has shown to be amenable to a zzso screening zzso opening new avenues in the search of molecules with potential zzso activity able to inhibit zzso zzso
