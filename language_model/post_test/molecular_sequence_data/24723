zzso zzso sequences of zzso gene of 38 zzso of zzso disease virus zzso of zzso O, A and Asia 1 originating from various parts of India were zzso Field materials were subjected straight to zzso zzso reverse zzso - zzso zzso and zzso Also 3 zzso vaccine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Asia 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso The zzso were compared mutually as well as with available corresponding sequences of other zzso zzso and their zzso relationships were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences showed that the zzso O zzso were relatively zzso as compared to zzso Asia 1 or A zzso from zzso In zzso analysis, the zzso O viruses clustered in two zzso one including the European vaccine strain zzso and the other represented by the zzso from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and zzso The zzso Asia 1 viruses clustered in two groups of single zzso where the zzso strain from Pakistan zzso zzso formed one group and the other was formed by the zzso from Bangladesh, zzso India, Israel and zzso In zzso A viruses three zzso zzso were zzso The zzso from Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and India formed the first zzso The second zzso was formed by zzso from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, while two recent Iranian zzso represented the third zzso In India, the prevalence of at least one zzso could be identified in each zzso This evolutionary zzso of zzso from the neighbor countries is not surprising, since these countries share border with zzso The genetic zzso between sequences of zzso from India and those from distant places is indicative of spread of the virus between the zzso Of importance is the fact that clinical materials proved useful for rapid generation of sequences and subsequent studying of molecular epidemiology of the zzso
