zzso infections mainly cause acute zzso in children and young zzso Human zzso are well characterized zzso and zzso However, information on turkey zzso is zzso We isolated two zzso zzso and zzso from zzso and classified them as two different zzso using a virus zzso zzso To zzso the differences between these two zzso at the molecular level, further genetic characterization and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis were carried zzso The sequences of the complete zzso protein gene of these two zzso were obtained by cloning and zzso The percentage zzso and predicted zzso acid identities for these two sequences along with those of 16 other zzso protein gene sequences from human and animal zzso retrieved from zzso were calculated using zzso The results showed that zzso and zzso had zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso tree of these sequences was generated using zzso 3 software with 1000 zzso zzso The results of evolutionary analysis showed that zzso was closely related genetically to another virus, designated zzso whereas zzso was not as close to zzso as zzso The analysis of the zzso proteins of the two viruses by zzso revealed that they had different band patterns, indicating that their zzso proteins consisted of different viral zzso The findings in this study revealed the molecular differences in the zzso protein gene of zzso and zzso which may provide the molecular basis of the zzso differences between these two zzso of turkey zzso
