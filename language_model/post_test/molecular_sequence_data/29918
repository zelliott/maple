The zzso zzso leader is a zzso zzso zzso region which zzso translation of viral zzso at late times after zzso The zzso leader also zzso the ability to initiate translation independent of the requirement for zzso protein complex or zzso without any requirement for zzso gene zzso To zzso the manner by which the zzso leader functions, the primary zzso of leader activity were investigated in zzso by testing a series of zzso expressed from zzso zzso The results of these experiments indicate that the zzso leader does not promote internal zzso zzso at least in a manner recently described for zzso zzso In addition, despite an unusual arrangement of sequences complementary to the 3' end of zzso zzso in the zzso leader, we could find no evidence for involvement in its translation zzso Instead, our results are consistent with a model in which much of the first leader is maintained in an zzso zzso which determines the ability of the zzso leader to facilitate translation and bypass a normal requirement for zzso zzso Several possible translation models are discussed, as well as the implications for translation of late viral zzso
