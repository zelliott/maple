zzso molecular dynamics are used to look at zzso and dynamic aspects of an zzso zzso inserted in a zzso zzso This approach allows carrying out zzso simulations which bring to light zzso zzso zzso potentially interesting in the context of the membrane fusion mechanism zzso by the zzso zzso We show that these zzso models are in agreement with most experimental data on the zzso system, but differ in some details that may have a functional interest, most notably in the orientation of the soluble part of zzso that does not appear to be spontaneously accessible for zzso complex zzso We also compare rat and zzso sequences of zzso and find some minor differences in their zzso
