zzso zzso relationships within species complexes of disease zzso is crucial for identifying zzso changes associated with the evolution of zzso important zzso However, the high degree of genetic similarity among sibling species confounds the ability to determine zzso relationships using molecular zzso The goal of this study was to zzso the zzso relationships among malaria zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso species complex by analyzing zzso of fixed zzso zzso in zzso and several zzso zzso We identified genes at zzso of fixed overlapping zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso using zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso sequencing, and clone zzso We also mapped zzso of a zzso inversion zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso species using a zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso arrangement and zzso zzso and zzso arrangements are present in zzso species zzso zzso Aedes zzso and zzso zzso The data indicate that the ancestral species of the zzso zzso complex had the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso arrangement uniquely characterizes a malaria zzso zzso zzso as the zzso species in the zzso The rooted zzso zzso implies that zzso zzso acquired the zzso inversion and that its sister species zzso zzso acquired the zzso inversion from the ancestral zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso A and B was derived from the zzso of the major malaria zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the ability to effectively transmit human malaria had originated repeatedly in the zzso Our findings also suggest that saltwater tolerance originated first in zzso zzso and then independently in zzso zzso The new zzso zzso will facilitate identifying the association of evolutionary zzso changes with zzso important zzso
