Four zzso zzso differentiate the blood group A and B zzso Multiple zzso zzso are associated with weak expression of A and B zzso but the structural changes causing zzso have not been zzso 

zzso or families having zzso weak B zzso on their red cells were zzso zzso were characterized by sequencing of zzso 1 through 7 in the zzso zzso Single crystal X-ray zzso zzso molecular zzso and zzso zzso showed the effects of the B zzso zzso on the zzso 

Seven unrelated individuals with weak B zzso possessed seven different B zzso five of which are new and result in substitution of highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso One of these zzso was due to a hybrid zzso resulting from zzso between B and zzso zzso The two other zzso were recently described in other ethnic groups and result in zzso and zzso The first zzso determination zzso of a zzso zzso and molecular modeling zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso changes in the zzso that could explain the diminished zzso zzso The effect of three zzso could not be zzso since they occur in a zzso zzso 

The genetic background for zzso zzso is very zzso but usually arises through seemingly random zzso zzso throughout the last zzso zzso The targeted zzso acid zzso however, are well zzso during zzso Based on analysis of the resulting structural changes in the zzso the zzso are likely to disrupt molecular bonds of importance for zzso zzso
