An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the host zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify an zzso factor, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was separated into plasma and zzso zzso When zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso they showed significant reduction in bacterial binding zzso Here, we considered a viral zzso previously known in other zzso species as a zzso zzso candidate in zzso zzso zzso Based on consensus regions of the viral zzso the corresponding zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Its zzso is zzso zzso long and encodes 157 zzso acid zzso containing a signal zzso (15 zzso and one zzso recognition zzso Open reading frame is divided by one zzso zzso zzso in its zzso zzso zzso acid sequence shares zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and is classified into zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the cloned zzso gene was located at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both real-time quantitative zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso showed early expression during the zzso A zzso zzso was expressed in a bacterial system and the zzso protein significantly inhibited the association between bacteria and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected on the surface of zzso eggs after 24 h zzso by its specific zzso The 24 h old eggs were not zzso in zzso by zzso of zzso zzso compared to newly laid zzso eggs showing no zzso zzso and easily zzso These results support an existence of a zzso zzso family among zzso zzso and propose its zzso zzso
