In animals, zzso is always transmitted through the female and this is termed zzso zzso Recently, zzso was reported to be involved in maternal inheritance by elimination of paternal zzso and zzso in zzso zzso moreover, by zzso zzso and zzso proteins were also found to zzso to zzso zzso after zzso in zzso Thus, it has been speculated that zzso may be an evolutionary zzso mechanism for paternal zzso zzso However, by using two transgenic mouse zzso one bearing zzso zzso and the other bearing red fluorescent zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso did not participate in the zzso elimination of zzso zzso in zzso Although zzso and zzso proteins zzso to zzso zzso immediately after zzso zzso zzso were not engulfed and ultimately zzso in zzso until zzso and zzso proteins zzso from zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso zzso distributed in zzso during zzso and persisted in several cells until the zzso zzso Furthermore, by using single zzso zzso zzso we observed that most zzso zzso that had reached the zzso for zzso had eliminated their zzso leaving only zzso zzso However, if zzso with remaining zzso entered the zzso zzso was not eliminated and could be detected in newborn zzso Based on these results, we conclude that, in mice, maternal inheritance of zzso is not an active process of zzso zzso and zzso elimination achieved through zzso in early zzso but may be a passive process as a result of zzso zzso zzso elimination and uneven zzso distribution in zzso
