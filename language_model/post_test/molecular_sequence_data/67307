zzso and its binding partner, zzso interacting protein zzso are essential components of linear zzso zzso chain assembly complex zzso a zzso zzso complex catalyzing zzso of a zzso connected zzso chain, which serve as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso interaction between the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso and the zzso domain zzso located at the central region of zzso is shown to be involved in the formation of zzso For better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generation of the linear zzso chains by zzso it is necessary to characterize the zzso interaction on the basis of structural data, which, however, is not available to zzso Here we report backbone and side chain zzso assignments of the zzso of human zzso By inspection of chemical shift index, it was predicted that zzso assumes a zzso fold followed by an zzso segment, offering the basis for determination its zzso structure and interaction with zzso in zzso
