zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso products is an efficient, highly accurate tool for the detection of single base sequence zzso We describe the first application of this comparative sequencing strategy for automated zzso zzso detection in microbial zzso The method was applied to identify DNA sequence changes that occurred in zzso coli K-12 zzso during laboratory zzso evolution to new optimal growth zzso zzso were based on a zzso in zzso model of zzso coli metabolism and zzso This model zzso several zzso functions and predicts optimal growth zzso To identify zzso underlying a zzso zzso laboratory evolution on zzso we zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in several clones picked at the end of the evolutionary zzso The zzso screen was completed in zzso zzso This zzso study is the largest reported by zzso mass zzso to zzso Ten zzso in 40 clones and three zzso from the reference sequence were zzso zzso were predominantly found within the zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the most prominent zzso shows its zzso impact on the process of zzso zzso All sequence changes were independently confirmed by zzso and zzso We demonstrate that comparative sequencing by zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso is an zzso fast, and highly accurate alternative to zzso zzso
