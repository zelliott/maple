zzso acid, a clinically used inhibitor of zzso zzso is produced by zzso of zzso zzso The early steps in zzso acid zzso leading to the zzso zzso intermediate zzso acid have been zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso acid is converted to the penultimate intermediate zzso is zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of the zzso acid zzso gene zzso blocks zzso acid production and leads to the zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid, suggesting that these compounds are zzso in the zzso Two alternative start zzso have been proposed for zzso to zzso for two possible zzso one of which has 92 zzso zzso less then the zzso The shorter version of zzso was successfully expressed in zzso coli and zzso as a zzso zzso zzso analyses predicting the zzso protein to be a member of the zzso fold zzso were supported by soft zzso mass zzso analyses that demonstrated binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, prepared by in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso accessible intermediate zzso acid, was shown by mass zzso analyses to be converted to zzso acid in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso Under the same conditions zzso and zzso acid were not converted to zzso zzso The specificity of zzso as an zzso acid zzso together with the reported zzso of zzso acid in zzso and zzso disruption zzso suggested that zzso acid is an intermediate in zzso acid zzso
