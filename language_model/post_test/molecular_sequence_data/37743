zzso zzso ameliorates zzso and zzso nerve function and increases skeletal muscle blood flow, oxygen zzso and zzso transport in patients with zzso diabetes zzso These effects have in part been ascribed to the zzso influence of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso To evaluate the capacity of zzso to insert into zzso zzso and form zzso channels, zzso secondary structure and membrane interactions were studied with circular zzso zzso and size exclusion zzso zzso is shown to lack a stable secondary structure, both when part of zzso and when free in zzso solution, although the zzso third of the zzso exhibits an zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso remains zzso in the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso regardless of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is unlikely to elicit zzso effects through stable zzso interactions with zzso zzso
