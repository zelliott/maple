zzso is a zzso protein of 27 to 35 zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso is required for high viral load and full pathological zzso In zzso zzso has at least four activities: induction of zzso and major zzso complex zzso class I zzso enhancement of viral zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that the zzso protein from human zzso virus type 1 interacts with a novel human zzso zzso In the present study, by zzso analysis, we identified a region of the zzso core, extending from the zzso zzso to zzso that is involved both in zzso interaction and in zzso zzso zzso This region of zzso is located on the zzso interface and is in close proximity to the putative zzso binding zzso One of the zzso carrying a zzso in this region, targeted to the zzso zzso zzso was also found to be defective in two other functions of zzso zzso class I zzso and enhancement of viral zzso Furthermore, zzso of this zzso affected the ability of zzso to form zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso may be critical for its multiple zzso
