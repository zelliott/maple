We have performed a differential screen of a zzso egg zzso library and selected two clones zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso which are specifically zzso and recruited into zzso after zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals that the corresponding protein is zzso identical zzso zzso to the product of the zzso zzso zzso (also called zzso or zzso zzso This zzso when zzso is an omnipotent zzso of nonsense zzso When expressed in a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was able to suppress zzso zzso showing that the structural zzso reflects a functional zzso Our discovery of a structural and functional zzso in zzso cells implies that the function of zzso is not restricted to lower zzso and that the zzso protein may perform a crucial cellular function in higher zzso
