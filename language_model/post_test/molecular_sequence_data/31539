The zzso zzso locus in the soybean plant introduction zzso zzso zzso extreme resistance against the majority of zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso including zzso but not zzso and zzso In contrast, in susceptible soybean zzso lacking a functional zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso severe disease symptoms and accumulates to a high level, whereas both zzso and zzso induce mild symptoms and accumulate to a significantly lower zzso zzso of zzso by zzso on zzso soybean requires concurrent zzso in both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is because of the presence of at least two resistance zzso zzso probably belonging to the zzso zzso repeat zzso class, within the zzso zzso independently zzso the recognition of zzso or zzso In this study, we show that the majority of zzso evolved zzso pathways that disrupt the zzso functions of zzso on zzso soybean also result in mild symptoms and reduced zzso relative to parental zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso sequences from virulent zzso or zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso point zzso associated with gain of zzso reveals a direct correlation between the zzso of zzso and a fitness penalty in zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that gain of zzso by zzso on zzso soybean results in fitness loss in a previously susceptible soybean zzso this being a consequence of zzso in zzso but not in zzso
