zzso evolution, that is the outgrowth of the zzso zzso in a population, usually applies to living organisms over long periods of zzso Recently, in zzso zzso techniques have been developed that allow for the rapid evolution of functionally active zzso acids from a pool of zzso zzso We now describe a modification of the zzso zzso protocol in which selection and amplification take place inside living cells by means of a zzso replication zzso We have generated a library of zzso DNA zzso with random sequences in particular zzso of the zzso element, which is the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso This mixture of zzso zzso was zzso into T cells and outgrowth of the zzso viruses was observed within two weeks of viral zzso The results of this in zzso selection analysis are consistent with the notion that primary sequence elements in both zzso zzso and loop zzso are critical for zzso zzso and viral zzso
