zzso is an intermediate filament zzso binding protein of exceptionally large zzso Its molecular structure, revealed by zzso and predicted by its zzso indicates an zzso zzso domain, a long zzso central domain, and a zzso zzso domain containing six highly zzso repeat zzso To examine the role of the various zzso in zzso zzso interaction with zzso we have constructed rat zzso zzso truncated zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso and zzso cells could be distinguished from zzso wild type zzso by virtue of a short zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As shown by conventional and zzso zzso zzso the transient expression of zzso zzso containing all six or the last four of the repeat regions of the zzso or the zzso and the rod, associated with IF networks of both the zzso and the zzso type and eventually caused their collapse into zzso zzso Similar effects were observed upon expression of a protein zzso by a full length zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso containing the rod without any of the zzso repeats, accumulated almost exclusively within the zzso of zzso When the rod was extended by the first one and a half of the zzso repeats, zzso proteins showed a partial zzso distribution, although association with intermediate filaments was not zzso Nuclear and diffuse zzso distribution was also observed upon expression of the zzso domain without zzso These results indicate that sequences located roughly within the last two thirds of the zzso zzso are indispensable for association of zzso with intermediate filaments in living zzso
