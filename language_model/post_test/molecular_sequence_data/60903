snail family genes zzso a zzso factor with specific zinc finger zzso In zzso they are expressed in the entire zzso in early zzso and later in the zzso zzso and the zzso suggesting roles in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso In the present study, a snail family gene zzso from a member of the zzso an zzso zzso zzso was cloned to obtain an insight into the origin of the mechanisms of zzso zzso and body axis formation as observed in zzso zzso of zzso during zzso zzso was found to be quite similar to that of zzso snail zzso First, before zzso zzso was initially expressed in most precursors of zzso zzso including the zzso where zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso expression persisted in the zzso zzso the zzso and muscle, but not in the zzso zzso Also, just as zzso snail family genes are expressed in the border of the neural plate that develops into zzso neural tube and neural crest cells, so zzso expression was detected in the precursors of lateral and zzso regions of the neural zzso However, zzso expression was not detected in the tip of the tail, unlike in zzso zzso In the light of the present findings, similarity and zzso of mechanisms governing zzso zzso and body axis formation between zzso and zzso are zzso
