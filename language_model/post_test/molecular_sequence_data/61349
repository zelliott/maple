The accessory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is required to maintain the structural integrity or zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso for the accessory zzso from zzso man, zzso and rat have been identified, and comparative sequence alignment reveals that the zzso region of about 120 zzso is the most zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the accessory zzso of animal zzso has both sequence and structural similarity with class zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence similarity and fold recognition followed by zzso zzso we have developed a model of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso region of the accessory zzso of zzso The model reveals a rare zzso zzso surrounded by four zzso with structural zzso to the zzso domain of class zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the accessory zzso plays a role in the recognition of zzso zzso in zzso zzso to recruit zzso to the zzso zzso A similar role is served by the zzso in zzso coli DNA zzso III, and indeed our accessory zzso model shows structural similarity with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso similarity is also found with zzso coli zzso the accessory zzso and zzso factor in zzso zzso DNA zzso Thus, we propose that the accessory zzso of zzso is involved both in primer recognition and in zzso DNA strand zzso
