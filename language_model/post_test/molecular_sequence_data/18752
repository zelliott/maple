A moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso designed as strain zzso was isolated from zzso zzso The zzso was a straight rod, zzso by means of zzso zzso and able to zzso both oxygen and zzso Growth occurred with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH 5-11 zzso pH zzso and at zzso zzso zzso at 35 zzso It accumulated zzso zzso and produced zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 9 zzso was the only respiratory zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso was zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the strain represents a member of the zzso zzso and more precisely of the zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso sequence identities in particular with the three last species listed zzso A zzso sequence analysis zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes allowed clarifying the zzso position of zzso This, combined with the level of zzso zzso between zzso and its closest relatives ranging from zzso to zzso indicated that zzso did not represent any of these zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso zzso and also zzso and zzso evidence, it was concluded that strain zzso represented a novel species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
