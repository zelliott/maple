zzso zzso are zzso and highly zzso formats of zzso functional protein zzso Major bottlenecks in protein zzso are the limited availability and high cost of zzso functional proteins for zzso and the limited stability of zzso proteins in their functional zzso In contrast, zzso DNA is readily available by zzso and DNA zzso can be stored over prolonged times without zzso This chapter presents a method for the rapid and economical zzso of replicate protein zzso directly from a single DNA array template using zzso protein zzso termed zzso array to protein zzso zzso The procedure is a truly enabling technology, making zzso protein zzso affordable for laboratories with no access to routine zzso zzso The experimental effort involved for the printing of a protein array from the template DNA array is comparable to the assembly of a Western zzso
