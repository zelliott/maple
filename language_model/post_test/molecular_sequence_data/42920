zzso from 25 mice at different stages of experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso transferred using zzso zzso cells zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso of zzso basic protein zzso were examined for zzso to a different zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Cellular zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found in zzso mice with acute zzso zzso with chronic zzso zzso mice with zzso in zzso and zzso during zzso No proliferation to zzso was seen in zzso mice or in healthy mice zzso with zzso Two of 13 mice developed typical zzso after the serial transfer of cells from animals with zzso zzso had been activated with zzso in zzso zzso consisted of recipients of zzso zzso cells from zzso donors or donors zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from mice zzso with zzso activated in zzso with irrelevant zzso or zzso zzso cells serially transferred from mice with zzso transferred zzso No control mice developed zzso These results suggest that during the course of zzso breakdown caused by an immune response to one zzso component zzso zzso zzso to at least one additional zzso zzso zzso can zzso Furthermore, the acquired cellular zzso to additional zzso components may be sufficient in some cases to induce disease itself, perhaps lending insight into mechanisms involved in disease zzso
