Most small zzso plasmids of zzso bacteria and many in zzso bacteria replicate by a zzso zzso zzso The replication zzso proteins zzso by the zzso plasmids and zzso zzso of zzso coli have zzso zzso activities that are required for the initiation and termination of zzso zzso We have investigated the sequence requirements for termination of zzso replication of zzso zzso The zzso zzso site is located in the loop of a hairpin region zzso within the zzso origin of zzso By zzso analysis, we have found that several zzso within the stem of zzso which are critical for the initiation activity are zzso for termination of zzso We also demonstrate that zzso in the right arm of zzso but not the left arm, are absolutely required for termination of zzso zzso We have also identified specific zzso in zzso that are critical for its termination zzso The sequence of the right arm of the hairpin must be located downstream of the zzso zzso site for zzso suggesting that termination requires a specific orientation of the zzso protein at the zzso
