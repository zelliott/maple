The effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 hours on the induction of pulmonary and zzso zzso zzso has been investigated in adult male zzso Northern zzso analysis using six zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in liver and zzso zzso zzso in lung were significantly increased by zzso exposure, whereas the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in liver and zzso zzso in zzso were zzso Since induction of zzso zzso has only been reported with the use of zzso administered zzso further studies were carried out to confirm the results obtained with Northern zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in the liver and zzso zzso in the lungs and amplified by reverse zzso These results indicate that these zzso were amplified significantly more in the zzso group than in the control zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in liver and zzso zzso protein in lungs as well as the corresponding zzso activities were increased by zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso is the first demonstration of zzso zzso zzso induction in animals and indicates the needs to pursue the changes of zzso zzso interaction in zzso
