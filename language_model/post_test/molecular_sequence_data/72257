Based on sequence analyses of 17 complete zzso DNA zzso from ten different deer species, a model is proposed for the zzso evolution, and zzso organization of zzso satellite I zzso All zzso satellite I DNA arose from the initial amplification of a zzso DNA zzso These zzso zzso were organized in a zzso fashion as zzso zzso in zzso deer and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso repeat nature of zzso zzso satellite DNA zzso accounts for their high zzso and zzso sequence zzso Such high zzso sequence conservation zzso the use of a single zzso satellite I DNA zzso from each deer species for zzso sequence comparisons to zzso zzso zzso Also, a specific zzso tandem zzso was observed in all zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso satellite I DNA zzso arose from an unequal crossover event between two similar zzso ancestral DNA zzso
