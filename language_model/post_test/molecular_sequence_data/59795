The comparative analysis of a large number of plant zzso of the zzso family has recently revealed that plants possess two distinct zzso groups and three distinct zzso groups of zzso Despite earlier zzso this large-scale comparative analysis has allowed an unequivocal definition of plant zzso into either A or B zzso We present here the most important results obtained in this study, and extend them to the case of plant zzso zzso in which three groups are zzso For each of the plant zzso groups, consensus sequences have been established and a new, rational, zzso naming system is proposed in accordance with the guidelines of the Commission on Plant Gene zzso This nomenclature is based on the animal system indicating zzso classes by an zzso zzso letter, and distinct groups within these classes by an zzso zzso zzso The naming of plant zzso classes is chosen to indicate zzso to their closest animal zzso The revised nomenclature of all described plant zzso is zzso with their zzso into groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
