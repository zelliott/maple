zzso cell zzso receptors zzso protect class I zzso expressing target cells from natural killer zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular basis of this zzso recognition, we have zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a member of the zzso zzso receptors that recognize zzso 3, 7, and 8 zzso The structure was determined in two different crystal forms, an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso space group, to resolutions of zzso and zzso A, zzso The overall fold of this structure, like zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in both zzso that define zzso zzso which sets zzso apart from the zzso zzso growth hormone zzso zzso The hinge angle of zzso is approximately 80 degrees, 14 degrees larger than that observed in zzso despite the existence of zzso zzso zzso near the hinge zzso There is also a 5 degrees difference in the observed hinge angles in two crystal forms of zzso suggesting that the zzso hinge angle is not zzso The putative zzso site is formed by zzso from several variable zzso with charge distribution apparently complementary to that of zzso The packing of the receptors in the zzso crystal form offers an intriguing model for zzso zzso on the cell zzso
