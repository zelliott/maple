Fifteen zzso zzso were developed in an endangered species, zzso zzso and were tested in an additional three species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to evaluate the population structure for conservation efforts and reconstruct the zzso patterns of this ancient zzso 

zzso primer sets were developed from zzso zzso the number of zzso ranged from two to 10, with an observed zzso ranging from 0 to zzso All of the zzso were found to be zzso zzso 

These zzso and zzso zzso will be potentially useful for future studies that will focus on identifying distinct genetic units within species and establishing the zzso patterns and the process of zzso among closely related zzso
