zzso a modular zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso sodium channels zzso zzso in zzso of zzso and initial segments of zzso zzso However, direct effects of zzso on zzso properties of zzso channels remain zzso In this study, we explored whether zzso has a role in zzso gating properties of the zzso zzso channel that is predominantly localized at zzso of zzso and initial zzso zzso cells zzso with the human zzso zzso alone exhibited significant persistent sodium current zzso On the other hand, zzso was barely detected on zzso with zzso zzso another zzso did not show such an zzso zzso of zzso between the two zzso of zzso suggests that the zzso domain of zzso is critical for reducing the zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso not only through zzso zzso channels but also by directly zzso their channel zzso
