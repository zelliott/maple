An zzso within the 60 zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso 60, recognized by a zzso T cell clone from a zzso arthritis patient, has been zzso zzso peptides contained a nine zzso acid sequence zzso zzso predicted by zzso to zzso strong binding to zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso The overall length of the zzso was critical for efficient zzso peptides with at least one zzso zzso to the putative zzso position were markedly more zzso than a zzso whose zzso is the zzso zzso zzso responses were seen with zzso peptides having two to three zzso acids zzso and zzso to the core zzso The sequence of the defined zzso is identical in zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since the latter is a common respiratory zzso patients infected with zzso zzso may already be primed for responses to zzso by prior infection with zzso zzso Such secondary responses are important in the zzso of zzso inflammatory diseases such as zzso zzso by infection with enteric organisms was considered because of the similarity of the zzso sequence in zzso coli zzso However, although an zzso zzso zzso was zzso intact zzso coli zzso was not, suggesting that the zzso is cryptic in zzso coli zzso Human zzso has six zzso acid differences from zzso zzso in the zzso sequence and was not zzso Thus zzso recognition of self zzso could not be implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso arthritis in this zzso
