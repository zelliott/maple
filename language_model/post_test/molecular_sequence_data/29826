Five major regions of sequence diversity between strains zzso have been described in the zzso zzso zzso zzso envelope surface unit zzso zzso To determine which of these variable regions is important in persistent infection in zzso we evaluated zzso sequence diversity in five zzso zzso from two zzso and zzso DNA from five additional zzso infected with zzso for up to 7 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence divergence in the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso compared to parental zzso ranged from zzso to zzso However, most of the zzso acid zzso and all of the deletions and insertions were present in two discrete regions designated zzso and zzso The zzso region was variable in all zzso zzso and zzso sequences from most zzso This region overlapped the zzso domain of zzso zzso and the zzso domain of the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso was located in a region of zzso strictly zzso in all small zzso zzso strains except zzso This region only varied in a subset of zzso zzso and zzso all derived from zzso with zzso In contrast, sequences in the zzso and zzso regions were stable in zzso zzso and zzso from infected zzso indicating that sequence diversity between strains in these regions is not due to selection of zzso in persistently infected zzso Our results define two discrete regions of zzso zzso that undergo rapid sequence variation in persistently infected zzso which may have important roles in zzso zzso
