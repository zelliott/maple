In order to understand how lungs of healthy people, unlike those of zzso zzso zzso patients, are protected against bacterial infections such as zzso zzso the following three key findings were zzso First, zzso zzso do not multiply when planted onto zzso zzso cells from healthy humans but do so profusely on cells from zzso zzso zzso Second, some bacteria zzso and gain entrance into zzso cells, even at a zzso salt concentration (104 zzso Third, human zzso zzso cells express an approximately 4 zzso zzso zzso which is known in its bovine form to exhibit zzso action against zzso zzso A model is proposed depicting both how normal zzso cells, in a zzso self defense zzso may be protected against bacterial infection and how this mechanism may fail during the initial stages of zzso
