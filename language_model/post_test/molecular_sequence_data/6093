The technique of Random zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso has been used to detect DNA zzso among zzso zzso zzso Seven arbitrary zzso zzso were used as zzso to amplify total zzso zzso and significant genetic zzso was detected among 11 zzso zzso strains with different zzso for zzso The zzso observed allowed relationship zzso of zzso zzso strains to be constructed by zzso and zzso zzso The genetic relationships of the zzso zzso strains generated by 2 analyses using completely different assumptions were zzso Both analyses revealed 2 groups of zzso zzso zzso one formed by the 6 virulent strains and the other formed by the 5 zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso may actually contain 2 groups, correlated with their zzso which have probably evolved independently following their initial zzso zzso zzso were also detected between 2 different laboratory stocks of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
