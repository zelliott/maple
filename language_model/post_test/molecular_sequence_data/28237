In the course of a systematic survey of wheat zzso zzso zzso we have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes and their zzso zzso These genes are remnants of zzso zzso DNA that has been incorporated into wheat zzso in the course of its zzso Each gene differs by one or a few zzso from the authentic zzso zzso previously characterized in wheat or other plants, and each could potentially zzso a functional zzso whose secondary structure shows no zzso from the generalized zzso To determine whether these zzso zzso genes are actually zzso wheat zzso zzso were resolved by a series of zzso gel zzso after being specifically zzso in zzso by zzso addition zzso by wheat zzso zzso zzso direct zzso sequence analysis identified prominent zzso species corresponding to the zzso and not the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This analysis also revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that at least some zzso zzso genes in wheat zzso are zzso with transcripts undergoing processing, zzso modification and zzso addition, to produce mature zzso that may participate in zzso protein zzso
