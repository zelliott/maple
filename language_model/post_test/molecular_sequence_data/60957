The zzso protein zzso gene codes for the most abundant protein in the central nervous system zzso zzso of higher zzso Its function in the zzso sheath is not clear however, a series of point zzso have been shown to have devastating effects on the zzso The structure of the zzso genes is highly zzso zzso seven zzso that code for an open reading frame of 277 zzso zzso We determined a total of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and compared this sequence with the human zzso zzso A very high similarity was detected between the zzso regions of the zzso genes of human and zzso interrupted primarily by several zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was assigned to the long arm of zzso zzso X zzso The analysis of the zzso transcripts revealed three zzso start sites within 160 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso zzso studies of the 3' region showed the use of several zzso zzso Three main transcripts were detected in adult pigs in the range of zzso zzso and 1600 zzso with Northern zzso zzso The usage of an alternative zzso site within zzso 3 was zzso
