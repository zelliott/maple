We have identified and zzso a putative response regulator zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso and its zzso protein zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso In the zzso region of zzso a short sequence is found that matches the consensus sequence of the stress response elements zzso from zzso zzso zzso is located on zzso 1 and is expressed in either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and a basic zzso point zzso zzso It has a zzso zzso located in its zzso which resembles the zzso zzso target type 1 sequence zzso of most of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso search of zzso with other proteins in databases showed that the zzso of zzso exhibits the greatest similarity with the zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The response regulator domain of zzso contains the motifs that are characteristic of all response regulators, including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the putative zzso which is zzso by a zzso zzso Finally, in spite of the structural similarities among zzso zzso and zzso zzso does not seem to exhibit functional zzso with these zzso
