zzso zzso provide motor function for a wide range of zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso in zzso zzso disrupt the zzso zzso zzso heavy zzso The zzso protein is present at a low level throughout fly development and at the same level in heads, zzso and zzso Severe zzso zzso likely to be molecular zzso die as zzso or larvae, but all zzso combinations tested thus far yield a small fraction of adult zzso that are weak and zzso zzso electron zzso shows that zzso have defects in zzso and zzso indicating that this motor protein plays a role in the structure of the zzso zzso We generate a zzso model for the structure of the zzso zzso head that indicates zzso zzso like zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso zzso their N zzso In addition, we establish that the two zzso zzso zzso repeats share high sequence similarity with only the first two zzso of the zzso structure that is typical of zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, the approximately 100 and approximately 75 zzso acids that follow the first two zzso of the first and second zzso zzso are highly zzso among zzso zzso suggesting that they compose a zzso zzso tail zzso 7 zzso domain that may be an integral part of the zzso domain or may function independently of zzso Together, our data suggest a key role for zzso in the formation of cellular projections and other zzso functions required for zzso
