The identification and characterization of zzso expressed in zzso zzso stages that zzso zzso are essential steps for the development of new vaccines and zzso Genes that are zzso expressed in zzso may be involved in key processes that define the biology of zzso like cell invasion and immune system zzso 

With the initial aim of identifying zzso expressed zzso we constructed and zzso an zzso zzso zzso library zzso zzso More than zzso of the zzso clones of the library could not be mapped to previously zzso zzso or zzso We validated the presence of these transcripts by reverse northern zzso and northern zzso experiments, therefore providing novel information about the zzso expression of these genes in zzso A zzso consensus element zzso element, zzso located at the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of many different open reading frames zzso was identified after zzso the zzso zzso Using an zzso approach, we were able to amplify different mature zzso containing the same zzso in the 3' zzso The proteins zzso by these zzso are members of a novel surface protein family in zzso zzso (which we named zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rich zzso All members of the zzso family have zzso coding zzso and zzso and a central variable core that allows zzso of zzso proteins into three zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso database resulted in the identification of 38 zzso for the whole zzso family in the reference zzso strain zzso zzso Because this protein family was not found in other zzso we also looked for the presence of zzso genes in other evolutionary lineages of zzso zzso sequencing 48 and 28 zzso members from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I) zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso gene products show that this gene family is different from previously characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 

We identified zzso a new gene family of surface proteins in zzso zzso
