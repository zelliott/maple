The specificity of the zzso of zzso virus zzso was studied with zzso 21 zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso with zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso and zzso 3 compounds designed as human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso zzso The central zzso unit zzso state or zzso bond zzso and the role of the inhibitor side chains from zzso to zzso were zzso zzso zzso prefers an aromatic side chain in zzso and a small zzso zzso chain in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso positions are outside of the short zzso zzso of the zzso but still influence binding zzso The data obtained provide evidence that the zzso zzso has generally lower specificity and poorer binding than the zzso zzso
