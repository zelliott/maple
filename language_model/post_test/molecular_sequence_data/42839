zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso presents two structural zzso a zzso implicated in interaction with zzso and a zzso containing four zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain mainly involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to shuttle between zzso and zzso To get an insight on the nature of nuclear and zzso zzso signals, a set of zzso deletion zzso in fusion with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed, and the resulting zzso proteins were recognized by zzso zzso First, a nuclear location signal zzso and composed of two short basic stretches separated by zzso zzso was zzso zzso of either motifs renders the protein zzso Second, by deleting one or more zzso implicated in zzso association either with DNA, zzso or zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso requires, in addition to the nuclear zzso zzso at least two of the five zzso in presence or absence of zzso However, in presence of only one zzso the zzso allowed a partial targeting of the zzso protein to the zzso
