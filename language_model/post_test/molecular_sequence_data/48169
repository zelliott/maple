zzso is a DNA reorganization reaction potentially deleterious for the zzso The frequency of zzso is limited by the amount of zzso zzso strict regulation of a zzso is required to keep control over the destructive zzso of the mobile zzso We have shown previously that the expression of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is positively affected by integration host zzso Here, we present evidence that the amount of the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells is controlled by the zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso coded just downstream of the zzso zzso showed that it has remarkable similarity to the putative zzso zzso by the mercury resistance zzso zzso As determined by quantitative Western zzso analysis, the abundance of zzso was reduced up to zzso in the intact zzso zzso In zzso experiments using zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene and the reporter gene zzso indicated that zzso operates in the regulation of the zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso
