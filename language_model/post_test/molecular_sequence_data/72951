The zzso of zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso strain 71 occurs upon DNA damage via a unique regulatory circuit involving zzso zzso and zzso In a similar zzso system zzso in zzso coli, the zzso product was found to activate the expression of zzso the structural gene for zzso zzso The kinetic data presented here also show that zzso of zzso followed that of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a zzso order of gene zzso By deletion analysis we have localized the zzso region within a 66 zzso DNA segment upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso This region contains the zzso consensus sequence but not the sequences corresponding to the zzso coli zzso zzso For zzso studies, zzso was zzso in zzso coli and a 14 zzso zzso was identified as the gene zzso zzso from crude extracts or a zzso preparation caused an identical gel mobility shift of a zzso zzso DNA segment containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I protection zzso the zzso site was localized between zzso zzso and zzso zzso overlapping the position of the putative zzso zzso The findings reported here, taken along with our previous observation that the zzso product is required for zzso zzso establishes that zzso encodes a zzso factor which specifically interacts with the zzso zzso zzso
