zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of four zzso and four zzso zzso and the basic structural unit of the zzso is an zzso zzso To investigate one aspect of the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso region at the zzso interface zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were replaced by zzso zzso in each and in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso do not disrupt the zzso structure of zzso However, these zzso produce novel kinetic properties including, with respect to zzso positive zzso regulation by zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso These zzso properties are also apparent in zzso zzso Despite substantial measurable activity for the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso in both zzso expression of this zzso produces growth zzso indicative of zzso dysfunction in zzso
