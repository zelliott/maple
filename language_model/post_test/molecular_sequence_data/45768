Human zzso stimulating factor zzso a human zzso was expressed in transgenic rice cell suspension zzso The zzso gene was cloned into the rice expression zzso containing the promoter, signal zzso and zzso derived from a rice zzso gene zzso Using particle zzso zzso zzso gene was introduced into the zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was confirmed by zzso and Northern zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso accumulated in culture medium from transgenic rice cell suspension culture on the sugar zzso was determined by time series zzso Biological activity of the plant derived zzso was confirmed by measuring the proliferation of the zzso cells, and was similar to that of the commercial zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we discuss the attractive attributes of using rice cell suspension system for the expression of therapeutic zzso zzso
