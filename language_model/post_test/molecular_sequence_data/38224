Human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that functions in the host innate zzso We developed a highly sensitive zzso for zzso and identified several zzso peptides in human zzso zzso and plasma by zzso acid sequencing and mass zzso Large quantities of zzso peptides are produced in the zzso are released into the zzso zzso as zzso zzso and then undergo zzso processing and generate multiple truncated zzso The respective urine and plasma zzso of zzso in patients with zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso those of normal zzso zzso is thought to contribute to zzso defense in the urinary zzso Our findings provide a better understanding of the zzso of this zzso and its zzso significance in infectious zzso
