zzso zzso is a family of ubiquitous zzso protein zzso that frequently function in tandem with the zzso modification system to zzso protein turnover and zzso In Alzheimer's disease, these zzso zzso with zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso bodies, suggesting they also play a role in disease zzso To identify binding partners that potentially regulate or recruit these zzso toward disease zzso a zzso zzso zzso screen was performed with human zzso (the zzso zzso zzso most closely linked to zzso zzso zzso and a human brain zzso zzso All interacting clones contained a single open reading frame termed zzso zzso binding protein zzso On the basis of sequence zzso zzso was a structural zzso of the zzso domain of zzso a component of the zzso protein complex and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with full-length zzso the isolated zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso system, and bound zzso and zzso in zzso zzso but did not interact with zzso zzso with the zzso zzso domain led to zzso zzso of protein zzso activity in the presence of protein zzso zzso and zzso Although intact zzso did not bind any zzso zzso deletion of its zzso domain yielded a protein zzso that behaved much like zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso domain of zzso and its zzso in humans may function to recruit zzso zzso zzso to protein complexes involved in multiple biological zzso
