The upstream region of the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso It was found that this region contains the previously zzso gene zzso zzso an zzso closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of a putative zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region indicates that zzso and zzso are not zzso as an zzso zzso comparison between the two zzso revealed high sequence conservation in the zzso domain and in the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso to zzso family IV, which binds specifically to zzso cellulose and soluble zzso In contrast to zzso zzso lacks a family III zzso capable of binding to zzso zzso By partial zzso acid sequence determination zzso was shown to be identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be members of zzso E1 of zzso family E zzso family zzso zzso comparison of zzso zzso of family E1 zzso with zzso zzso zzso a family E1 zzso of known three-dimensional structure, revealed a significant variation in the lengths of zzso zzso connecting the zzso of the zzso barrel zzso The extended zzso of zzso and zzso might form an zzso tunnel, as found in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
