von zzso factor zzso is a zzso plasma protein that mediates zzso zzso to exposed zzso at sites of vascular zzso The A3 domain of zzso zzso forms the principal binding site for zzso type I and zzso We report here the crystal structure of the zzso domain at zzso zzso As expected, the structure is similar to the zzso I domain but with several novel zzso zzso alignments had suggested that the domain contained an zzso metal zzso zzso site zzso zzso but the crystal structure shows that the motif is modified and that no metal zzso is zzso We have introduced zzso into the vestigial zzso motif and report that, unlike the I domain of zzso zzso zzso continues to bind collagen after disruption of the zzso We conclude that collagen recognition by zzso occurs by a mechanism different from that of the zzso zzso
