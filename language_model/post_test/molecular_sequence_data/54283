The active centers of the hairpin and VS zzso are both generated by the interaction of two internal zzso and both zzso use zzso and zzso zzso to accelerate zzso and zzso zzso The centers are zzso equivalent and the relative positioning of key elements the zzso There is good evidence that the zzso reaction of the VS zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso acting as general base and the zzso zzso as general zzso We now critically evaluate the experimental zzso evidence for the hairpin zzso We conclude that all the available data are fully consistent with a major contribution to zzso by general zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso and zzso zzso It appears that the two zzso are mechanistically zzso
