The human zzso zzso zzso domain zzso is an important drug target for the treatment of various zzso However, the low intrinsic stability and zzso of zzso have rendered its zzso and zzso characterization zzso In order to overcome these problems, we have stabilized zzso by a combination of random zzso and zzso screening using zzso cell sorting zzso with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso as folding zzso Two zzso gene libraries of zzso fused to the zzso gene were expressed in zzso coli, followed by eight rounds of zzso zzso in each of which zzso cells were zzso The zzso zzso isolated by this approach contained numerous zzso acid exchanges, and four beneficial ones zzso zzso zzso and zzso were followed up in zzso Their characterization showed that the zzso of zzso zzso is correlated zzso with the stability and zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso When combined, the four exchanges increased the zzso stability of zzso by more than zzso and enhanced its zzso yield after expression in zzso coli by about zzso The introduction of three beneficial exchanges into the zzso zzso domain of mouse enabled its X-ray structure determination at high resolution, which showed how the exchanges stabilize the protein and revealed atomic details that will guide future drug zzso Our results demonstrate that large zzso fusion libraries can be screened by zzso with extreme sensitivity and efficiency, yielding stabilized zzso proteins suitable for zzso characterization and structure zzso
