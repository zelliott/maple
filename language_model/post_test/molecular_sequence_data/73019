zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein that limits the activity of zzso oxygen species zzso We cloned the zzso zzso the mouse zzso of zzso from an zzso brain zzso library and analyzed its distribution and function in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso with those of other species revealed that zzso was highly zzso across all zzso Mouse zzso had broad tissue distribution, but its expression was especially marked in cells that metabolize oxygen molecules at high levels such as zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, and certain types of zzso zzso of increased expression of zzso in the brain were zzso with regions known to be especially sensitive to hypoxic and zzso injury in zzso Models of zzso differentiation and zzso survival were employed to study the function of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso increased zzso zzso when in a chemically differentiated zzso Furthermore, expression of mouse zzso in zzso zzso cells prolonged their survival in the absence of nerve growth factor zzso and serum, indicating that zzso could promote zzso cell zzso We propose that zzso contributes to zzso defense in zzso and zzso cells by limiting the destructive capacity of oxygen zzso These findings identify a novel gene that appears to be relevant to hypoxic brain injury and may be of importance in development of new approaches to abrogate the effects of zzso and zzso injury in the central nervous system zzso
