The effects of zzso zzso placement in a de zzso zzso bundle are investigated by placement of zzso zzso at coiled zzso zzso a positions in two distinct zzso and at each position within a single zzso repeat of our zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of a generic zzso zzso zzso The zzso to zzso zzso of zzso of zzso with either or both zzso on each zzso replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrates the zzso requirement of zzso for biologically significant zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a single zzso per zzso in positions 9 to 15 were evaluated to verify the design based on molecular zzso The zzso site formed between zzso positions a at 10 and zzso bound zzso zzso with the highest zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso and 800 zzso zzso Placement of zzso at position 11 zzso position b) resulted in a protein that bound a single zzso with moderate zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas the other peptides had no measurable apparent affinity for zzso zzso with zzso values zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso was confirmed by electron zzso resonance zzso The protein design rules derived from this study, together with the narrow zzso revealed, are zzso for improving future zzso protein designs, for analyzing the results of zzso zzso protein zzso libraries, as well as for zzso in automated protein zzso
