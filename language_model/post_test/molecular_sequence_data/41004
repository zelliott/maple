Transfer zzso are the most densely modified zzso acid molecules in living zzso In zzso coli, more than 30 zzso modifications have been zzso ranging from zzso and zzso to more complex additions that require multiple zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso have been identified, although a few notable exceptions include the zzso that zzso the zzso at the zzso 34 zzso position in the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we have used a comparative zzso approach to uncover candidate zzso coli genes for the missing zzso Transfer zzso from zzso zzso for candidate genes were analyzed by mass zzso and revealed that zzso of zzso leads to loss of zzso at position 34 in both zzso and zzso Loss of zzso zzso reduces the efficiency of zzso base interaction, as demonstrated in an amber zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had no zzso effect on zzso growth rate, although a distinct disadvantage was noted in zzso zzso growth experiments, suggesting that the ability to recover from the stationary phase was zzso zzso is restored in zzso by zzso with a zzso copy of zzso Despite being one of the smallest characterized zzso knot zzso zzso independently zzso the zzso transfer from zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recognition of this target requires a zzso at position 34 and zzso at position zzso zzso is one of the last remaining zzso coli zzso modification zzso to be identified and is now renamed zzso
