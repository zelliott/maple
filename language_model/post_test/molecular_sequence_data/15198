We describe a novel zzso zzso named zzso which was isolated from rat zzso by differential display of zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and encodes a zzso acid protein with 50% similarity to mouse zzso The gene is located on zzso zzso spanning 21 zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso region of zzso and zzso by zzso A specific zzso zzso against the zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso reveal that zzso is specifically expressed in the principal cells of the zzso zzso Interestingly, its expression zzso at zzso Day 45 in zzso level and at zzso Day 60 in protein level while the zzso column cells undergo zzso Moreover, within this very period this zzso protein is confined inside the cell with a change of zzso distribution pattern, which implies its important roles in the cell differentiation zzso Only after the zzso zzso differentiation is completed and the zzso enter the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso into the zzso fluid and bound on the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play various roles in principal cell differentiation and zzso zzso
