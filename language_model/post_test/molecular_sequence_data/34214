zzso zzso zzso participate in the degradation of a variety of zzso zzso and interact zzso with other zzso in the production of zzso and zzso of zzso biomass into zzso In this work, the structure of a novel zzso family 51 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure consists of an zzso zzso core associated with a zzso zzso domain, which is stabilized by zzso zzso In contrast to other structurally characterized zzso zzso the accessory domain of zzso is intimately linked to the active site by a long zzso zzso which zzso the zzso cavity in shape and zzso zzso and structural analyses indicate that this motif is unique to zzso zzso Small angle X-ray scattering investigation showed that zzso assembles as a zzso in solution and is preserved at the optimum zzso temperature, zzso suggesting functional zzso Crystal packing analysis shows that the biological zzso encompasses a zzso of zzso and the multiple zzso zzso are predominantly fashioned by polar and zzso zzso
