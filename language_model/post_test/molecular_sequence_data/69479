We have developed and evaluated an zzso detection method for zzso zzso zzso The zzso uses two zzso zzso which are zzso at the zzso with zzso or zzso zzso Upon solution zzso of these zzso which react with the same strand of amplified DNA product, the formed hybrids are bound to zzso zzso of a zzso plate and detected by zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso and 3, zzso 5, zzso as zzso zzso critical for a high zzso ratio were the use of serum as blocking agent, the amount of zzso and zzso zzso zzso present in a reaction and the zzso of zzso DNA zzso The method has a detection limit of 1-3 zzso of amplified DNA and is quantitative in a range extending from 1 zzso to at least 200 zzso In the background of 1 zzso of total DNA, one zzso copy of zzso DNA can be detected after 35 cycles of zzso A comparison of the zzso detection method with primer extension analysis, a method previously shown to reach a similar detection limit, demonstrated complete agreement of the results of 118 amplified zzso The method proved simple, requires only about 3 zzso and could easily be adapted to the detection of other amplified target zzso
