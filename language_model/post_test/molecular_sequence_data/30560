zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of a larger group of proteins called zzso zzso These proteins all function to zzso zzso zzso 60 S zzso zzso leading to rapid shutdown of protein zzso They are zzso in sequence and are probably zzso zzso We have determined the complete primary zzso acid sequence of zzso and have found it to be zzso as expected, to that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A crystal structure for zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been determined from zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence zzso of these zzso we fit the primary sequences of zzso zzso and zzso to the backbone structure for zzso zzso and have generated zzso molecular models for zzso These models should prove useful in studying the zzso relationships of these proteins in particular and of the class in zzso
