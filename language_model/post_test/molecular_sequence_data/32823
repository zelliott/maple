Root zzso formation is controlled by plant hormones such as zzso zzso protein zzso genes have been identified in various plant species but their functions are not zzso We have isolated a full-length zzso clone zzso showing high sequence zzso to previously identified zzso genes from root zzso of zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso showed that there are at least four zzso genes in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso clone encodes a zzso of 120 zzso acid zzso with no signal zzso or zzso signals, indicating that it is a zzso zzso Its zzso location was confirmed using zzso zzso expressing a zzso fusion zzso Northern zzso showed that zzso expression was higher in root zzso than in leaves or zzso zzso Unlike the zzso genes of zzso and black zzso which are zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso expression is induced by zzso in leaf tissue of zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso is mainly expressed in the fixation zone of root zzso
