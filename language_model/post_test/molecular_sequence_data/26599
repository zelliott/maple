zzso of zzso due to zzso that involves the zzso zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso protein 2 zzso as the zzso component zzso frequently results in zzso In this report, we developed a zzso screening system to identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso This system was established by tagging zzso with fluorescent zzso zzso Green zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso to bind to zzso zzso We identified two compounds that inhibited the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso A and zzso zzso Further studies have shown that the compounds inhibit the zzso of zzso in zzso as well as zzso degradation in zzso zzso zzso both compounds exhibited preferential zzso activity against zzso and zzso cells compared with zzso cells and delayed the zzso phase progression in zzso zzso Our approach indicates a potential strategy for restoring zzso levels in human zzso
