zzso mice are highly susceptible to development of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso removal at the age of 1-3 months greatly reduces zzso zzso zzso that have the characteristics of zzso and/or zzso occur sporadically in peripheral zzso zzso of old zzso zzso zzso These zzso mice were shown to carry dormant potential zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells from zzso zzso mice, zzso at the age of 6 to 8 weeks, into intact or zzso young recipients yielded zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso zzso strain the zzso zzso of zzso mice was zzso with the zzso zzso thereby limiting viral replication and spread of the zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso As a result of this restriction in virus spread, zzso mice develop a low spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso zzso and about zzso of zzso zzso zzso at old zzso In zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice and intact zzso mice, zzso of the zzso were of the zzso B zzso Analysis of the zzso locus in these normal old zzso and zzso B zzso indicated zzso or zzso One particular zzso zzso was identified in many individual old zzso and zzso A second specific zzso zzso was found in some zzso zzso mechanisms involved in the expansion of zzso clones and their progression into tumors are zzso
