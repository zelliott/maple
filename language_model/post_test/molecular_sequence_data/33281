Mouse zzso binding requires a zzso of zzso zzso including an zzso high molecular weight, wheat germ zzso zzso zzso that associates with the egg coat at zzso zzso we report the zzso and identification of this zzso zzso zzso high molecular weight zzso isolated from zzso primed mouse zzso zzso competitively inhibit zzso binding in zzso Within this zzso zzso preparation, a distinct 220 zzso protein selectively binds to zzso surfaces, and was identified by sequence analysis as zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was confirmed by the loss of zzso following zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and by the ability of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to competitively inhibit zzso zzso As expected, zzso is expressed by the zzso cells of the zzso and zzso however, in contrast to previous reports, zzso is also associated with both the zzso zzso and the zzso space of mouse zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso affinity zzso demonstrate that whereas the bulk of zzso remains soluble in the zzso fluid, distinct zzso associate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is zzso and restricted to a relatively minor peanut zzso zzso zzso that zzso associates with the zzso surface, zzso zzso and zzso space, relative to other more abundant zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso which do not normally bind zzso with zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso
