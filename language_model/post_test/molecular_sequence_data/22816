zzso are involved in controlling and maintaining the zzso of DNA and are present in all zzso of zzso Unlike all other types of zzso similar type zzso zzso have only been identified in bacteria and zzso The only putative type zzso zzso in zzso is represented by zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite several common functional zzso zzso V shows no sequence similarity to other members of the same zzso The structure of the 61 zzso zzso zzso of zzso V reveals no structural similarity to other zzso Furthermore, the structure of the active site region is different, suggesting no conservation in the zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, the active site is zzso indicating the need of a zzso change for zzso The presence of a zzso in zzso with a unique structure suggests the evolution of a separate mechanism to alter zzso
