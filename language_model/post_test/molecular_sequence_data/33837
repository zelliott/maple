zzso intrinsic proteins zzso of the zzso family are involved in the transport of diverse zzso but the mechanisms controlling the selectivity of transport zzso are poorly zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate how the zzso zzso selectivity filter influences the zzso selectivity of two NIP zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso from rice and the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from zzso both proteins are also permeable to zzso Native and zzso zzso zzso of the two genes were expressed in zzso zzso and the transport activities for zzso B, zzso and water were zzso zzso of the zzso acid at the zzso second zzso zzso position of zzso did not affect the transport activities for zzso B, and zzso but that at the zzso position resulted in a total loss of zzso and B transport activities and a partial loss of zzso transport zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso selectivity filter and the zzso motifs to the zzso type did not result in a gain of zzso transport zzso B transport activity was partially lost in the zzso zzso but unaffected in the zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, both the single and double zzso at the zzso and/or zzso positions of zzso did not affect zzso transport zzso The results reveal that the zzso at the zzso position of the zzso filter of both zzso and zzso plays a key role in the zzso to zzso and B, but there is a relatively low selectivity for zzso
