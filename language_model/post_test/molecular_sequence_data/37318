zzso factors of the basic zzso family such as zzso are essential for adequate differentiation of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene leads to early zzso death caused by zzso zzso with an absent zzso and an zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to analyze the structure of the zzso zzso zzso to screen a broad spectrum of zzso for its zzso and to investigate zzso zzso expression at different zzso zzso The zzso protection zzso identified, in addition to the zzso zzso zzso two unexpected zzso transcripts that could be confirmed by a zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso However, all three transcripts were zzso exclusively in zzso zzso and not in other zzso such as the zzso zzso skin, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, zzso skull, adrenal zzso zzso stomach, zzso skin, zzso or zzso zzso analysis disclosed an additional zzso start site upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is measurable at all investigated stages of zzso After its initial detection on Day zzso zzso zzso set to zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso concentration increases significantly and reaches a maximum of zzso zzso zzso on Day zzso zzso The second half of gestation is marked by a more than zzso zzso decrease by Day zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso level of zzso zzso zzso is measurable at zzso
