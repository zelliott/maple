The zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso has been invoked in the zzso of both zzso arthritis zzso in the Lewis rat zzso and human zzso zzso zzso Lewis rats in the late phase of AA show diversification of the T cell response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Lewis rats with a mixture of peptides representing these zzso zzso protection against zzso However, the fine specificity and zzso significance of the zzso T cell repertoire, and the role of zzso self zzso zzso zzso if any, in spreading of the T cell response to zzso have not yet been zzso We observed that T cells primed by peptides zzso zzso can zzso transfer protection against AA to the recipient Lewis zzso However, these T cells can be activated by zzso zzso form of zzso but not native zzso showing that zzso are cryptic zzso The zzso T cells can be activated by the naturally generated zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso and vice zzso Furthermore, certain individual peptides zzso zzso and their self zzso can also induce protection against zzso These results support a model for the diversification of T cell response to zzso during the course of AA involving zzso of the display of cryptic zzso coupled with spontaneous induction of T cell response to the zzso dominant zzso zzso of zzso The identification of zzso cryptic zzso in zzso implicated in arthritis provides a novel approach for zzso of zzso zzso
