zzso signaling during the DNA damage response zzso to zzso breaks zzso is initiated by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeting zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the first zzso recruited to the damage site, and zzso follows zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso chains and zzso extends zzso Here, we show that zzso is inactive toward zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso specifically on zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows zzso charged zzso determines whether zzso proteins are zzso We find that zzso zzso chains are zzso to zzso zzso zzso at zzso and not on zzso Using a zzso of zzso unable to target zzso but still catalyzing zzso chains at zzso we show that zzso chains per zzso are insufficient for zzso but zzso target zzso is required for zzso
