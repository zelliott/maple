Point zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso have been associated with zzso inherited zzso zzso including the zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We describe a further zzso in zzso zzso in a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diabetes zzso The zzso was zzso in the zzso blood zzso and muscle zzso it was present at high levels in the zzso affected mother zzso in zzso and at low levels zzso zzso in blood, muscle and zzso of an unaffected zzso The zzso was not found in 121 normal controls or 35 other patients with zzso zzso The zzso is at a highly zzso position in the zzso zzso close to the zzso zzso which is associated with more than zzso of zzso zzso Further more, both zzso lie within a possible zzso control zzso This finding adds further support to the evidence that zzso in this region and in other zzso zzso genes may cause zzso
