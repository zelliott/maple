zzso regulate the rhythm of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso even minor pauses can give rise to improperly formed proteins and human zzso Such minor pauses are difficult to characterize by ensemble methods, but can be readily examined by zzso zzso zzso Here we use zzso to carry out real-time monitoring of the expression of a full-length zzso the green fluorescent protein zzso Emerald zzso We demonstrate significant correlations between measured zzso rates and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and provide a quantitative estimate of the effect on zzso rate of replacing a zzso recognizing an abundant zzso with a synonymous zzso zzso to a rarer zzso Our results suggest that zzso selection plays an important general role in modulating the rates and rhythms of protein zzso potentially influencing simultaneous zzso processes such as folding and chemical zzso
