We have recently shown that T cells zzso cardiac zzso early in graft rejection use a limited zzso zzso zzso V beta zzso In this study we tested whether this limited repertoire of V beta genes is important for graft zzso A cell line, zzso was established from zzso zzso zzso zzso heart zzso 2 days after zzso This cell line is composed of zzso T cells that primarily recognize the class II zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso expressed by the donor zzso This cell line zzso acute rejection of donor hearts with a median survival time zzso of zzso days following adoptive transfer to zzso zzso zzso zzso This rate of graft rejection was significantly zzso zzso zzso accelerated when compared with a zzso of 60 days for zzso in zzso control zzso The zzso acceleration of graft rejection was donor specific as zzso third-party heart zzso were rejected with a delayed tempo zzso zzso zzso zzso The V beta repertoire of this cell line was primarily restricted to the expression of V beta 4, 15 and 19 zzso The zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso from this cell line demonstrated that the restricted use of the V gene repertoire was not shared with the zzso D and J zzso A wide variety of zzso zzso and J beta genes were used in association with selected V beta zzso These data provide evidence for the role a restricted repertoire of V beta genes plays in cardiac zzso rejection in this zzso The restricted usage of the V beta repertoire in an early zzso response to zzso may provide the opportunity to zzso disrupt the rejection reaction by targeting selected zzso populations for elimination at the time of organ zzso
