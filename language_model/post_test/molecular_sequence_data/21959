We describe solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso on zzso formed by the zzso zzso zzso associated with Alzheimer's disease zzso that place constraints on the identity and symmetry of contacts between zzso parallel zzso in the zzso We refer to these contacts as internal and external zzso zzso depending on whether they are within a single molecular layer or between molecular zzso The data include zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso that indicate internal zzso contacts between side chains of zzso and zzso and side chains of zzso zzso and zzso as well as external zzso contacts between side chains of zzso and zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso that indicate external zzso contacts between the side chain of zzso and the zzso backbone at zzso zzso zzso of magnetic zzso zzso between the side chain zzso group of zzso and the side chain zzso group of zzso that indicate salt bridge zzso zzso dilution experiments allow us to make distinctions between zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these data and previously determined structural constraints from solid-state zzso and electron zzso we construct full molecular models using restrained molecular dynamics simulations and restrained energy zzso These models apply to zzso zzso grown with gentle zzso We also present evidence for different internal zzso contacts in zzso zzso grown without zzso which are zzso zzso
