zzso occupancy of a large percentage of zzso zzso zzso is necessary for the suppression of zzso zzso synthesis by human zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the levels of zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in both normal and zzso zzso human zzso zzso and compared the degree of suppression of zzso synthesis by zzso in cultures of the two cell types in order to investigate whether or not the zzso system played an important role in the zzso of zzso By zzso binding zzso we recorded zzso zzso zzso sites per cell zzso zzso SE, zzso zzso 9) in primary cultures of normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites in zzso cells zzso zzso 10, P zzso zzso zzso zzso constant zzso values did not vary between normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of the number of zzso binding sites per cell to values comparable to those obtained in normal zzso Analysis of zzso zzso of zzso extracts from normal zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) revealed that the former zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso higher relative density of zzso protein than the zzso By comparing the optical zzso of zzso chain reaction products generated from normal zzso zzso 6) and zzso zzso zzso 9) zzso total zzso zzso using an internal standard, zzso zzso zzso we established a relative ratio, zzso of zzso zzso comparing the biological responsiveness of normal and zzso zzso to zzso suppression of zzso zzso synthesis showed that zzso inhibited zzso synthesis in a zzso manner with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) in normal cells while an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was recorded using zzso zzso zzso 5) zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso express fewer zzso than normal cells as a result of a decrease in specific gene zzso The decreased responsiveness of zzso cells to circulating zzso may be among the factors responsible for an increased level of zzso synthesis by zzso in zzso zzso
