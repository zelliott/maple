zzso are zzso zzso complexes consisting of a set of zzso zzso zzso A zzso for component zzso of rat zzso was isolated by screening a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso library using synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to partial zzso acid sequences of the zzso The zzso deduced from the open reading frame consisted of 240 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso Computer analysis revealed little similarity of zzso to other proteins reported so zzso The primary structure of zzso showed partial sequence zzso to that of another component zzso but no regions of zzso with the sequence of component zzso Thus zzso is concluded to be a new type of zzso of the zzso zzso
