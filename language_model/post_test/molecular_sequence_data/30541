We have previously shown that the signal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Y zzso does not function in zzso cells unless a zzso zzso in the central core is replaced by zzso Additional zzso were constructed to investigate the features of this zzso core zzso region that are important for signal sequence function in zzso zzso We find that the degree of zzso of the h region of any particular zzso signal is directly related to the efficiency with which it directs the zzso of zzso A minimal h region in a functional signal appears to consist of five zzso zzso interrupted by 1 zzso Analysis of potential secondary structures suggests that a functional zzso signal is more likely than the zzso zzso signal to adopt either a beta strand or an zzso zzso
