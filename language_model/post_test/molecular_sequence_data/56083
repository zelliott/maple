We developed a rapid method to determine zzso sites for putative zzso zzso This procedure has been successfully used to define a specific consensus site for the human zzso zinc finger zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso containing 11 consecutive finger motifs located at the zzso zzso and an zzso domain located at the zzso zzso These features suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso protein involved in the regulation of gene zzso We have expressed the zzso protein from zzso coli and have employed a zzso chain reaction method using random zzso to identify its zzso binding zzso The core sequence for the zzso zzso site is zzso
