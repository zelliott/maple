Land plants have developed a zzso preventing uncontrolled water zzso Here we report that an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso G zzso full zzso is required for leaf water conservation in both wild barley and zzso A spontaneous zzso zzso in wild barley has a low capacity to retain leaf water, a zzso associated with reduced zzso deposition and a thin zzso zzso cloning revealed that zzso encodes an zzso full zzso The gene was highly expressed in the zzso zone of a growing leaf (the site of zzso zzso and its gene product also was localized in developing, but not in mature zzso A de zzso wild barley zzso named zzso along with two zzso zzso lines of rice zzso in the zzso of zzso also were unable to restrict water loss from detached zzso zzso is hypothesized to function as a zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso were found in green algae, zzso and zzso indicating that this full zzso is highly zzso in the evolution of land zzso
