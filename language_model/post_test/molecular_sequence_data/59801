Limited emphasis has been given to the molecular study of zzso an asexual method of reproduction where seeds are produced without zzso Most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reproduce by zzso zzso zzso however, rare sexual plants have been zzso A modified differential display procedure was used to compare gene expression in zzso zzso containing zzso with either sexual or zzso female zzso The modification incorporated zzso zzso anchored zzso as the only zzso source, and was a reliable and consistent approach for detecting zzso displayed zzso Using 20 different zzso and two anchor zzso zzso zzso fragments between 200 and 600 zzso were zzso From these, eight zzso zzso displayed zzso were identified and zzso Based on northern analysis, one zzso was detected in only the sexual zzso two zzso in only zzso zzso and one zzso was present in both types of zzso Three fragments could not be detected and one zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of gene expression during sexual and zzso development in zzso represents a new model system and a strategy for investigating female zzso development in the zzso
