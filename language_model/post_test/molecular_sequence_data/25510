zzso in the third zzso gene zzso are shown to display genetic interactions with specific zzso of the zzso locus zzso which encodes a zzso protein with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso lethal zzso zzso exhibit zzso and zzso zzso which are reminiscent of those produced by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We present the molecular cloning of zzso and show that it encodes two zzso expressed transcripts from a zzso zzso greater than 30 zzso in zzso The deduced protein product of zzso zzso acids contains a single zzso domain and 14 zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents another member of the group of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis reveals complex zzso and spatial patterns of zzso expression consistent with the zzso and zzso defects observed in zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the implications of zzso function within the context of other zzso molecules known to be involved in the differentiation of zzso derived zzso
