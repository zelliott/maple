The genetic basis of zzso resistance in six clinical zzso of zzso zzso was demonstrated to be 3- or zzso zzso within zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso all result in repetition of one or two zzso acids in the region from zzso to zzso close to but distinct from the zzso zzso a zzso previously reported in a resistant laboratory strain zzso Lopez, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Six zzso clinical zzso lacked such zzso The role of the zzso in zzso zzso resistance was confirmed by transforming zzso or zzso zzso fragments into the zzso of a susceptible zzso Two members of a clone of zzso zzso one susceptible and one resistant to zzso which are highly related by other criteria, were shown to have zzso sequences that differ in zzso of zzso in addition to the zzso responsible for zzso It is zzso that horizontal gene exchange has been involved in the acquisition (or zzso of resistance within this zzso However, five of the six resistant zzso have distinct zzso and other sequence zzso suggesting that resistance has arisen independently on many zzso
