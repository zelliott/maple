The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and is implicated in the editing of viral zzso during zzso and persistent zzso We have now isolated and characterized human zzso clones that contain the promoter region required for zzso of the zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso identified additional upstream zzso 1 sequence that was localized on zzso and zzso zzso clones by Southern zzso analysis and sequence zzso A Northern zzso analysis using a probe corresponding to the zzso zzso 1 sequence and adjacent zzso 2 sequence detected a major zzso transcript of approximately zzso that was zzso in human zzso U zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso as the reporter in zzso possessing various zzso fragments of the zzso zzso led to the identification of a functional zzso promoter that directed zzso zzso of zzso zzso determination and deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed a consensus copy of the zzso Response zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso that was flanked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso element previously found to be unique to the human and mouse zzso gene zzso A zzso minimal promoter zzso possessing the zzso and zzso elements was sufficient to drive zzso zzso
