The zzso zzso zzso play a central role in the metabolism of chemical zzso The action of these zzso can lead to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso expression in animal models give rise to large differences in zzso to chemical zzso so genetic zzso in zzso expression may be expected to be an important factor in individual human zzso to zzso Of particular interest is the genetic zzso at the zzso zzso zzso locus zzso Although this is a minor liver zzso its zzso expression is associated with the abnormal metabolism of at least 30 therapeutic drugs, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso reports have been made on the association of this zzso with cancer zzso This disagreement may be attributable to limitations of the zzso zzso used to identify affected individuals zzso zzso zzso In order to clarify these anomalies, we have developed a simple zzso zzso with which we can identify the majority of zzso The zzso is centered around the primary gene zzso responsible for the zzso a G to A transition at the junction of zzso zzso 4 which results in a zzso in the zzso zzso The frequency of this zzso is zzso in zzso We have studied the frequency of zzso zzso in a control population and in a wide range of cancer zzso No association between this zzso and lung cancer zzso was zzso however, in other populations of cancer patients some very interesting shifts were found in the proportion of zzso and zzso from that in the normal zzso
