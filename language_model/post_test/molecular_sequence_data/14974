zzso zzso play a major role in zzso cells, despite being a minor component of most zzso This is the first report on zzso metabolism in a zzso the moss zzso zzso Moss zzso composition is similar to that of other land plants growing under normal zzso In contrast to the large number of zzso genes present in flowering plants, the zzso zzso zzso encodes only two type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are very similar at both the zzso and protein product zzso However, the expression of the two genes is zzso zzso and in zzso zzso characterization shows that the resulting zzso have different zzso zzso zzso uses zzso and zzso with similar preference and also zzso zzso to produce zzso a zzso not yet detected in intact plant zzso zzso prefers zzso as zzso and is much less active towards zzso and zzso Thus, zzso shows properties reminiscent of both zzso and zzso Moreover, a substitution of zzso acid by zzso in the zzso loop drastically reduced zzso activity and altered the zzso specificity to zzso being the preferred zzso compared with zzso and zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso specificity of plant zzso is determined in a zzso manner, which provides new insights into the regulatory modes of zzso activity in zzso
