Alzheimer's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of zzso senile plaques composed of zzso zzso (A zzso Whereas most cases of zzso occur zzso about zzso of zzso cases are inherited as a fully zzso zzso dominant zzso zzso in the recently cloned zzso genes zzso and zzso are by far the most common cause of early onset familial zzso 

Cellular expression of zzso and zzso zzso proteins was analyzed by zzso and zzso labeling followed by zzso In zzso zzso sites of zzso proteins were analyzed by extensive zzso 

zzso as well as zzso proteins were localized predominantly within the zzso zzso zzso However, small amounts of the zzso proteins were detected within the zzso zzso where they zzso with the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to be highly zzso whereas very little zzso was observed for zzso The selective zzso of zzso occurs exclusively on zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso was mapped to zzso zzso 7, 9, and 19 within an zzso stretch at the N zzso which is absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to zzso the N zzso of zzso in zzso 

The majority of zzso proteins were detected in the zzso where little if any zzso processing of beta zzso was zzso zzso retention of zzso proteins might occur by zzso zzso Small amounts of zzso proteins were also detected in the zzso where they zzso with beta zzso This might suggest that potential interactions between zzso proteins and beta zzso could occur within the zzso Selective zzso of zzso proteins within the zzso domain missing in zzso indicates differences in the biological functions and regulation of the two highly zzso zzso
