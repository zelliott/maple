The zzso acid sequences of 16 zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso have been determined by a direct protein chemical zzso In addition, zzso acid sequences of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been established by DNA sequencing of their genes as well as by protein zzso zzso of their sequences with those of zzso proteins from other organisms revealed that proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso are related to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso being more zzso to zzso than zzso counterparts, and proteins zzso zzso and zzso are related to only zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, some proteins are found to be similar to only zzso zzso whereas other proteins show no zzso to any other known zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso acid compositions between zzso and zzso zzso proteins revealed that zzso proteins gain zzso and zzso acid zzso and significantly lose zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso proteins seem to lose zzso as compared with zzso coli zzso zzso
