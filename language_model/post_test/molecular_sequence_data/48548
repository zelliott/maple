So far zzso proteins zzso have not been discovered in zzso zzso In this study we investigated and characterized a microbial zzso derived from the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso which lives in a hot spring at around 75 zzso The gene for the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein was functionally expressed in the cell zzso of zzso coli cells and showed active zzso transport upon zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso bound only zzso as a zzso and showed an zzso maximum at zzso zzso In addition, zzso exhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes, which are characteristic of zzso Of note, zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso maintained its zzso even at 75 zzso and the zzso rate constant of zzso was much lower than those of other zzso pumping zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, these results suggest that microbial zzso are also distributed among zzso organisms and have high zzso zzso should allow the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of zzso transport and protein zzso
