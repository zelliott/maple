We have used transient zzso in zzso skeletal muscle cells, newborn rat primary zzso zzso and zzso cells to characterize regulatory elements of the mouse muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sequence reveals a zzso zzso positive regulatory region between zzso and zzso A zzso zzso from this region acts as a skeletal muscle zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso high-level expression in skeletal zzso but is inactive in zzso indicating that skeletal and cardiac muscle zzso regulatory sites are zzso To further delineate muscle regulatory zzso we tested six sites within the zzso zzso for their functional zzso zzso at five sites decrease expression in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and zzso zzso zzso at two of these sites, Left E box and zzso cause similar decreases in all three cell zzso zzso at three sites have larger effects in muscle than zzso zzso an zzso site zzso has a pronounced effect in both zzso muscle types, zzso at the zzso (Right zzso site are relatively specific to expression in skeletal muscle, and zzso at the zzso site are relatively specific to expression in cardiac zzso Changes at the zzso site tend to increase expression in muscle cells but decrease it in zzso zzso In contrast to reports involving zzso of zzso cells with plasmids expressing the zzso determination factor zzso we show that the skeletal zzso activity of zzso zzso sites is zzso lower than that of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso binding sites alone are not sufficient for high-level expression in skeletal zzso containing zzso levels of zzso and other zzso determination zzso
