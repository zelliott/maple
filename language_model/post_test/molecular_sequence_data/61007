zzso proteins play an essential role in membrane trafficking in zzso zzso They activate and zzso zzso proteins by serving as zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso A zzso zzso is composed of an zzso twisted sheet of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso sheet has local similarity to the zzso repeats from protein zzso 5 but has a different overall zzso zzso also shares structural features with zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso zzso models of zzso binding suggest that zzso may function as lever arms, zzso forces generated by zzso changes in zzso to drive zzso of zzso zzso
