zzso zzso virus zzso were used to zzso mouse zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso or human zzso together with human zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso to examine the zzso processing of zzso by these zzso zzso performed on high pressure gel zzso zzso extracts obtained from zzso cells and corresponding zzso media revealed distinct profiles of zzso for products generated by each zzso zzso produced intermediate sized processing products zzso zzso the major zzso zzso species observed zzso at the positions of zzso B, the zzso fragment, and free zzso zzso exhibited a more complete processing zzso The major zzso zzso produced were free zzso free zzso free zzso and free zzso Thus zzso appears to be more capable of generating active zzso units from zzso than is zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso B, an unidentified peak between the zzso and zzso fragments, and a small amount of the zzso zzso zzso data verified that the production of the zzso zzso by zzso occurred as a result of a zzso zzso The ability of zzso to cleave zzso (but not zzso at a zzso site implies that the structural context of the paired basic zzso site may be more important in the determination of zzso specificity than the particular pair of basic zzso at the zzso
