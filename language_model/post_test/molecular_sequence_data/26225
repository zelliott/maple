The zzso virus immediate early zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso of viral and cellular gene zzso The zzso action of zzso protein has led to the suggestion that it functions by an unusual zzso Here, we show that zzso protein has the two essential features of a typical cellular zzso zzso a zzso zzso region, and zzso a zzso region that directs zzso zzso or an unrelated zzso region, to the vicinity of the zzso We map the zzso protein zzso region to 34 zzso zzso demonstrate that it is comparable in strength to the strongest known zzso region, and show that it is required for the zzso activity of the intact zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso region is highly zzso We provide evidence that it uses the same cellular target as an unrelated zzso zzso and a different target from that of a zzso zzso Our results provide insight into the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso
