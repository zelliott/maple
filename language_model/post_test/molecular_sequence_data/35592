The functions of zzso zzso proteins zzso are governed by relationships between information zzso in their zzso acid sequences and the ensembles of zzso that they sample as autonomous zzso Most zzso are zzso with sequences that include both positively and zzso charged zzso zzso we focus here on the zzso relationships of zzso zzso The fraction of charged zzso discriminates between weak and strong zzso Using zzso simulations, we show that weak zzso form zzso whereas the zzso preferences of strong zzso are determined by a combination of fraction of charged zzso values and the linear sequence zzso of zzso charged zzso We zzso the latter using a patterning zzso zzso that lies between zero and zzso The value of zzso is low for zzso zzso and in these zzso zzso zzso zzso and attractions are zzso leading to the zzso of preferences for zzso that resemble either zzso random walks or generic zzso random zzso zzso of zzso charged zzso within linear sequences leads to high zzso and preferences for zzso zzso caused by long-range zzso attractions induced by zzso zzso We propose a zzso theory to explain the zzso zzso properties of strong zzso We show that naturally occurring strong zzso have low zzso and this feature implies a selection for random zzso zzso The design of sequences with different zzso demonstrably alters the zzso preferences of zzso zzso and this ability could become a useful tool for enabling direct inquiries into connections between zzso relationships and functions of zzso
