An zzso of an zzso acid sequence in the processing site of the insulin zzso by a point zzso of the insulin zzso gene produced extreme insulin zzso We characterized functional properties of the zzso insulin zzso in transformed zzso from a zzso zzso binding to intact cells and to a partially zzso insulin zzso preparation was radically decreased to zzso and zzso of the control values, zzso In competitive insulin binding to intact cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had the same relative binding activity in both the patient's and the control cells, but zzso and zzso were markedly less able to zzso zzso in the patient's zzso In contrast to the study in intact cells, zzso and zzso as well as other insulin zzso had the same relative binding activity to bind to the partially zzso insulin zzso preparations from both the patient's and the control zzso As regards the signal zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso insulin zzso occurred zzso to the amount of decreased insulin zzso With zzso zzso treatment, the abnormal binding characteristics and zzso were zzso through conversion to functionally normal zzso In spite of the abnormal processing, zzso of receptors into zzso structures was observed in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso insulin zzso in the plasma zzso has an altered zzso which affects its binding characteristics but not its zzso signal zzso
