To develop a rapid and accurate method of typing large numbers of clinical zzso of zzso zzso four regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and B, zzso zzso C, zzso and D, zzso zzso were zzso amplified from 24 zzso When region A was zzso to zzso zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso all of the variable length restriction fragments zzso When region B was zzso to zzso zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso a set of variable length restriction fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso When region C was separated by zzso gel zzso a series of products ranging in size from approximately zzso zzso was zzso When regions C and D were zzso with zzso a constant region of 430 zzso was found in both products and in all zzso From the above experiments it was concluded that the variable length Group II restriction fragments and the variable length region C amplification products were due to variable length zzso zzso regions between zzso of the one zzso When region C amplification products were separated by zzso zzso 16 variable length zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated from 24 zzso zzso strains ranging in size from zzso zzso After analysis with maximum zzso the 24 strains were divided into 14 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
