zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bond zzso formation, and zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso cancer progression is not yet clear, and there is a need for zzso selective, and safe zzso zzso of zzso Here, we report a class of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso that are active against a panel of human zzso cancer cell zzso Using fluorescent zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso we established that zzso 31, one of the most active zzso acts as an irreversible zzso inhibitor of zzso forming a zzso bond with the active site zzso of zzso We also showed that zzso activity is essential for the survival and proliferation of human zzso cancer zzso In zzso zzso 31 showed tumor targeting ability and significantly suppressed zzso tumor growth without causing toxicity to normal zzso These irreversible zzso zzso zzso represent an important approach for the development of targeted zzso agents for zzso cancer therapy, and they can also serve as useful zzso for investigating the biology of zzso zzso
