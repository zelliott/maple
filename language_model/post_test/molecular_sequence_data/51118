The gene zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso and zzso acid, was cloned from a zzso zzso strain zzso and expressed in zzso coli, in a zzso system, and the zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was composed of two zzso zzso their molecular weights were estimated by zzso to be 40,000 and zzso and had a zzso of zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso deduced from the zzso zzso showed high similarity zzso with that of a previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also resembles the bacterial zzso zzso zzso with respect to their molecular organization and zzso acid zzso but differs from them with respect to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited not only zzso zzso activity, but also zzso zzso The zzso values of the zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not recognized by zzso prepared against bacterial zzso
