The zzso zzso zzso is a putative breast tumor zzso To define the role of zzso we used a segment of this protein as bait in a zzso zzso screen and identified a novel zzso zzso zzso In general, primary tumors and cancer cell lines showed lower expression of zzso than normal zzso Together with the location of this gene on the long arm of zzso zzso a region of frequent loss of zzso in cancer, these results suggest a possible role of zzso in zzso In zzso analysis of this protein revealed that it contains multiple classic zinc finger zzso that are predicted to bind zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso strongly interacts with zzso and this interaction occurs through the zzso 109 zzso acids of zzso In contrast, there was a weak interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso the other two members of this zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso further confirmed the strength and selectivity of the zzso zzso The zzso repression of growth factor zzso zzso a previously characterized zzso zzso zinc finger zzso was shown to be enhanced by zzso but to a lesser extent by zzso and zzso We therefore suggest that each of the various gene zzso zinc finger proteins may specifically interact with one or more of the zzso proteins to generate a defined range of zzso zzso zzso
