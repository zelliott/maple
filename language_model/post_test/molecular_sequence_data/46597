zzso knowledge about the rate and mode of the genetic variation is vital for understanding how zzso zzso disease and develops resistance as well as for studies on the molecular epidemiology and origin of the zzso To unveil the molecular clock of zzso we analyzed a unique set of viruses from a known transmission history with separation times between samples of up to 25 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso regions of the zzso were zzso and genetic distances were estimated by using the true tree and a zzso substitution model based on a general zzso zzso process with a gamma distribution to account for differences in substitution rates among zzso Linear zzso analysis showed that separation times were significantly correlated with synonymous as well as zzso zzso distances in both zzso and zzso giving strong support for the existence of a molecular zzso The estimated rate of zzso substitution was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per year in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso analyses showed that there was a significant genetic distance at zero divergence zzso This zzso zzso exists because the ramifications in the zzso trees do not zzso to time of transmission, but rather to the zzso time of the most recent common zzso of the viruses carried by the zzso and the zzso zzso experiments showed that neither the zzso nor the zzso clocks were zzso which indicates that the introduction of zzso zzso can be described adequately by a simple zzso zzso zzso
