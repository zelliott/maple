Purple sulfur bacteria zzso mainly occur in zzso aquatic and zzso zzso where they play important roles in cycling carbon and zzso Many zzso characteristically produce the unique zzso zzso which is important not only for its light zzso and zzso properties but also because of its zzso product, zzso which is a zzso for ancient sediments derived from zzso zzso The specific zzso pattern of the zzso of zzso is unlikely to be formed by zzso processes and should therefore reflect an zzso activity from zzso zzso This study describes two zzso that produce the zzso of zzso the only structural element of zzso preserved in zzso Genes zzso zzso of zzso were identified in the draft zzso sequence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso Two zzso transcribed genes zzso a zzso lycopene zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli showed that this gene zzso a lycopene zzso that produced zzso as the only zzso Although the sequence of the zzso zzso was more similar to zzso sequences of green sulfur bacteria than to zzso sequences of zzso expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso showed that the zzso produced zzso with zzso rather than zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso capable of converting zzso to zzso have independently evolved at least two zzso These results indicate that it probably will not be possible to deduce the activity of zzso zzso solely from sequence zzso
