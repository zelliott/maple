Four zzso functional zzso box genes were characterized from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso is an zzso gene and zzso is a putative zzso zzso The identity of these four genes was further supported by the presence of zzso motifs in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso showed an expression pattern different from zzso zzso with expression in the zzso zzso lip and zzso and was barely detected in the zzso The expression pattern for zzso was similar to zzso and different from zzso zzso since its expression was zzso in the zzso The expression pattern for zzso was nearly identical to zzso The similarities in the expression patterns of the zzso genes zzso 11 and 7 indicated that their zzso regulation is highly zzso zzso in the zzso Unlike zzso zzso was only expressed in zzso leaves and in the lip and zzso of mature flowers, which zzso it from most genes in the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso 11 or 7 caused extremely early zzso whereas zzso only caused moderately early flowering in transgenic zzso zzso In addition, flower organ zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in zzso and zzso zzso were produced in zzso while flower organ zzso were not observed in zzso or zzso transgenic zzso This result reveals possible functional diversification of the zzso zzso genes zzso 11, 7 and 10 in regulating flower transition and zzso
