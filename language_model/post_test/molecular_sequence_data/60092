Recently zzso coding for cell surface molecules have been isolated from zzso The molecules for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from the marine zzso zzso zzso have been described zzso In the present study also the zzso for one putative zzso has been identified from zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence comprises the characteristic signatures, found in other zzso zzso zzso the estimated size is zzso zzso To obtain first insights into the molecular events which proceed during zzso fusion, the expressions of these genes were determined on zzso and zzso zzso The zzso as well as zzso raised against the zzso sponge proteins zzso zzso and zzso were used and Northern zzso experiments and zzso analyses have been zzso The results show that zzso of the two zzso of an zzso zzso as well as of the zzso are strongly zzso after zzso levels of zzso zzso have been determined in the fusion zone of the zzso after a 10 days zzso zzso studies of sections through the fusion zone support these zzso In contrast the zzso of the gene zzso zzso is drastically zzso after zzso In a parallel series of experiments the level of the zzso zzso was determined and it was found that it remained unchanged after zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are involved in zzso recognition of zzso
