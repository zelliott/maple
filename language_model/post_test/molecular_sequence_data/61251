The high sensitivity of zzso stimulation in detecting primary or zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso suggests widespread expression of the corresponding zzso type on human zzso Indeed, zzso studies have demonstrated zzso zzso receptors not only in more than zzso of zzso but also in a high percentage of small cell lung zzso some zzso zzso zzso and potentially a variety of zzso The aim of this study was to systematically screen and zzso in a zzso model and a pilot clinical study, suitable zzso for targeting zzso receptors in zzso 

A variety of zzso zzso all bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso or derivatives zzso were zzso They were zzso by the zzso or zzso zzso The peptides were members of the zzso or zzso families, which differ by the zzso position of a zzso zzso Their stability and affinity were studied in zzso and in zzso their zzso and therapeutic efficacy were tested in nude mice bearing subcutaneous human zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso derivatives of suitable peptides were zzso zzso and their zzso and initial clinical evaluations were performed, labeled with zzso 

All members of the zzso or zzso families were stable in serum (with zzso of several hours at 37 degrees zzso zzso the stability of those peptides bearing zzso zzso zzso or zzso acids was significantly zzso In accordance with their comparably low zzso zzso members of the zzso family showed fairly low zzso in the tumor and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives performed significantly better but also displayed a comparably high zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso This effect was probably due to their similar affinity for both zzso and zzso zzso Best tumor zzso and zzso ratios were obtained with members of the zzso family because of their selectivity and affinity for the zzso zzso zzso Pilot therapy experiments in zzso animals showed significant zzso efficacy compared with zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso were successfully zzso In a pilot clinical study, zzso and zzso derivatives showed excellent targeting of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as all known tumor zzso 

zzso zzso may be a useful new class of zzso peptides for diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso tumors, such as zzso or small cell lung zzso zzso zzso derivatives may be preferable because of their zzso zzso zzso hence lower zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso
