The drug zzso A zzso exerts its zzso action by binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and, as a complex, binding to and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is unknown whether a similar mode of action occurs during the drug's zzso zzso zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by affinity zzso yielding single zzso bands of zzso zzso according to zzso These proteins were tested for zzso activity by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso Both proteins were zzso and zzso and were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso with zzso A zzso values of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso However, neither of the zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso These data suggest the zzso mode of action of zzso in these zzso models does not involve the zzso of a signal zzso zzso requiring interaction with zzso
