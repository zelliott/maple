The first synthesis of a zzso library by zzso assisted switching phase zzso synthesis is zzso zzso synthesis enables flexible switching between zzso steps and zzso reactions conducted with molecules attached to a zzso zzso zzso A library of zzso derived from the lead compound zzso strongly zzso zzso variations in the zzso part, the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso fatty acids was designed and zzso The zzso synthesis of the zzso fatty acid building blocks was achieved by employing zzso zzso of zzso fatty zzso zzso were prepared by this approach without any zzso isolation steps, mostly in excellent zzso Final zzso to the zzso acids was accomplished by zzso zzso zzso All prepared zzso were tested for their zzso properties against human zzso cells by zzso the zzso of the zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso into the zzso The observed zzso relationships of zzso indicate a specific, zzso mode of action, with small structural variations in the zzso resulting in strong effects on the zzso activities of the zzso at low zzso zzso
