zzso E zzso was found to inhibit primary zzso zzso in our previous zzso Now we examined the effect and mechanisms of zzso on the central nervous system zzso zzso in experimental allergic zzso zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso following zzso and continued throughout the zzso The effect on the progression of zzso and other relevant parameters were zzso zzso reduced the zzso and severity of zzso Spinal zzso zzso analysis showed that the therapeutic effect of zzso was associated with reduced zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso As reverse zzso chain reaction analysis zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso T cells from zzso zzso of zzso mice expressed enhanced levels of zzso and zzso zzso compared with T cells from normal zzso However, zzso and zzso expressions were suppressed in T cells from zzso zzso In zzso study also showed zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression in T cells through suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, whereas it inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression through suppressing zzso zzso in zzso T zzso As a result, the initial influx of T cells into zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells was inhibited in spinal zzso from zzso mice as determination of zzso expressions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the secondary influx of zzso zzso and zzso cells was decreased in spinal cords from zzso zzso These findings suggest the potential therapeutic effect of zzso on multiple zzso
