For long, our knowledge of the biology of zzso zzso has long relied solely upon the study of the two structurally unrelated zzso identified in culture zzso of a zzso zzso However, the characterization of a number of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso has now established that structural relationships of zzso usually link these zzso which is consistent with the genetic basis of the mating type systems evolved by these zzso In this context, our growing appreciation of the zzso and variable elements of the zzso architecture should foster progress in the understanding of zzso interactions and thus, provide important clues into zzso mechanisms of zzso
