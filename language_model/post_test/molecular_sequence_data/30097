The issue of zzso repertoire selection has been addressed recently by several zzso While evidence has been provided for both negative and positive selection of zzso and zzso alpha beta T cells, the molecular basis of positive selection remains zzso In this article Juan zzso and colleagues describe molecular features of gamma delta zzso selection in the fetal zzso These features were deduced from extensive zzso sequence data of gamma delta zzso zzso genes in fetal zzso Their data suggest the active participation of a self zzso in the positive selection of gamma delta T zzso
