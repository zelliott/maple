Natural resistance to infection with zzso zzso is controlled by a dominant gene on mouse zzso 1, called zzso zzso or zzso zzso affects the capacity of zzso to destroy zzso zzso zzso early during zzso We have assembled a 400 zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso containing zzso A search for zzso units by zzso amplification identified six novel genes in this zzso zzso expression studies showed that one of them, designated zzso was expressed exclusively in zzso populations from zzso zzso and in the zzso line zzso zzso encodes an integral membrane protein that has structural zzso with known zzso and zzso transport systems, suggesting a zzso membrane transport zzso zzso to infection zzso in 13 zzso and zzso strains tested is associated with a zzso zzso to zzso substitution within predicted zzso domain 2 of zzso
