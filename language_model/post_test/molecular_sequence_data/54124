A novel strictly zzso moderately zzso and zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment located in south zzso zzso of strain zzso stained zzso and were zzso straight and zzso zzso zzso had a typical zzso zzso structure, unlike the thick, multilayered cell wall of its closest relative zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso grew between 20 and 48 zzso zzso 40 zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso required at least zzso zzso zzso and grew in the presence of zzso zzso up to 150 g zzso zzso 40 g zzso zzso extract (2 g zzso was required for degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Also, strain zzso grew zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso but was unable to grow on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate and zzso were not zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso was a member of the family zzso in the order zzso strain zzso was related to members of various zzso of the family zzso It exhibited highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, it is suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species in a new zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type strain of zzso zzso
