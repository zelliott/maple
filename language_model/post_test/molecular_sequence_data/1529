Little is known about the role of the zzso immune response to zzso C virus zzso This study provides molecular evidence for the mechanism by which zzso zzso from the zzso of chronic zzso patients have lower zzso activities against the binding of zzso zzso envelope protein to human zzso cell lines than to a zzso cell zzso zzso binds to several putative zzso specifically human zzso human scavenger zzso class B, type 1; and zzso zzso We have shown that zzso binds to target cells via these receptors in a zzso zzso Thus, incomplete zzso of one of the receptors leads to only a partial zzso blockade and, zzso evasion of the host immune zzso We demonstrated that the difference in and reduction of zzso was closely related to impaired blockade of zzso binding to scavenger zzso class B, type 1, and zzso zzso We have also shown that soluble zzso protein binds to multiple soluble receptors via separate binding zzso on zzso providing further evidence for the distinct recognition of multiple cellular receptors by zzso This report suggests a novel finding that biased zzso immune responses to zzso zzso might provide an alternative mechanism for viral escape without the involvement of zzso Additionally, our data give crucial consideration to the development of zzso vaccines that stimulate protective zzso immune zzso
