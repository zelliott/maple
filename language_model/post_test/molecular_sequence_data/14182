zzso zzso zzso zzso causes bacterial spot on zzso worldwide, and for the last 10 years severe outbreaks have been reported in the zzso Valley, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resembles zzso zzso zzso tomato in that it is also zzso for tomato and causes the same types of zzso We used a collection of 106 strains of zzso zzso to characterize the relationships between zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso paying special attention to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso gene sequences showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes diseases in zzso forms six genetic lineages within zzso 3 of zzso zzso strains as defined by zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso tomato forms two distinct genetic zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso conducted with eight zzso zzso confirmed the genetic structure obtained with zzso and zzso sequence zzso These results provide promising tools for zzso zzso studies on diseases caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso had distinct host zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso for zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains that are zzso for zzso tomato plants were shown to lack zzso and zzso or to contain a disrupted zzso zzso Taking zzso and pathological features into account, our data suggest that the zzso strain belongs to zzso zzso zzso zzso This study shows that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tomato appear zzso as they did not diverge from a single common ancestral group within the ancestral zzso zzso zzso 3, and suggests that zzso specificity within zzso zzso may be due to independent genetic zzso
