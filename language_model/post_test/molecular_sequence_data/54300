zzso zzso or zzso is an zzso zzso protein that zzso virus release from infected zzso Whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso counteract human zzso most zzso use zzso to antagonize the zzso proteins of their nonhuman zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso changes in the zzso domain of zzso zzso acquired by a zzso virus that regained a zzso zzso in infected zzso zzso restore resistance to zzso These changes facilitate virus release in the presence of zzso zzso but not human zzso and enhance virus replication in zzso primary zzso The zzso in zzso result in a selective physical association with zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by a mechanism that depends on a zzso zzso motif in zzso These results are consistent with zzso zzso antagonism of human zzso and suggest that the ability to oppose zzso is important for zzso zzso
