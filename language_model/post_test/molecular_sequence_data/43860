The zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of few organisms known to possess both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso clones zzso the precursor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a single zzso rather than as a zzso its deduced transit zzso of 139 zzso acids possesses structural motifs zzso for precursor import across zzso three outer zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal that the zzso zzso of zzso was recruited to the zzso independently from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and may derive from the zzso zzso of the secondary zzso zzso Two distinct zzso of zzso zzso genes are shown to exist in zzso which can be traced to an ancient gene zzso which occurred in the common zzso of contemporary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso genes resulted in functional specialization of the zzso products for zzso other than zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso and zzso are shown to be of zzso origin, having been acquired via zzso gene transfer, probably from the zzso of zzso The data provide evidence for the zzso nature of zzso zzso
