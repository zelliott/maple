zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, by a type III zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and found to be zzso under the same conditions required for zzso zzso Likewise, zzso was zzso by the zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso but zzso was not zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso required their respective zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso expressed a zzso zzso on cultured zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of the infected zzso cells and the amount of zzso zzso correlated with the degree of zzso Both zzso and zzso were prevented by the addition of zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso D prior to infection prevented zzso of bacteria, but zzso of zzso was still zzso These results zzso the hypothesis that zzso is zzso through the plasma membrane by zzso zzso We propose that virulent zzso and zzso deliver zzso zzso molecules into the target cell through the zzso of a functionally zzso zzso machinery similar to that shown for zzso
