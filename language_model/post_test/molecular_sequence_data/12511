The interaction of zzso with zzso has been studied by binding zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex suggest a binding site near the tip of the tail of the zzso zzso The distance from the zzso zzso junction to zzso indicates binding zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso zzso zzso show binding near the end of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso positions along the zzso zzso show binding predominantly in the region located in the A band in zzso which is consistent with the proposal that zzso regulates thick filament zzso Estimates of the apparent zzso constant of the zzso complex were approximately 20 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso fragments also suggested a strong binding site near the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from whole zzso resulted in eight peptides of which only one, zzso 17 zzso bound strongly to zzso Two zzso of this zzso were detected by protein zzso Similar binding data were obtained using synthetic versions of both zzso The zzso is located immediately zzso of the fourth zzso zzso in the zzso tail, which is consistent with the electron zzso zzso may have a role in determining thick filament structure, by allowing abrupt zzso of the zzso tail close to the zzso zzso
