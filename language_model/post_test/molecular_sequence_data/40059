The zzso zzso toxin zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso zzso toxin consisting of a zzso composed of the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso The zzso and zzso zzso form two zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind the zzso to the target zzso Point zzso were used to study zzso structure and zzso One zzso of eight zzso replacement zzso identified yielded a gene product that failed to form biologically active zzso Based on the possibility that the zzso zzso zzso a predicted zzso targeted zzso was used to examine the contribution of each of four zzso zzso in two predicted zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso replacement zzso in two predicted zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were also zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell proliferation zzso showed that changing either zzso or zzso in zzso to zzso abolished the biological activity of zzso zzso However, replacing zzso or zzso in zzso and any of the four zzso in zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in only partial or no loss of zzso zzso Changes in the biological activities of the zzso zzso correlated with altered zzso zzso In contrast to elimination of the B chain of zzso the elimination of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso by genetic replacement of zzso zzso these zzso proteins but not to the extent that zzso is zzso Reduction of the zzso zzso did not affect zzso and the reduced form of zzso zzso exhibited a statistically significant increase in binding to zzso A diminished role for zzso zzso in stabilizing zzso and zzso may have clinical relevance for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene products zzso by this pathogen assemble and bind to target cells in zzso involved sites, which are decidedly reduced environments in the human oral zzso
