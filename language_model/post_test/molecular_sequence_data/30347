We report the identification of a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene of a zzso zzso patient in zzso The zzso is associated with zzso 1 of the zzso gene in this zzso This zzso has previously been found in North Africa, where it is in linkage zzso with zzso zzso While it is conceivable that this zzso could have been transferred from one zzso background to another by a double crossover or gene conversion event, the fact that the zzso is exclusively associated with the two different zzso in the two distinct populations supports the hypothesis that these two zzso zzso are the result of zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso Furthermore, since the site of zzso involves a zzso zzso they may represent hot spots for zzso in the human zzso zzso
