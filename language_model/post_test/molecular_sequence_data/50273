A system is described in which zzso of zzso clones by zzso zzso zzso zzso is coupled to translation in the zzso zzso treated rabbit zzso zzso in a single reaction of coupled zzso The zzso and zzso zzso requirements for translation are dominant for optimum expression in this coupled system, so that zzso is relatively zzso Nevertheless, the use of appropriate DNA zzso leads to the synthesis of sufficient zzso to zzso the protein synthesis capacity of the zzso The zzso and efficiency of expression in this coupled system are high, and the degree of zzso of the zzso DNA is relatively zzso The system therefore offers very considerable advantages for rapid screening of zzso of zzso zzso zzso for retention of the correct reading frame and expression of the desired protein zzso
