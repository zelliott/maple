We have undertaken a comprehensive study of the gene conversion of all the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The approach used involved the zzso of zzso transmission amongst the progeny of crosses between a recipient strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and various donor strains zzso zzso with various combinations of zzso zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso second zzso zzso of zzso b zzso is extremely active as a donor in gene conversion whereas its zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of sequence of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that it differs from that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a very small number of zzso zzso
