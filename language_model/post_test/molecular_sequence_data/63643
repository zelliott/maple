zzso syndrome zzso is a genetically heterogeneous, zzso lethal zzso and the most common form of zzso neural tube zzso zzso To date, several zzso genes have been identified whose protein products affect zzso zzso Here we show that zzso in zzso zzso and zzso (also known as zzso either can cause zzso syndrome zzso or may have a potential zzso effect on zzso in known zzso zzso Five of six families with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso seizures, a feature that is not a typical component of either zzso zzso studies in zzso showed that zzso is necessary for zzso movements and that it interacts genetically with known zzso zzso Similarly, we found two families with zzso or zzso zzso in zzso in one of which the affected individual also bears a zzso nonsense zzso in zzso that is likely to zzso the C zzso of the zzso These data extend the genetic zzso of zzso and suggest that zzso and zzso although distinct zzso are zzso forms of the same molecular zzso
