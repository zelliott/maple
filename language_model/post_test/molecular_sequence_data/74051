This paper describes the production of a zzso protein from the expression system based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production of rat zzso 1 zzso protein was obtained using the zzso Two forms of zzso were zzso into the culture zzso a zzso species corresponding to the native zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso easily and shown to possess the same zzso properties as zzso zzso from calf zzso zzso DNA zzso to the zzso zzso is taken up by a variety of zzso cells in zzso zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene was zzso Under selective conditions, stable expression of a zzso gene was established as a result of integration into the zzso zzso gene delivery was as efficient as calcium zzso zzso but without associated cell zzso In addition, stable zzso obtained after selection for zzso resistance usually integrated only one copy of the zzso DNA in contrast to the high unpredictable number obtained by the calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes were not toxic to cultured cells, even at high zzso
