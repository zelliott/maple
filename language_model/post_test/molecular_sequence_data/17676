By exhaustive structural zzso we have found that about one-third of the zzso zzso in zzso barrel zzso share a common structural zzso The chief characteristics of this motif are that first, the geometry of the turn between the zzso and the zzso is somewhat zzso and second, the zzso contains a zzso patch that fits into a zzso pocket on the zzso The geometry of the turn does not seem to be a major zzso of the zzso unit, because the turns vary in length from four to six zzso However, the motif does not occur when there are few constraints on the geometry of the zzso instance, when the turns between the zzso and the zzso are very zzso It also occurs much less frequently in zzso zzso zzso where the zzso is much less regular and the amount of twist on the sheet varies considerably more than in the barrel zzso The motif may be one of the basic building blocks from which zzso barrels are zzso
