Mouse cells expressing the human zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as human zzso cells are susceptible to zzso type 1 zzso strains and produce a large amount of progeny virus at 37 degrees zzso However, the virus yield is markedly reduced at 40 degrees C in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The reduction in virus yield at 40 degrees C appears to be due to a defective initiation process in zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in this detective process, naturally occurring zzso zzso which show normal growth ability in zzso cells even at 40 degrees C were isolated from a virus stock of the zzso strain and their zzso sites that affect the zzso were zzso The key zzso was a change from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso position zzso 133 within the zzso zzso region of the zzso This zzso also gave an zzso zzso to the viral zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso strains with a single point zzso at zzso 133 (A to G, C, or T or zzso were investigated for their ability to grow in zzso cells at 40 degrees zzso Only the zzso carrying G at zzso 133 showed an zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that a host cellular zzso interacts with an zzso segment around zzso 133 of the zzso zzso or the corresponding region of the zzso zzso contributing to efficiency of zzso zzso zzso
