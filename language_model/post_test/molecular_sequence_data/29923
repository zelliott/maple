When screening a number of zzso type 5 zzso zzso zzso for defects in viral gene zzso we observed that zzso zzso cells accumulated reduced levels of newly zzso viral late zzso zzso and zzso experiments were used to establish that the late proteins zzso in zzso cells under zzso conditions were as stable as those made in zzso zzso zzso cells contained normal levels of viral late zzso Because these observations implied that translation of viral zzso species was defective in zzso zzso cells, the association of viral late zzso with zzso was examined during the late phase of infection at a zzso zzso In zzso cells, the majority of the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso late zzso species were zzso zzso By contrast, these same zzso species were recovered from zzso cells in zzso zzso the top of zzso zzso suggesting that initiation of translation was zzso During the late phase of infection, neither the zzso association nor the translation of most viral early zzso species was affected by the zzso zzso This zzso mapped by marker rescue to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a single base pair substitution that replaces zzso of the zzso zzso protein with zzso A set of zzso zzso of zzso was isolated and zzso Either true zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso protein to zzso zzso or His restored both zzso growth and the efficient synthesis of viral late zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso zzso zzso protein is necessary for efficient initiation of translation of viral late zzso species during the late phase of zzso
