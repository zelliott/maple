zzso a human zzso protein with zzso in other zzso organisms, includes 23 repeats, each of 23 zzso zzso separated by 10 zzso zzso The main molecular partner in the zzso is a small, zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso experiments, we characterized the zzso capacity of three isolated zzso repeats, two exhibiting the general consensus motif and the third being the unique zzso human zzso The two standard peptides bind human zzso 2 and its isolated zzso domain with high affinity zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso with a moderate zzso zzso The zzso repeat shows a binding affinity that is two orders of magnitude zzso The target binding site is localized within the zzso domain of human zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso and zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso zzso situated in the zzso of each repeat is deeply embedded in a protein zzso zzso indicating that the zzso direction is reversed relative to previously studied zzso zzso The present results suggest that almost all of the repeats of the zzso protein may independently bind zzso zzso On the basis of this hypothesis and previous studies on zzso zzso we propose a working model for the role of zzso interactions in the dynamic structure of zzso zzso zzso
