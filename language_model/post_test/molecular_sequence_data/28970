The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A zzso It was compared with the structures of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The main chains of the three zzso zzso proteins zzso closely, and the packing of side chains in the zzso cores, as well as the architecture of surface zzso is very zzso Both zzso proteins have, however, 17 strong salt bridges, compared with only 10 in zzso The number of additional salt bridges in zzso and zzso zzso well with their reduced rate of irreversible zzso zzso at 90 degrees zzso Only 3 of 17 salt bridges in zzso and zzso are zzso zzso The major difference between the two proteins is the preference for zzso salt bridges in zzso and zzso ones in zzso The different zzso of salt bridges in the closely related proteins suggests that the stabilizing effect of salt bridges depends rather on the sum of their individual contributions than on their zzso This observation is consistent with a protein unfolding mechanism where the simultaneous breakdown of all salt bridges is the zzso zzso
