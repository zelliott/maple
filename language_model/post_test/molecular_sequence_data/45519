zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso pumps found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso which share zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso a zzso pump found in zzso zzso In this study, zzso and zzso were zzso into zzso zzso belonging to zzso (a zzso b zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso zzso zzso In both the zzso the zzso unit contains two protein molecules with slightly different zzso Each zzso is composed of seven zzso segments as seen in zzso but, unlike zzso zzso as well as zzso has a unique omega loop near the N zzso It is found that the zzso zzso in the zzso half zzso the zzso release zzso is more opened in zzso than in zzso or zzso This structural difference accounts for a large variation in the zzso of the acid zzso transition among the three zzso zzso All the aromatic zzso surrounding the retinal zzso chain are zzso among the three zzso pumps, confirming a previous argument that these zzso are required for the zzso of the retinal zzso In the zzso half, the region surrounded by zzso B, C and G is highly zzso while the structural conservation is very low for zzso zzso from zzso E and zzso zzso conservation of the zzso zzso located on the zzso zzso zzso suggests that their precise arrangement is necessary to prevent a backward flow of zzso in the presence of a large pH zzso and membrane zzso An empty cavity is commonly seen in the vicinity of zzso zzso the retinal zzso zzso zzso of such a cavity is required to allow a large rotation of the zzso of zzso at the early stage of the zzso which has been shown to accompany water zzso across the Schiff zzso
