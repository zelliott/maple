We have amplified by zzso and zzso the first zzso of the zzso 2 gene from the zzso mouse strain zzso When we compared the zzso first zzso sequence with the one reported zzso we found several zzso These differences are also reflected in the deduced zzso acid sequence and they have been localized in the first 23 zzso acids of the mature zzso The finding of this new zzso sequence shows that there is more than one zzso for the mouse zzso zzso and raises the possibility of functional differences between zzso
