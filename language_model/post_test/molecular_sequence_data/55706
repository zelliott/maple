The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso protein zzso C that is required for normal growth and division of zzso zzso We report here the isolation of the zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso protein zzso zzso genes which, when zzso suppress the cell zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso protein zzso most similar to the zzso product of zzso zzso the zzso product of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso gene alone did not cause any apparent zzso zzso but deletion of both zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso cell zzso zzso that was suppressed by zzso zzso This zzso zzso is similar to that associated with deletion of the zzso zzso which is thought to function in the zzso zzso by zzso The zzso gene also encodes a predicted protein zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the growth zzso caused by deletion of zzso whereas an activated zzso of zzso zzso did not suppress the zzso of the zzso zzso double zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso which encodes a protein zzso closely related to zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of the zzso zzso double zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso function in a signal zzso zzso involving the protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the site of action for zzso and zzso is between zzso and zzso
