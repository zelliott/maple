Andean potato zzso virus zzso is a zzso whose zzso structure consists of two zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso Here we report the zzso sequence analysis of an zzso zzso zzso clone with zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusive of the zzso at the 3' end, covering approximately zzso of the zzso zzso The first initiation zzso in register translates from zzso zzso to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso A second initiation zzso in register, beginning at zzso position zzso translates a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sites used in the processing of zzso were identified in the long open reading frame by zzso zzso of the large coat protein zzso and the small coat protein zzso These zzso zzso sites are zzso for the zzso and zzso for the zzso In a comparison of the deduced zzso zzso zzso sequence with those of four other zzso the coding regions for the putative movement zzso zzso and zzso were found similar in length in all five zzso Multiple alignment of the zzso sequences for each of the three genes from the five zzso revealed different degrees of zzso zzso was always the least zzso of the five zzso showing significant zzso zzso in positions where the other zzso have identical zzso or conservative zzso
