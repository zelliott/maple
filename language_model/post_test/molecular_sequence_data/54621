A widespread feature in the zzso of most bacteria and zzso is an array of zzso regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso that, together with a group of zzso zzso zzso mediate immunity against invasive zzso acids such as plasmids and zzso Here, the zzso system was activated in cells expressing a zzso protein that was targeted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso in a manner that required the zzso zzso regulatory system, which is known to respond to zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirm that the zzso zzso form a stable zzso complex and appear to function as the zzso core of the zzso system to process zzso zzso into its mature zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso system targets DNA directly as part of a zzso mechanism in bacteria that is overlapping with but not limited to zzso zzso
