zzso zzso can zzso zzso functions zzso by mobile elements for their own zzso A particularly interesting kind of acquisition involves the zzso of zzso envelope zzso which zzso infectious zzso ability to zzso So far, these examples have been limited to zzso zzso including primates where the zzso envelope is under zzso selection to assist zzso zzso Here, we show that in zzso zzso a previously zzso gene zzso renamed zzso was zzso from a novel, active zzso lineage of insect zzso at least 25 million years ago, and has since been maintained as a host gene that is expressed in all adult zzso Iris and the envelope genes from zzso zzso are zzso to those found in insect zzso and gypsy and zzso insect zzso Two separate envelope zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso have taken place, in fruit fly and zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso envelopes are zzso zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso Iris appears to lack this zzso zzso In the zzso species groups of zzso we find that Iris has zzso duplicated to give rise to two genes zzso and zzso zzso has significantly zzso from the zzso zzso primarily because of the zzso of an zzso de zzso in what was previously zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso envelope genes in zzso we find that Iris has been subject to strong positive selection between zzso zzso The zzso zzso evolution of Iris is sufficient to zzso distinguish the zzso of three closely related sibling species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso power previously described only for a putative zzso zzso Iris represents the first instance of a zzso zzso host gene outside zzso It is also the first example of a zzso envelope gene that has been found to be subject to positive selection following its zzso The unusual selective pressures acting on Iris suggest that it is an active participant in an ongoing genetic zzso We propose a model in which Iris has zzso zzso having been recruited by host zzso to combat zzso and zzso which employ zzso envelope genes to mediate zzso
