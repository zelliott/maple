zzso zzso are widespread in the environment and play a crucial role in the evolution of their bacterial hosts and the emergence of new zzso 

zzso a reference zzso strain, was classified as a member of the zzso family with a zzso form zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and short tail zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso The double stranded DNA was about 30 zzso pairs in zzso We identified its host range and determined the zzso sequences and protein structure using shotgun analysis and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso possesses a zzso protein with zzso activity which is probably responsible for its specific zzso zzso host range within the zzso
