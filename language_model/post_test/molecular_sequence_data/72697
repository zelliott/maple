The products of zzso are involved in normal in zzso Ni zzso into the carbon monoxide zzso zzso of zzso zzso Located on a zzso DNA segment immediately downstream of the zzso structural gene zzso two of the genes zzso proteins that bear motifs reminiscent of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso motif near the N zzso of zzso and a run of 15 zzso zzso regularly spaced over the last 30 zzso acids of the C zzso of zzso A zzso cassette was developed to create both polar and zzso zzso zzso insertions in the zzso region, and these, along with several zzso were introduced into zzso zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso Ni levels required to sustain zzso growth of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated different zzso whereas the zzso strain and a zzso bearing a partial zzso deletion (of the region zzso the zzso zzso grew at zzso zzso Ni zzso strains bearing zzso zzso in zzso and zzso required approximately zzso Ni levels and all zzso zzso zzso bearing polar or zzso zzso grew zzso at 550 zzso zzso
