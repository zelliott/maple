A new general method for sequencing zzso zzso DNA by chemical degradation has been zzso It is based on the observation that zzso attached via a zzso or zzso zzso arm to the zzso of an zzso is stable during the reactions commonly used in chemical zzso zzso DNA to be zzso is first zzso zzso in zzso by zzso and extending a zzso zzso primer thereby introducing the fluorescent label at the zzso of the zzso The newly zzso zzso zzso DNA is then chemically zzso zzso zzso a set of four different zzso zzso or zzso only one reaction zzso zzso of zzso followed by a partial zzso with zzso in the presence of sodium zzso The fluorescent degradation products are loaded on either four lanes or one lane of the zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso detected online during zzso In the zzso zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso can be read from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso method, in which the zzso sequence is determined by measuring different signal zzso following the rule G greater than A greater than C greater than zzso currently yields around zzso zzso of sequence per zzso
