Since there is no consensus sequence directing the initial zzso incorporation into zzso zzso zzso sites are not reliably zzso We have developed a mass zzso sequencing strategy that allows the identification of in zzso zzso sites on zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from human milk and partially zzso by zzso acid to the level of core zzso zzso The product was fragmented by the zzso zzso zzso to yield tandem repeat zzso starting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to sequencing by zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso or by solid phase zzso degradation to zzso the zzso zzso The masses of zzso or zzso fragments registered for the zzso to zzso zzso indicated that zzso was linked to the zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso but contrary to previous in zzso zzso studies also at zzso and zzso located within the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso data from solid phase zzso sequencing revealed no preferential zzso of the zzso These discrepancies between in zzso and in zzso zzso patterns may be explained by assuming that zzso of adjacent zzso positions is a zzso regulated process that depends on changes of the zzso qualities induced by zzso at zzso zzso
