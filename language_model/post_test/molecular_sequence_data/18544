zzso zzso is the main zzso in the western Mediterranean area of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of canine and human visceral zzso zzso dogs serve as a zzso of the disease, and therefore measuring the exposure of dogs to sand fly bites is important for zzso the risk of zzso zzso zzso In bitten zzso sand fly saliva elicits a specific zzso response that reflects the intensity of sand fly zzso As screening of specific zzso zzso is limited by the availability of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins is a promising zzso In this manuscript we show for the first time the use of zzso zzso proteins as a functional tool for detecting zzso zzso bites in zzso 

The zzso of six zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso were tested with zzso of mice and dogs zzso bitten by this sand fly using zzso and zzso In the zzso both mice and canine zzso gave positive reactions with zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso A similar reaction for zzso zzso proteins was observed by zzso with the zzso of zzso protein and zzso significantly correlated with the zzso response of mice and dogs against the whole zzso zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the best candidates for evaluating the exposure of mice and dogs to zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso or their zzso would be beneficial for screening canine zzso in endemic areas of visceral zzso for zzso exposure and for zzso the risk of zzso zzso transmission in zzso
