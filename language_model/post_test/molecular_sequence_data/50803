Recent studies on the highly potent and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso suggested that key structural features necessary for specific zzso to the zzso zzso are located within the zzso halves of these naturally occurring zzso To investigate the contribution of zzso acid 4 zzso in zzso I and zzso acid 7 zzso in zzso to the zzso ability of the zzso ends, zzso zzso were zzso and assessed for their ability to bind to zzso and zzso receptors in rat brain membrane zzso zzso showed that zzso although the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso I differ in zzso acid zzso they play a similar role in specifying correct addressing of these peptides to the zzso zzso the zzso charged side chain of zzso acid 4 zzso in zzso I and zzso acid 7 zzso in zzso is not involved in binding contact at the zzso site, nor in maintaining a zzso folding of the zzso zzso these side chains are, in contrast, functionally or structurally required to zzso high zzso by preventing zzso recognition and/or zzso
