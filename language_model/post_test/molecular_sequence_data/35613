To characterize a zzso resistance zzso zzso closely related to the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso strain previously isolated from a zzso zzso 

zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso was shotgun cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso testing and a zzso zzso zzso were used to confirm the function of the target zzso zzso of the gene was examined using filter zzso and confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso quantitative zzso was performed on soil zzso DNA to evaluate the prevalence of the gene in the soil from which zzso zzso zzso was isolated and in more pristine local zzso 

The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was identified as a zzso zzso pump sharing zzso zzso acid identity with certain zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was adjacent to truncated and zzso zzso resistance genes with high sequence similarities to genes from zzso zzso After filter zzso the zzso gene could be found in zzso coli zzso although the transfer mechanism was zzso zzso zzso are also present in the zzso of several zzso zzso strains and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso soil, and persisted at a similar level 2 years after removal of the chicken waste, although it was not detected in several more pristine zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso pump closely related to zzso zzso gene transfer may have contributed to the dissemination and persistence of zzso in a zzso zzso
