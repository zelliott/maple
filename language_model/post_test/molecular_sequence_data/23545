The zzso zzso gene from zzso tuberculosis zzso a new member of the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso with one zzso of tightly but zzso bound zzso and zzso per zzso Although zzso as a probable zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cannot catalyze reduction of zzso zzso because it lacks one of two zzso zzso involved in zzso interchange with zzso zzso and a zzso pair involved in general acid zzso The crystal structure of zzso was solved by multiple zzso replacement with anomalous zzso which confirmed the absence of these zzso zzso from the active zzso Although zzso cannot catalyze reduction of zzso zzso it zzso the zzso reduction of alternative electron zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso primary zzso kinetic isotope effects were observed with zzso establishing that the zzso promotes transfer of the zzso hydride of zzso The absence of an isotope effect with zzso the low zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso and the potent zzso of the zzso reduction of zzso by zzso zzso approximately 6 zzso and zzso zzso approximately 800 zzso demonstrate the high affinity of zzso for zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso pair is zzso rather than zzso Modeling of zzso in the active site revealed that zzso achieves the high specificity for zzso through interactions involving the zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso that are different from those in zzso zzso
