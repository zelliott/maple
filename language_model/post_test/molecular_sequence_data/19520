The large zzso zzso zzso better known for its zzso role in zzso cartilage where it serves to facilitate resistance of zzso forces during joint zzso is also present within the distinct functional regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies demonstrate that an increased turnover of zzso occurs in tendon, which is zzso principally by the zzso and, as such, these zzso may play an important role in the normal functioning of the zzso In the present study, zzso bovine zzso zzso culture systems, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso turnover may be modulated by generic zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, no zzso zzso zzso were detected in the culture system, suggesting that zzso zzso may be inhibited by zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso are present in the zzso surrounding the collagen zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may provide functions of water zzso and resistance of zzso and repeated zzso loads manifest between the collagen zzso these functions, in turn, may be associated with increased zzso turnover in this zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso and consequently zzso turnover in this zzso may be related to some of the deleterious effects observed in the zzso of patients undergoing drug therapy with zzso zzso zzso for cancer and zzso
