zzso is a plasma protein exclusively zzso from fat zzso Many recent pharmacological studies suggest that zzso zzso has multiple therapeutic zzso for zzso zzso disorders, including type 2 diabetes, zzso insulin resistance and zzso However, the zzso relevance of these findings remains to be further zzso In the present study, we have zzso zzso zzso from fetal bovine serum and characterized its zzso modifications and zzso functions in animal zzso zzso bovine serum zzso consists predominantly of full-length proteins that form multiple zzso complexes, including zzso zzso and higher molecular zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that bovine serum zzso exists as multiple zzso modified zzso with distinct molecular weight and zzso zzso Further analysis using mass zzso and zzso degradation sequencing demonstrated that five zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, 60, 63, 72 and zzso within the zzso domain of bovine zzso are zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso bovine zzso into zzso mice zzso decreased circulating zzso levels and enhanced zzso clearance after a high fat zzso zzso administration of this protein for a period of two weeks significantly increased insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso and depleted zzso zzso zzso in high-fat fed zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso bovine zzso is a zzso hormone that can regulate zzso and zzso zzso
