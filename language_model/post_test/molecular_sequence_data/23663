A zzso rapidly growing zzso strain was isolated in pure culture from the zzso and the zzso fluid of a patient with zzso pneumonia by using zzso media and an zzso zzso zzso Both zzso grew in less than 7 days at 24 to 37 degrees C with an optimal growth temperature of 30 degrees zzso The zzso exhibited zzso and zzso zzso profiles overlapping those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that they belonged to zzso zzso zzso zzso They differed from zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso activities and by the lack of nitrate zzso and zzso production activities, as well as in their in zzso zzso to zzso and zzso These zzso and zzso zzso differed from zzso zzso and zzso zzso by exhibiting zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their zzso zzso genes had complete sequence identity with that of zzso zzso and zzso similarity with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further molecular investigations showed that partial zzso and zzso gene sequences differed from that of zzso zzso by five and three positions over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence analyses showed 96 and zzso similarities with zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso sequence of the zzso differed from that of zzso zzso by a zzso substitution at position 60 and a C zzso at position zzso zzso and zzso features of these two zzso indicated that they were representative of a new zzso species within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that these zzso were perhaps recently derived from zzso zzso We propose the name of zzso zzso for this new zzso The type strain has been deposited in the Collection Institut zzso as zzso zzso and in Culture Collection of the University of zzso zzso Sweden, as zzso zzso
