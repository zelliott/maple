The zzso zzso exists as two zzso zzso localized predominantly in the nucleus, and zzso localized in the zzso Previously we generated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tag placed after the first zzso and zzso zzso tag placed after the second zzso zzso zzso zzso Stephen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Schwartz, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which represent the native zzso zzso is exclusively zzso whereas zzso is found predominantly in the zzso Using high resolution zzso focusing and zzso gel zzso we confirm that these zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso exists as one zzso and four zzso forms, and zzso exists as one zzso zzso form and two minor zzso zzso We demonstrate that the first 11 zzso acids are essential for zzso and exclusive nuclear zzso of zzso Within this region are four zzso zzso and a putative nuclear zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso of these four zzso zzso reduced zzso levels by zzso but had no effect on nuclear zzso of zzso Each zzso zzso was independently zzso to an zzso and analyzed by two-dimensional zzso only zzso 4 was zzso zzso of the basic zzso acids within the zzso resulted in loss of exclusive nuclear zzso and a zzso decrease in the zzso of zzso This putative zzso was able to zzso nuclear import on a zzso protein in zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Thus the zzso requirement for efficient zzso of zzso is a functional zzso suggesting that zzso may be zzso within the zzso
