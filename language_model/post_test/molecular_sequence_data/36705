A procedure is described for the detection of zzso C virus zzso zzso in blood by means of the zzso chain reaction zzso in which the reverse zzso step and two rounds of amplification are carried out in a single zzso This results in fewer zzso reduced risk of contamination, and economy of zzso The procedures are generally zzso to other zzso based on the zzso We describe the preparation (from 100 zzso zzso of test samples that remain stable for at least 6 days under specified conditions and an zzso that employs zzso primer pairs zzso to zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso The method was tested on 107 zzso from the United States and zzso zzso with first-generation zzso was zzso Two sets of zzso primer pairs zzso to sequences in the zzso zzso region and one set based on structural region sequences showed differences in their zzso with serum zzso zzso The recommended single tube procedure specified a primer for reverse zzso that was zzso in all reported zzso zzso but absent from zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso factors on the detection of zzso zzso were zzso zzso there was no change in the zzso zzso of zzso that were exposed to room temperature for 24 zzso zzso studies showed a decrease in zzso in some zzso Three cycles of zzso had no zzso effects on the zzso of zzso zzso
