We have analyzed the zzso of a recently isolated human zzso K zzso gene in zzso and in zzso In contrast to zzso characterized class III genes zzso transcribed by zzso zzso zzso the coding sequence of this gene is not required for faithful and efficient zzso by zzso zzso zzso In fact, a zzso zzso DNA sequence was efficiently transcribed by zzso zzso III under the control of the zzso K zzso gene upstream sequence in zzso and in zzso zzso protection analyses confirmed that the zzso K zzso sequence was sufficient for accurate zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso K DNA represents a novel class III zzso the promoter elements of which are located outside the coding zzso
