A zzso clone zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to the highly zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso However, northern analysis suggests that the zzso is about zzso to zzso zzso Analysis by zzso indicated that the zzso to zzso zzso sequence missing in the zzso maps to the 3' end, suggesting that the zzso is terminated within the 26 zzso zzso that are in the middle of the zzso zzso The most unique feature about this zzso is the presence of two open reading frames zzso one from zzso 91 to zzso and the other starting from zzso The second zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso clones in zzso coli and translation in rabbit zzso of zzso transcribed from the zzso promoter of the zzso clones revealed that only the 3' end zzso is translated from this zzso Further experiments with zzso zzso specific for zzso indicated that the zzso protein serves an important function in the life cycle of the zzso
