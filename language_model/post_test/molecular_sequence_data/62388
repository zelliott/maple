zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso require zzso information exchange between T cells and zzso cells zzso Because zzso continually enter and leave normal zzso the resident zzso pool is composed of zzso cells with different dwell times that display zzso zzso in mouse zzso in zzso Here we employ zzso zzso in zzso to study zzso zzso and zzso T cells whose dwell time in zzso was zzso During the first 8 h after entering from the blood, T cells underwent multiple short encounters with zzso progressively decreased their zzso and zzso zzso zzso During the subsequent 12 h T cells formed long-lasting stable zzso with zzso and began to zzso zzso and zzso On the second day, coinciding with the onset of zzso T cells resumed their rapid migration and short DC zzso Thus, zzso zzso by zzso occurs in three successive zzso transient serial encounters during the first zzso phase are followed by a second phase of stable contacts culminating in zzso production, which makes a transition into a third phase of high zzso and rapid zzso
