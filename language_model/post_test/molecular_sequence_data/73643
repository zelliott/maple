Large regions of zzso zzso have been demonstrated among grass species by zzso zzso but the degree of zzso conservation at the zzso level has not been extensively zzso We cloned the rice and zzso genes zzso to the zzso locus of zzso on bacterial artificial zzso zzso and observed that a zzso of the zzso zzso gene was also present on each of these zzso In zzso we found a direct zzso of zzso zzso separated by about 10 zzso In zzso zzso and zzso are approximately 140 zzso apart and transcribed in the same direction, with zzso upstream of zzso In rice and zzso this arrangement is fully zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso are separated by about 19 zzso in both rice and zzso We found zzso and repetitive zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso but the repetitive DNA and most zzso sequences between these genes did zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and rice have zzso gene order and composition in the zzso region, but have acquired extensive qualitative and quantitative differences in the sequences between these zzso
