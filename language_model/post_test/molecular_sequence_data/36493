We have identified and cloned a novel member of the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso was isolated from a mouse brain zzso library and encodes a protein zzso zzso acids in length with a predicted zzso zzso of 66 zzso The zzso acid sequence of the protein is closely related to an additional family member and immediate early gene product, zzso and the novel factor is referred to as zzso zzso factor zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso suggests that these proteins constitute an additional zzso within the nuclear zzso zzso Like zzso the expression of zzso is induced by membrane zzso of zzso zzso However, while zzso shows an early zzso response to nerve growth factor zzso the failure of zzso to respond to this agent suggests a differential selectivity of the two proteins in terms of their zzso responses to specific zzso Finally, both proteins are zzso expressed during development and in zzso of the adult zzso Unlike zzso zzso appears to be predominantly located in brain zzso suggesting a primary role for this putative zzso factor in regulation of gene expression in the central nervous zzso
