We detected several types of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso with an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso genes in eight of zzso zzso patients who possessed drug-resistant viruses under highly active zzso therapy zzso It was characteristic that a zzso zzso motif zzso in the zzso of zzso protein was completely or partially duplicated in all zzso Five among the eight cases were zzso investigated in terms of the occurrence of dynamic change in the gag gene between the inserted and zzso zzso in the course of zzso The zzso analysis revealed the zzso 1) The zzso viruses were selected over the zzso during zzso in three cases in which the both types zzso in the beginning of the zzso 2) In two cases in which the zzso zzso alone was detected before the beginning of zzso the zzso zzso alone was continuously detected during the zzso The zzso zzso was also detected in four of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the frequency of zzso zzso detection in the zzso patients is significantly higher than that in the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that this type of zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso however, it consequently gave an advantage on proliferation and/or survival of the zzso zzso under the presence of zzso zzso
