We present the structure of the human Aurora B zzso domain in complex with the zzso zzso region of human zzso and the Aurora zzso inhibitor zzso The structure unexpectedly reveals a zzso arrangement of the Aurora zzso complex, which was confirmed to exist in solution by zzso zzso The zzso involves a domain swap of the zzso loop, resulting in a different zzso of the zzso motif as compared to that seen in other zzso complexes with zzso The binding of zzso differs significantly from that seen in the zzso zzso Aurora zzso complex currently used as a model for zzso design for this important zzso zzso
