We have expressed a zzso mouse zzso alpha zzso alpha 2) in zzso coli under the control of a zzso promoter using a synthetic zzso formed by zzso two partially complementary zzso which introduced an zzso start zzso and zzso the complete coding sequence of the mature zzso alpha 2 protein in the expression zzso zzso of up to zzso reference units of zzso alpha 2 per liter of culture were obtained using this zzso This zzso mouse zzso alpha 2 exhibited zzso activity in mice infected with zzso virus and zzso activity in mice zzso with zzso leukemia cells in a manner similar to that of natural mouse zzso zzso
