zzso channels conduct transient outward zzso currents in the human heart and brain where they mediate the early phase of action potential zzso zzso proteins are members of a new class of calcium sensors that zzso the surface expression and zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso Here we describe three novel zzso of zzso with an alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the human atrium, whereas zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso The zzso zzso were zzso with zzso channels in zzso zzso and currents recorded with zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a reduction in current zzso an acceleration of zzso and a slowing of the recovery from zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased the current zzso and slowed the rate of zzso but did not alter the recovery from zzso or the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased current zzso slowed the rate of zzso and shifted the zzso of zzso zzso to more negative zzso The zzso changes induced by these alternatively spliced zzso proteins differ markedly from previously described zzso proteins and would be expected to increase the diversity of native transient outward zzso zzso
