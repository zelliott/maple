zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that causes zzso in the domestic zzso zzso with this zzso is diagnosed frequently in zzso reared poultry and its control is usually zzso a high priority, especially in chickens raised for zzso zzso chemotherapy has been the primary method used for the control of zzso However, drug efficacy can be compromised by drug-resistant zzso and the lack of new drugs highlights demands for alternative control strategies including zzso In the long term, sustainable control of zzso will most likely be achieved through integrated drug and vaccination zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso may provide a better understanding of the biology of the zzso and aid in the development of a more effective control for zzso 

More than 15,000 partial sequences were generated from the zzso and 3' ends of clones randomly selected from an zzso zzso second generation zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso of these sequences produced zzso unique transcripts zzso Based on the transcript assembly and subsequently primer walking, 433 full-length zzso sequences were successfully zzso These sequences varied in zzso ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso with an average size of zzso zzso zzso sequence repeat zzso analysis identified zzso as the most abundant zzso zzso while zzso usage analysis revealed that the ten most infrequently used zzso in zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso complete coding sequences identified 25 putative zzso and 60 putative surface zzso all of which are now rational candidates for development as zzso vaccines or drug targets in the effort to control avian zzso 

This paper describes the generation and zzso of full-length zzso sequences from zzso zzso second generation zzso and provides new insights into the zzso zzso zzso The data generated will be useful for the development and validation of diagnostic and control strategies for zzso and will be of value in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
