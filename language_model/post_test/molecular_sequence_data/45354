zzso bacteria almost exclusively zzso members of the families zzso zzso and zzso but are found on a single zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on their zzso their zzso ability and strain competition experiments, bacterial strains isolated from zzso were thought to constitute a separate lineage that would account for their exceptional host zzso This hypothesis was investigated by focusing on four zzso that are representative of the zzso and cultural types of zzso zzso Their evolutionary relationships with other zzso were zzso using zzso zzso gene sequences and their zzso properties were explored using the zzso gene as a proxy for zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences revealed that bacterial zzso from zzso species are embedded among other zzso They did not cluster together in zzso based on the zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso but were scattered among other zzso belonging to either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the ability of some zzso to zzso species of the zzso zzso does not represent a historical relationship that predates the relationship between zzso and zzso but is probably a more recent host switch for some zzso
