The chemical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso toward DNA in zzso have been compared with those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using the standard zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso of the two sets of zzso zzso showed similar zzso of reaction with DNA, but the zzso was zzso times more zzso toward DNA than the corresponding zzso zzso and was the most zzso of the eight zzso zzso zzso When the reactions of the zzso with DNA were analyzed by the zzso zzso method of zzso the observed zzso levels were between 3 and 10 times lower than were obtained using the standard method of zzso By analyzing by TLC and zzso the zzso products of the reactions of the zzso zzso with synthetic zzso the relative reactions of the zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso bases in DNA were zzso All four zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso in similar proportions to those seen for the zzso zzso Thus, the presence of an additional zzso ring on the zzso structure, distant from the zzso region, does not radically alter the zzso or base selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso except in the case of the zzso of zzso The reasons for the lower zzso of this zzso compared with that of the corresponding zzso of zzso are zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
