Previous studies have shown that zzso B zzso editing, zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso and F zzso zzso proteins interact with a zzso binding site located at the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the role of 12 positively charged zzso acids of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso were constructed that expressed each of these zzso acid zzso These viruses were examined for replication in the presence of zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso incorporation of the different A3 proteins into zzso and replication in zzso zzso zzso Similar to other studies, we found that zzso was essential for zzso activity and zzso but was not important for restriction of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso Our results identified the zzso at position 14 of the zzso zzso as a critical zzso for virus restriction by zzso zzso and zzso
