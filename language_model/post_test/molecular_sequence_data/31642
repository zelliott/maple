zzso Z zzso is a ubiquitous zzso that removes the zzso from precursor zzso during zzso In zzso and animals, zzso regulates the cell cycle via its zzso processing zzso however, its zzso function in higher plants has not been well zzso This study describes the identification of a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso plants zzso for the zzso zzso were zzso with deficient zzso zzso A microscopic analysis of the zzso plants revealed that the transition of zzso to zzso was arrested at an early stage, and the number and size of the zzso in callus cells was substantially zzso A genetic zzso test and an zzso interference analysis confirmed that disruption of zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all rice zzso but is zzso expressed in leaves, zzso and zzso zzso was zzso localized in zzso and displayed zzso zzso processing activity in both in zzso and in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was severely reduced and moderately increased, zzso These results suggest that the zzso 3' processing activity of zzso contributes to zzso zzso
