Making use of mice deficient for terminal zzso zzso zzso expression and a random zzso library, we have examined the diversity and zzso specificity of the zzso T cell repertoire specific for a single zzso zzso zzso with the predicted decrease in repertoire diversity, zzso zzso lines and individual clones from different zzso mice are more similar to each other than those from different zzso mice in terms of their fingerprints of zzso to the library and their zzso zzso We have also found that several zzso zzso clones zzso with many more library peptides than zzso zzso zzso In a few instances, the degree of zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence characteristics such as N region addition and zzso zzso but not zzso loop zzso Based on zzso zzso for each zzso zzso affinity for zzso is consistently high; thus, this reduced specificity for zzso may coincide with an zzso affinity for the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso may allow the relatively small numbers of T cells in the periphery to protect against a broader range of zzso
