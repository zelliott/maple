During zzso infections, the zzso zzso accumulates harmlessly in the membrane zzso at an zzso time, suddenly triggering to form irregular holes of unprecedented size zzso zzso releasing the zzso from the zzso resulting in zzso within zzso Here we used a functional zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso to show that the zzso fusion accumulated in a zzso distributed fashion, until suddenly, within 1 zzso it formed zzso or zzso at the time of lethal zzso Moreover, the zzso fusion to a zzso zzso zzso remained zzso distributed, whereas a fusion to an zzso zzso showed early triggering and early raft zzso zzso zzso rates of the zzso early, and zzso zzso were zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso hybrids were highly mobile in the zzso whereas the zzso raft was essentially zzso Finally, an zzso zzso zzso in the product of which the zzso sequence deleted for the first zzso domain was fused to zzso This hybrid retained full zzso activity, in that it blocked lethal hole formation by the zzso fusion, accumulated zzso throughout the host membrane and prevented the zzso protein from forming zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso occurs when the zzso reaches a critical concentration and zzso to form zzso analogous to the initiation of purple membrane formation after the induction of zzso in zzso This model for zzso function may be relevant for processes in zzso cells, including the release of zzso viruses and zzso
