zzso is zzso by the zzso as well as the zzso zzso with zzso playing a role in both degradation zzso So far, no zzso protein zzso has been identified for any of the zzso By using pull-down zzso here we show binding of a zzso protein zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso This observation was confirmed in zzso by zzso and zzso showing zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to its interaction partners is generally carried out by its WW zzso Our results indicate that the interaction with zzso occurs through all three WW zzso of zzso Furthermore, whereas zzso and zzso zzso mainly interact with the zzso form of zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso forms zzso In addition, using the surface zzso resonance approach we show that only the zzso domain binds to the zzso motif located at the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso expression with zzso resulted in an zzso of gap junction plaques at the plasma zzso suggesting an involvement of the zzso protein zzso zzso in gap junction zzso
