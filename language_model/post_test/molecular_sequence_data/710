We investigated the ability of the most common zzso and delta chains to express on the cell zzso zzso and zzso chains paired with all zzso chains tested, whereas zzso chains were found with zzso and zzso but not with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso chains were expressed only with zzso zzso studies showed that up to four zzso zzso influence the different zzso of zzso and zzso chains with zzso zzso zzso these zzso are not located in the zzso zzso zzso but in the outer part of the zzso zzso complex exposed to the zzso zzso of functional zzso or zzso chains in zzso cells or of functional zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso expression of the zzso zzso Taken together, these data show that zzso the zzso repertoire of mouse zzso T cells is reduced by physical constraints in their zzso zzso Lack of zzso expression is due to the formation of zzso zzso complexes, rather than to an intrinsic inability of the chains to pair and zzso despite not being expressed at the cell surface, the presence of a functionally rearranged zzso chain in zzso T cells results in reduced zzso zzso
