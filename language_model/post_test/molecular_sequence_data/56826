In acute zzso zzso zzso minimal residual disease zzso can be defined as disease occurring at a zzso level and beyond detection by conventional methods of zzso Application of the zzso chain reaction zzso to the zzso segment of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso allows detection of zzso at a level of one zzso cell in zzso normal zzso zzso We have performed a retrospective study using this technique in the assessment of children with precursor zzso ALL in whom the clinical outcome is zzso In the early treatment period zzso is commonly detected in children who remain in complete zzso on subsequent follow zzso Thus, the detection of zzso at this time may have little value in the prediction of future zzso However, at the end of treatment, children who remain in complete zzso have no evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso at this time would seem to predict for future zzso though this can be a delayed zzso zzso in two children who suffered a bone zzso zzso zzso and 9 years after completing therapy for their initial disease, zzso was zzso in their end of initial treatment zzso zzso Clearly zzso technology is changing the definition of the zzso state in childhood zzso and may have zzso value in the assessment of children who are at a high risk of future zzso Large prospective studies of molecular monitoring are now required to confirm these preliminary zzso
