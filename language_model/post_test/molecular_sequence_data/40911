The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are central regulators of zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression of each is sufficient to trigger zzso and hid and zzso have been shown to be important for programmed cell death zzso To investigate the role for grim in zzso a grim zzso zzso was zzso grim was not a key zzso gene for embryonic zzso confirming that grim zzso with zzso and hid in zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso cells in the zzso lineage required zzso identifying a death process dependent upon zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and has been shown to activate a zzso death zzso distinct from zzso zzso therefore, the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were investigated for genetic interaction with zzso Loss of zzso led to zzso zzso cell survival and suppressed death in the eye induced by zzso zzso This is the first example of a zzso zzso process influenced by zzso and places zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells represents an exceptional opportunity to study the zzso zzso process induced by zzso
