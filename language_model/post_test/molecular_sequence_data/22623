The number and location of bacterial zzso vary with the zzso The zzso zzso cell has a single polar zzso which is driven by sodium zzso We selected zzso on the basis of reduced swarming ability on soft zzso zzso Among them, we found two zzso with multiple polar zzso and named them zzso and zzso In zzso species, it is known that zzso and zzso which are zzso and zzso zzso respectively, are involved in regulation of zzso placement and number, zzso We cloned zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells had a nonsense zzso in zzso cells expressing transgenic zzso recovered the swarming ability and had a reduced number of polar zzso zzso cells did not have a zzso in either zzso or zzso In zzso cells, expression of zzso increased the number of polar zzso in contrast, expression of zzso reduced both the number of polar zzso and the swarming zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates the number of polar zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells expressing both zzso and zzso exhibited fewer polar zzso and better swarming ability than zzso cells expressing zzso alone, suggesting that zzso acts with zzso
