We describe the zzso and molecular characterization of zzso zzso an essential gene in zzso zzso Two zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso result in late zzso or zzso zzso zzso examination of actively dividing zzso in these zzso reveals defects in zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso show defects in zzso migration and separation during zzso of both zzso zzso We have cloned the gene affected by these zzso and shown that it codes for a zzso protein in the zzso family of small zzso severing zzso A zzso for this gene has previously been described by Edwards et zzso zzso Northern analysis shows that the zzso gene is expressed throughout development, and that the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso that accumulate decreased levels of zzso zzso These findings prompted us to examine zzso behavior during male zzso to zzso the effects of decreased zzso protein activity on zzso dynamics in zzso zzso both zzso exhibit abnormal zzso of zzso Large zzso zzso are seen in association with zzso in mature primary zzso Later, during zzso of both zzso zzso zzso large and zzso structures appear at the site of zzso ring formation and fail to zzso at the end of zzso in contrast with zzso We discuss these results in terms of possible roles of the zzso zzso in zzso movement and in zzso
