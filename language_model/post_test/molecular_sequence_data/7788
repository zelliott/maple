zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has six repeats of a domain containing the zzso zzso In addition, the protein has an zzso leader sequence which serves as a signal for transfer of the protein into the zzso of the zzso and a zzso sequence at its zzso zzso which functions as a signal to retain the protein in the zzso In this paper, we describe the zzso structure of this unique zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of mouse zzso DNA revealed that there is a single copy of the zzso gene per zzso zzso The gene spans over 13 zzso pairs and encodes six separate zzso Thus, zzso differs from the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which also has six zzso motif zzso but the gene for which is divided into 11 zzso While there is some correlation between zzso division and protein domain structure, these relationships are not as clear as they are in other zzso zzso of the gene organization of zzso with that of other zzso proteins revealed that zzso zzso very early from other members of the zzso protein zzso
