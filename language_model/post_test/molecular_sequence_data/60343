zzso are a family of proteins that zzso long-term extension of isolated plant cell walls due to an as yet unknown zzso zzso They are divided into two groups, the zzso and zzso the latter group consisting of grass group I zzso and their zzso zzso These grass group I zzso to which more than zzso of patients allergic to grass zzso possess zzso zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso exclusively expressed in zzso of all zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of grass group I zzso derived from diverse grass species reveal up to zzso zzso It is therefore likely that these molecules share a similar biological zzso The major grass group I zzso from zzso grass zzso zzso zzso p 1, was chosen as a model zzso and expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to obtain a zzso modified and functionally active zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity when zzso with various test systems and zzso which was also subsequently demonstrated with the natural zzso zzso p zzso These observations are confirmed by zzso alignments of zzso p 1 with three functionally important sequence motifs surrounding the zzso zzso acids of the C1 zzso family of zzso zzso Moreover, the significantly zzso zzso mostly share the functionally important C1 sequence zzso This leads us to propose a C1 zzso zzso function for grass group I zzso which may mediate plant cell wall growth and possibly contributes to the zzso of the zzso
