zzso populations of zzso consisting of normal zzso and zzso with large zzso are found in the skeletal muscle and other zzso of certain patients with zzso respiratory chain deficiencies, particularly in those with the zzso zzso progressive external zzso zzso To study the zzso zzso of this zzso disorder, the distribution of the deleted zzso in a wide range of zzso of different embryonic origins zzso 34 samples from 27 zzso obtained at zzso was investigated in a patient with the zzso zzso Three species of partially deleted zzso were observed, with deletions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their tissue distribution suggests that the zzso deletions have occurred very early during embryonic development, prior to the differentiation events that lead to the formation of the three primary embryonic germ zzso and that the partially deleted zzso species were zzso during development mainly to the skeletal muscle and to zzso of the central nervous zzso
