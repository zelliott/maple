zzso zzso zzso zzso repeated zzso zzso zzso consist of a zzso untranslated region zzso with regulatory properties, two protein zzso regions zzso I, zzso II, which encodes a reverse zzso and a 3' zzso zzso elements have been evolving in zzso for zzso 100 million years and this process continues to generate novel zzso zzso in modern zzso Here we characterized the youngest known zzso in zzso zzso zzso and unexpectedly found that this element has a dual zzso While its 3' zzso shares the same lineage as its nearest zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso I sequence does zzso The zzso zzso I was derived from an ancestral zzso I sequence that was the evolutionary precursor of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We suggest that an ancestral zzso I sequence was recruited into the modern zzso zzso by zzso that possibly could have resulted from template strand switching by the reverse zzso during zzso zzso This mechanism could also account for some of the structural features of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I sequences including one of the more dramatic features of zzso evolution in zzso namely the repeated acquisition of novel zzso zzso
