Several zzso proteins have been identified and characterized in pursuit of understanding zzso and protection in zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso from infected zzso mice to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library and obtained the full-length gene that encodes a novel zzso zzso protein designated zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso family of proteins mediates zzso interactions and coordinates the formation of protein zzso The zzso zzso gene is transcribed as a approximately zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso with zzso being detected in several other zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from human patients with zzso and zzso zzso indicated that these individuals mounted significant zzso responses against zzso Given that zzso zzso protein zzso the production of high levels of gamma zzso but no zzso levels of zzso zzso in zzso cells of zzso zzso mice, we further examined whether zzso could elicit protective zzso DNA vaccination with the zzso and zzso genes significantly delayed zzso development, which correlated with a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso Thus, we have successfully identified a promising vaccine candidate and zzso vehicle to aid in the dissection of the complicated zzso immune response of zzso zzso
