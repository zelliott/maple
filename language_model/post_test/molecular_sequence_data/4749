zzso zzso zzso gene deletion is frequent in primary tumor cells from acute zzso leukemia zzso suggesting that loss of zzso may be an important precursor to transformation in zzso We have previously described zzso a human ALL cell line, that contains zzso deletion of the zzso zzso Because zzso expression of zzso suppresses cell growth, we created a temperature sensitive zzso zzso to develop a system for zzso zzso function in human zzso zzso cells were zzso either with a zzso gene zzso at position 119 zzso to zzso temperature sensitivity zzso zzso or with control zzso The percentage of cells in zzso phase was similar in zzso control cells or in zzso zzso cells cultured at restrictive conditions (40 degrees zzso However, with lowering of temperature from 40 degrees C to zzso conditions zzso degrees zzso the percentage of zzso zzso cells in zzso phase and binding of zzso to zzso and zzso increased, with associated decreases in zzso and zzso zzso activities, and zzso of zzso protein zzso Culture of zzso zzso cells at 31 degrees C for zzso days zzso inhibited zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells cultured under these zzso conditions showed a less transformed zzso and more differentiated zzso than did these cells cultured under restrictive zzso Finally, zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso cells cultured at 40 degrees C, but did not trigger death of these cells cultured at 31 degrees zzso These results suggest that deletion of zzso gene in zzso human ALL cells is associated with zzso growth of less differentiated tumor cells, which nonetheless remain susceptible to zzso triggered by zzso
