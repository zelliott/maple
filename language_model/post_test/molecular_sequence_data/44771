We developed a novel approach for the high-level production of a microbial zzso zzso from zzso in zzso zzso The direct expression of the zzso gene in zzso coli cells did not cause zzso probably due to the harmful influence of zzso activity, which introduces zzso zzso between zzso zzso we fused the chemically zzso zzso gene coding for the entire 331 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso gene 10 leader zzso zzso zzso zzso using an zzso expression zzso The zzso gene was expressed as inclusion bodies in the zzso coli zzso zzso 15 zzso acid zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of the mature zzso by a zzso deletion of the fusion sequence facilitated zzso and subsequent zzso zzso thus releasing mature zzso Although the mature form had less zzso activity than native zzso because of the poor zzso rate, these results suggest that this system is suitable for the efficient production of zzso
