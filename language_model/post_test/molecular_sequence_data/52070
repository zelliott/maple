Previous work indicates that both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are critical zzso for interaction with either the A or B zzso zzso We have examined a series of zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso ring of the zzso zzso has been zzso zzso were assessed in binding zzso using zzso rat pancreatic zzso and bovine zzso as the source of zzso and zzso receptors respectively and for zzso activity after zzso administration to zzso zzso of a number of zzso or zzso zzso zzso for the zzso ring of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to zzso with zzso times the zzso potency of zzso The zzso activity of 21 was blocked by the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso Other bulky zzso groups in place of the zzso aromatic ring such as zzso zzso and zzso gave derivatives similar to 2 in zzso While most of the new compounds were comparable to zzso in binding zzso 23, 26, 27 and 29 were exceptionally potent with zzso zzso M in the zzso zzso 23 and 29 were further evaluated for their ability to stimulate zzso zzso and found to have zzso similar to that of zzso The zzso between potency in the binding and zzso zzso zzso suggests that they may interact with a high affinity binding site which is not coupled to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso receptors possess a generous zzso pocket capable of accommodating large zzso groups in place of the side chain of zzso and that the pharmacological profile of zzso zzso can be tailored by appropriate exploitation of this zzso
