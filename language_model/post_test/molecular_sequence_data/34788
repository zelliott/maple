zzso is an important zzso that is involved in zzso zzso the gene zzso the zzso alpha zzso was recently proposed as a candidate for premature zzso failure zzso a syndrome that leads to the zzso of zzso function under the age of 40 zzso 70 zzso patients and 70 controls were screened for the previously identified zzso zzso transition zzso The T zzso was found in zzso zzso of controls, but only zzso zzso of zzso zzso This result indicates that the T zzso is significantly underrepresented in the zzso patient population zzso exact test, zzso P zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter in 50 zzso patients and 50 controls identified a highly zzso imperfect zzso repeat at approximately zzso zzso that consisted of four common zzso zzso B, C and zzso The zzso zzso is linked to the shortest repeat zzso zzso zzso Despite the association between zzso C and zzso no significant difference was found between the promoter activity of a zzso reporter construct containing zzso C, and most of the other zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso B failed to show any promoter zzso We conclude that the inheritance of specific zzso promoter zzso zzso to the development of premature zzso zzso
