zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that regulates zzso levels of zzso a zzso zzso factor, in response to zzso zzso We have determined the structure of the zzso domain of zzso bound to a zzso zzso from zzso containing a highly zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains two short zzso zzso connected by two overlapping type I zzso stabilized by the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region fits into a binding pocket on the top face of the zzso domain and the zzso zzso form multiple hydrogen bonds with highly zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments confirmed the role of individual zzso acids for binding of zzso to zzso and for zzso repression of zzso gene zzso Our results provide a detailed picture of how a zzso zzso zzso protein binds to its zzso zzso and will enable the rational design of novel zzso zzso
