Two marine, zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strains that are zzso by means of gliding were isolated from the green zzso zzso zzso and from sea zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed an affiliation between the strains studied and the zzso zzso a member of the family zzso The level of sequence similarity between strain zzso zzso and zzso algae zzso zzso was zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso experiments and zzso analysis indicated that the strains represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso The description of the zzso zzso is zzso with newly obtained zzso
