Changed zzso zzso properties near surfaces, zzso and zzso zzso acid have been reported before in the zzso In the present work, we extend this work to zzso We have performed zzso molecular dynamics simulations to study zzso properties of simple zzso of biological relevance zzso in explicit water, near single and multiple zzso as zzso zzso We find that our zzso prefer direct contact with zzso over zzso but that the zzso contacts are longer zzso These interactions also lead to strong but short-lived changes in zzso zzso with zzso wrapping around zzso with multiple zzso These findings may have implications for current hypotheses on zzso zzso
