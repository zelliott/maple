Current methods for detection of zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and sequence analysis frequently are not able to detect zzso large zzso We report the successful use of a novel approach to identify such zzso based on detection of apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis of zzso DNA zzso products containing all coding zzso and zzso zzso identified only a single zzso zzso zzso in a patient with classic zzso zzso zzso zzso storage disease type II zzso zzso zzso for multiple zzso zzso detected by this sequencing suggested presence of a large deletion as the second zzso zzso zzso the region of zzso zzso permitted identification and characterization by zzso of a large zzso deletion zzso zzso extending from zzso to zzso The data clearly demonstrate the utility of zzso as markers for large deletions in zzso zzso diseases when only a single zzso is found, thus zzso currently standard DNA zzso sequence methods for identifying the molecular basis of zzso
