The active form of zzso reverse zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is generated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso A well-known problem of zzso zzso expression is partial zzso of a zzso zzso from the zzso by host zzso that can not be completely zzso In order to zzso the contribution of specific zzso to a particular function in one distinct zzso an expression and zzso system is required that selects for the combination of the two individual zzso with the desired zzso We zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso coli as an zzso fusion protein of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso system ensures convenience for gene manipulation while degradation is reduced to a zzso as zzso protects the protein from further zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso affinity zzso allows rapid and selective zzso of the desired zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso are efficiently zzso zzso zzso revealed that the preparations are free of zzso zzso In a successful test of the novel expression system, mixed zzso zzso with zzso selectively zzso in a putative zzso acid binding motif (the so called zzso zzso show reduced binding of zzso in zzso zzso This indicates the zzso zzso has an active role in DNA binding
