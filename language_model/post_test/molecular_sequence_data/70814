It is unclear whether the sequence populations of zzso C virus zzso zzso in the liver and in serum are different, as a variety of studies on this subject provide conflicting zzso In the current study, the populations of zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso sequences in paired serum and liver samples from six patients with chronic zzso were zzso zzso zzso viral zzso was amplified with a highly zzso zzso zzso and extensive measures, including accounting for template copy number, were undertaken to lower the risk of sporadic zzso zzso zzso sequences were compared by zzso zzso zzso analysis and by direct sequencing of identified zzso In four patients, liver samples were found to contain zzso within the zzso which were not found in serum or zzso viral zzso while in the remaining two patients, low virus zzso prevented a reliable zzso zzso These results suggest the presence in the same individual of zzso zzso differing in the zzso zzso and possibly replicating with different zzso
