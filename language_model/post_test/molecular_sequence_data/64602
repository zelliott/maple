zzso proteins are recently identified members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lots of zzso family of zzso thought to function in zzso and inflammatory signaling zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a member of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family, the zzso zzso expressed primarily in zzso cells, were recently found to be associated with a spectrum of zzso zzso These include chronic infantile zzso zzso and zzso zzso syndrome (also known as zzso zzso inflammatory disease zzso zzso syndrome zzso and familial cold zzso zzso We describe zzso 7 new zzso in 13 unrelated patients with zzso syndrome and identify zzso hotspots in zzso on the basis of all zzso described to zzso We also provide evidence of zzso zzso A zzso model of the zzso domain zzso of zzso suggested that this zzso is structurally and functionally similar to members of the zzso protein family of zzso According to this model, most of the zzso known to affect zzso of the zzso are clustered on one side of this domain in a region predicted to participate in zzso zzso suggesting that this model is likely to be biologically relevant and that defects in zzso zzso zzso zzso or protein zzso may lead to the functional zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
