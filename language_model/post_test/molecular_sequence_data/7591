We have studied the sequence and function of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso genes from nine patients with highly divergent rates of disease progression enrolled in a zzso study of zzso zzso Over an average of zzso years of zzso three patients had net positive changes in zzso zzso counts, three patients had net negative changes in zzso T cells but did not develop zzso and three patients progressed to zzso The zzso gene from each of these patients was amplified and zzso and the sequence of 8 to 10 clones was zzso Only 2 of 88 zzso zzso genes recovered from these nine patients were zzso zzso Moreover, there was no relationship between the zzso of zzso sequences and the corresponding rates of disease progression from these zzso Representative zzso genes from all nine patients were tested for their abilities to zzso cell surface zzso in a zzso zzso There was no correlation found between the functions of the zzso genes from these patients and their corresponding rates of disease zzso We conclude that the zzso gene is not a common zzso of the rate of zzso disease progression in natural zzso
