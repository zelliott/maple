Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso (named after the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso segments of cancer DNA zzso gene zzso have been found before in breast and prostate zzso The present study focused on determining the value of markers zzso in the diagnosis and prognosis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer, in benign tumors, in zzso adjacent to cancer, and in normal zzso was tested by Western zzso zzso of the zzso separated proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso alpha gene was zzso amplified with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso of zzso zzso and cervical cancer cases and in zzso of zzso cancer zzso The zzso alpha gene was expressed in zzso of cancer cases, in approximately zzso of benign zzso tumors, and in zzso of benign tumors of the zzso DNA sequences amplified in all cancer cases exhibited more than zzso zzso to zzso zzso and were zzso for the functional zzso DNA sequences found in benign tumors contained zzso zzso and zzso truncated or zzso zzso Such sequences have not been amplified in normal zzso zzso zzso and the zzso alpha gene seem to belong to a zzso type that is highly related to zzso Beyond the diagnostic value of zzso zzso future cloning of the full viral zzso would lead to a better understanding of the zzso of zzso and zzso tumors of zzso zzso and to the development of novel therapeutic zzso
