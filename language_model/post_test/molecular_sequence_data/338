This study examines the structural features and zzso of the alpha zzso of 69 full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The analyses of this set of sequences included zzso scores, multiple sequence zzso examination of patterns of zzso zzso zzso analysis and comparison of the sequences zzso the zzso zzso and His zzso that attach the zzso zzso to zzso and that are also zzso in the alternative zzso The results show that zzso zzso fall into two distinct zzso Group I includes zzso sequences from many zzso within zzso including all zzso zzso zzso as well as strict zzso and some zzso zzso but no zzso zzso In contrast, Group II zzso sequences were limited to a small number of zzso and bacterial sequences from strict zzso The zzso and zzso sequences fall into two separate groups, more closely related to Group II zzso than to Group I zzso The pattern of perfectly zzso zzso distributed along the full length of the Group I and II zzso zzso and zzso confirms zzso that these zzso are derived from a common ancestral zzso 

There is no indication of a relationship between the patterns of zzso zzso specific to each of the four groups discussed above that would give indications of an evolutionary zzso leading from one type of zzso to zzso Rather the totality of the data, along with the zzso analysis, is consistent with a radiation of Group I and II zzso zzso and zzso from a common ancestral zzso All the data presented here strongly support the suggestion made by some earlier investigators that the zzso family had already evolved in the last common zzso of the zzso and zzso
