The zzso calcium binding mechanism of the two zzso zzso of human zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To zzso the calcium binding of each zzso zzso two zzso structures zzso and zzso of wild type zzso were zzso According to zzso analysis both zzso and zzso were properly zzso The zzso zzso in these zzso remained nearly intact and active in calcium zzso whereas the zzso zzso lost its affinity for calcium zzso The apparent calcium binding affinity of the zzso zzso was much lower compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and approximately 240 zzso zzso When the chemical shift zzso were followed upon calcium zzso a positive correlation between the zzso zzso and the binding of the first calcium zzso to the wild type was zzso These observations showed that the first zzso in zzso binds the first calcium zzso and thereby triggers a zzso change that allows the second calcium zzso to bind to the other zzso
