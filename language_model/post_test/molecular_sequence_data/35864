zzso and identification of the fire blight zzso zzso zzso can be accurately done by zzso chain reaction zzso analysis in less than 6 zzso Two zzso derived from a zzso zzso which is common to all strains of zzso zzso were used to amplify a zzso zzso of the zzso By separation of the zzso products on zzso zzso this zzso zzso specifically detected when zzso zzso DNA was present in the amplification zzso It was not found when DNA from other zzso bacteria was used for the zzso A visible band specific to the zzso zzso was produced with DNA from fewer than 100 zzso zzso zzso A signal of similar strength was also obtained from zzso zzso cell zzso in the presence of the mild zzso zzso zzso zzso were weaker when bacteria were added to the zzso mixture without the zzso As with results obtained from zzso experiments using zzso zzso the zzso signal was obtained with zzso zzso zzso from various geographic zzso This technique could also be used for detection of the fire blight pathogen in extracts of tissue obtained from infected plant zzso
