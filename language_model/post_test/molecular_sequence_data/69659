We have cloned part of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The characterized sequence consists of zzso zzso of the coding and zzso zzso of the zzso region interrupted by an zzso In the coding region we found zzso similarity in DNA and zzso in deduced zzso acid sequences between human and zzso with no similarity in the zzso zzso By Southern zzso zzso of DNA from zzso zzso cell hybrids and by in zzso zzso zzso we mapped zzso to human zzso zzso This location of zzso is different from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso previously assigned to zzso zzso by linkage analysis, thus excluding it as a target of the zzso zzso Since it is likely that zzso is caused by a zzso in the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our results do not support the hypothesis that the two zzso are zzso by a single zzso
