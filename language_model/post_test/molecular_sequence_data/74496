zzso zzso zzso is a common syndrome associated with numerous adverse health outcomes in zzso Despite its medical importance, the zzso and microbial ecology of zzso remain poorly zzso We used zzso zzso to census the community structure of the healthy and zzso zzso microbial zzso and zzso current publicly available bacterial zzso zzso gene sequence data from this zzso The community of zzso bacteria detected in subjects with zzso was much more zzso rich and diverse than in subjects without zzso At a zzso sequence similarity zzso the number of operational zzso units zzso per patient in 28 subjects with zzso was nearly three times greater than in 13 subjects without zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso zzso analyses revealed previously hidden diversity for many zzso bacteria that are currently poorly represented in zzso Our sequencing efforts yielded many novel zzso zzso of our sequences represented 38 zzso not previously found in the zzso zzso including several novel zzso zzso such as those belonging to the zzso species complex, which remain severely underrepresented in the current zzso zzso Community composition was highly variable among subjects at a fine zzso scale, but at the zzso level, zzso and zzso were strongly associated with zzso Our data describe a previously zzso extent of bacterial diversity in the zzso zzso The human zzso hosts many bacteria that are only zzso related to known species, and subjects with zzso harbor particularly zzso and diverse bacterial zzso
