Human plasma zzso zzso D is a zzso with an apparent molecular weight of zzso zzso It is present, zzso in high density zzso zzso and very high density zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of HDL and zzso using rabbit zzso to human zzso revealed major zzso bands at zzso and 38,000 zzso with minor bands ranging from 50,000 to and zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso band corresponding to zzso remained when the zzso was conducted under reducing conditions, demonstrating that zzso is zzso to other proteins via zzso zzso The broad pattern of zzso was also observed under zzso conditions when the blood was collected into a solution of zzso zzso or when these zzso were added to the isolated zzso These results indicated that the zzso bonds were not the result of zzso exchange during the experimental zzso On the basis of zzso acid sequencing and reactions to zzso the 38,000 zzso band was identified as an zzso zzso The zzso was also demonstrated in zzso In both HDL and zzso the zzso zzso constituted the major form of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were also found in low and very low density zzso and in whole zzso It is concluded that a fraction of human zzso like other zzso zzso exists as a zzso zzso with other zzso in all major human zzso zzso
