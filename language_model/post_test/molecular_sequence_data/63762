zzso zzso is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the molecular mechanisms causing zzso in zzso remain poorly zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of zzso on DNA zzso of zzso and the underlying mechanism of zzso expression that was induced by zzso in zzso About 50, 100, zzso and 500 zzso zzso were added to the zzso cultured for 48 zzso zzso that acted as zzso sensors and bind with zzso affinities to zzso of zzso were determined by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso in zzso Here, we used a zzso quantitative zzso zzso that zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction to determine the levels of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso level and zzso zzso level were detected by high performance liquid zzso zzso indicated that the levels of zzso promoter zzso in zzso cultured with zzso were increased in comparison with the control group, and the peak was in the 100 zzso zzso group, however, a zzso increase with increasing zzso was not zzso zzso also decreased zzso and protein levels of zzso in zzso Further, with the addition of zzso the levels of zzso were zzso the levels of SAM and the ratio of zzso were lower, and the activity of zzso was zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso DNA zzso induced by zzso may represent an important mechanism to explain zzso which may become a therapeutic target for preventing zzso induced by zzso
