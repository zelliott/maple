Because zzso light chains have been implicated in the regulation of zzso coat assembly and zzso specialization of zzso zzso trafficking, a zzso zzso gene of zzso has been sought as a genetically zzso model for these zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene has been identified and its expression examined in various zzso stages and zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso A zzso zzso originally identified from a partial sequence in the Berkeley zzso Genome Project zzso database, has been zzso completely and shown to zzso a zzso with extensive sequence similarity to zzso and zzso zzso light zzso Secondary structure zzso predict an extensive zzso over a region extending from zzso acid zzso 100 to zzso in excellent agreement with previous analyses of zzso light zzso By in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso the gene has been mapped to zzso position zzso on the left arm of zzso zzso An zzso analysis, coupled with zzso analysis of zzso DNA, showed that there is no neural specialization of the zzso zzso light chain corresponding to that observed in zzso zzso light zzso The zzso alternative zzso of zzso light chains thus appears to be restricted to zzso where it may contribute to the more complex zzso capacity of higher nervous zzso
