In zzso transformation a particular point zzso belonging to the zzso locus is able markedly to enhance zzso frequency when crossed with any other markers of this zzso This results from a polarized conversion of the zzso towards the zzso zzso In this report, by zzso zzso zzso we have generated a series of zzso showing various degrees of zzso We have found that the substitution zzso is a sufficient signal for localized zzso zzso individual bases within this sequence results in decreased conversion zzso to levels that depend on the zzso suggesting that there is a family to related sequences which may act as a zzso for a conversion zzso Moreover, the length over which this conversion occurs has been estimated to be 12 base pairs on the zzso
