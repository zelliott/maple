Secondary structure models for the zzso zzso P zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coli were derived by a zzso comparative analysis of published sequences as well as four novel zzso The zzso P zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and compared with the other available zzso zzso of pairing were identified by the occurrence of zzso complementary sequences that vary among the compared zzso A common core of primary and secondary structure can be identified in all these zzso P zzso The previously noted striking differences between the zzso and the enteric zzso P zzso arise not only from point zzso but from the addition or deletion of structural zzso The primary and secondary structural features that are common to all of the zzso P zzso are likely to be the elements involved in the binding and zzso of zzso zzso and in the interaction with the zzso P zzso
