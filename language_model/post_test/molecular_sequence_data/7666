The frequency, zzso value and zzso of zzso and zzso gene expressions were investigated by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in 91 cases of de zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso of which 51 were newly zzso 21 were zzso and 19 were zzso zzso As compared with normal bone zzso cells and peripheral zzso an zzso of zzso gene was found in zzso zzso of zzso cases of de zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gene zzso tended to be higher in relapsed patients than in newly diagnosed patients zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso In 52 zzso newly diagnosed and relapsed patients treated with zzso drugs, both zzso and zzso gene zzso correlated to a higher rate of emergence of clinical drug resistance zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and 67 vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso A positive correlation was found between zzso and zzso gene zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso Analysis of 46 zzso zzso cases revealed a trend for higher resistant disease rate in zzso patients as compared with zzso patients zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso like zzso may have an important negative impact on the outcome of chemotherapy, and that there may be a common mechanism of induction for the zzso of these two zzso
