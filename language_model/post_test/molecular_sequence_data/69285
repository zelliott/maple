The structure of zzso human zzso zzso zzso factor expressed in zzso cells was zzso The zzso protein zzso expressed from a zzso sequence that zzso a signal zzso of 32 zzso acids and zzso zzso acids numbers zzso was zzso in terms of molecular mass, as analyzed by zzso because of the presence of zzso sugar zzso The primary structure of the zzso was determined by sequence analysis and zzso acid analysis of the fragments obtained from zzso zzso of reduced and zzso zzso and from zzso zzso of the intact zzso A sugar chain was located only at zzso of the two putative sites of zzso that were present per zzso The zzso structure appeared to have seven zzso bonds, formed by zzso or zzso zzso since there were no free zzso groups in the zzso The assignment of zzso bonds by sequence analysis using zzso fragments indicated the combinations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso in which the remaining zzso was replaced by zzso and which was expressed in zzso cells, suggested that the zzso existed as a zzso Our study shows that the zzso pairings of zzso that is expressed and zzso modified in zzso cells are identical to those of zzso zzso zzso with only one zzso zzso bond, zzso zzso
