The mechanisms of perception of zzso zzso stress and ensuing tolerance in plants remain zzso To obtain an insight into these mechanisms, zzso and zzso profiling of two contrasting zzso of zzso zzso was zzso After screening 14 varieties for As zzso one tolerant zzso and one sensitive zzso variety were selected and exposed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 7 d and 15 d for zzso zzso The tolerant variety zzso demonstrated higher zzso of As upon exposure to both 500 zzso zzso and 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 37 zzso zzso dry weight zzso after 15 zzso as well as a better response of zzso metabolism as compared with the responses observed in the sensitive variety zzso zzso profiling of selected genes that are known to be responsive to zzso depletion and/or zzso stress was conducted in zzso zzso after 3 h and 6 h exposure to 250 zzso zzso The results showed an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas there was a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso within 6 h of exposure to zzso This suggested that perception of zzso stress was presumably zzso through an integrated zzso in hormonal functioning that led to both zzso and long-term adaptations to combat the zzso Such a coordinated response of hormones was not seen in the sensitive zzso In conclusion, an early perception of zzso stress followed by coordinated responses of various pathways was responsible for As tolerance in zzso
