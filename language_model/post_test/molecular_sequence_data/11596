Transport of zzso I zzso to the zzso appears to be insensitive to zzso of the zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso extension of the 61 zzso precursor of zzso zzso is zzso processed in two sequential zzso The first step involves zzso A zzso and produces a 55 zzso unstable intermediate zzso The second step involves zzso B zzso and converts zzso into the 50 zzso stable, mature zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth zzso by a zzso zzso indicates that zzso is transported to the zzso by a zzso zzso zzso of the first 16 zzso acids results in zzso of the truncated protein in the zzso indicating that zzso is actively transported to the zzso The zzso zzso constructed by fusing a zzso tag to the zzso of zzso was exploited to dissect the mechanism of zzso zzso Cell zzso studies show the presence of zzso and zzso in a fraction of zzso zzso by density zzso This and the sequential conversion of zzso into zzso and zzso lacking the zzso tag is consistent with zzso of zzso into the zzso membrane through its zzso zzso The specific mechanism of zzso sorting demonstrates a new zzso of protein transport in zzso zzso
