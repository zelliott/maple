Two genes with high sequence zzso to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned from blood of zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso of the expression pattern of these receptors in different species demonstrated that, like in humans, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are highly expressed in zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells expressing zzso bind zzso zzso with an affinity similar to zzso zzso values, 170 zzso 87 and 103 zzso 37 zzso zzso and show low binding affinity to zzso zzso zzso also binds zzso but with somewhat higher affinity than the zzso zzso zzso 28 and 220 zzso 14 zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso has a reduced binding affinity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso more potent in zzso zzso binding to zzso than to zzso suggesting that some of the observed differences in the zzso acid sequences of the human and monkey zzso affect zzso binding sites or the zzso of the zzso Both zzso receptors were functionally active in inducing zzso zzso exchange on zzso in response to zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso cells in response to zzso and zzso These results identify the products of the novel zzso genes as functional zzso of zzso and zzso
