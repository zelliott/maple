zzso zzso zzso zzso is defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso with blood zzso levels below 600 zzso zzso within the therapeutic zzso on a normal dietary zzso zzso analysis at the zzso locus was performed in 17 Danish families with zzso zzso revealing compound zzso in all zzso By zzso zzso zzso probing for common zzso zzso we found 12 of 17 zzso zzso children with a zzso zzso on one zzso To identify molecular zzso in the second zzso individual zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction and screened for zzso by zzso zzso zzso Two new zzso zzso were zzso Three children had inherited a zzso transition at zzso 415 in zzso 12 of the zzso zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso for zzso whereas one child possessed an zzso transition at zzso zzso in zzso 9, causing the replacement of an zzso by a zzso in the zzso It is further demonstrated that the identified zzso have less impact on the zzso ability to zzso zzso to zzso compared to the parents carrying a zzso zzso The combined effect on zzso activity explains the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The present observations that zzso zzso in combination with other zzso result in the zzso zzso zzso and that particular zzso zzso length zzso zzso combinations are associated with this zzso offer the possibility of distinguishing zzso patients from zzso individuals by means of molecular analysis of the zzso zzso and, consequently, of determining whether a newborn child requires dietary zzso
