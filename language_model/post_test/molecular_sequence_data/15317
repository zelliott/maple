Fluorescent proteins have wide applications in zzso However, not all of these proteins are properly expressed in bacteria, especially if the zzso usage and zzso zzso content of the host zzso are not ideal for high zzso In this study, we analyzed the DNA sequences of multiple fluorescent protein genes with respect to zzso and zzso content and compared them to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found high discrepancies for zzso fluorescent protein zzso yellow fluorescent protein zzso and the zzso green fluorescent protein zzso but not zzso with regard to zzso content and zzso zzso zzso when the proteins were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso a phenomenon caused not by lack of gene zzso or degradation of the proteins but by lack of protein zzso To improve expression in bacteria with low zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso zzso and constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were in contrast to zzso genes highly expressed in zzso zzso and in another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a reporter, we were able to monitor the activity of the protective zzso promoter of zzso zzso and confirm its dependence on zzso and regulators present on zzso zzso zzso
