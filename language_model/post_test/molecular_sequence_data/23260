Many cells express a Group zzso zzso zzso designated zzso that does not require calcium for zzso is zzso by zzso and is sensitive to zzso by a zzso zzso suicide zzso zzso Studies in various cell systems have led to the suggestion that zzso has a role in zzso zzso signal zzso cell zzso and zzso We have found that pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells express an zzso that zzso in zzso insulin zzso but is not involved in membrane zzso zzso Additionally, recent studies reveal that zzso is involved in pathways that contribute to zzso proliferation and zzso and that various zzso zzso are involved in these zzso zzso characterization of the zzso suggests that the zzso express multiple zzso of zzso and we zzso that these participate in different cellular zzso
