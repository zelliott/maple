zzso a zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso in plant zzso zzso and plays crucial structural and functional roles in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the formation of zzso from zzso zzso In contrast to the well studied zzso that have been cloned and characterized from many organisms, the zzso has only been genetically defined by the zzso zzso in zzso We have isolated the zzso gene by zzso cloning and found that, in contrast to all known zzso zzso which are the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso background, in which both zzso zzso are zzso yielded a zzso zzso zzso zzso in which all three known zzso zzso activities are zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso were still produced in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a fourth unknown zzso zzso exists in zzso that is structurally unrelated to zzso 1 or zzso A second zzso member of the zzso family, zzso is zzso identical to zzso and hypothesized as a likely candidate for this additional zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso defines a class of zzso zzso that has evolved independently from and uses a different mechanism than zzso zzso zzso
