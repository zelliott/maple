zzso requirements for zzso recognition by zzso raised in rabbits against zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were determined in zzso zzso by measuring the displacement of binding of zzso and zzso respectively, by a large number of selected zzso to two zzso and two zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso modifications of the zzso zzso such as the presence of an zzso or zzso group or the addition of a second zzso acid to form zzso with zzso zzso or zzso are tolerated to variable degrees, more so by the zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso possess zzso recognition sites for the two zzso groups present in both zzso zzso Strong shape zzso between the zzso acids and their respective binding sites is suggested by the lack of recognition of the appropriate D zzso by any of the zzso Changes in the distance between the two zzso groups, or zzso replacement or loss of either or both zzso groups, strongly reduce or eliminate zzso Based on these results, we suggest that other zzso raised to similar zzso of these zzso acids are likely to share similar recognition zzso In addition, the results provide a rational background for the evaluation of zzso specificity and the interpretation of results in zzso studies using zzso to zzso and zzso
