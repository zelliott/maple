The question of how dispersed zzso in one protein zzso the same zzso zzso is of great zzso Here we focus on zzso in zzso zzso zzso that cause an zzso form of zzso zzso diseases, the most common zzso peripheral zzso Because the disease zzso is dominant, and not correlated with defects in the role of zzso in protein zzso the zzso proteins are considered to be zzso that gain new functions from altered protein zzso Given that previous crystal structures showed little zzso difference between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso proteins were investigated in solution by zzso exchange zzso by mass zzso and zzso X-ray scattering to uncover structural changes that could be suppressed by crystal packing zzso zzso each of five zzso dispersed zzso induced the same zzso opening of a consensus area that is mostly buried in the zzso zzso The identified zzso surface is thus a candidate for making zzso pathological zzso and a target for disease zzso Additional result showed that a zzso zzso domain that was appended to zzso in zzso can regulate the zzso structural change, and that the gain of function of the CMT zzso might be due to the loss of function of the zzso domain as a zzso Overall, the results demonstrate how zzso dispersed and seemingly unrelated zzso can zzso the same localized effect on a zzso
