zzso contemporary zzso increases our understanding of zzso adaptation and, ultimately, zzso The sister species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and genetically similar and zzso Recently, zzso zzso has zzso northern Spain, creating a broad zzso region with zzso zzso Here, we review the distribution of both species in zzso and evaluate the degree of zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso using six zzso markers zzso individuals from 26 zzso and five zzso genes in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso of the genetically controlled zzso zzso in females of both zzso 

In a principal component analysis of the zzso data, the first two principal components zzso almost half zzso of the total genetic zzso The first axis revealed a clear separation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while the second axis separated zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed extensive zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso and occasional zzso suggesting zzso is zzso More specifically, approximately zzso of the 166 Spanish zzso zzso individuals were assigned to the zzso zzso zzso category, whereas not a single of those individuals was assigned to the zzso with zzso zzso The zzso genes held little genetic variation, and the most common zzso was shared by the two zzso 

The results suggest rapid species turnover in zzso regions in zzso of zzso zzso corroborating previous findings that zzso zzso suffers a mating disadvantage in zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso frequency dynamics indicates that zzso is likely to have important implications for the maintenance of multiple female zzso in particular during the initial period of zzso
