zzso a zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso formation of zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso in many zzso and zzso and have been implicated in bacterial zzso zzso contains two zzso repeat regions that are modified by zzso zzso A zzso cluster has been identified, and this cluster is implicated in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the initial step of zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso as a zzso This zzso zzso has the same zzso composition profile as the native zzso zzso zzso linkage analyses indicated that zzso zzso is among the first group of sugar zzso transferred to the zzso zzso Two putative zzso zzso and zzso were essential for the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso in both zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis as well as in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso demonstrated the two putative zzso zzso with each zzso The interaction domain was mapped to an zzso region of zzso that was required for the zzso zzso The data in this study suggested that the formation of the zzso and zzso complex was required for the initiation of the zzso zzso and that the zzso region of zzso was zzso
