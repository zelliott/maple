Species of zzso are among the most serious pathogens that affect mango trees and zzso Several species occur on zzso and these are identified mainly on the zzso of the zzso Common zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified species, zzso zzso The zzso name zzso however, is acknowledged as a synonym of zzso This study aimed to characterize and name the zzso zzso associated with disease symptoms on zzso To achieve this zzso representing all four zzso zzso mentioned above were compared with the zzso of known zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and DNA sequence zzso Two zzso regions were zzso namely the ITS zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and molecular results confirmed that the zzso previously identified from mango as species of zzso belong to zzso zzso zzso zzso were identical to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A new zzso namely zzso zzso is proposed for zzso previously treated as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso zzso also was identified as those zzso previously known as zzso zzso A key is provided to distinguish these species based on zzso zzso in zzso This study provides a basis for the identification of zzso species from zzso which is important for disease control and to zzso zzso zzso
