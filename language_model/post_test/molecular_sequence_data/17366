zzso class II zzso genes are regulated by an zzso complex containing two zzso zzso factors, regulatory factor X complex zzso and zzso These factors assemble on a strictly zzso regulatory module zzso found immediately upstream of the promoters of all classical and zzso zzso genes as well as the zzso chain zzso zzso To identify new targets of zzso and zzso we developed a zzso approach based on the unique and highly constrained architecture of the composite zzso zzso We identified six novel zzso zzso situated far away from the promoters of known human zzso and zzso zzso Four are situated at strategic positions within the zzso zzso and two are found within the zzso zzso These zzso zzso function as zzso zzso are bona fide targets of zzso and zzso in B cells and zzso cells, and induce broad zzso of zzso zzso These results reveal a zzso unexpected level of complexity involving long distance control of zzso expression by multiple zzso regulatory zzso
