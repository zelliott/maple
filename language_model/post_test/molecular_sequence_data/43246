zzso zzso zzso zzso toxins that have zzso zzso and zzso zzso are significantly more potent than toxins with only a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of these toxins differ from the zzso peptides found in zzso and zzso zzso by the nature of their different zzso bond structure and, in lieu of the zzso signature zzso zzso zzso binding zzso there is an zzso zzso zzso sequence in that zzso Due to these apparent differences, the contribution to the overall function of the zzso zzso by the zzso domain has been zzso In this investigation we have expressed in insect cells the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and demonstrated that the zzso protein zzso can inhibit zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso we have evidence that the region of the zzso domain that is zzso analogous to the zzso loop of the zzso is the site responsible for zzso of zzso zzso For these synthetic peptides to have significant zzso activity, the zzso zzso zzso must be constrained by participation in a zzso bond with another zzso zzso The two zzso zzso acids adjacent to the middle zzso zzso in these peptides are also important for biological zzso These studies emphasize a functional role for the zzso domain in toxins and suggest structural possibilities for the design of zzso of zzso zzso
