In zzso zzso the zzso of zzso occurs via specific zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We selected several zzso zzso zzso in a zzso genetic zzso Two of them were devoid of zzso activity zzso zzso belonging to the same zzso zzso The zzso mapped in the structural zzso This was demonstrated by a gene dosage effect and by the zzso of the zzso activity of zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned by zzso for growth on zzso zzso in the strain zzso carrying both a zzso disruption and the zzso zzso The minimal complete zzso sequence was localized by zzso zzso From the sequence analysis an open reading frame zzso was identified that could zzso a zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence showed significant zzso with the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso which zzso the terminal step of zzso acid zzso These results are discussed together with the role of zzso and zzso in zzso metabolism of zzso zzso
