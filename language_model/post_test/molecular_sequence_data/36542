We have used the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso zzso of the bovine zzso zzso The zzso responsible for the B zzso were identified by direct sequencing of the amplification zzso A zzso zzso zzso method zzso has been developed using zzso overlapping the zzso site at their 3' zzso This new procedure allows a rapid and reliable discrimination between the B and non-B zzso of zzso
