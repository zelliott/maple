zzso are zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso which play important roles in patterning nervous and vascular zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have identified a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the originally described zzso zzso zzso zzso Marks and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso lacks a segment of 22 zzso acids zzso zzso At the transcript level, zzso 3 is spliced out in the transcript zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso embryonic kidney zzso zzso with an zzso zzso resulted in a significant expression of the protein on the cell zzso However, soluble zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to zzso zzso but bound strongly to zzso zzso zzso have been shown to undergo regulated zzso after interaction with their zzso This process is inhibited by zzso of zzso and zzso indicating that zzso influences the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that this newly described zzso may regulate the function of its zzso zzso
