In the last few decades, zzso zzso an zzso combination of zzso and zzso has been used for treatment of upper respiratory tract infection due to zzso zzso The usage of this zzso has become less important due to emergence of zzso strains zzso Most reports associate zzso resistance to the presence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes which are responsible for zzso zzso while the zzso zzso resistance are due to zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and/or zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso This study aims to detect and zzso the genes that are involved in zzso resistance in zzso zzso strains that were isolated in zzso zzso targeting for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes were used to amplify the genes in nine zzso zzso The products of amplification were zzso and multiple alignments of the assembled sequences of the local strains were compared to the sequences of other zzso zzso strains in the zzso Of the five zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was detected in three out of the nine zzso In contrast to intermediate zzso at least one zzso of zzso genes was detected in the resistant zzso Multiple zzso alignment of this gene revealed that strain zzso was genetically different from the others due to a zzso zzso insert in zzso zzso The sequence of the insert was similar to the insert in zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso a strain isolated in United zzso None of the strains had zzso gene but zzso gene was detected in four zzso zzso study on the limited number of samples shows that the zzso resistance was attributed to mainly to zzso and the zzso was due to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in addition to zzso in seven strains apparently had increased their level of zzso A strain that lacked zzso or zzso zzso its resistance to zzso was attributed to a zzso DNA insert in the zzso zzso
