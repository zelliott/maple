Studies were conducted with the final goal of identifying genes of interest mapping to the zzso region zzso an area commonly affected by zzso losses in breast zzso To this end we generated a detailed physical map of the zzso region spanning between zzso site markers zzso and zzso To identify candidate zzso we used shotgun zzso sequencing as well as isolation and analysis of transcripts mapping to the area of zzso We identified and cloned a novel zzso the zzso structure of which spans the whole region of zzso We named this gene zzso because it contains two WW zzso coupled to a region with high zzso to the zzso zzso family of zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso zzso long, zzso a zzso acid zzso This gene is composed of nine zzso We performed a zzso screening of zzso zzso in a panel of breast cancer lines, most of which are zzso for the zzso zzso region zzso We found no evidence of zzso thus indicating that zzso is probably not a tumor zzso zzso However, we observed that one case of zzso deletion as well as two previously described zzso zzso map to zzso regions of this zzso We speculate that zzso may span the yet zzso common fragile site zzso zzso In expression studies we found zzso of zzso in breast cancer cell lines when compared with normal breast cells and zzso The highest normal expression of zzso was observed in zzso regulated zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso This expression pattern and the presence of a zzso zzso domain and specific zzso acid features suggest a role for zzso in steroid zzso Interestingly, the presence of WW zzso in the structure of zzso indicate the likelihood that this protein physically interacts with other zzso The unique features of zzso and its possible association with cancer processes make it an interesting target for further zzso
