zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso by mast zzso zzso and zzso differ in structure, function, and mast cell zzso and zzso zzso Seeking genetic regulatory elements shared by zzso we zzso the dog zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso and zzso sequences of the dog, human, and mouse zzso zzso but little in corresponding zzso zzso zzso elements probably derived from zzso are unique features of the dog zzso DNA blots suggest that the dog zzso like its human counterpart, may be the zzso sole zzso unlike in zzso in which zzso zzso Nuclear zzso studies predict that zzso mechanisms explain differences in steady state zzso and zzso zzso levels between zzso and zzso zzso In dog zzso zzso cells incubated with zzso zzso high steady state levels of zzso zzso drop dramatically with little change in zzso zzso whereas zzso decreases expression of both zzso zzso of the dog or human gene zzso flank zzso into zzso cells drive expression of a reporter gene and define regions with active zzso Thus, zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso regulated independently of zzso and support zzso using dog or human zzso These studies reinforce the zzso zzso and suggest the utility of zzso cells in probing regulation of zzso zzso
