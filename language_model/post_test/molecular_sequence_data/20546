zzso C virus zzso is a zzso zzso virus harboring a highly structured internal zzso entry site zzso in the zzso zzso region of its zzso Important for initiating translation of viral zzso into zzso the zzso zzso is composed of zzso structures reminiscent of zzso precursors that may be targeted by the host zzso zzso zzso 

We report that zzso zzso can be recognized and processed into small zzso by the human zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, we identify zzso II, III and VI of zzso zzso as potential zzso for zzso in zzso However, maintenance of the functional integrity of the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso suggests that the structure of the zzso zzso abrogates its processing by zzso in zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso zzso may have evolved to adopt a structure or a cellular context that is zzso to zzso processing, which may contribute to viral escape of the host zzso zzso zzso
