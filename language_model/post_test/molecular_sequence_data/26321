zzso belongs to the diverse zzso family of intermediate filament zzso each member of which is expressed in a zzso and zzso regulated zzso The existence of zzso filaments has been documented in zzso eggs, and early zzso of zzso zzso but the role of these zzso components remains zzso To investigate the functions of zzso during early development in zzso we induced the zzso of zzso and deletion zzso zzso in most of the cells of zzso by injecting synthetic zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso lacking most of the zzso head piece, assembled into normal appearing filaments in zzso zzso zzso of the fourth zzso rod domain were assembly incompetent and zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso when both types of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso of at least a tenfold excess of zzso or zzso zzso within cells of zzso did not lead to any zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that the presence and proper regulation of zzso expression is not essential during the initial stages of zzso in zzso
