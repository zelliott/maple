zzso disease zzso is one of the most common inherited zzso and is a genetically and clinically zzso disorder with variable inheritance zzso As several molecules have been reported to have therapeutic effects on zzso depending on the underlying genetic causes, exact genetic zzso have become very important for executing personalized zzso zzso sequencing has recently been introduced as an available method to identify rare or novel genetic defects from genetic zzso zzso CMT is a model disease to apply zzso sequencing because more than 50 genes zzso are involved in its development with weak zzso zzso This study performed the zzso sequencing in 25 unrelated CMT patients who revealed neither zzso zzso nor several major CMT zzso This study identified eight zzso zzso zzso zzso This detection rate seems rather high because each sample was tested before the study for major genetic zzso zzso this study suggests that the zzso sequencing can be a highly zzso zzso and economical molecular diagnostic tool for CMT patients who are tested for major genetic zzso
