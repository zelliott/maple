zzso anemia zzso is a complex disease involving nine identified and two unidentified zzso that define a network essential for maintaining zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso network is zzso in zzso zzso we cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso clones zzso to all nine cloned zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and identified zzso in the zzso database for the zzso zzso zzso zzso organization of zzso and zzso was nearly identical between zzso and human for all genes zzso zzso plots revealed conservation of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regions identified functionally important zzso since many zzso acid zzso zzso in human disease zzso or shown to be critical in targeted zzso studies are identical in zzso and zzso Comparative zzso analysis demonstrated zzso zzso for all zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso gene network has remained intact since the last common zzso of zzso and human zzso The application of powerful zzso zzso and zzso zzso make zzso a useful model for discovering zzso gene functions, identifying new genes in the network, and identifying therapeutic zzso
