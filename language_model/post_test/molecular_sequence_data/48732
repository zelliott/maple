zzso are fundamental to zzso ranging from oceans to humans, yet our ability to study them is zzso by the lack of ecologically relevant zzso resulting in zzso dominating zzso zzso Here we present zzso from 31 zzso infecting multiple strains of the aquatic zzso zzso zzso zzso to provide data for an underrepresented and environmentally abundant bacterial zzso Comparative zzso delineated 12 zzso groups that zzso each represent a new zzso and zzso represent one novel and four well-known viral zzso This diversity contrasts the few well-studied marine zzso systems, but parallels the diversity of zzso infecting zzso zzso Although all 12 zzso zzso represent new zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso up to twice as large as those previously observed for each zzso zzso zzso novelty was also substantial, requiring experimental zzso zzso to identify zzso of the structural zzso The presence of uncommon zzso metabolism genes in four zzso likely underscores the importance of scavenging zzso molecules as previously seen for zzso in marine zzso zzso recruitment analyses suggest that these particular zzso zzso are rare and may represent a first glimpse into the zzso side of the rare zzso However, these analyses also revealed that these zzso zzso are zzso occurring in zzso of 137 investigated zzso Together, this diverse and novel collection of zzso identifies a small but ubiquitous fraction of unknown marine viral diversity and provides numerous environmentally relevant zzso systems for experimental hypothesis zzso
