To investigate the function of a basic and neutral zzso acid zzso protein zzso which is a candidate gene for zzso we zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso Patient 1 is a compound zzso with zzso in the zzso gene causing a zzso transition at zzso acid zzso and a zzso transition at zzso acid zzso who inherited these zzso from his mother zzso and father zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso into zzso decreased transport activity to zzso and zzso of control zzso transport activity in zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso into zzso strongly decreased zzso acid transport activity to zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not decrease transport zzso Furthermore, zzso studies have demonstrated that the reduction of zzso acid transport is not due to a decrease in the amount of zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso in the zzso gene are crucial zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso experiments suggest that zzso may function as a transport zzso or regulatory zzso by zzso or zzso complex zzso
