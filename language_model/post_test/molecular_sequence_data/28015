zzso from a human zzso containing four atoms of zzso zzso zzso was zzso with Na zzso and zzso in zzso to achieve a net addition of either 2 or zzso atoms of zzso After zzso by high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso peptides from zzso zzso were zzso zzso characterized by zzso acid distribution, and localized within zzso primary structure based upon the published zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The addition of 2 atoms of zzso of zzso produced zzso at five principal sites, with no zzso zzso The addition of zzso atoms zzso the same sites more zzso produced zzso at 10 additional sites, and formed zzso at 5 zzso After addition of 2 atoms of zzso zzso 24 and zzso of zzso zzso while zzso zzso had zzso but with zzso added atoms of zzso zzso 24 had more of the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso Since zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso early but did not form the inner rings of zzso they are attractive candidates for donors of outer zzso zzso The sequences around the zzso fall into three consensus groups, as zzso 1) zzso associated with synthesis of zzso zzso 24, zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2) zzso associated with synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and 3) zzso 7 of the remaining 8 zzso occur in this zzso and we found zzso incorporation at each place this sequence appears in the zzso zzso zzso has been found at zzso of most of these sites in zzso of other zzso We conclude that the primary structure of zzso and particularly these consensus zzso have a major role in the formation of zzso hormones and their zzso zzso
