Green fluorescent protein zzso and its zzso have become valuable tools in molecular zzso zzso has been regarded as a very stable and rigid protein with the zzso shielding the zzso from the zzso Here, we report the zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso studies on the green fluorescent protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation studies of zzso show that most of the zzso of zzso is rigid on the zzso to zzso time zzso For several regions, including the first zzso and zzso 3, 7, 8, and 10, increased zzso exchange rates suggest a substantial zzso flexibility on the zzso to zzso time zzso zzso of zzso 148 located in zzso 7 is known to have a strong impact on the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso not only reduces the zzso of the zzso zzso state but also affects the zzso stability, leading to the appearance of doubled backbone zzso zzso for a number of zzso This suggests the presence of two zzso in slow exchange on the zzso time scale in this zzso
