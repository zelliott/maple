Laboratory zzso have been carried out to artificially zzso insect larvae of the birch zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso sugar beet zzso zzso Schmidt and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of some zzso species of the zzso zzso From among four species tested on insects only zzso zzso zzso infected about zzso of zzso zzso larvae, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso Brady et Hall, zzso zzso zzso Liu et zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso did not affect insect zzso Only single eggs of the zzso zzso were infected by zzso zzso in the laboratory trials, whereas its larvae remained zzso No infection cases of the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso and sugar beet zzso eggs were zzso Comparisons of zzso sequences of the investigated strains with zzso data showed no differences between zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of ITS 2 with the sequence characteristic only for zzso zzso was zzso Two cluster analyses indicated close similarity of this species to zzso zzso as sister zzso but the latter appeared more zzso zzso and zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso close to specialized zzso pathogen zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a separate sister zzso zzso zzso does not show remarkable relations to the establishment of aforementioned zzso zzso considerations on the zzso biology and DNA sequencing of investigated zzso species state their identification more precisely and facilitate the establishment of systematic zzso
