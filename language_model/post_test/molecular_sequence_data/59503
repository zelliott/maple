zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and genetically zzso zzso In some families, the disease is linked to the zzso locus on zzso zzso in which the cardiac zzso T gene zzso has been identified as the disease zzso The zzso found in this gene appear to be associated with incomplete zzso and poor zzso Because zzso hot spots offer unique possibilities for analysis of zzso zzso new zzso zzso that could define such hot spots in zzso were looked for in unrelated French families with familial zzso zzso 

Family members were zzso with zzso markers to detect linkage to the four known disease zzso In family zzso analyses showed linkage to zzso zzso To accurately position potential zzso on zzso its partial zzso organization was zzso zzso for zzso was performed by zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso A new zzso zzso zzso was identified in affected members of family zzso because of a zzso zzso located in the 10th zzso of the zzso zzso of this new zzso is zzso zzso data show a wide range of zzso and there was no sudden cardiac death in this zzso 

The zzso 102 of the zzso gene is a putative zzso hot spot in familial zzso zzso and is associated with zzso zzso Analysis of more zzso carrying zzso in this zzso is necessary to better characterize the clinical and zzso implications of zzso zzso
