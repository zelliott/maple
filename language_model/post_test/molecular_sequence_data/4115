zzso an effective method for zzso differential display, was employed to compare the gene expression in developing zzso between the male sterile and fertile plants of cotton zzso zzso zzso zzso Dong zzso In the zzso stage, there were more differential bands of zzso than that in the zzso zzso Among 64 differential fragments produced by zzso three were randomly selected for further zzso zzso dot zzso showed that the zzso transcript was expressed mainly in floral zzso on the other hand, the zzso and zzso transcripts were present specifically in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was highly similar to the plant zzso factor zzso while zzso and zzso were shown no significant similar to any sequences in the available zzso
