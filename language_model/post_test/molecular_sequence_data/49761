The zzso zzso protein zzso I and IV zzso and zzso are closely related by primary sequence and predicted to have similar zzso zzso based on zzso zzso We identified a zzso of zzso that is a zzso of both zzso and through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso release sequencing, established that zzso and zzso zzso completely different zzso The zzso site, zzso zzso fits the expected consensus whereas the zzso site, zzso zzso is zzso To compare zzso zzso preferences more generally, we employed a zzso display technique that allowed comparison of complex cell extracts zzso by each zzso in a rapid in zzso zzso thereby demonstrating zzso preferences that overlapped but were clearly zzso To validate this approach, one of the proteins labeled in this zzso was identified by zzso as zzso zzso as a zzso zzso and examined as a zzso for both zzso and zzso Again, zzso and zzso were different, this time in zzso and zzso of the zzso sites, with zzso preferring zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso the two sites zzso These differences in zzso zzso emphasize the need to consider these protein zzso independently despite their close zzso
