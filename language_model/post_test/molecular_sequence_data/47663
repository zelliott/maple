Four zzso cassette (ABC) zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso defects in zzso cause the neurodegenerative disorder zzso zzso zzso By comparative Northern zzso analyses we found each of the four zzso zzso ABC zzso zzso species at maximum abundance only in a few zzso which differed for each family zzso The four genes were also regulated zzso during mouse brain development: zzso zzso was most abundant in embryonic brain and gradually decreased during zzso zzso and zzso zzso accumulated in the early zzso zzso and the amount of zzso transcript increased slightly during the second and third zzso zzso The different expression patterns could explain why zzso is defective in zzso although zzso and zzso can replace zzso functionally in zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso and zzso zzso but strongly increased expression of the zzso and zzso genes in mouse zzso However, in zzso zzso mice zzso treatment increased zzso gene expression also in the brain, suggesting that the zzso zzso restricts entry of zzso to the brain at the zzso zzso Analysis of the promoter sequences revealed a cryptic nuclear hormone zzso response element of the zzso type in the zzso promoter and a novel zzso sequence motif present only in the zzso zzso DNA of the zzso and zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene uses a single zzso start site but alternative zzso zzso These data are of importance for the use of zzso mice as a model in pharmacological gene therapy zzso
