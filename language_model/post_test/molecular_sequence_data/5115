zzso production of zzso zzso has been described in several human and zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell line is derived from an zzso zzso An zzso zzso production due to the zzso of one zzso zzso has been previously described zzso et zzso zzso However, the exact mechanism leading to the zzso zzso of the abnormal zzso gene was zzso In this study, we show that this zzso expression results from a deletion within zzso zzso The zzso gene in the abnormal zzso is under the control of the zzso zzso zzso gene promoter and the expressed zzso results from the fusion of the non coding zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso gene to a truncated zzso zzso 1 zzso This resulting abnormal zzso allows the expression of a normal zzso zzso
