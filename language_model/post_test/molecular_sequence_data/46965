zzso zzso zzso are broadly applied in gene therapy zzso However, zzso gene transfer has limitations in zzso One of these is the low gene transfer rate into zzso other than the liver after systemic intravenous zzso zzso Local direct injection into the target organ has been used as one possible solution, but increases necessary equipment and methodology and is traumatic to the zzso zzso zzso infection as well as zzso gene transfer depends on virus interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus attachment to the cell surface, and on interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus entry into the zzso In order to assess the zzso potential of different zzso to act as zzso targets, we have therefore determined zzso and zzso expression in multiple zzso from different zzso In addition, we have newly determined several human, zzso pig and dog zzso zzso zzso comparison and structural analyses of known and of newly determined sequences suggests a potential zzso binding site between zzso acids 29 and 128 of the zzso With respect to the virus zzso expression patterns we found that zzso expression was extremely variable between different zzso with the highest levels in the liver, whereas zzso expression was far more zzso among different zzso Both zzso and zzso showed similar expression patterns among different zzso There was no zzso however, between the zzso expression patterns after zzso zzso and zzso root injection, respectively, and the virus zzso zzso In zzso many zzso carry both receptors required to make them potential zzso zzso In sharp contrast, their actual targeting clearly indicates that zzso zzso expression is necessary but not sufficient for zzso transfer after systemic zzso The apparently very important role of anatomical zzso in particular the zzso requires close attention when developing zzso zzso gene therapy zzso
