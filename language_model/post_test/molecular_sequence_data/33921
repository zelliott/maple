The zzso zzso zzso are important participants in the degradation process of zzso zzso for several bacterial zzso However, their expression status during degrading zzso is still zzso In order to study this expression process, we isolated a novel zzso bacterial strain, zzso its zzso gene cluster and examined the expression of the zzso gene at different zzso of zzso zzso The expression of zzso increased slightly at zzso zzso zzso and was significantly zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso could not be detected in the total zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is actively involved in the zzso process, but zzso has lost its activity in this bacterial zzso
