zzso is essential for regulating the extent, zzso and specificity of cellular responses to zzso such as zzso and zzso Here we describe the solution structure of zzso the first structure determined for any zzso zzso in complex with a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso The structure of the complex shows that seven zzso zzso form a predominantly zzso binding zzso zzso outside the zzso zzso domain are important for zzso zzso in particular, a single 15 zzso alpha zzso immediately zzso to the zzso domain makes direct contacts with the zzso binding loop and, in part, determines its zzso The zzso domain itself is remarkable in that it contains a 35 zzso zzso zzso motif zzso that is not required for zzso zzso The zzso motif increases zzso turnover and affects its degradation pathway, zzso that it has an important regulatory role inside the zzso
