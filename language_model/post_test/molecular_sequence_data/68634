An empirical function was used to calculate free energy change zzso zzso of complex formation between the following zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso zzso and zzso turkey zzso 3rd domain zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the potato zzso inhibitor with the zzso zzso and the barely zzso inhibitor and zzso with zzso and zzso Using X-ray coordinates of the nine complexes, we estimated the contributions that zzso effect, zzso interactions and zzso zzso zzso make towards the stability of the zzso The calculated delta G values showed good agreement with the zzso measured ones, the only exception being the zzso complex whose X-ray structure was solved at an exceptionally low zzso In complexes with different zzso the same inhibitor zzso contributed zzso towards complex formation zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso to zzso The most productive zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were found in analogous positions on their respective binding zzso thus, our calculations identified a functional zzso motif that parallels the well-known structural similarity of the binding zzso The delta G values calculated for zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were similar and close to the experimental delta G value of the zzso complex zzso zzso lending support to the suggestion that the zzso difference in the observed zzso zzso of these two complexes reflects the energetic cost of zzso changes induced in zzso during the zzso stages of complex zzso In almost all of the complexes zzso the stabilization free energy contributed by the zzso was larger than that donated by the zzso In the zzso complex, the calculated delta G contribution of the zzso group from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was somewhat higher than that arrived at in experiments with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso In zzso different binding loop zzso are known to affect differently the binding zzso delta zzso to zzso and zzso zzso a good qualitative agreement was found between the calculated delta zzso estimates and the experimental delta delta G data zzso zzso zzso Large variations were observed in local surface zzso and related zzso volume in the two zzso complexes (by 20 to zzso for some zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
