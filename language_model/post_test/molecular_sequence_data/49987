Human zzso zzso zzso is an zzso inflammatory disorder leading to gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as the zzso in both human disease and experimental zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso significantly contributed to current knowledge of human zzso but to what extent zzso mimics zzso is still zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso are yet zzso This study aimed to identify the zzso zzso recognized by gastric T cell clones from zzso patients, to define their zzso zzso usage and zzso zzso zzso Sixteen zzso zzso gastric T cell clones of four zzso patients were tested for proliferation to overlapping zzso peptides spanning the a and beta chains of zzso We identified 6 zzso in the a chain and 5 in the beta zzso zzso zzso usage was not zzso Four zzso of the 11 zzso zzso recognized in zzso were found to overlap with zzso that are relevant in zzso including a previously described zzso zzso zzso T cell recognition of the zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest a striking similarity between human zzso and zzso at the zzso level, with regard to zzso zzso and likely also with regard to zzso zzso
