The results of a preliminary trial are reported in which the diagnostic value of a zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso of the zzso zzso was compared with that of currently recommended zzso These methods were microscopic examination of zzso zzso in zzso culture of both patient zzso and zzso an in zzso culture of zzso zzso following zzso with patient zzso The tests were performed on zzso of Colombian patients with zzso or with zzso zzso The outcome of this trial was that zzso was consistently more sensitive than any of the four currently recommended methods of diagnosis, an gave results much faster than the three zzso zzso Clinical specificity did not match the absolute specificity obtained in the laboratory when tested against zzso zzso from various zzso zzso This is thought to be due to the small sample size and to possible zzso presence of the zzso in the zzso The results nevertheless show that, given a more extensive trial directed at clinical zzso zzso can provide the means for early and rapid diagnosis of zzso This should reduce morbidity and treatment zzso Further improvements to the method, its introduction in endemic settings and its possible further clinical uses are also zzso
