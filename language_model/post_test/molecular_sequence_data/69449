Over zzso transgenic families of zzso zzso produced following seed transformation with zzso zzso were screened for embryonic zzso zzso and pattern zzso One hundred and zzso zzso with a wide range of zzso abnormalities were zzso zzso zzso appear from genetic studies to be zzso zzso of the 115 zzso examined in zzso zzso with visible markers demonstrated that zzso genes were randomly distributed throughout the zzso Seven zzso families appeared to contain zzso zzso because the zzso genes exhibited linkage to visible markers on two different zzso zzso zzso may therefore be widespread following seed zzso DNA gel zzso zzso with 34 zzso zzso and three zzso zzso revealed a wide range of zzso zzso Models of zzso structure at each zzso locus were constructed to facilitate gene zzso The value of such models was demonstrated by using zzso rescue to clone zzso plant DNA from four zzso zzso Further analysis of genes isolated from these zzso zzso should help to zzso the relationship between gene function and plant zzso
