The zzso zzso zzso zzso lives in zzso habitat of both zzso and zzso zones along the coasts of the northwestern zzso An zzso zzso survey (five zzso zzso was combined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso on 17 populations to trace back past colonization pathways from the actual population structure of the zzso Both genetic markers display a sharp genetic break between zzso zzso I) and zzso populations zzso zzso This break zzso to an zzso frequency inversion at three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a deep divergence of about zzso in zzso sequences between most of the zzso populations and other zzso The geographic distribution of zzso I seems to be more restricted than zzso S as it is absent from the zzso of the eastern English Channel and North Sea and may be replaced by zzso S in south zzso zzso previously published rates of zzso divergence between the two zzso is estimated to zzso 5 million years ago and may be due to zzso zzso processes at the zzso zzso The occurrence of putative hybrids in a few zzso however, suggests incomplete cryptic zzso with secondary contact zzso The relative importance of colonization history zzso habitat specialization are discussed in the light of neutral evolution as tested from zzso gene zzso While differential selection seems to have contributed little to the separation of the zzso it may have played a role in the emergence of zzso zzso in the hybrid zzso Furthermore, zzso spatial patterns of differentiation were observed in both zzso suggesting a recent increase in population zzso These findings are in agreement with a recent expansion of the populations during or after the formation of the English Channel, from a southern refuge for the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso may have persisted further zzso As previously suspected for a species with a very short zzso zzso phase, contemporary gene flow between distant or adjacent populations appears to be extremely reduced or even zzso
