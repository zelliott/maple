The zzso family is a growing group of proteins with a zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso We zzso a new member of this family with zzso activity from the plasma of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing followed by zzso sequencing revealed that the protein was composed of 212 zzso acids including a signal zzso of 20 zzso zzso The gene expression analysis by zzso showed that the gene was transcribed in the liver, stomach and zzso The zzso gene expression was zzso within 3 h of an zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso zzso placed the 23 zzso protein in the same cluster as other fish zzso zzso proteins including a zzso protein of rainbow trout and zzso protein of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso of zzso were located on the neighboring zzso Though the zzso activity has yet to be ascribed to the zzso domain, these findings, together with former findings on zzso activity of zzso and human zzso indicate that zzso activity is relatively common among the zzso zzso
