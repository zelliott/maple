All zzso zzso have in common the presence in their zzso domain of several zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso L and S previously demonstrated their involvement in the binding of donor and zzso zzso The region comprised between the zzso S and VS contains a stretch of four highly zzso zzso with the following consensus sequence zzso zzso letters and zzso letters indicate a strong or low occurrence of the zzso acid, zzso The functional importance of these zzso and of the zzso zzso of motif VS zzso was assessed using as a template the human zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso of the new zzso and zzso of the VS zzso are essential for activity since their substitution by zzso yielded inactive zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important zzso role mainly attributable to the aromatic zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso retained significant zzso activity zzso of the wild zzso zzso analyses and zzso binding zzso showed that none of the zzso tested had any significant effect in zzso donor zzso Instead the zzso proteins were affected in their binding to the zzso and/or demonstrated lower zzso zzso Although the human zzso I has four zzso attachment sites in its zzso domain that are potentially zzso none of them was shown to be necessary for zzso zzso However, zzso appears to contribute to the proper folding and trafficking of the zzso
