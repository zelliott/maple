The zzso DNA region encompassing the zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso II zzso genes of two Malaysian blow fly species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso This region, which spans zzso and includes the zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso was zzso from adult fly and zzso zzso and zzso zzso variations were observed at zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso while sequence divergence between the two species was recorded at a minimum of 141 out of zzso sites zzso zzso obtained in this study are comparable to published data, and thus support the use of DNA sequence to facilitate and complement zzso species zzso
