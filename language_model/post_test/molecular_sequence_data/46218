zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are the most common zzso of zzso zzso zzso living in a symbiotic partnership known to be highly susceptible to environmental changes such as zzso zzso In this study, we identified members of two major heat shock proteins zzso families, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with full-length sequences that showed the highest similarity and evolutionary relationship with other known zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was examined in samples of the zzso coral zzso zzso subjected to elevated temperatures progressively over zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to severe heat stress at zzso and zzso zzso and zzso above average sea zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso gene expression from zzso to zzso while extreme heat stress zzso reduced zzso transcript abundance by zzso (after zzso and zzso (after zzso zzso temperatures decreased an zzso expression under both rapid and gradual heat stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression patterns were observed in zzso cultures and in zzso indicating their independent regulation from the zzso zzso gene expression profiles observed for zzso and zzso suggests diverse roles of these molecular zzso during heat stress zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene under heat stress can indicate a reduced role in zzso the heat shock zzso factor which may lead to zzso of zzso genes and heat zzso
