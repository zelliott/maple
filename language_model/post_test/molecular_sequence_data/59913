Chemical synthesis and high resolution zzso studies are reported for the zzso zzso and constituent structures that occur as terminal elements of zzso zzso cell surface zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso type zzso in which beta zzso replaces beta Gal were zzso from zzso zzso utilizing zzso and zzso zzso zzso The unique zzso zzso that caps the structure was introduced to selectively protected zzso and zzso zzso zzso by utilizing an zzso silver zzso catalyst and a zzso zzso In separate reactions not only were the principal targets obtained but also the corresponding zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso showed that at the site of the zzso zzso structure, specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possess zzso wide zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso that represents the native zzso zzso exhibited only narrow line zzso (3 zzso zzso Since zzso derived distance constraints for the zzso zzso structure were not consistent with the existence of unusual zzso zzso the origin of the limited number of wide lines was attributed to local rigidity in the zzso zzso at the site of zzso zzso
