A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family, designated zzso was cloned during a search for zzso genes using a zzso cell genetic approach in T cell zzso The zzso gene encodes a type II membrane protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35 zzso Its zzso domain is most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an immediate early gene zzso by zzso stimulation and is controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso is most highly expressed in zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso and is abundantly expressed in T cells but not in B zzso zzso of the mouse zzso to a human zzso library yielded the human zzso which encodes a protein zzso identical to the mouse zzso Human zzso was mapped to zzso zzso while mouse zzso was located to the portion of mouse zzso 14 zzso with human zzso zzso A zzso soluble form of zzso composed of the entire zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in T cells but not in zzso B cells or in bone zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a role for this zzso zzso in the regulation of the T zzso immune zzso
