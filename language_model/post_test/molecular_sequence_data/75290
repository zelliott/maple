The zzso clones for rat zzso C zzso having the nearly complete length were isolated from a rat brain zzso library and zzso The zzso sequence of zzso a zzso clone having the largest zzso zzso indicates that the zzso is composed of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso C deduced from a possible open reading frame was composed of 362 zzso having a relative molecular mass of zzso excluding the initiating zzso one zzso acid shorter than zzso A and zzso The length of zzso c zzso was 1750 zzso somewhat longer than that of the zzso A and B zzso The zzso C zzso was distributed mainly in the brain, some in zzso zzso and fetal zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of rat zzso C with those for rat zzso A and B zzso et zzso zzso Gene 39, zzso zzso et zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been determined zzso shows the existence of highly zzso stretches of zzso acid among the three zzso forms throughout their zzso The extent of the zzso between zzso A and C is zzso while those between zzso A and B, and B and C are zzso zzso The analysis of zzso acid substitution among zzso A, B and C from several species suggests that the zzso genes zzso much earlier than animal species appeared and that the zzso C gene has evolved from the zzso A gene after zzso A and B genes zzso
