In a systematic study of the zzso folding of zzso fragments in zzso coli, we have zzso the expression of an zzso and previously zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model system and converted it to a functional zzso Introduction of heavy chain framework zzso previously found to improve the folding of a related zzso led to improved folding of zzso fragments and improved physiology of the host zzso zzso zzso of the zzso determining regions zzso of the zzso forms of zzso further improved folding and bacterial host zzso but no improvement was seen in the wild type, suggesting the existence of a hierarchy in sequence positions leading to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso light chain led to the production of functional zzso fragments for the first time, with increased levels of functional protein produced from zzso manipulated zzso We propose that a zzso analysis of the primary zzso acid zzso as we have zzso provides guidelines on how correctly zzso functional zzso might be achieved and will allow further zzso of the decisive structural factors and pathways zzso protein zzso
