zzso of the 54 proteins of the zzso coli zzso interact directly with the zzso but the zzso binding sites of only a very few proteins are zzso We present a method zzso of random zzso zzso zzso that can identify the minimal binding region for proteins within zzso complexes such as the zzso The power of the method is exemplified with the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso sequences are identified for both proteins and characterized by zzso zzso Surprisingly, the binding region of zzso a zzso zzso zzso of domain I of zzso zzso can simultaneously and independently bind zzso one of the two assembly zzso proteins of the large zzso
