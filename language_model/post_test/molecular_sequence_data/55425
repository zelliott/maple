A number of human activities result in environmental contamination with copper compounds that can cause severe zzso effects on the zzso as well as human zzso The zzso methods of metal detection have limitations such as inability to distinguish between total versus zzso metals and differences in metal zzso in different zzso The heavy metal zzso genetic systems of certain bacteria provide critical tools for development of zzso for these zzso This study reports a copper zzso utilizing the cop zzso of the heavy metal resistant bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from a contaminated site in zzso A section located between the zzso transcribed putative response regulator gene zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso that included a zzso cop box was identified as a zzso promoter using a zzso reporter zzso zzso in zzso zzso The expression was found to be enhanced by inclusion of zzso Another engineered strain, zzso showed stronger zzso and the zzso expression in both backgrounds was enhanced significantly zzso zzso by copper but minimally by other zzso The construct in zzso zzso zzso thus has a high potential as zzso for detecting copper zzso zzso potential zzso in a soil bacterial background, while the construct in zzso coli is ideal for zzso zzso
