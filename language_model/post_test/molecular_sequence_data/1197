zzso zzso zzso tumor protein zzso is frequently zzso in various types of human cancer, including zzso zzso and gastric zzso Cancer cells with zzso zzso acquire zzso zzso such as selective growth advantage, zzso instability, resistance to zzso and promotion of zzso zzso partial zzso isolated from zzso zzso immortalized zzso is derived from one of zzso zzso Here, we identified and characterized the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein 5) gene corresponding to zzso partial zzso by using zzso zzso zzso was the representative human zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of 23 zzso was located at human zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in human zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso mouse zzso zzso with multiple zzso due to retention of zzso zzso Complete coding sequence of mouse zzso zzso was determined by assembling zzso positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso gene was located at mouse zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso showing zzso zzso identity, were zzso proteins with zzso and zzso tails facing the zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was identified as a novel member of the zzso family based on membrane zzso and zzso zzso This is the first report on the human zzso and mouse zzso zzso
