Mobile zzso elements are among the primary drivers of the evolution of zzso zzso For zzso zzso point zzso zzso zzso zzso deleterious effects of zzso by mutating zzso DNA during zzso In this study we identify five zzso species from the zzso fungus zzso zzso and report the signature pattern of zzso acting in a zzso manner on 21 of 35 unique zzso copies, providing the first evidence for sexual zzso for this zzso zzso analysis of zzso populations of the zzso zzso showed repeated rounds of zzso zzso acting on different copies of the zzso In the zzso zzso population, there were multiple zzso of zzso primarily attributed to zzso zzso This study supports the view that the sequence zzso of zzso populations in zzso zzso reflects the activities of evolutionary processes that fall outside of typical zzso or population genetic zzso
