zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO production by zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in vascular zzso zzso The zzso zzso influx is a major zzso influx zzso in zzso cells including zzso cells and it has been reported to play a role in the zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso Recent studies have identified zzso interaction zzso 1 zzso to function as a sensor of the store site zzso content, thereby regulating the zzso zzso zzso However, the functional role of zzso in the zzso zzso influx and NO production in zzso cells still remains to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso to evaluate the zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso and NO production, respectively, in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with small interfering zzso zzso targeted to zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso expression and the zzso zzso zzso The degree of suppression of the zzso expression correlated well to the degree of suppression of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was associated with a substantial zzso of the zzso influx and a partial reduction of the NO production induced by zzso The zzso zzso influx exhibited the similar sensitivity toward the zzso influx zzso to that seen with the zzso zzso zzso The present study provides the first evidence that zzso plays a critical role in the zzso zzso influx and zzso component of the NO production in zzso zzso
