We have identified two distinct sequence elements in the mouse alpha zzso collagen promoter which are protected from zzso I zzso by the binding of factors present in crude nuclear extracts of zzso zzso zzso Small substitution zzso were introduced into these promoter elements and shown by the gel zzso zzso mobility zzso and zzso I protection zzso to decrease or eliminate factor binding to the zzso element but not to the remaining zzso element, indicating that two distinct factors recognize these separate promoter zzso Region A appears to bind a factor related to the zzso zzso whereas the factor binding to region B remains as yet zzso zzso of either region decreased the activity of the alpha zzso collagen promoter in DNA zzso zzso by about zzso for the A region zzso between - 122 and - zzso and about zzso for the B region zzso between zzso and zzso These results indicate that regions A and B in the mouse alpha zzso collagen promoter are positive zzso zzso independently binding two distinct zzso zzso
