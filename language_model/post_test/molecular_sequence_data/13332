We investigated the profiles of zzso zzso expression in muscle in 15 cases of inflammatory zzso zzso (5 each of zzso inclusion body zzso and zzso and in 10 controls (5 of zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso Expressions of the predominantly T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso as well as zzso that can be of either T cell or zzso origin zzso colony stimulating factor zzso and transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso 1) and zzso zzso were monitored by the reverse zzso zzso The expression of T cell zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso was generally weak or zzso zzso zzso expression was consistently moderate to strong in zzso but generally weak or absent in the other zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso for zzso alpha and zzso beta was weak or absent in all zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in 12 of 15 IM cases and faint or weak expression in 5 of 10 zzso Very strong zzso expression was zzso but only on zzso zzso in 12 of 15 cases of IM but in none of the zzso zzso was expressed only zzso or zzso In contrast to the variable expression of several of the above mentioned zzso zzso all IM specimens strongly expressed zzso 1 zzso and 12 of 15 strongly expressed zzso 2 zzso Thus, with the exception of zzso expression in zzso a similar pattern of zzso zzso expression exists in the different types of zzso Moreover, this pattern resembles that detected in zzso and zzso controls, although expression is generally weaker in the zzso zzso The findings suggest that in IM muscle a sustained zzso of zzso by T cells or of zzso by zzso is not a prerequisite for operation of the immune zzso response and that muscle may not be the site of ongoing zzso
