The resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso and kinetic properties of six zzso zzso have been zzso Five of the zzso are of the form zzso zzso where X is zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The sixth intermediate is zzso zzso Throughout the series there is an approximately zzso variation in zzso the rate constant for zzso and a zzso variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso structure correlations allow us to define the zzso angles in the zzso zzso zzso of the functioning zzso The values of these angles for each bound zzso appear to be very similar, with the zzso assuming a zzso zzso such that the nitrogen atom of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso atom of zzso For each zzso the zzso zzso zzso angle is approximately zzso degrees, whereas for the zzso zzso angle the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C alpha hydrogen zzso atoms are approximately zzso The three zzso with the lowest zzso rate constants, zzso zzso zzso or zzso have zzso zzso zzso in that they show a feature of medium intensity in the zzso zzso This band is sensitive to zzso to zzso exchange of the zzso zzso zzso zzso function and, thus, the corresponding mode involves an excursion of the zzso zzso It is hypothesized that the high intensity is due to a particularly strong interaction between the zzso zzso nitrogen atom and the zzso zzso of zzso which also has the effect of zzso zzso because the nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso contact has to be broken in the zzso zzso
