Over a decade ago, genetic studies identified a family of small integral membrane zzso commonly referred to as copper zzso zzso that are both required and sufficient for cellular copper zzso in a zzso genetic zzso zzso We recently used electron zzso to determine a projection density map of the human high affinity zzso zzso embedded into a zzso zzso At 6 A resolution, this first glimpse of the structure revealed that zzso is zzso and possesses the type of zzso symmetry that traditionally has been associated with the structure of certain zzso channels such as zzso or gap junction zzso Representative for this particular type of architecture, a region of low protein density at the center of the zzso is consistent with the existence of a copper permeable pore along the center zzso axis of the zzso In this contribution, we will briefly discuss how recent zzso studies correlate with the projection density map, and provide a perspective with respect to the cellular zzso of other transition zzso
