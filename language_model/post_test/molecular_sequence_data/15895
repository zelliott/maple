The absolutely zzso zzso box within zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso serves an indispensable role in zzso zzso We show in this report that rather short zzso sequences inserted into the zzso zzso gene zzso immediately 3' to the zzso box block the second but not the first zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso sequence inserted some 23 zzso 3' of the zzso box did not affect correct and efficient zzso The data suggest that hairpin structures that might form adjacent to the zzso sequence interfere with some necessary zzso of the zzso required for 3' zzso zzso and zzso zzso
