The set of zzso in zzso coli zzso which facilitate zzso by zzso zzso zzso has been defined zzso et zzso (1992), zzso zzso 11, zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso acceptance on a zzso zzso we constructed zzso zzso with the set of zzso recognition zzso These zzso were examined for zzso in zzso with zzso and also with zzso zzso zzso to correlate gains in zzso acceptance with losses of zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition elements in only the zzso stem or zzso loop of zzso improved the specificity constant zzso for zzso by zzso However, the introduction of all defined zzso recognition elements in zzso resulted in a zzso with a specificity constant zzso below that for zzso of zzso Including the zzso framework of zzso (in addition to the zzso recognition zzso in the zzso context further improved zzso by zzso but the specificity was still reduced compared with that of zzso The increase in zzso acceptance was correlated for all zzso with a decrease in zzso zzso indicating that zzso also recognizes zzso stem and zzso sequences in zzso zzso The inability to completely convert zzso to zzso acceptance with these zzso suggests that zzso contains zzso to zzso zzso The analysis of these zzso with both zzso revealed that there is a strong element of discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso associated with the zzso To test this zzso zzso of both zzso were made to effect zzso switches to the possible zzso and zzso zzso The kinetic evaluation of the zzso switch zzso suggests that overlap in zzso recognition is avoided through specificity for the third zzso position coupled with divergent preferences for the zzso zzso
