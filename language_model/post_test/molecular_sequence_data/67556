The most common cause of invasive zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso disease zzso is zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso other zzso rarely cause the zzso Here we review two clinical cases of fatal zzso in zzso patients and describe a new zzso agent of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Unlike typical zzso caused by zzso zzso the disease caused by the new species was chronic and spread from the lung to multiple adjacent zzso zzso characteristics and the zzso relationship with other zzso based on the sequence analysis of zzso zzso and zzso indicated that the new species, which we named as zzso zzso belongs to zzso section zzso The species has a higher zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso and causes more chronic infection in zzso mice than zzso zzso This is the first report documenting zzso in zzso patients caused by a species belonging to the zzso section zzso that is inherently resistant to zzso and zzso zzso Unlike the results seen with many members of zzso section zzso zzso was not detected in zzso of cultures grown in various zzso Our zzso and genetic characterization of the new species and the case reports will assist future diagnosis of infection caused by zzso zzso and lead to more appropriate patient zzso
