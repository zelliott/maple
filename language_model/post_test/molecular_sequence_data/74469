zzso bat zzso zzso is a known zzso for European bat zzso type 2 zzso An appreciation of the potential for zzso spread and disease risk requires an understanding of the zzso of the primary host, and any large-scale geographical barriers that may impede gene zzso The spatial pattern of zzso and zzso DNA variation was examined to zzso patterns of zzso of bats among 35 populations across zzso DNA sequence variation at the zzso control region and zzso genes revealed two distinct zzso zzso with generally zzso geographical zzso except for a small number of populations where both zzso were found in zzso Such zzso suggests that Scotland was zzso twice following the retreat of the zzso ice sheet with little subsequent zzso zzso However, eight zzso zzso showed low levels of genetic divergence among zzso even between populations from the two distinct zzso DNA zzso An overall, zzso genetic zzso pattern was observed, with high levels of gene flow among local zzso Apparently contrasting patterns of zzso and zzso divergence at different scales could be explained by zzso differences in gene flow at large zzso
