As a step toward identifying the zzso genes for zzso zzso disease type I zzso and other disorders mapped to the zzso locus on zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso of 450 zzso covering markers zzso and performed zzso zzso We isolated 22 distinct zzso including 6 zzso derived from two known genes zzso and zzso Among 16 novel zzso 2 zzso matched with human expressed sequence tags zzso and 7 zzso showed zzso at predicted zzso acid sequence level with proteins from other zzso These 16 zzso were mapped back to the zzso zzso 12 of which were confirmed for their expression by zzso chain reaction zzso screening of human zzso libraries of various zzso These zzso sequences and a transcript map will aid for isolation of corresponding genes which will be identified as candidate genes involved in the zzso of disorders mapped to the zzso zzso
