zzso chain reaction amplification of several zzso genes has been used to study the population biology of zzso zzso S zzso is particularly suitable for such studies, but difficulties in the amplification of this gene have precluded its zzso Here we describe a simple method for the amplification of S zzso and show why previous attempts may have been zzso Data are presented from both laboratory and field zzso
