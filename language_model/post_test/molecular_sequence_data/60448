In contrast to zzso zzso zzso which retains the zzso of the zzso in the product, T4 zzso zzso is an zzso zzso The substitution zzso zzso zzso however, converts zzso from an zzso to a retaining zzso It is shown here that the zzso zzso His zzso is also a zzso Indeed, the zzso reaction can be more effective than zzso In contrast, zzso zzso has no zzso zzso zzso The results support the prior hypothesis that zzso by the zzso zzso His zzso proceeds via a zzso zzso Further zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso mechanism of this zzso requires zzso as a general acid but zzso is not zzso The results help provide an overall rationalization for the activity of zzso in which a highly zzso acid group zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of the zzso acts as a zzso zzso whereas zzso in the placement and chemical identity of zzso on the zzso of the zzso can lead to zzso with or without retention of the zzso to zzso activity, or to the formation of a stable zzso zzso
