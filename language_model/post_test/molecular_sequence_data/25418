zzso of the zzso zzso group II zzso zzso has been zzso by chemical modification of the in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso Computer calculations of the zzso secondary structure through zzso of free energy were also performed in order to study zzso properties of the zzso and to relate these to data obtained from chemical zzso zzso of the two sets of data with the current zzso model structure of the zzso zzso reveals close agreement, thus lending strong support for the existence of a typical group II zzso core structure zzso six zzso zzso zzso Local discrepancies between the experimental data and the model structures have been analyzed by reference to zzso properties of the zzso This shows that use of the latest refined set of free energy values improves the structure calculation zzso
