We report the identification of a zzso named zzso zzso a novel G zzso zzso zzso A customized search procedure of a database of expressed sequence tags zzso retrieved a human zzso sequence that partially zzso a zzso A zzso DNA zzso identical to the zzso was obtained and used to screen a library to isolate the full-length coding region of the zzso This gene was zzso in its open reading frame, and zzso a zzso of 402 zzso zzso and shared zzso zzso acid identity in the zzso zzso regions to the five known human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in human brain regions, including the zzso and zzso zzso in the rat was highest in brain, followed by heart, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells failed to show specific binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso A repeat zzso of the form zzso was discovered in the zzso region zzso of the gene and zzso was mapped to zzso 22, zzso
