The first evidence of zzso presence and its zzso with zzso in the compartment involved in zzso zzso zzso is zzso We identified zzso by zzso Western zzso and zzso in zzso and electron zzso The partial zzso which we have designated zzso and zzso are zzso zzso long, zzso identical to one another and zzso the zzso and middle zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences contain all three zzso zzso zzso motifs and show zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso generated against the cloned zzso domain revealed zzso association with zzso containing zzso the marker of zzso zzso In Western zzso a strong zzso zzso of approximately 116 zzso which seems to be zzso was accompanied by a faint one of approximately 90 zzso in zzso fraction zzso zzso level was correlated with zzso of zzso and it was significantly decreased upon zzso of this zzso zzso labeling in electron zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso in coated pits and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso with 2 different zzso against zzso zzso was identified by zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso exists in this evolutionary ancient zzso
