In zzso eggs of the zzso zzso zzso embryonic cells are arrested at zzso zzso The ability to undertake cell division is resumed in the course of zzso termination caused by such a treatment as zzso to 5 degrees zzso As an initial trial to investigate the relationship between zzso and embryonic cell zzso we have cloned and zzso two zzso zzso zzso two distinct zzso zzso protein zzso One zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein which had all of the zzso characteristic of other zzso zzso The other zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein that was most similar to zzso and human zzso protein zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis was carried out to examine levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso of zzso zzso The result demonstrated that the zzso level of zzso zzso appeared to zzso to the activity of zzso division in zzso eggs, and that the zzso profile in the level of zzso zzso was somewhat different from that of zzso zzso zzso
