We have studied the effect of zzso zzso acids on the expression of zzso for the immediate early genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in isolated cortical zzso The expression of the different genes was induced by 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not induce the expression of any of the genes zzso The effect of zzso stimulation was not inhibited by the zzso zzso or by withdrawal of external zzso In contrast the zzso effect was abolished by zzso but not by the removal of external zzso However, elevated zzso induced zzso only when calcium was present in the external zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso lack zzso receptors and that the induction of genes by zzso and zzso is in part independent of the presence of calcium in the external medium and may be zzso through second zzso zzso
