To investigate zzso V alpha gene expression in the Lewis rat model of experimental zzso zzso we obtained V alpha chain sequences from two V zzso zzso T cell zzso Two different V alpha zzso a V zzso gene and a V zzso zzso are zzso but both were found to contain an zzso repeat zzso sequence present in the V alpha zzso zzso This zzso motif is also present in the previously reported sequence of a zzso zzso zzso which zzso a different V zzso gene family zzso In further experiments, spinal zzso T cells were isolated at the onset of basic protein zzso disease and sorted for the zzso zzso marker, which we have previously used to enrich for specifically activated T zzso Analysis of V alpha expression in the zzso population revealed the biased use of three V alpha zzso V zzso V zzso and V zzso The zzso motif was present in the V alpha zzso region of V zzso V zzso and V zzso zzso derived from zzso spinal zzso T cells but found to be generally absent in the zzso spinal zzso zzso Since these zzso zzso V alpha chain sequences are nearly identical to those zzso by the zzso zzso clones zzso it is likely that these V alpha sequences are derived from zzso T cells in the spinal zzso Thus, we demonstrate that the zzso V alpha zzso motif is strongly associated with experimental zzso zzso in the Lewis rat and propose that it plays a role in zzso recognition of a specific zzso zzso zzso
