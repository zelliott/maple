zzso of proteins and small peptides play numerous zzso roles as hormones, zzso zzso and cellular signaling zzso The zzso are a group of small zzso peptides involved in processes such as zzso zzso zzso development, wound healing, tissue repair, and zzso Recent characterization of the beta zzso as zzso regulators in zzso led to our identification and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso possessed an zzso of 132 zzso zzso a protein of 44 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence shows high identity with another zzso zzso and has a characteristic zzso binding motif zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a close relationship with zzso zzso as well as its distinct identity and common ancestral zzso zzso analysis revealed a 3 zzso zzso structure similar to the other zzso In zzso promoter analysis also revealed significant zzso factor binding sites, providing evidence for the expression of this gene under different cellular conditions, including stress or zzso zzso zzso distribution profiling revealed a ubiquitous presence in all the examined zzso but with the highest expression in mantle and zzso zzso challenge with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso expression in zzso and zzso affirming an zzso role in zzso
