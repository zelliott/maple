Human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso 160 processing by host cell zzso is an essential step for viral fusion and zzso We have identified a rat liver zzso fraction which specifically processes zzso into zzso and zzso Using zzso of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity was associated with particles zzso at low zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso network, zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso Its density distribution was compatible with light zzso zzso derived from the zzso network zzso or to zzso but association with zzso was not supported by free flow zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been proposed as the major zzso processing zzso the rat liver zzso zzso processing activity was essentially resolved from zzso and only partially overlapped zzso These data suggest that zzso other than zzso and zzso presumably located in zzso zzso may participate in the zzso processing into zzso and zzso
