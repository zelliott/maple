The surface zzso zzso is highly zzso and zzso A zzso spanning the zzso region of the zzso is zzso and can induce protective immunity in mice against zzso major zzso We report here that the minimum length of the zzso zzso in this region is a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso 158 to zzso where H and E are consensus zzso zzso These two zzso determine the specificity of the zzso The next two zzso M and A are necessary for the zzso of the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso are recognized by the zzso zzso complex, while the two adjacent zzso are involved in the zzso presentation by the major zzso complex zzso zzso
