A zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple tissue northern zzso analysis revealed the presence of two zzso transcripts which were expressed only in the zzso zzso The transcripts were 1968 zzso or zzso zzso in length and resulted from the zzso of alternative zzso zzso The open reading frame of the cloned zzso encodes a protein composed of zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso which is similar to that of the zzso or zzso although it is not a member of either of these two classes of zzso A motif analysis revealed that the cloned zzso does not contain a consensus zzso domain because it lacks a critical zzso and zzso zzso at the appropriate zzso Since the cloned zzso is a new member of the zzso gene family and its expression appears limited to the zzso organ, we have named it zzso
