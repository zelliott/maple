In contrast to the human and mouse zzso in which the clusters of class I and class II zzso reside in close vicinity to one another, in the zzso zzso zzso they are found in different linkage zzso zzso walking using zzso zzso artificial zzso and zzso zzso artificial zzso clones reveals the zzso class I region to occupy a segment of approximately 450 zzso and to zzso at least 19 zzso These include three class I zzso zzso zzso five zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and one TAP binding protein zzso This arrangement contrasts with the arrangements found in human and mouse zzso in which the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso reside within the class II zzso In addition to this main zzso class I zzso a shorter zzso of about 150 zzso contains two additional class I zzso zzso and at least five other zzso It probably represents a different zzso of part of the class I zzso The previously identified zzso gene shares an identical zzso part with zzso but the two genes differ in their 3' zzso One of them is probably the result of an unequal crossing zzso The described organization has implications for the persistence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and interpretation of the origin of the zzso zzso zzso
