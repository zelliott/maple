Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso two different zzso zzso sequences have been isolated from a zzso library from growing zzso of zzso zzso An intriguing property of these two clones is the presence in their coding region of a repeated sequence which is highly zzso except for the number of zzso The corresponding genes of zzso and zzso zzso for proteins related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso during zzso growth, the transcript levels of both clones decrease when the growth of zzso is inhibited by several treatments and their expression increases when zzso resume zzso Furthermore, clones zzso and zzso are zzso and are only expressed in zzso zzso roots and stem zzso whose cells undergo zzso zzso Neither clone was found to be expressed in other zzso such as zzso leaves, flowers, pods and immature zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatments suggest that the processes in which the proteins zzso by zzso and zzso are involved are not zzso by these zzso
