zzso factors bearing a zzso zinc finger were thought to be confined to zzso but recent studies have suggested their presence also in zzso In this paper, we report the first complete functional characterization of the DNA binding domain present in the putative zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso from zzso zzso We demonstrate that in the single zinc binding motif present in the zzso protein the metal zzso is coordinated by two zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso separated by a shorter zzso with respect to the zzso classical zzso zzso The zzso zinc finger motif is essential for zzso DNA binding and is part of a larger DNA binding domain which includes four basic regions located on either side of the finger, one at the zzso and three at the zzso The one described here is a novel type of DNA binding domain containing a zzso zzso zinc finger motif which, by sequence zzso seems to be zzso in all the bacterial putative zinc finger proteins identified so zzso Interestingly, basic zzso acids have been shown to be important in stabilizing the DNA binding of zzso single zzso zinc finger zzso confirming that the zzso of DNA binding using a single zinc finger motif flanked by basic zzso is widespread throughout the living kingdom from zzso both animal and plant, to zzso even if in each kingdom it presents its zzso
