zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has been shown to be restricted to neural and neuroendocrine cell zzso In this paper, the structure and zzso sequence of the rat zzso gene coding regions and promoter is described and zzso The gene is divided into 3 zzso zzso a signal zzso the 29 zzso acid rat zzso and a 92 zzso acid extension zzso While the overall zzso structure is similar to that predicted from the sequence of the human zzso differences in zzso are zzso Several forms of the rat zzso zzso are found in brain: a zzso zzso form which zzso in both brain and gut primarily from a zzso promoter, and less abundant forms of about zzso zzso whose initiation sites are heterogeneous, located zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso zzso initiation site, and found only in spinal zzso and a subset of brain zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso of the human and rat promoter region sequences identifies regions of high similarity upstream from both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso initiation sites, which may be important in the cell zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
