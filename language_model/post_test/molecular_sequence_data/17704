This study investigated the ability of 6 putative zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso release from human zzso G cells maintained in culture for 48 zzso The zzso studied comprised different sequence changes based around a constant zzso sequence from the zzso of the zzso At zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso release zzso above zzso The remaining 4 zzso showed no zzso zzso After the addition of zzso of zzso zzso against a zzso concentration of zzso zzso the following levels of zzso were zzso analog 3, 90 zzso zzso analog 4, 95 zzso zzso analog 5, 99 zzso zzso and analog 6, 85 zzso zzso The 2 most effective zzso were analog 3, which was 9 zzso acids in length with zzso of two zzso zzso and a zzso bond zzso and analog 5, which was 8 zzso acids in length with a zzso zzso at the zzso and a single zzso substitution at the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso present on the human zzso G cells differs from that on guinea pig zzso cells and canine G cells, being less sensitive to zzso structural zzso
