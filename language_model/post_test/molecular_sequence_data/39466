The gene zzso the unique soluble zzso carrier protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been isolated by expression cloning in zzso zzso This zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso carrier protein zzso with fatty acids with chain lengths from C4 to zzso The gene (called zzso encodes a protein of 60 zzso a zzso version of which was readily expressed in zzso coli and zzso in large zzso Surprisingly, the sequence of the zzso protein was significantly more similar to that of an zzso zzso of the zzso related zzso zzso zzso than to that of the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso of zzso coli, an zzso that zzso the same reaction from a more closely related zzso Indeed, the zzso sequence can readily be modeled on the known crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with remarkably high levels of conservation of the zzso site zzso To test the possible role of zzso in the fatty zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene of the zzso was disrupted by zzso of a zzso cassette by zzso zzso The resulting zzso strains retained low levels of zzso carrier protein zzso consistent with prior indications of a second such activity in this zzso The zzso strains grew normally and had normal levels of zzso but were deficient in the incorporation of zzso zzso acid into the cellular zzso of zzso zzso particularly at low zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is responsible for a zzso and zzso zzso system that efficiently converts zzso fatty acids into zzso species competent to enter the fatty acid zzso zzso
