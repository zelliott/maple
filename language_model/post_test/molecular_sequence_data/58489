It was predicted from the zzso acid sequence of the bone anabolic zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso related protein zzso zzso that the zzso zzso acids form an zzso zzso zzso we zzso a model zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence in the zzso region of zzso obtaining zzso zzso zzso The anabolic activities of zzso and zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso at 80 zzso partially reversed zzso depletion zzso bone loss but was ineffective in the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso reversed loss at both sites and, at 80 zzso returned both zzso and cortical bone calcium to the level of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed significantly elevated bone formation rates over zzso zzso in both zzso and cortical zzso bone following treatment with zzso zzso zzso showed an increase in the relative surface area of zzso zzso covered by zzso in animals treated with zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso acids of zzso can be replaced by a model zzso zzso and that the new chemical entity has greater anabolic activity than the parent zzso The results suggest that zzso may be a candidate zzso for the treatment of human zzso
