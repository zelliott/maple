The zzso of a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The clone zzso zzso was 2,566 zzso long and zzso 395 zzso acids in a single open reading zzso zzso Southern zzso showed that zzso zzso is a single copy zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence can be aligned along its entire length with known insect zzso It shared common characteristics such as a signal zzso a zzso region, and a zzso domain with seven zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a single zzso zzso in zzso larvae, zzso and zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso region proper in early embryonic stages and in the embryonic zzso of zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso segments zzso zzso and all abdominal segments except the tenth segment zzso and zzso zzso The present results indicate that zzso zzso expression reflects the primary determination of embryonic zzso
