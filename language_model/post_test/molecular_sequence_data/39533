The common zzso zzso zzso is emerging as a promising alternative zzso model for transplantation and zzso zzso It is therefore important to establish a rapid and reliable method of confirming zzso between zzso zzso In this study of a large zzso colony zzso we zzso zzso zzso Class II genes zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time in this species, zzso zzso typing zzso zzso 2 was amplified using zzso zzso zzso specific for known zzso zzso and zzso using universal zzso sequencing zzso and dye zzso cycle zzso Twenty-six zzso involving zzso zzso 8 zzso and 5 zzso zzso were zzso Two new zzso zzso were zzso zzso we investigated whether matching at zzso zzso alone could accurately predict zzso zzso as assessed by mixed zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso isolated from fully and partially zzso and fully mismatched animal pairs were mixed and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso from fully or partially mismatched pairs exhibited significant T cell proliferation above single cell controls zzso Mixed zzso from fully zzso pairs exhibited no proliferation over controls zzso Thus using zzso zzso suitably zzso zzso pairs can be rapidly and accurately identified for use in further studies of cellular and solid organ zzso
