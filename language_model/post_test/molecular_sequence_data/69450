The zzso zzso 1 locus zzso of the zzso important zzso fungus zzso zzso was replaced in a zzso procedure by an expression cassette containing an zzso I zzso zzso under control of the zzso zzso zzso protein was missing from zzso of the zzso showing that targeting of the linear expression cassette to the zzso locus was zzso Studies of expression of the intact zzso cassette at the zzso locus revealed that zzso zzso is expressed from the zzso promoter as efficiently as zzso zzso Furthermore, a strain carrying two copies of the zzso expression cassette produced twice as much zzso I as the amount of zzso the major zzso zzso produced by the host zzso The level of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was about zzso higher than that found in the non transformed host strain, indicating that the zzso promoter is about 10 times stronger than the zzso zzso The zzso increase in the zzso zzso I zzso measured with an zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated well with the increase in zzso zzso
