zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso is under the control of the zzso regulator zzso Although previous studies have identified recognition sequences for zzso in several promoter regions, their structures have not been clearly zzso We show that the zzso binding sites within the zzso and zzso promoters consist of zzso repeats and suggest that zzso motifs may represent the recognition elements for zzso zzso
