zzso community structure and the chemical components in zzso caused by rotating brushes in an zzso zzso ditch were assessed in a Beijing municipal wastewater treatment zzso 

Air samples were collected at different distances from the zzso rotating zzso zzso zzso methods were used to characterize the community structure of the airborne bacteria in each sample regardless of cell zzso A clone library of zzso zzso directly amplified from air DNA of each sample was constructed and zzso to analyze the community composition and zzso zzso particles and zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso were analysis by a scanning electron microscope together with energy zzso X-ray zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In total, most of the identified bacteria were zzso The majority of sequences near the rotating brushes (the main source of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Complex patterns were observed for each sampling location, suggesting a highly diverse community structure, comparable to that found in water in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of SO zzso zzso , zzso of zzso zzso of NO zzso zzso , zzso of zzso zzso zzso , zzso of PO zzso zzso , zzso of NO zzso zzso , and elements of zzso zzso K, zzso Fe, zzso and P were detected from the air near the zzso zzso 

zzso in the structure of the bacterial communities and chemical components in the zzso observed between sampling sites indicated important zzso zzso The composition of zzso in water was one of the most important sources of bacterial communities in zzso Chemical components in zzso may provide a media for airborne zzso attachment, as well as a suitable zzso for their growth and survival in the zzso This study will be benefit for the zzso of pollution standards, especially for aerosols, that take into account plant workers' zzso
