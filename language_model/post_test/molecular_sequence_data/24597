When zzso with a zzso zzso protein zzso accessory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can function as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report on the structural zzso involved in selective AM binding that were examined using various zzso zzso and deletion zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso situated in the zzso zzso domain of human zzso zzso were crucial for selective zzso zzso zzso More detailed analysis showed that deletion of zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso production despite full cell surface expression of the zzso zzso and that deletion of zzso zzso zzso had a similar zzso There is little sequence identity between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso moreover, substituting zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso It thus seems unlikely that any one zzso acid zzso is responsible for determining selective AM binding or that AM binds directly to these zzso zzso Instead these findings suggest that the respective zzso acid sequences zzso selectivity either by directly contributing to the structure of zzso binding pocket or by zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso
