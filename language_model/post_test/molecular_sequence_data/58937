The primary zzso for zzso replication is the zzso zzso responsible for zzso the zzso strand of the zzso The only component of this zzso that has been identified in zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso strain defective for the zzso gene exhibits the same zzso zzso shorter zzso and a zzso zzso as a strain deleted for zzso suggesting that zzso encodes either a component of zzso or some other factor essential for zzso zzso We designed a zzso screen that led to the isolation of 22 zzso that display the same zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso mapped to four zzso groups: the previously identified zzso gene and three additional zzso called zzso zzso and zzso Cloning of the zzso gene demonstrated that it encodes a large, extremely basic novel protein with no motifs that provide clues as to zzso zzso analysis indicated that the four zzso genes function in the same zzso for zzso replication as defined by the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso genes zzso either components of zzso or factors that positively regulate zzso zzso
