zzso have several zzso zzso zzso These can be classified onto two groups: zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso followed by its zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso is produced by other microbial zzso The regulation of these mechanisms employs both positive and negative elements ensuring expression of the relevant genes only when they are absolutely zzso zzso zzso in induced in response to iron zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso transport systems is not only regulated by iron availability but also requires the presence of their zzso zzso The investigation of these regulation systems in three different zzso species gave similar results consisting of regulatory elements new to the field of iron zzso These elements are superimposed upon the regulation by the zzso zzso which in other bacteria directly regulate the expression of the zzso genes in response to iron zzso
