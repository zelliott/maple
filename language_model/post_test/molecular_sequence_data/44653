The fruit of zzso zzso a zzso relative of zzso showed an increased rate of zzso in response to the application of zzso zzso Moreover, late in zzso the fruit produced a burst of zzso zzso Thus zzso is zzso and there is a clear zzso separation of zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso protection zzso were used to monitor transcript levels of zzso zzso genes during fruit development and zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso correlated with increased transcript levels for three different zzso zzso zzso genes and for the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of an zzso zzso gene was not affected by zzso zzso However, zzso zzso transcript levels increased during subsequent zzso production by the fruit, consistent with this being the control step for the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts increased significantly both prior to and during zzso zzso production, while only one of the three SAM zzso transcripts was induced during the late zzso zzso We propose that the regulation of SAM zzso transcripts by zzso may occur as part of the zzso salvage zzso
