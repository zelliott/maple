The serum deprivation response gene zzso alias zzso has been previously isolated for its high zzso expression in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso such regulation is not observed in zzso transformed zzso cells after serum zzso More recently zzso has been identified as a zzso of protein zzso C zzso this interaction determines the zzso of zzso to zzso a plasma membrane zzso of which zzso is a major zzso Lack of zzso interaction in transformed cells has been proposed to be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of the human zzso zzso zzso symbol zzso and its mapping to zzso in the human zzso In zzso with the zzso system, zzso zzso expression is increased when human zzso are serum zzso it becomes zzso during zzso zzso zzso but it is not induced in cells arrested by contact zzso Analysis of zzso expression in human zzso reveals a near ubiquitous zzso with highest levels found in heart and zzso We show that human zzso encodes zzso a previously characterized zzso protein zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to specifically bind zzso in the absence of zzso zzso is zzso to two genes in the zzso one of which, zzso is similarly regulated during growth arrest and encodes a zzso protein that is a zzso of zzso
