zzso and zzso proteins play important roles in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso protein sorting protein 1) is involved in zzso zzso as cells deleted for the zzso gene contain reduced numbers of enlarged zzso What relationship zzso has with zzso remains zzso Here we show that zzso interacts with zzso a zzso that acts as a shuttling zzso for zzso membrane proteins or as a zzso assisting the zzso of proteins at the zzso zzso zzso contains two putative zzso recognition sequences at zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso of the first (but not the zzso sequence results in reduced numbers of enlarged zzso in cells, as in zzso zzso zzso of either sequence has no effect on zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso zzso functions of zzso are separate and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso at position 516 of zzso abrogates zzso binding and gives the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso to the nucleus does not affect the normal cellular distribution of zzso in the zzso and in zzso structures that are not zzso suggesting that zzso does not function in targeting zzso to zzso zzso zzso showed that a fraction of zzso is associated with zzso and that deletion or zzso of the first zzso recognition sequence abrogates this zzso Our results are consistent with zzso acting as a zzso to stabilize the association of zzso with zzso and not as a zzso involved in targeting zzso to zzso
