zzso particles are central to numerous cellular zzso but their study in zzso is often complicated by zzso and zzso We describe a new technique to characterize these complexes trapped as homogeneous species in a zzso zzso Using this technique, in conjunction with zzso zzso analysis, we identify the zzso site and zzso folding states of zzso P zzso zzso an zzso zzso that, in zzso requires a protein zzso to catalyze the zzso maturation of precursor transfer zzso zzso Our results show that the protein binds to a patch of zzso zzso structure adjacent to the active site and influences the zzso of the zzso near the zzso zzso The data are consistent with a role of the protein in zzso recognition and support a new model of the zzso that is based on a recently solved crystal structure of zzso P zzso
