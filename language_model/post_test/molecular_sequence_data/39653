Live virus vaccines provide significant protection against many zzso human and animal diseases, but zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso has reduced zzso Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a model, we engineered a different zzso regulatory circuit and isolated zzso zzso The zzso network allowed for efficient expression of the viral transcripts and zzso and the zzso viruses zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso were then constructed that contained zzso of the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso reflecting zzso viruses that might occur in zzso Although viable viruses could readily be isolated from zzso and zzso zzso containing homogeneous zzso zzso zzso that contained mixed regulatory networks were zzso zzso because viable zzso viruses were not zzso zzso mixed regulatory circuits promoted inefficient zzso zzso from inappropriate start sites, resulting in truncated zzso and effectively minimize viral structural protein zzso Engineering regulatory zzso circuits of zzso zzso successfully introduces genetic traps into a viral zzso that are lethal in zzso zzso progeny zzso
