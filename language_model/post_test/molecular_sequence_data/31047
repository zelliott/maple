A zzso method, adapted from that of Angel et zzso zzso 10), for sequencing sugar zzso in partially zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso is zzso zzso selection provides sequence information by directing fragmentation exclusively to both sides of zzso oxygen atoms and, in the case of opened rings, between zzso carbon and ring oxygen zzso zzso or zzso are subjected to sequential zzso zzso zzso reduction, and zzso The zzso zzso are then subjected to partial degradation, zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso data obtained on model compounds, using zzso alcohol as zzso for zzso demonstrated direction of fragmentation to both sides of the zzso oxygen atom in zzso zzso and to both sides of the zzso oxygen atoms in oxidized zzso zzso linkage and sequence may thus be determined by observing fragmentation from both the reducing and zzso ends of the zzso Two zzso zzso zzso by this zzso were partially zzso and then zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso derivatives by zzso demonstrated the zzso of the technique for sequencing zzso quantities of zzso zzso
