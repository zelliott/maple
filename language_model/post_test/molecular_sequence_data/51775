The zzso acid sequence of the first of a family of insect zzso peptides from the tobacco zzso zzso zzso has been determined using a combination of zzso degradation zzso and mass zzso This zzso contains 9 zzso acid zzso and an observed mass for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso There are two zzso at positions 3 and 9 forming a zzso bridge and the zzso is zzso The structure of this zzso zzso is identical to a zzso recently isolated from zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso and we propose that this zzso be named zzso zzso
