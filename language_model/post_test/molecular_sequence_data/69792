A large satellite zzso of zzso zzso named zzso is always found associated with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus, isolate zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso to which no function has previously been zzso zzso zzso clones of zzso were zzso in the zzso and 3' zzso regions and in the zzso open reading zzso The ability of transcripts obtained from these clones to be zzso was investigated by zzso infection in the presence of a helper zzso We demonstrate that the zzso and 3' zzso regions as well as the zzso zzso protein are essential for replication of the zzso satellite zzso Our results suggest that two zzso regions located at the zzso and zzso of zzso and a zzso motif near the zzso zzso of zzso are probably involved in the replication of this zzso Analysis of the in zzso translation products from transcripts of zzso clones of different lengths indicates that the double band formed by zzso could result from zzso of a part of this zzso
