zzso distance zzso are essential for tracking zzso processes in a wide range of zzso zzso zzso The normally used zzso resonance energy transfer zzso ruler is not useful for investigating zzso properties when distances are more than 10 zzso Driven by this zzso we have developed a long-range zzso zzso zzso zzso optical ruler using zzso gold zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rigid zzso zzso serves as the zzso zzso Our experimental results show that one can tune the length of the zzso ruler between 8 and zzso zzso by choosing the size of the zzso gold zzso A possible mechanism for our observed zzso zzso phenomenon is discussed using the Gersten and zzso zzso Ultimately, our long-range zzso molecular rulers can be an important step toward understanding zzso biological zzso
