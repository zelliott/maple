The zzso zzso zzso family has been implicated in the process of a variety of diseases such as arthritis, zzso and tumor cell zzso To study the mechanisms of zzso action on zzso zzso we have constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso zzso sites in types I and II zzso The zzso incorporate either the zzso or the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso at the zzso and zzso bonds, respectively, analogous to the bonds zzso in corresponding native zzso Thus, the zzso contained all necessary information to direct zzso binding and zzso zzso investigations using the zzso zzso showed zzso by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso approximately zzso lower than for type I zzso The effect is caused primarily by relative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso more rapidly than zzso but zzso zzso occurred at distinct multiple zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that both can cleave a zzso zzso with a slightly higher zzso value for zzso We propose that the zzso domain of zzso is necessary for zzso whole, native collagen molecules but may not be necessary for binding to and zzso a zzso This proposal is consistent with the large distance between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso observed by three-dimensional structural analysis and supports previous suggestions that the features of the zzso domain contribute significantly toward zzso zzso
