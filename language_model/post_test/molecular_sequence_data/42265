Although the zzso zzso scanning mechanism can account for the zzso initiation of most zzso in zzso cells, several viral and cellular zzso contain zzso sequences in their zzso zzso regions that can mediate binding of zzso to the zzso regardless of the modification state of the zzso zzso During the past year, some nuclear proteins normally involved in zzso processing have been shown also to facilitate zzso zzso zzso Unexpected dual functions have, therefore, been suggested for these zzso zzso in both zzso zzso in the nucleus and zzso translation in the zzso
