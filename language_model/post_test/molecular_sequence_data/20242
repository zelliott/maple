The zzso pathogen zzso zzso causes soft rot diseases on a wide range of plants, including the model plant zzso zzso This zzso zzso in the host by zzso a set of zzso degrading zzso responsible for symptom zzso In addition, survival of this zzso in zzso requires two zzso iron acquisition systems zzso by zzso and protective systems against zzso damages, suggesting the implication by both partners of accurate mechanisms controlling their iron zzso under conditions of zzso In this review, we address this question and we show that zzso both from the pathogen and the host are subtly implicated in the control of this zzso
