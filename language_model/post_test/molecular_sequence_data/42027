An zzso growth factor zzso responsive zzso protein zzso has been zzso It recognizes with high affinity and specificity a specific zzso DNA sequence located in the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso element, determined by footprint analysis, is located from zzso to zzso zzso base pairs upstream from the major in zzso zzso initiation zzso The factor does not recognize the zzso DNA sequence or zzso DNA of the zzso zzso Three bands were observed by mobility shift zzso using nuclear extracts from normal human zzso zzso zzso followed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso showed one major band with molecular weight in the range of zzso to zzso The induction of zzso became evident 3 to 4 h after zzso stimulation and remained elevated as long as zzso was zzso zzso cells are devoid of zzso zzso and produce no zzso zzso gene transfer of zzso into zzso cells resulted in induction of zzso by zzso to levels comparable to those found in human zzso
