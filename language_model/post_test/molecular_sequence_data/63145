This study was aimed at the determination of the zzso and zzso zzso in native and heat-treated zzso h 1, a major zzso from zzso Both the zzso structure and the zzso structure of the zzso were zzso Under the in zzso conditions applied, zzso zzso h 1, either unheated or zzso was zzso by zzso at a lower rate than zzso zzso h zzso zzso with relatively high molecular masses were shown to be able to bind zzso whereas peptides with lower molecular masses zzso zzso did zzso In these latter zzso fragments of 15 previously published zzso of mature zzso h 1 were zzso As a result, these zzso are not likely responsible for the induction of systemic food allergic reactions to zzso Using sequential zzso zzso the zzso zzso peptides were deduced to contain the previously identified intact zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso The presence of four additional earlier published intact zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso peptides could be neither deduced nor ruled zzso The two deduced and four possible zzso zzso are all situated in the zzso part of zzso h 1, which does not show zzso with other zzso zzso zzso this unique zzso part of zzso h 1 is proposed to be responsible for the zzso ability to induce systemic allergic zzso
