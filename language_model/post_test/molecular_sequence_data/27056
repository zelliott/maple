zzso is the most important zzso disease in tropical and zzso zzso The viral envelope zzso protein is responsible for cell zzso binding and is the main target of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the diversity of the E protein gene of zzso E protein gene sequences of 20 new viruses isolated in zzso zzso Brazil, and zzso sequences retrieved from zzso were aligned for diversity and zzso zzso 

zzso of the E protein gene sequences revealed the presence of 47 variable sites distributed in the zzso most of those zzso acids changes are located on the viral zzso The zzso analysis showed the distribution of zzso in four zzso zzso I, II and III revealed internal groups that we have called lineages and zzso All zzso acids that characterize a group zzso zzso or zzso are located in the 47 variable sites of the E zzso 

Our results provide information about the most frequent zzso acid changes and diversity of the E protein of zzso
