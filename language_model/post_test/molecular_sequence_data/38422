Cell envelopes from the zzso zzso but zzso zzso rumen zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a major 42 zzso heat modifiable zzso A similarly sized protein was present in the envelopes of zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso extracted cell envelopes from zzso zzso zzso showed that they consisted primarily of the 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso produced against these envelopes zzso only with the 42 zzso major envelope proteins in both zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso indicating a conservation of zzso structure among each of the major envelope zzso The zzso of the 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso envelope protein shared significant zzso with the zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso as well as additional envelope proteins containing the cell surface binding region known as a surface zzso zzso zzso zzso Thin section analysis of zzso zzso extracted envelopes demonstrated the presence of an outer zzso zzso the cell wall, and a regularly ordered array was visible following zzso zzso through this zzso These findings suggest that the regularly ordered array may be composed of the 42 zzso major envelope zzso The 42 zzso protein has similarities with regularly ordered outer membrane proteins zzso reported in certain zzso and ancient zzso
