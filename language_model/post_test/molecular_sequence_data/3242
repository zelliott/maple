zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso in zzso and in zzso with an expression which is regulated in a variety of cells and zzso and may be modulated by a variety of external zzso To understand the molecular basis of the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we have analyzed the zzso region and zzso of the human zzso zzso The functional promoter and zzso elements were identified by zzso reporter zzso in transient zzso experiments using four different human zzso Although the location of the functional elements were shared among the different cells used, the activities for the zzso promoter zzso Further, cell zzso protein binding activities were observed by an zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso analysis with specific zzso and DNA sequence analysis identified the zzso domain zzso factor zzso as a candidate zzso regulator of the zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the promoter region of the zzso zzso a copy gene for zzso was nearly identical to that of the zzso zzso indicating a common regulatory mechanism for zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, the transcript of the zzso gene was zzso These results provided the first evidence for the functional promoter and candidate zzso factor for the zzso gene and zzso of the zzso zzso
