The zzso acid sequence of all but a few zzso zzso of the beta zzso of rat liver zzso zzso has been determined from zzso zzso zzso liver zzso is shown to contain 17 zzso acid differences from that reported for zzso of bovine heart, 2 differences of which involve differences in zzso This may account in part for the observation that bovine heart F1 binds zzso with much greater affinity than the rat liver zzso zzso liver zzso also contains zzso regions with another zzso binding zzso zzso zzso for which high-resolution structural studies are zzso zzso to one of these zzso regions is an eight zzso acid stretch which bears striking zzso to the zzso region of the zzso The combination of these two zzso regions may constitute at least part of a zzso binding domain in zzso zzso both rat liver and bovine heart beta contain these regions of zzso whereas the 17 zzso acid differences between the two zzso lie outside this zzso The possibility of a second zzso binding domain which differs between the two zzso is zzso A zzso clone containing all the regions of zzso as well as 11 of the 17 zzso acid differences between the bovine heart and rat liver beta zzso has been zzso into the bacterial expression zzso zzso After transformation of a zzso strain of zzso coli, this zzso clone is expressed as a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
