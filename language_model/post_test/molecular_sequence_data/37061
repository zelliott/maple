zzso interactions between the zzso and the zzso allow plants fine control over zzso zzso zzso rejection is among the most widespread and best understood of these zzso At least three plant families have zzso zzso zzso systems, and zzso have also been implicated in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso determine the specificity of zzso other genes are required for the zzso rejection system to zzso Progress is being made toward identifying these zzso zzso zzso first identified as a zzso factor that was required for zzso in zzso zzso has now been implicated in other species as zzso In addition, several zzso proteins bind to zzso in zzso One hypothesis is that zzso forms a complex with these proteins in zzso that is the active form of zzso in zzso zzso
