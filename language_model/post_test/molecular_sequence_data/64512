zzso species colonize a significant proportion of zzso populations worldwide and produce life-threatening infections in accidental zzso including zzso Complete zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparative analysis with the available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that despite overall genetic similarity there are significant structural differences, including a large zzso inversion and extensive variation in the number and distribution of zzso sequence zzso Genome sequence analysis zzso many of the novel aspects of zzso physiology relating to energy zzso oxygen zzso zzso signal zzso systems, and mechanisms of zzso A broad array of zzso regulation proteins and two new families of zzso zzso which contribute to host tissue colonization in the early steps of infection were zzso zzso in genes involved in the zzso of zzso O side chains between the zzso and zzso zzso were identified, offering an important starting point for the zzso of the zzso complex zzso surface zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso might be associated with the adaptation of zzso zzso and zzso to different animal zzso Hundreds of genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso outer membrane proteins were identified as candidates for development of vaccines for the prevention of zzso
