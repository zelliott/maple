We investigated the membrane zzso of zzso zzso a zzso membrane zzso on the zzso zzso In zzso cells, the first zzso segment zzso with weak zzso is inserted into the membrane in the zzso zzso The following zzso is inserted depending on zzso zzso has the same orientation as zzso In contrast to data from living cells, the full-length zzso and zzso fusion zzso were not inserted into the membrane in a zzso zzso zzso of a signal recognition particle did not improve zzso zzso When the zzso zzso segment was deleted, however, zzso and zzso were correctly zzso We concluded that the three zzso TM segments are inserted into the membrane dependent on the two zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso is likely to be an unconventional signal sequence that barely functions in zzso The zzso zzso segment zzso the signal function of the following zzso in zzso zzso
