The diversity and abundance of zzso zzso family 5 zzso were studied in the North Atlantic zzso This family was chosen because of the large number of available sequences from cultured bacteria, the variety of zzso it targets, and the high number of similar sequences in the zzso Sea environmental zzso zzso Three clone libraries of a zzso zzso were constructed from the Mid-Atlantic zzso and the eastern and western North Atlantic zzso The two North Atlantic Ocean libraries did not differ from each other but both were significantly less diverse than the Mid-Atlantic zzso zzso The abundance of zzso genes estimated by quantitative zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso in the eastern part of a zzso from Fort Pierce, Florida, to the zzso and in a depth profile, suggesting that the supply of zzso organic material selects for zzso bacteria in these zzso However, the data suggest that only zzso of all bacteria harbor the zzso zzso These and other data suggest that the zzso of zzso requires complicated zzso zzso
