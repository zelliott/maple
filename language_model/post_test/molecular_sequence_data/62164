Five zzso were detected in a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA library by zzso with a zzso product amplified from zzso representing a consensus of known zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses demonstrated that zzso 11 and 12 (but not zzso zzso extended the partially characterized gene cluster for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso transfer of the zzso zzso genes to zzso zzso gave zzso strains zzso and zzso each producing a similar series of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso groups replaced the zzso zzso of zzso zzso established that the principal zzso in the disrupted strains was the zzso zzso The sequence of zzso implicated the protein in zzso and involvement in zzso was zzso from zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso A role in generating the zzso zzso was supported by partial restoration of zzso zzso when a cloned copy of zzso was introduced in trans into zzso zzso of the zzso also indicated that zzso of zzso rather than a polar effect of the disruption on zzso expression had zzso with zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence resembled sequences of zzso zzso zzso transfer of zzso or zzso into zzso zzso zzso a zzso strain with a zzso mapped genetically to the zzso zzso gene zzso did not complement the zzso zzso suggesting that one or more genes in addition to zzso and zzso is needed to assemble the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect zzso production, and the products of zzso and zzso matched zzso zzso zzso proteins lacking plausible functions in zzso zzso Thus zzso appears to mark the downstream end of the gene zzso
