The known zzso that open the zzso ring, the zzso acid zzso have been confined almost exclusively to the kingdom zzso and are all zzso members of the rare zzso acid zzso protein zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain CA, was isolated from soil by enrichment zzso using zzso acid as the sole source of zzso A zzso approach identified a zzso zzso acid zzso gene composed of two zzso and one zzso The translated spliced sequence was 39 to zzso identical to previously characterized bacterial zzso acid zzso The sequence was used to generate a gene zzso for expression in zzso coli and zzso an zzso zzso zzso The protein was zzso by zzso affinity and zzso zzso The zzso protein was shown by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to produce zzso as the product, which spontaneously zzso to yield zzso and carbon zzso The protein was very narrow in zzso zzso showing activity only with zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid was an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso analysis identified genes with zzso in other zzso from the zzso that, if zzso are predicted to zzso proteins with zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso are most closely related to zzso acid zzso from zzso
