zzso signal zzso systems zzso are an important mechanism by which bacteria sense and respond to their zzso Although each zzso system appears to detect and respond to a specific zzso it is now evident that they do not always act independently of each zzso In this paper we present data indicating regulatory links between the zzso zzso system that zzso in the cellular response to zzso zzso and the essential zzso zzso system in zzso zzso We show that the zzso sensor zzso can activate the zzso response regulator during a zzso zzso stationary phase, and that this reaction occurs in the presence of the zzso zzso sensor zzso zzso of zzso by zzso also occurs in zzso albeit at a reduced zzso However, the zzso zzso does not zzso A second level of interaction between zzso and zzso is indicated by the fact that cells depleted for zzso have a severely deficient zzso zzso limitation response and that zzso can bind directly to the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso cells neither activate expression of zzso and zzso nor repress expression of the essential zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso This effect is specific to the zzso zzso limitation response because zzso zzso limitation responses can be initiated in zzso zzso
