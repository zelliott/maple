zzso stress zzso zzso of an zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in concert with zzso of the zzso zzso by a mechanism that is not zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mediates recovery of the zzso zzso following zzso zzso In this study, we have employed in zzso zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso activity is activated for the zzso recovery zzso via a zzso zzso zzso Our work also shows that zzso requires the zzso proteins zzso and zzso to promote efficient, polarized zzso zzso but that this requirement can be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso functions are also required for zzso recovery but, unlike for zzso and zzso these requirements cannot be zzso by zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso acts downstream of zzso and zzso and upstream of zzso to drive zzso recovery, possibly by zzso the zzso nucleation activity of the zzso
