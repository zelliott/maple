zzso in the zzso gene zzso ( zzso ) affect starch structure and its zzso zzso properties in useful ways, although the gene has not been characterized previously at the molecular zzso This study tested the hypothesis that zzso codes for starch zzso zzso zzso Two independent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso , were identified in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso locus that codes for zzso was compared between wild type plants and those zzso for either novel zzso Plants bearing zzso invariably contained a zzso zzso in zzso 3 of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso always contained a small zzso zzso in zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss or reduction in abundance of the zzso protein detected by zzso These data indicate that zzso codes for zzso and that zzso in this zzso is ultimately responsible for the altered zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso A specific starch zzso zzso among several identified in soluble zzso extracts was absent in zzso or zzso zzso indicating that zzso is active in the soluble phase during kernel zzso The immediate structural effect of the zzso zzso zzso was shown to be increased abundance of short zzso chains in zzso and a zzso decrease in intermediate length zzso similar to the effects of zzso zzso in other zzso
