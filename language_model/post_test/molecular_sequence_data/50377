A zzso strategy for amplifying putative receptors involved in zzso zzso was employed to isolate a member zzso of the zzso zzso zzso During development, the first cells that express zzso appear adjacent to the wall of the zzso zzso at embryonic day zzso The zzso zzso is uniquely expressed in a subset of zzso cells that have a characteristic bilateral symmetry in the adult zzso zzso This zzso and its specific pattern of expression may serve a functional role in odor coding or, zzso may play a role in the development of the zzso zzso
