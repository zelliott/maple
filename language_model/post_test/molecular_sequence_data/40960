The role of zzso zzso zzso zzso smaller than zzso such as zzso and zzso on the zzso of zzso a common zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso in marine zzso was studied in zzso using zzso A method to extract live zzso was developed and used in order to zzso manipulate zzso abundance and group zzso Higher zzso of zzso were found to significantly decrease zzso zzso Furthermore, a change in the bacterial community composition zzso using terminal restriction zzso length zzso was also observed in presence of higher zzso zzso as well as a lower number of zzso zzso zzso The reduced zzso of zzso and the altered bacterial community composition in the presence of increased zzso abundance is likely the result of zzso control by zzso This study shows that higher zzso of zzso can significantly decrease the microbial zzso of zzso such as zzso and also significantly modify the bacterial community composition in natural marine zzso
