zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso was used to investigate zzso zzso and zzso binding to bovine bone zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind 3 zzso zzso per zzso zzso There was also evidence for the presence of four additional metal binding zzso zzso increased the formation of the zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso to the same extent as zzso but did not induce the zzso of zzso zzso bound to a lesser extent than either zzso or zzso to zzso and, like zzso did not influence zzso Each zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso whereas zzso binding may occur zzso at sites other than zzso zzso This implies that the different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso complexes influence the tendency of zzso to form a zzso
