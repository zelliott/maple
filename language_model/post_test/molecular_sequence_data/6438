zzso zzso is a group of proteins recently renamed as the tear zzso These proteins were initially described as unique to zzso zzso The tissue distribution and zzso have never been thoroughly zzso 

The distribution of zzso tear zzso was studied in many human zzso and zzso by western zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso species of the same molecular weights were observed in western zzso lanes loaded with tears, zzso and protein extracts from the zzso and zzso von zzso zzso zzso and von zzso zzso contained tear zzso other human zzso and secretions, including other zzso zzso and taste zzso did zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso cells of zzso and von zzso zzso zzso tear zzso were present on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were concentrated in zzso zzso zzso in amounts commensurate with a regulated zzso 

zzso zzso are expressed and truncated similarly in zzso von zzso and zzso zzso but not at all in other human zzso zzso are expressed and zzso with zzso zzso are concentrated in zzso zzso in an amount consistent with a regulated zzso zzso
