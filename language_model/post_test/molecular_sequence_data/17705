The sequence of the zzso gene from zzso zzso was zzso It encodes the precursor to the zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which presents extensive zzso with the zzso protein from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The first third of zzso is the most zzso with zzso changes and strict identity between the signal zzso The last zzso contains five zzso segments where more than 50% of the zzso are changed with respect to zzso The three first variable segments are 8 to 14 zzso long and contain only zzso while the two more zzso ones are 24 and 29 zzso long and also include insertions and zzso It is remarkable that the variable segments zzso essentially to regions predicted to be zzso zzso on our zzso folding model for zzso they alternate with zzso predicted zzso zzso Four of the variable regions were predicted to be zzso zzso on the basis of genetic and zzso data, while one of them zzso zzso was predicted to be zzso on the sole basis of folding zzso The zzso protein from zzso zzso can substitute for the zzso protein from zzso coli for zzso binding and zzso but not for infection by any of the known zzso coli zzso using zzso for zzso A zzso zzso assumed to be responsible for zzso cell zzso by zzso is zzso in zzso suggesting that it could have a functional zzso The conservation of the binding and transport activity can be accounted for by the conservation of the regions known to be directly involved, namely the first third of the protein and a region corresponding to 352 to 374 of zzso The zzso resistance can be attributed to the zzso of the four zzso zzso previously identified as essential for zzso zzso These results, together with those obtained with zzso and zzso zzso directed against known zzso regions, strongly support the folding model presented for zzso and the idea that it can essentially be extended to zzso except perhaps for a region between zzso 155 and zzso We propose that the existence of variable regions is due zzso and perhaps only, to the local lack of structural constraints in the zzso The zzso region between zzso and the following zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso including one zzso zzso
