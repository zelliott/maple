We report the isolation and characterization of an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript of zzso is greatly increased in abundance when zzso zzso strains are starved for zzso zzso is also zzso when zzso cells are starved for zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso occurs when zzso cells are exposed to a carbon dioxide atmosphere, when they are shifted to higher temperatures or when they enter stationary zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene and the corresponding zzso acid sequence of its protein share no obvious zzso with any other known gene or protein and we have not found a zzso for zzso disruption zzso We speculate that expression of the zzso gene is regulated by one or several components of the zzso zzso pool and that its gene product has a function in stress-related responses of the zzso
