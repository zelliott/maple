C zzso is the zzso form of the zzso from the zzso precursor of the zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso was mapped by chemical modification in 1 M zzso zzso M zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso The results suggest the secondary structure is similar for all three zzso zzso melting zzso were also measured for C zzso in 1 M zzso and zzso and indicate the secondary structures have similar zzso under both zzso Computer predictions of secondary structure and stability are in good agreement with zzso The results suggest that many of the approximations used for computer prediction of secondary structure by free energy zzso are zzso
