zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor required for zzso differentiation and cartilage zzso We used a zzso zzso method based on Son of zzso zzso recruitment to screen a zzso zzso library and found that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso specifically with zzso Next we found that two consensus zzso zzso sites within zzso could be zzso by zzso in zzso and that zzso could be zzso by zzso in zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso but did not affect zzso of a zzso protein in which the two zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso were zzso Using a zzso zzso that specifically recognized zzso zzso at zzso zzso one of the two zzso zzso sites, we demonstrated that addition of zzso to zzso strongly increased the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso of mouse zzso hind legs showed that zzso zzso at zzso 211 was principally localized in the zzso zone of the growth plate, corresponding to the major site of expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso has previously been shown to effectively increase the zzso levels of zzso and other specific markers of zzso differentiation in culture, we then asked whether zzso zzso could zzso the activity of zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in culture increased the activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly, zzso of zzso increased the activity of this zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso consensus sites of zzso markedly decreased the zzso zzso of this zzso by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso in the consensus zzso zzso sites of zzso did not alter its nuclear zzso In zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in more efficient DNA zzso We conclude that zzso is a target of zzso signaling and that zzso of zzso by zzso enhances its zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso signaling is zzso by zzso our results support the hypothesis that zzso is a target of zzso signaling in the growth plate and that the increased activity of zzso might mediate the effect of zzso in maintaining the cells as zzso zzso
