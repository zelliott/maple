zzso in systemic levels of zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of distant organ injury after zzso Stress signals zzso from burn influence zzso activities of mouse zzso zzso zzso in various distant zzso The involvement of zzso pathways in the zzso regulation of zzso in the zzso was investigated in this zzso zzso harbors substantial numbers of tissue zzso a key zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso and wild type zzso mice after burn were subjected to zzso analysis of zzso zzso There was a substantial induction of 2 bands and a marked zzso of a band in zzso zzso mice compared to zzso mice after zzso zzso analysis of these zzso and zzso bands identified 3 new alternatively spliced and 2 defective zzso transcripts of zzso as well as novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso sharing the unique zzso sequences of these transcripts were mapped by surveying the entire zzso of zzso zzso In addition, coding zzso zzso regulatory zzso and adjacent cellular genes of these putative zzso were zzso The results from these studies suggest that zzso zzso signaling events play roles in the zzso regulation of certain zzso carrying unique zzso promoter zzso
