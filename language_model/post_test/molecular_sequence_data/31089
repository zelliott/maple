We propose that the generally accepted model of a single zzso zzso zzso binding to a center of symmetry in the natural zzso operator zzso et zzso 1988) is zzso We show here that the zzso zzso binds to a sequence whose center is located four base pairs either to the right or to the left of the central axis of symmetry that was previously zzso We show that: zzso the zzso used by zzso et zzso is not retarded by the zzso zzso in a mobility shift zzso under conditions wherein a shorter zzso carrying our consensus sequence is zzso zzso that zzso protection experiments on the full natural operator sequence and the short zzso protect similar patterns and zzso that by varying every base in the shorter zzso we can demonstrate an optimal sequence for zzso zzso zzso
