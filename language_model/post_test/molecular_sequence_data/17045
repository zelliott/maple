The ability to acquire iron in zzso is essential for most microbial zzso Here we show that zzso zzso does not have specific mechanisms for the zzso of host iron zzso However, it does have functional zzso iron zzso and reductive iron zzso systems, both of which are induced upon iron zzso zzso of reductive iron zzso by zzso of the high affinity iron zzso zzso has no effect on zzso in a zzso model of invasive zzso In striking contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the first committed step of zzso zzso zzso is absolutely essential for zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso Combined with the absence of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso these data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso represents a promising new target for the development of zzso zzso
