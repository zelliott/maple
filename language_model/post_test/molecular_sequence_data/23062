zzso which results from motor zzso defects in the central nervous system zzso is observed in numerous neurological conditions, including cerebral zzso stroke, spinal zzso injury, zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso and Parkinson zzso Mice with zzso in the zzso zzso gene exhibit severe zzso as their primary zzso Here we show that zzso zzso mice have much lower levels of zzso acid type A zzso receptors in their zzso particularly the lower motor zzso than do zzso mice, indicating that the zzso of the zzso is likely to be caused by deficits in zzso motor zzso zzso We cloned the responsible zzso trafficking zzso zzso binding 1 zzso and showed that its protein product interacts with zzso zzso Our data zzso zzso as a crucial regulator of zzso zzso zzso and underscore the importance of zzso mice as a model for studying the molecular zzso of zzso associated with human neurological zzso
