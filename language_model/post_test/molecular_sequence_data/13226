The recent demonstration of the occurrence in rat brain and other zzso zzso of zzso A zzso gene transcripts without associated zzso activity could be ascribed to the presence of a soluble zzso protein zzso This tissue zzso inhibitor zzso detected by the zzso of added bovine pancreatic zzso was zzso from rat zzso zzso were obtained by partial zzso of zzso zzso a protein of approximately 30 zzso and starting from their zzso a full-length zzso zzso a zzso acid protein containing three potential zzso sites was cloned from a zzso zzso Its identity with zzso was shown by expression in zzso coli of a zzso protein recognized by zzso raised against native zzso and display characteristic zzso zzso zzso appears as a hardly zzso zzso and potent inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso approximately 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso and inactive on various other zzso This pattern of selectivity might be attributable to a limited zzso of a zzso acid sequence with sequences within the zzso segments of zzso and zzso known to interact with zzso within their active zzso The widespread expression of zzso in a number of zzso zzso brain, zzso or zzso zzso and its apparently zzso zzso point to a rather general functional role, zzso in the control of zzso protein zzso
