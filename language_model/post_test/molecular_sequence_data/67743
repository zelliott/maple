zzso zzso is an important cause of gastrointestinal disease in animals and zzso In this study, we developed an zzso to detect RV group B zzso and characterized the zzso zzso gene segment detected in zzso zzso One hundred zzso three samples were tested for RV group A zzso zzso and C zzso by zzso and examined for zzso zzso using zzso A majority zzso of the samples had mixed RV infections and zzso of zzso were detected at a higher rate zzso than previously zzso zzso was identified in zzso of the 173 zzso An adapted zzso zzso was developed using previously published zzso and newly zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in 20 G zzso based on an zzso zzso identity zzso zzso Our results revealed a broad genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso has been the cause of zzso yet zzso disease in zzso
