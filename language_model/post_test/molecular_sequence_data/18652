zzso growing bacteria are rarely found in the wild, as zzso tend to spend most of their lifetime at stationary zzso Despite this general prevalence of zzso bacteria, they are as yet poorly zzso Our goal was to zzso study this phase by direct observation of single bacteria as they enter into stationary phase and by monitoring their activity over several days during growth zzso For this purpose, we devised an experimental procedure for starving single zzso coli bacteria in zzso devices and measured their activity by monitoring the production rate of fluorescent zzso When zzso acids were the sole carbon source, the production rate decreased by an order of magnitude upon entry into stationary zzso We found that, even while zzso bacteria continued to produce proteins at a surprisingly constant rate over several zzso Our identification of this newly observed period of constant activity in zzso cells, designated as constant activity stationary phase, makes possible the zzso of zzso that require constant protein expression over time, and are therefore difficult to perform under exponential growth zzso Moreover, we show that zzso protein expression bears no fitness cost on the regrowth of the population when zzso zzso Further characterization of constant activity stationary zzso phase where zzso bacteria can be zzso studied over several days in a zzso zzso contribute to a better understanding of this ubiquitous but overlooked zzso state of bacteria in zzso
