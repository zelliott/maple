A zzso approach for reducing the size of a zzso hormone, zzso zzso zzso zzso from 28 zzso to 15 while retaining high zzso is zzso zzso structural and functional analysis identified a zzso functional zzso for zzso binding and zzso most of which was placed onto a smaller ring zzso to zzso that was created by repositioning the zzso native zzso bond zzso to zzso High affinity was subsequently restored by zzso the remaining zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso that flanked the zzso structure were then deleted in zzso and affinity losses were zzso by additional zzso zzso Thus, structural and functional data on hormones, coupled with zzso display methods, can be used to shrink the hormones to zzso more zzso to zzso zzso
