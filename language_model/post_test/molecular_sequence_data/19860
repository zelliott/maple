Most zzso zzso zzso express a zzso outer membrane protein of 453 zzso designated zzso which has been previously shown to mediate binding to zzso human lung zzso Here, it is reported that two distinct zzso of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso protein specify zzso zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli to demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso are important for attachment to zzso cells, and database searches indicated that zzso acids zzso resemble an adhesive motif found in zzso proteins termed zzso 3 repeat zzso Cellular zzso zzso zzso using zzso proteins demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso specify adhesive zzso Furthermore, these zzso revealed that a zzso protein encompassing zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso The two zzso zzso of zzso were further defined to zzso acids zzso and zzso by utilizing a zzso system, which was constructed from the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to express foreign peptides on the surface of zzso zzso
