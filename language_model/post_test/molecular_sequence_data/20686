zzso is the main blood sugar of insects, and the zzso zzso is involved in energy metabolism and controlling zzso levels in zzso Two forms zzso and zzso of zzso and the corresponding genes zzso and zzso were identified from the brown zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso contain zzso signature zzso and zzso contains a putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity and gene zzso level at different zzso zzso or following application of zzso zzso suggests that zzso and zzso zzso a soluble zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity accounted for the majority of total zzso activity in zzso zzso Only soluble zzso activity and zzso zzso level could be induced by zzso Additionally, only soluble zzso activity was significantly higher in zzso individuals than in zzso zzso These results indicate that only soluble zzso is zzso expressed between zzso and zzso individuals and is more responsive to hormone zzso
