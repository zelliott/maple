zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a clinically and genetically zzso group of neurodegenerative zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene are responsible for approximately zzso of zzso dominant zzso zzso and zzso of sporadic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were screened in 11 zzso families and 11 sporadic cases by direct sequencing and zzso zzso Novel zzso were detected in 100 healthy controls by zzso 

zzso We identified seven different zzso zzso in five zzso and one sporadic zzso Two of seven zzso were zzso The zzso was a zzso zzso but the effect of zzso zzso remained zzso 

zzso This study allowed us to estimate the frequency of the zzso zzso in Chinese at zzso zzso in families with zzso and zzso zzso in sporadic zzso In addition, our data showed zzso was not associated with zzso zzso zzso
