A new approach for direct identification and characterization of zzso zzso stocks in biological samples was tested for field zzso on an extensive sample of feces collected from zzso zzso from four different species found in zzso The first step of the technique is zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the zzso region of zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this report, 345 zzso samples were analyzed and the zzso results were compared with microscopic zzso For zzso zzso the principal zzso zzso both techniques were in zzso zzso of the zzso For the three other species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso samples were all negative by microscopic examination whereas zzso results showed several zzso zzso insects in each zzso The second step of the procedure is the characterization of the zzso zzso clones by means of zzso of the zzso products with zzso zzso generated by the zzso We used two zzso corresponding to major clones circulating in high frequency in Bolivia (as shown by previous population genetic studies using zzso zzso We obtained four primary zzso 1) we confirm the importance of two major clones in Bolivia in two distinct zzso 2) we report high rates of mixed infections (multiple clones in a single zzso in zzso zzso up to zzso and zzso in zzso and La zzso departments, zzso 3) the results favor the absence of interaction between different zzso and 4) we find, for the first time, evidence of the major clones circulating in three species of zzso that are known as mainly zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
