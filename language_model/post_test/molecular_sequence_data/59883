The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and identified as an zzso counterpart of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso The zzso gene comprised zzso zzso zzso zzso including the initiation zzso and a molecular mass of zzso Da was predicted for the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso zzso The size of the transcript, together with the presence of a zzso zzso structure, suggests that zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso plasmids carrying zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in specific zzso zzso complex activity and expression of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 136 zzso in good agreement with the predicted size of the zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso protein shows strong sequence similarity to zzso from other zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso extension not found in previously reported zzso The zzso acid sequence of this extension shows similarity to that of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso complexes and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso It suggests that the zzso zzso zzso gene might zzso a novel zzso protein with zzso and zzso zzso
