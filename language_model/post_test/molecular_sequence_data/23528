In response to brief synaptic stimulation that activates protein zzso A zzso the bag cell zzso of zzso trigger the onset of zzso behaviors by generating a prolonged zzso In juvenile animals, such zzso are inhibited by a high density of zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, zzso by the zzso zzso An increase in this current also follows an zzso in mature animals, contributing to a subsequent zzso state that limits zzso zzso Using a bag cell zzso library, we have isolated two alternative transcripts of the zzso zzso differing in the presence zzso or absence zzso of a consensus zzso site for zzso zzso of either zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells produced zzso - and zzso channels with zzso and zzso properties matching those in bag cell zzso The zzso zzso however, in their response to application of the zzso zzso of zzso which reduced the open probability of zzso an effect that was reversed by a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on zzso By zzso we determined that the zzso zzso zzso is present in adult, but not zzso bag cell zzso zzso clamp recordings from adult and juvenile bag cell zzso confirmed that zzso decreases BK channel activity only in zzso Our findings suggest that a change in the identity of zzso zzso expressed during development allows mature zzso to generate zzso that are required for zzso
