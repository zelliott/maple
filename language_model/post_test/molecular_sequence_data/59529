A structurally diverse group of zzso peptides is zzso by zzso zzso which act as templates for a growing zzso chain, attached to the zzso via a zzso zzso The protein templates are composed of distinctive zzso zzso whose order dictates the primary structure of the corresponding zzso zzso Each module contains defined zzso that catalyze zzso zzso and zzso bond formation, as well as zzso zzso To show that a putative zzso domain zzso is involved in zzso binding and transfer of zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso characterized that region of zzso zzso 1, zzso 

The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned using its zzso to the genes for the zzso carrier proteins of fatty acid and zzso zzso The protein was expressed as a zzso fusion zzso and zzso in a single step by affinity zzso zzso of zzso a precursor of zzso A, demonstrated the modification of zzso with the zzso zzso When an zzso domain is present to supply the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso in zzso 

zzso can bind zzso to the zzso zzso and can subsequently be zzso strongly supporting the multiple carrier model of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso can each act as independent zzso zzso further confirming the modular structure of zzso zzso and can also perform sequential steps in zzso as do zzso zzso
