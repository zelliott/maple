zzso of the universal base zzso on the zzso stability of DNA zzso having a 6 zzso stem and four base zzso were investigated by optical zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso Melting studies were conducted in buffer containing 115 zzso zzso Five different modified versions of DNA zzso containing a zzso base or bases zzso at different positions in the stem and loop regions were zzso zzso parameters of the melting transitions estimated from a two-state analysis of optical melting zzso and measured directly by zzso revealed that the presence of zzso bases in the duplex stem or loop regions of short DNA zzso significantly affects both their zzso and zzso melting components in a zzso manner, while the transition free energy varies zzso with the transition zzso The zzso determined zzso and zzso values of the modified zzso were considerably smaller zzso than the two-state optical zzso suggesting that zzso effects may be significant in the melting processes of these zzso zzso of circular zzso zzso also revealed slight differences between the modified zzso and the control in both the duplex and melted states, suggesting subtle structural differences between the control and DNA zzso containing a zzso base or zzso
