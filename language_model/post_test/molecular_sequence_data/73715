zzso zzso glaucoma zzso is an zzso zzso eye disorder, zzso to result from zzso defects in the anterior eye zzso Previously, we reported two zzso locations for this condition on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso of human zzso zzso gene zzso in affected individuals of five zzso families linked to the zzso locus are zzso zzso gene has previously been mapped within the zzso candidate region and its expression in the zzso zzso cells has been demonstrated in this zzso Three different zzso zzso were identified and zzso a 13 zzso deletion in zzso zzso an zzso of a single zzso base in zzso zzso and a larger deletion affecting the zzso end of zzso III and the adjacent zzso zzso All of these are zzso zzso that are predicted to remove zzso essential for the function of the zzso zzso zzso it is expected that all these zzso result in functional zzso zzso The zzso detected in the affected members of these families were not present in 470 zzso from randomly selected normal individuals, thus strongly suggesting that zzso is the gene for the zzso locus on zzso The results are discussed in the context of the earlier hypothesis that zzso zzso might zzso the processes of growth and differentiation by controlling the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
