One of the most complex zzso processes in zzso is the assembly of zzso the key zzso in biological nitrogen zzso We describe here the crystal structure of an zzso zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso into which the zzso is inserted in the final step of zzso protein zzso The zzso protein folds as a zzso containing two copies each of the zzso alpha and beta zzso In this structure, one of the three alpha zzso zzso exhibits a substantially changed zzso whereas the rest of the protein remains essentially zzso A predominantly positively charged funnel is zzso this funnel is of sufficient size to accommodate zzso of the zzso charged zzso
