zzso zzso coli zzso form adherent zzso on the surface of tissue culture cells in a pattern termed localized zzso zzso adherence requires the presence of a large zzso adherence factor zzso zzso Recently a zzso zzso has been described in zzso possessing the zzso zzso An analysis of 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that seven have insertions in the zzso zzso and are incapable of localized zzso We report here the mapping of the zzso insertions in these zzso The zzso sequence of the gene interrupted in these zzso zzso zzso was determined and found to zzso to the zzso zzso acid sequence of the major structural protein of the zzso zzso The zzso gene bears sequence similarities to members of the type IV zzso gene family and encodes a potential site for processing by a zzso zzso A zzso containing zzso as the only open reading frame directs the synthesis of a protein recognized by zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso at this locus are unable to zzso zzso but synthesis is restored by introduction of a zzso containing the cloned zzso The minimum zzso of DNA required to restore localized adherence is considerably greater than that required to restore zzso zzso zzso zzso as assessed by alkaline zzso activity in zzso zzso is affected by temperature and growth zzso These studies describe an zzso zzso zzso zzso a candidate for the elusive zzso adherence factor responsible for localized zzso
