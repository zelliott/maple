We report here on strategies aimed at improving the frequency of zzso zzso in plants by increasing the efficiency of selecting zzso in transgenic zzso Gene targeting was approached on the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso replacement zzso Large zzso regions, up to zzso zzso surrounding a positive selection marker were presented as zzso for zzso zzso For easier detection of putative zzso the negative zzso marker zzso zzso was inserted at the outside borders of the zzso regions offered for zzso A combination of positive and negative selection allowing zzso to grow, while zzso random zzso was used to select putative targeting zzso The more than zzso enrichment observed with replacement zzso designed to minimize gene zzso demonstrated the efficiency of the negative zzso Using five different replacement zzso an estimated total of zzso transformation events were taken through the zzso selection procedure and 185 resistant zzso zzso zzso events could not be verified in the survivors by zzso screening and Southern zzso zzso With this approach the frequency of zzso gene targeting in zzso zzso was below zzso zzso zzso despite the large zzso sequences offered for zzso
