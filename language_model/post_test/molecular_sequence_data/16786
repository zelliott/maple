zzso X zzso zzso plays a central role in the regulation of zzso zzso signaling pathways by acting as a ubiquitous zzso partner of many nuclear zzso including the orphan zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso or zzso which zzso from the nucleus to zzso where it interacts with zzso to induce zzso Here, we report that zzso is required for nuclear export and zzso targeting of zzso through their unique zzso that is zzso by zzso zzso located in their zzso zzso The effects of zzso are attributed to a putative nuclear export sequence zzso present in its zzso zzso zzso zzso suppress zzso activity by inducing zzso zzso or altering zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also silenced by zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso or vitamin D zzso zzso we were able to show that the zzso targeting of the zzso zzso and its induction of zzso are zzso inhibited by zzso zzso Together, our results reveal a novel zzso function of zzso and its involvement in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
