zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified by Mass, and zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on cell viability in human leukemia zzso and human stomach cancer zzso III cells were zzso zzso displayed strong growth zzso effect against zzso cells, but weak growth zzso effect on zzso III zzso zzso change showing zzso bodies was observed in the zzso cells treated with zzso but not in zzso III cells treated with zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso of zzso cells were increased to zzso zzso and zzso after a zzso treatment with zzso 5, and 10 zzso zzso zzso The fragmentation by zzso of DNA to zzso fragments, that is a characteristic of zzso was observed to be both zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that growth zzso by zzso of zzso cells results from the induction of zzso by this compound in zzso zzso
