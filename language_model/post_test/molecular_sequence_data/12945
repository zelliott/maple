The rice zzso zzso which zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso race 6, was isolated by zzso zzso Fifty transgenic rice plants carrying the cloned zzso gene display high levels of resistance to the zzso The sequence of the predicted zzso which carries both a zzso repeat motif and a zzso zzso domain, suggests a role in cell surface recognition of a pathogen zzso and subsequent zzso of an zzso defense zzso zzso of zzso should facilitate understanding of plant disease resistance and lead to engineered resistance in zzso
