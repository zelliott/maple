zzso zone animals exhibit seasonal variation in zzso zzso In most cases, seasonal changes in zzso states are regulated by changes in zzso zzso rather than zzso from the zzso area zzso zzso An important exception occurs in some zzso that become zzso to the zzso effects of long days and show profound decreases in brain zzso protein zzso Whether this decline reflects changes in gene expression is unknown because of past failures to measure zzso zzso levels, due in large part to the absence of available zzso gene sequence in this zzso Here, we report the first cloning of zzso zzso in two zzso European zzso and zebra zzso zzso with the size of the zzso in other avian and zzso species, the zzso frames predict proteins of 91 and 92 zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso in both species is perfectly zzso with chicken zzso the zzso acid identity in the signal zzso and zzso associated zzso zzso are significantly less well zzso At the zzso level, the zzso and zebra zzso coding sequences are approximately zzso identical to each other but only approximately zzso identical to chicken zzso In zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso expression primarily in the zzso consistent with previous studies on the distribution of the zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence for zzso regulation of zzso zzso in male zzso zzso in zzso zzso levels occur in parallel with zzso zzso Thus, zzso is associated with decreases in zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso
