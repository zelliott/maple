The crystal structure of the zzso binding domain 2 of zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been determined by multiple zzso replacement and refined to zzso A zzso The structure reveals an zzso sandwich similar to the zzso of zzso and zzso and contains two zzso sites, as observed in other domain 1 and domain 2 zzso zzso of the structures of several zzso family zzso has identified zzso that may mediate zzso binding in zzso domain 2 zzso To assess the involvement of these zzso in zzso zzso three zzso of human zzso domain 2 were zzso for zzso binding activity and zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated a lowered affinity for zzso indicating a role for those zzso in filament zzso Using both structural and zzso data, we have constructed a model of the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso This model highlights a number of interactions that may serve as positive and negative zzso of filament zzso and zzso
