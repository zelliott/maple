zzso zzso zzso experience two periods of muscle zzso once during zzso and again at zzso During zzso zzso hormone zzso both muscle growth in the limbs and muscle death in the zzso In zzso the muscle zzso zzso zzso gene is activated during the differentiation from zzso to zzso and has served as both a marker for muscle development and to drive zzso expression in transgenic zzso zzso control elements are generally highly zzso throughout evolution, potentially allowing mouse promoter use in transgenic zzso zzso This paper compares zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression and the mouse zzso zzso promoter driving a green fluorescent protein reporter in transgenic zzso zzso The zzso promoter demonstrated strong skeletal zzso zzso expression in both the juvenile zzso and adult zzso zzso our results clearly demonstrate the functional conservation of regulatory sequences in zzso muscle gene promoters and illustrate the utility of using zzso zzso zzso for detailed comparative study of zzso promoter activity in zzso
