zzso for zzso are present on horizontal cells of fish zzso that are linked to the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, the goldfish zzso zzso gene that encodes these zzso referred to as zzso was isolated and zzso A single open reading frame within the zzso gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that is highly zzso with zzso D1 receptors from rats and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso lacks 80 zzso acids that are present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso chain reaction demonstrated that the gene is expressed in the goldfish zzso and is zzso within the coding zzso The fact that zzso encodes a zzso D1 zzso was demonstrated through pharmacological analysis of zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and the human D1 zzso expressed in zzso cells had high affinity for zzso and other zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso and the human D1 zzso were able to stimulate the zzso of zzso in response to zzso or zzso Interestingly, stimulation of both the zzso and human receptors with zzso also resulted in an increase in zzso zzso Finally, long term zzso of zzso cells with zzso resulted in the zzso and zzso of both the goldfish and human zzso
