Investigation of zzso pathways of zzso signaling in zzso is possible by transgenic expression of agents known to influence specific zzso interactions in the zzso The objective of the present study was to establish an experimental model for analyzing signal zzso mechanisms in pancreatic zzso in zzso by expressing the zzso toxin A1 zzso under control of the insulin promoter, intending a constant zzso of the zzso and thereby constant generation of zzso Surprisingly, the transgenic mice demonstrated mild zzso and zzso in zzso and diminished zzso insulin release from the in zzso zzso zzso whereas the pancreatic insulin content was zzso These observations suggest a zzso in either the insulin release mechanisms or zzso zzso Although the translated zzso toxin A1 zzso was biologically active, there was no increase in the zzso content of zzso We conclude that the observed zzso in the zzso toxin transgenic mice may be caused by a deleterious effect of the zzso itself on zzso function, or that counter regulatory mechanisms may compensate for the zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso
