zzso analysis of gene expression zzso profiles, from zzso and median cells of the silk zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed and zzso so as to identify their respective distinguishing zzso The zzso of the zzso libraries was performed with a zzso zzso reference tag collection, which was extracted from a novel set of zzso zzso zzso from the 3' zzso Most of the tags appeared at similar relative concentration within the two libraries, and corresponded with zzso and highly abundant silk zzso zzso in addition to tags from silk protein zzso 19 abundant tags were found zzso zzso in the median cell library, which were absent in the zzso cell tag zzso With the exception of tags from zzso zzso no zzso specific tags were found in this subset zzso The analysis of some of the zzso zzso suggested that middle silk zzso cells have diversified functions, in addition to their well characterized role in silk zzso synthesis and zzso
