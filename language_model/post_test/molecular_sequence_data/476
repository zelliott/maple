Nuclear transfer has been used as a means of selectively zzso the zzso zzso One possible consequence of this technology is that the zzso used in nuclear transfer may provide additional zzso by zzso inheritance of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso These studies examine the potential consequences of such inheritance in a large animal transplantation zzso 

Renal transplants were performed between major zzso complex zzso animals differing only in the source of their zzso derived zzso DNA, using a zzso which zzso leads to tolerance within standard zzso zzso In an attempt to correlate transplant results with a putative marker for disparities in zzso inherited minor zzso zzso we examined one zzso region of zzso designated zzso region 1 zzso 

The zzso sequence of the zzso region was found to be zzso among zzso miniature zzso of different zzso despite 25 years of selective breeding of the zzso of this zzso In contrast, zzso derived by nuclear transfer into zzso zzso differed in the zzso region sequence from each other and from zzso zzso Renal transplants from standard, zzso zzso zzso to their zzso knockout counterparts derived from zzso zzso were rejected within 2 weeks, whereas transplants in the reverse direction were accepted for over 30 zzso 

The zzso sequence of zzso may serve as a marker for the level of diversity of zzso These transplant data are consistent with the existence of zzso zzso minor zzso with a level of diversity that can influence the outcome of zzso zzso
