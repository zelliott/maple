zzso zzso which are highly selective for delta zzso receptors have been designed using the zzso zzso The zzso member of this series, zzso 1, possesses very high affinity and selectivity for delta zzso and a closely related zzso zzso zzso 2, is a selective delta 2 zzso The fact that zzso zzso was found to be a delta 1 zzso suggests that the zzso of the putative delta address component zzso zzso of zzso plays a role in modulating delta zzso zzso
