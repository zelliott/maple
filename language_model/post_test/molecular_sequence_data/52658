Using CD and zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified potential initiation sites for the folding of T4 zzso by examining the zzso preferences of zzso fragments corresponding to regions of secondary zzso CD zzso showed most peptides were zzso in water, but adopted partial zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso This was also consistent with the zzso zzso data which showed that the peptides were predominantly zzso in water, although in some cases, nascent or small populations of partially folded zzso could be zzso zzso patterns, zzso constants, and zzso from random zzso zzso chemical shift values zzso the CD data and confirmed that many of the peptides were zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the zzso corresponding to zzso E in the native zzso formed a zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso indicating that zzso E potentially forms an initiation site for T4 zzso zzso The data for the other peptides indicated that zzso D, zzso G, and H are dependent on zzso interactions for their folding and/or zzso Overall, the results from this study, and those of our earlier studies, are in agreement with modeling and zzso exchange experiments, and support an zzso model of folding for T4 zzso
