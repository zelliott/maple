Given the importance of the cell surface recognition zzso zzso in immune function, the cloning and characterization of zzso at the molecular level from an zzso zzso the white whale zzso zzso was carried zzso Whale zzso zzso contains zzso base pairs and translates into a protein containing 455 zzso zzso Whale zzso shares zzso and 51% identity with the human and mouse zzso zzso respectively, and is organized in a similar zzso Unlike human and zzso however, the zzso domain, which is highly zzso contains zzso acid zzso unique to zzso Moreover, only one of the seven potential zzso zzso sites present in whale is shared with human and zzso zzso the whale zzso sequence is most similar to pig and structurally similar to dog and cat, in that all lack the zzso pair in the V2 zzso These differences suggest that zzso may have a different secondary structure in these species, which may affect binding of class II and subsequent zzso zzso as well as binding of viral zzso Interestingly, as a group, species with these zzso characteristics all have high zzso expression of class II molecules on T zzso suggesting potential uniqueness in the interaction of zzso class II zzso and the immune zzso zzso characterization of zzso in an aquatic zzso provides information on the zzso zzso itself and may provide insight into zzso evolutionary changes of the immune zzso
