An zzso disc is a large zzso of avascular cartilage rich in zzso and water consisting of zzso nucleus zzso and zzso zzso zzso The soluble fraction of rabbit nucleus zzso exhibited unusually high zzso zzso zzso zzso activity (about zzso of the total zzso zzso The soluble zzso activity was zzso higher than those of rabbit zzso zzso and zzso The zzso was bound to an zzso column at pH zzso and zzso near the void volume as a broad peak on zzso on a zzso zzso column developed with a buffer containing zzso M zzso When the zzso column was developed in the presence of 1 M salt, almost all the zzso activity was zzso near the total available zzso The soluble zzso was zzso to near zzso A zzso zzso was also zzso from the zzso extracted with 1 M zzso from nucleus zzso For comparison, we zzso a zzso zzso from the zzso fraction of zzso The zzso zzso was identical to a group zzso zzso as judged from its zzso zzso acid sequences and mass zzso On zzso gel zzso the zzso zzso from the soluble and zzso zzso of nucleus zzso both gave a major zzso zzso band at the same position as zzso group zzso zzso These results suggest that group zzso zzso is associated with soluble zzso zzso most likely zzso in the zzso zzso of rabbit nucleus zzso
