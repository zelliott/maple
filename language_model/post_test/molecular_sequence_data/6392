zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso zzso in a number of insect zzso Using zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of bacterial gene zzso strains from 10 species belonging to the closely related zzso zzso and zzso groups of zzso were screened for the presence of zzso in their zzso zzso Those screened included the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be infected with zzso zzso tests of four additional strains of zzso zzso found all to be infected with the zzso It was established that these bacteria cause partial zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso curing followed by crosses between cured and zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by a zzso zzso Although most species of insects shown to be infected with zzso are cosmopolitan and/or have undergone recent range expansion in association with human activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are endemic species with specialized ecological zzso zzso molecular zzso analysis indicates that, among the species we zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso To determine whether the bacteria are involved in zzso isolation between these two species, zzso crosses were carried out between zzso zzso and both infected and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso Although these species did mate with each other, all zzso crosses failed to yield hybrid zzso indicating that the bacteria are not responsible for zzso zzso between these zzso
