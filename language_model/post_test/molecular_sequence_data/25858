zzso peptides representing zzso acids 156 to 170 of virus zzso protein zzso from human zzso zzso type 2 have previously been used to elicit a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against this zzso have been compared with a zzso zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the same linear zzso The zzso activity of both zzso against virus is abolished by an zzso acid substitution in zzso at position zzso but only the zzso zzso zzso activity is affected by a change in zzso at position zzso The minimal binding site of zzso has been zzso using overlapping zzso to a sequence zzso covering zzso zzso 160 to zzso Using affinity zzso it has been shown that 8 to zzso of total zzso activity of zzso rabbit or guinea-pig antivirus zzso is due to recognition of this linear zzso 156 to 170 zzso Furthermore, a similar population of zzso zzso appears to be associated with an immune response to recent zzso infection in zzso These results confirm the existence of linear zzso on the surface of zzso which may be zzso by suitable synthetic zzso
