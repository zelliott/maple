Evidence suggests that resistance to zzso zzso in zzso zzso is related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, have been identified through the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have studied zzso and resistant strains of zzso zzso to determine whether the zzso zzso is associated with a zzso in zzso and to establish the number of zzso copies of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA from zzso and resistant strains of zzso zzso exhibited a unique zzso zzso restriction zzso consistent with a single zzso copy of zzso in both zzso DNA zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and zzso from two susceptible and two resistant strains of zzso zzso The zzso sequences from these strains were identical indicating that resistance to zzso was not associated with zzso in the gene zzso zzso
