In the zzso of most plants, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To better understand the regulation of this zzso we have isolated and zzso a BC zzso clone from zzso and partially characterized its zzso Fifteen zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature BC protein is highly zzso between zzso and tobacco zzso zzso BC expression was evaluated using northern blots and zzso fusion zzso in transgenic zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso as well as transcript level of the native gene were both found to be higher in zzso and flower than in root and zzso Analysis of tobacco suspension cells transformed with truncated BC zzso gene zzso indicated the region from zzso to zzso contained necessary promoter elements which supported zzso gene zzso A positive regulatory region was found to be located between zzso and zzso whereas a negative element was possibly located in the first zzso In addition, several zzso regulatory elements were identified in the BC zzso Surprisingly, although BC is a zzso zzso the expression of zzso fusion zzso was similar to zzso zzso
