zzso IX is a cell surface zzso strongly associated with several types of human zzso It exerts activity of zzso zzso and capacity of binding to cell surface zzso In the present work, we used affinity zzso zzso IX protein to demonstrate that the cells adhere to immobilized zzso IX and that the zzso zzso zzso abrogates cell attachment to zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso we identified zzso zzso and located it in the zzso domain, which contains a zzso tandem repeat of six zzso acids zzso From zzso display library of random zzso we identified and chemically zzso those which compete for the zzso with zzso and inhibit zzso of cells to zzso zzso These zzso might serve as lead compounds for drug zzso
