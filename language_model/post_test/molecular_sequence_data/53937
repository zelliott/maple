We report that zzso a zzso protein that functions downstream of zzso in membrane zzso can induce part of the reorganization of the zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso has been reported to associate and activate zzso complex at its zzso region that is rich in zzso zzso The deletion of the zzso zzso abolished the interaction with and the zzso ability of zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso however, induced zzso in cells as the zzso zzso zzso In addition, this zzso could not be suppressed by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso which clearly zzso zzso membrane zzso This study therefore demonstrates that zzso reorganizes the zzso zzso not only through zzso complex but also through another unidentified mechanism that may be important but has been neglected thus zzso
