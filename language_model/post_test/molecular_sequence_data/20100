The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was recently discovered in fish, and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript has been zzso Here we cloned the zzso zzso showing that the zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to zzso and examined gene structure and expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso response elements were observed upstream of the coding regions in all four zzso zzso adults and zzso were exposed (24 zzso to 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso or 20 zzso zzso and subsequently held in clean water for 24 h zzso or 48 h zzso All adult zzso examined zzso zzso heart, liver, zzso brain, gut, and zzso and zzso showed zzso expression of the four zzso zzso was most strongly expressed in liver, whereas zzso zzso and zzso were most strongly expressed in heart and zzso zzso and the zzso genes showed an expression pattern similar to one another and to zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso tended to have a higher zzso expression than zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso in all zzso and zzso and zzso in all zzso except zzso or zzso and brain, zzso zzso induction was significant only in the zzso However, in zzso all four genes were induced strongly by zzso The results are consistent with zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso being regulated by the zzso hydrocarbon zzso While zzso may have a protective role against zzso zzso in liver and gut, zzso zzso and zzso may also play zzso roles in eye and heart and possibly other zzso as well as during zzso
