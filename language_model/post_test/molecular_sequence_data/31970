zzso zzso zzso zzso the initial step of carbon metabolism in zzso The zzso comprises eight large zzso arranged as a zzso of zzso around a central zzso channel that defines a fourfold axis of zzso and eight small zzso arranged as two zzso at the poles of the zzso The zzso divergent zzso zzso between zzso A and B form the entrance to the zzso zzso In the green zzso zzso zzso zzso from each of the four zzso zzso zzso defines the minimal diameter of the channel zzso To understand the role of the central zzso channel in zzso function, directed zzso and transformation of zzso were employed to replace zzso with Ala, zzso zzso zzso or three zzso zzso zzso to close the entrance to the zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused only small decreases in zzso growth at 25 and zzso whereas zzso had a substantial effect at both zzso The zzso zzso had decreased zzso rates, but the zzso zzso had decreases in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso at lower temperatures than zzso zzso and were zzso at slower rates under zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso were activated by zzso zzso at normal rates, indicating that the structural transition required for zzso is not affected by altering the zzso channel zzso zzso dynamics alone may not be responsible for these distant effects on the zzso active zzso
