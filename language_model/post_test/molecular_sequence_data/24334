The use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso in zzso zzso zzso is suggested for the analysis of zzso zzso Its use was shown to overcome zzso problems and resulted in good quality zzso zzso of protected zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso molecules were formed in positive zzso mode while negative zzso mode resulted in zzso + zzso zzso from zzso and zzso + zzso zzso from zzso in cases where no significant molecular zzso related zzso could be observed applying commonly used zzso zzso such as methanol or zzso zzso labeling zzso high resolution experiments and tandem mass zzso zzso showed that the zzso acid zzso present in zzso as a common zzso is responsible for the formation of zzso molecules in positive zzso mode and for methane zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso in negative zzso zzso
