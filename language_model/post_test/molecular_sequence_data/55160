Two novel zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from marine zzso samples and their zzso positions were investigated by a zzso zzso Both strains formed zzso zzso in the early phase of growth but the zzso eventually fragmented into zzso zzso The zzso type was found to be zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing analysis revealed that strains zzso and zzso represented novel members of the family zzso Their nearest zzso zzso were the members of the zzso zzso with a similarity of zzso zzso However, strains zzso and zzso were distinguishable from the members of the zzso zzso and the other zzso of the family zzso in terms of zzso characteristics and zzso zzso The result of the zzso zzso indicated that strains zzso and zzso belonged to the same zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso represent a novel zzso and species of the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
