zzso of the mouse zzso zzso protein zzso gene is zzso by zzso and we have previously shown that in a 162 zzso fragment, located at position zzso to zzso a zzso sequence functions as an zzso zzso To determine which factors are involved in the zzso regulated zzso gene transcription, we have used zzso I zzso and zzso zzso to examine in zzso binding of proteins to the zzso and promoter sequences and have determined the functional significance of the recognized DNA sequences in transient zzso zzso Studies using zzso proteins such as the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and crude cellular extracts from zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso showed that in addition to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with the zzso zzso in a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso binding elements strongly reduced zzso or abolished zzso zzso induced zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso sequence is a composite site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
