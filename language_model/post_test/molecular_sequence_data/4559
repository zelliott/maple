The human zzso very late zzso zzso zzso mediates interactions with collagen and is the zzso for zzso zzso zzso sites for both collagen and zzso 1 have been mapped to the I domain within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso interacts with zzso it does not bind zzso We have used isolated zzso zzso I zzso expressed as zzso zzso fusion proteins in zzso coli to identify two groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso independently involved in virus zzso These zzso are distinct from the metal zzso zzso site previously demonstrated to be essential for zzso interactions with zzso zzso in three metal zzso zzso site zzso that abolish zzso to collagen had no effect on virus zzso These results confirm that different sites within the I domain are responsible for zzso interaction with zzso zzso proteins and with viral zzso
