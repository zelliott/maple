The molecular cloning and the determination of the zzso sequence of the zzso gene responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso coli are zzso zzso coli zzso strains have zzso zzso zzso and the defective gene is located at about zzso 10 on the zzso The zzso zzso gene was zzso from a zzso zzso clone containing the zzso zzso around zzso 10, picked up from the aligned zzso library of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Cell 50, zzso The cloned gene was identified as the zzso gene by the recovery and amplification of zzso zzso activity in an zzso zzso A zzso sequence of the cloned zzso was zzso This sequence specifies two open reading zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with the expected molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso A part of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed similarity to the sequences of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso product of a zzso zzso The zzso carrying zzso downstream of the zzso promoter zzso the zzso of zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso showing that the product zzso by zzso is the zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicated that a protein of molecular weight zzso approximately consistent with the molecular weight of the deduced zzso zzso is the gene zzso
