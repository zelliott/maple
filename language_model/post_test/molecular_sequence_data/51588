zzso clones zzso the human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso were isolated by screening a zzso zzso expression library in zzso cells with zzso The cloned zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family and comprises a signal sequence (44 zzso zzso an zzso region of two zzso zzso zzso and three zzso type III zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain (238 zzso zzso The zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells as a 190 zzso zzso that specifically binds human zzso with low zzso but does not bind mouse zzso zzso zzso a soluble form of the zzso mouse zzso zzso have been isolated, suggesting complex interactions between the various forms of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso is most related to the zzso zzso component of the zzso zzso a feature that may provide a molecular basis for the intertwined zzso of zzso and zzso in the absence of obvious structural similarly between the zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells zzso with the human zzso zzso display novel high affinity zzso receptors that are presumed to consist of zzso receptors in association with zzso mouse high zzso zzso Unlike the low affinity human zzso zzso the mixed species high affinity zzso is capable of binding mouse zzso
