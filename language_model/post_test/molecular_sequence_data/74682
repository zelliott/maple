zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso A zzso method with zzso detection was used to measure zzso activity in the zzso and the zzso zzso of the freshwater zzso zzso zzso Storage conditions were zzso in order to prevent decrease of zzso activity and consisted in freezing the zzso fraction in the presence of zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso mixture and zzso zzso zzso zzso Seasonal variations of activity in the zzso zzso and to a lesser extent in the zzso were found with activity increasing in spring compared to zzso No sex differences were zzso The zzso coding sequence was identified using zzso zzso designed in the highly zzso regions of the zzso zzso of zzso The partial sequence identified zzso for 121 zzso zzso The comparison of the identified partial coding sequence of zzso zzso with those available from zzso and zzso indicated that zzso sequence was highly zzso
