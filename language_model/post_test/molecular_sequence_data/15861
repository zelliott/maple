The genes for the zzso hormones zzso and zzso are located in close proximity to each other within the rat zzso They are separated by only zzso 11 zzso of DNA sequence and oriented in such a way that their zzso occurs on opposite DNA zzso Although the two genes are structurally very similar including common potential regulatory elements in their putative zzso regions, they are expressed in discrete populations of zzso zzso of the zzso In rats placed under zzso stress, the zzso gene is zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is also zzso To address the question of whether this coordinated rise in zzso zzso is the result of switching on zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso with double zzso zzso zzso was carried zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for either zzso or zzso zzso were constructed and zzso to zzso sections from zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso of zzso gene zzso is restricted solely to zzso zzso no zzso gene transcripts can be detected in zzso zzso
