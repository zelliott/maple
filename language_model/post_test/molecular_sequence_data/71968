zzso of human zzso genes increases as the target cell, the zzso zzso zzso displacement protein zzso is a cellular protein which has been shown in other cell types to zzso regulate gene expression in zzso cells but not in differentiated zzso We have previously shown that a zzso zzso sequence (the zzso binds zzso and zzso regulates the human zzso type 6 zzso E6 promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Roman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with a zzso expressing zzso from the zzso zzso zzso or E1 regulatory region and a zzso carrying the zzso gene indicate that zzso zzso zzso from all three zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso we have shown that zzso binds zzso both upstream and downstream of the zzso zzso and E1 zzso initiation start zzso Furthermore, when zzso were induced to zzso all three promoter activities zzso zzso with this, zzso and zzso revealed that zzso nucleus zzso and, zzso DNA binding activity decreased when zzso were induced to zzso The elevated promoter activities were zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso fulfills the requirement of a zzso negative regulator that could tie the zzso life cycle to zzso zzso
