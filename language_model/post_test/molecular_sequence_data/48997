The mechanisms by which zzso controls the maturation and zzso presentation functions of zzso cells zzso remains largely undefined in this critical cell zzso To examine this question, we have employed zzso zzso of primary bone zzso mouse zzso zzso of the distinct binding sites for zzso zzso factor 6 zzso and for zzso 2, 3, and 5 in the zzso zzso domain revealed their independent contributions to DC maturation and zzso of zzso In contrast, disruption of the zzso but not the zzso zzso binding site markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso along with zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso These data document a clear zzso of the zzso signaling cascade in primary DC at the level of the zzso two distinct and autonomous zzso binding sites, and reveal the zzso role of the zzso binding site in zzso zzso zzso production by these zzso
