zzso zzso is a member of the zzso gene zzso Its expression in the mouse zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso growth factor zzso The author et zzso cloned the zzso gene zzso region, and demonstrated that zzso signaling pathways are involved in modulating zzso gene zzso Three short but complex zzso within 400 zzso from the zzso initiation site of the mouse zzso zzso contain the response elements that are responsible for estrogen, zzso acid, zzso and growth factor zzso These elements have been identified and zzso using reporter zzso zzso zzso into human zzso zzso zzso zzso The author et zzso used molecular approaches, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine the relationship between the response zzso and to zzso the crucial zzso within zzso This article reviews the characterization of the zzso and zzso response elements of the mouse zzso gene zzso
