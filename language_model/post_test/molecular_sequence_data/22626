zzso zzso zzso is a beta barrel zzso toxin that is zzso by the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso Upon binding to susceptible cells, zzso assembles via an inactive zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso The N zzso of zzso which in the crystal structure of the fully assembled pore forms a latch between adjacent zzso has been thought to play a vital role in the zzso to pore zzso For example, the deletion of two zzso zzso produced a completely inactive protein that was arrested in assembly at the zzso zzso In the present study, we have zzso assembly with a comprehensive set of zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that after zzso of up to 17 zzso zzso the ability of zzso to form functional pores was diminished, but still zzso We then discovered that the zzso zzso zzso zzso which was present in our original set of zzso but not in the new ones, promotes complete zzso upon zzso of the N zzso zzso the N zzso of zzso cannot be critical for the zzso to pore transformation as previously zzso zzso 217 is involved in the assembly process and must interact indirectly with the distant N zzso during the last step in pore zzso In addition, we provide evidence that an intact N zzso prevents the premature zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
