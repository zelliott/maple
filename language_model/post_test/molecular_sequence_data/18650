All cellular proteins are derived from zzso ones by natural zzso Because of the random nature of this process, many potentially useful protein structures never arose or were discarded during zzso Here, we used a single round of genetic selection in mouse cells to isolate chemically simple, biologically active zzso proteins that do not contain any zzso acid sequences from zzso zzso We screened a zzso library expressing hundreds of thousands of proteins consisting of zzso zzso acids in random order to isolate four zzso proteins that induced focus formation in mouse and human zzso and tumors in zzso These proteins share no zzso acid sequences with known cellular or viral zzso and the simplest of them contains only seven different zzso zzso They transformed cells by forming a stable complex with the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso domain and causing zzso zzso zzso We term this approach de zzso selection and suggest that it can be used to generate structures and activities not observed in nature, create prototypes for novel research zzso and zzso and provide insight into cell biology, zzso zzso zzso and possibly virus evolution and the origin of zzso
