In the last decade, as a result of molecular cloning and the zzso zzso chain reaction, numerous zzso of the zzso protein zzso have been zzso What lags behind their discovery is knowledge of their zzso This review focuses on some of my recent work on the structure, function and regulation of zzso of the heavy chain of zzso smooth muscle and zzso zzso zzso zzso to related work in the field is included where zzso The particular zzso discussed are those that are generated by alternative zzso near the zzso end of the zzso resulting in either an zzso or a deletion of a cassette of zzso acids near the zzso of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso In both the smooth muscle and zzso zzso this zzso occurs in the exact same region, which begins at zzso acid 212 in the primary zzso In the three-dimensional structure of the zzso these zzso are located near the zzso pocket in a region of the zzso that was not resolved in the crystal structure and therefore is believed to represent a flexible zzso In the smooth muscle zzso the zzso of seven zzso acids in this loop zzso a higher zzso activity on the zzso The potential mechanism by which this occurs and the significance to smooth muscle zzso diversity is zzso In the zzso zzso the insert in this region is a different size and sequence of zzso acids than that in the smooth muscle zzso A zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop is zzso by zzso zzso in zzso during zzso maturation of zzso to eggs and is zzso in zzso egg extracts that are equivalent to the zzso after zzso of the zzso Thus, zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso with the cortical reorganization that occurs during zzso and zzso zzso with the cortical contraction that occurs at zzso which aids in zzso zzso In zzso these zzso in the zzso zzso in a flexible loop near the zzso pocket, appear to be important in determining differences in function or regulation among zzso II zzso
