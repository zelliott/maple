zzso that define the zzso locus of zzso zzso block zzso at an early stage and recently were shown to prevent the zzso processing of zzso E zzso 29) into its active form, an event that is believed to control critical changes in gene expression during the second hour of zzso By taking advantage of two zzso zzso zzso in zzso we have cloned DNA spanning the zzso Gene disruption experiments with zzso fragments transferred to zzso zzso revealed that the locus consisted of a single zzso unit about zzso zzso pairs in zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to show that expression of this zzso unit initiated at zzso h after the end of zzso growth and depended upon the products of all zzso zzso zzso was directed by a single promoter whose position was determined by high-resolution zzso protection zzso A deletion analysis of the promoter region was also carried out, with novel zzso zzso based on derivatives of zzso zzso The results indicated that a region of DNA extending from 183 to 118 base pairs upstream from the start point of zzso was required for full activity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso region of the promoter exhibited striking similarity to the zzso promoter and featured perfect but unusually spaced zzso and zzso consensus sequences for zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso
