We have identified a novel human zinc finger zzso zzso which is related to but distinct from the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso gene was initially detected in zzso cells using a zzso chain reaction approach with zzso zzso corresponding to zinc finger regions of zzso A zzso zzso of zzso was also identified in the mouse expressed sequence tag data banks, indicating that a family of zzso genes exists in zzso zzso appears to be widely zzso while zzso is expressed primarily in zzso and zzso cells and plays a fundamental role in the development of these zzso zzso of the full-length zzso zzso indicates that the interaction zzso for zzso factors zzso and zzso are both zzso and we have shown that this new zzso protein also physically interacts with these zzso We have demonstrated that zzso like zzso can act in concert with zzso to activate gene expression from the zzso zzso promoter region, but that it can also act to repress zzso zzso of additional reporter zzso Finally, we have identified a repression domain in zzso and show that repression is dependent upon the integrity of the zzso interaction motif zzso
