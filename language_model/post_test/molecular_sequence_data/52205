The zzso tumor locus on zzso zzso contains a tumor zzso zzso zzso which encodes a DNA binding protein zzso with four zinc fingers and a zzso N zzso and which functions as a zzso of zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene encodes a potent growth factor, which is expressed in high levels in a number of tumor cell zzso We initiated a search for zzso target genes and now report that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in transient zzso zzso and that the zzso protein interacts directly with a highly zzso region of the zzso zzso promoter in gel mobility shift zzso The results suggest that zzso may function to repress expression of the zzso zzso gene and that loss of this or related zzso activities may contribute to the abnormal growth of zzso zzso
