The zzso untranslated regions zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso contain internal zzso entry sites zzso that are unrelated to the two principal classes of zzso of zzso The mechanism of translation initiation on zzso zzso zzso which involves zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso also differs fundamentally from initiation on these zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso requires zzso sequences that form a zzso and the adjacent zzso and zzso zzso analogous elements do not occur in the two principal groups of zzso zzso Here, comparative sequence analysis was used to identify a subset of zzso from multiple zzso that contain zzso zzso sequences with significant similarities to zzso zzso They are avian zzso virus, duck zzso virus 1, duck zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso Valley virus, and zzso zzso Their zzso zzso are predicted to form several structures, in some of which the peripheral elements differ from the corresponding zzso zzso elements but in which the core zzso domain zzso and domain zzso elements are all closely zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso have been exchanged between unrelated virus families by zzso and support the hypothesis that zzso viruses consist of modular coding and zzso elements that can exchange and evolve zzso
