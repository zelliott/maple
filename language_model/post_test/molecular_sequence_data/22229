Since zzso zzso zzso are believed to exhibit enhanced zzso in avian species, zzso were zzso against the poorly zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso against either zzso zzso zzso from bovine zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso Y were isolated from the egg zzso and evaluated through suitable zzso and zzso systems in parallel with zzso G isolated from the zzso of rabbits zzso against the same zzso As revealed, zzso Y and G of low zzso and/or affinity were obtained against zzso zzso while zzso Y against zzso had a better apparent zzso could better discriminate between zzso and the closely related zzso zzso zzso alpha 1, and were obtained at much larger quantities than the corresponding zzso zzso
