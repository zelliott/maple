In this study, the genes involved in the initial attack on zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso The alpha and beta zzso of a zzso complex zzso showing 63 and 51% sequence identity, respectively, to the zzso of an angular zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso When zzso in zzso coli, zzso was responsible for the angular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso was able to zzso zzso aromatic zzso and zzso some of which were not oxidized by the zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso of resulting zzso products showed that zzso and zzso were the preferred zzso of zzso
