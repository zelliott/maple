The expression of human zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and is accompanied by increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we provide direct evidence that zzso mediates the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso but not an zzso zzso deleted of its zzso binding motif was zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso zzso is unable to induce zzso arrest in zzso zzso Using reporter plasmids containing various zzso of the zzso promoter, zzso zzso further revealed that the binding sites of the promoter to the zzso factor zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts only with the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso These results indicate a cooperative contribution of zzso and zzso to the zzso of zzso which leads to zzso zzso
