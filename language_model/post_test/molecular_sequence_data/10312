zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso of bone and zzso Recently, we found that the mouse zzso gene was induced in zzso zzso cells during differentiation by bone zzso zzso zzso To clarify the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso region of the mouse zzso gene by the zzso based gene walking zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of the zzso box followed by zzso rich sequences containing two zzso binding sites and a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso cells was mainly present between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site zzso zzso which contained the consensus sequence for the zzso element zzso Nuclear proteins from zzso cells and zzso cells could bind to this short segment in zzso zzso increased the promoter activity as well as the nuclear protein binding to the sequence in zzso zzso The present data suggest that the zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso precursor cells to zzso lineage would be mainly regulated by zzso zzso binding zzso zzso
