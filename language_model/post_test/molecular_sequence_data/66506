The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene was identified by both zzso cloning from a zzso region of loss of zzso zzso in liver cancer and by functional screening for genes affecting cell proliferation in large-scale zzso zzso Its zzso results in zzso of cell proliferation in cell culture and tumor growth in nude zzso To understand its zzso regulation, the promoter architecture has been dissected in zzso The major start of zzso was mapped by primer extension to a C zzso 177 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso By assessing the promoter activity of a set of zzso zzso of the minimal promoter zzso to zzso zzso in a transient zzso zzso we found that the zzso to + 40 region is critical to zzso gene transcription, containing binding sites for zzso factors zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and molecular analyses revealed that the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso bind to the two zzso sites in zzso and contribute significantly to the zzso active state of the zzso zzso while zzso zzso and two other members of the zzso family zzso and zzso appear to play little zzso Our observations provide insight into the zzso aspects of zzso zzso zzso
