The major zzso protein zzso from a zzso field isolate zzso A zzso of infectious zzso disease virus zzso was cloned and zzso to examine zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame consists of zzso zzso and codes for a zzso zzso acid zzso Overall, the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso A virus shares zzso identity with zzso genes from other published zzso zzso However, within the central region of zzso zzso acids zzso lies a highly divergent area that we have termed the variable zzso Relative to five other zzso zzso a total of six zzso acid changes occur within the variable domain of the zzso A zzso At positions zzso a substitution of zzso to zzso a decrease in the number of zzso and zzso beta turns, and a switch from a zzso to a zzso region are found only in the zzso A zzso Together these changes predict a decrease in zzso as determined by calculation of potential zzso zzso This suggests that only minor changes within zzso contributed to the emergence of a zzso virus that can cause disease in zzso zzso
