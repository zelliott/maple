zzso in its high zzso acid zzso form is expressed on chick zzso zzso during their growth, and then decreases at about the time that zzso is zzso In order to characterize this regulation at the cell and molecular level, the present studies use the chick zzso zzso zzso system, which constitutes a homogeneous and zzso synchronized population of zzso that can be used for in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso were evaluated both by zzso zzso analysis of total zzso and by pulse zzso of newly zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression on newly zzso zzso in the zzso was found to be closely correlated with in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso observed at zzso was prevented by in zzso blockade of zzso activity with zzso The zzso regulation of zzso expression was found to coincide precisely with an increase and decrease in levels of specific zzso zzso By contrast, the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso which in zzso is temporally correlated with zzso zzso was not expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso were used to provide direct evidence that zzso interaction can cause a specific zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
