zzso growth factor alpha zzso is a zzso zzso that stimulates cell proliferation via binding to cell surface zzso To identify the structural features of zzso that govern zzso zzso we prepared synthetic zzso fragments and zzso zzso proteins of zzso These zzso derivatives were tested in zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso peptides representing the N zzso the C zzso or the individual zzso constrained rings of zzso did not exhibit zzso or zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso with zzso at positions 8 and 21, 16 and 32, and 34 and 43 or at positions 8 and 21 and 34 and 43 yielded inactive zzso zzso However, zzso proteins containing zzso or deletions in the zzso region retained significant zzso zzso Conservative zzso acid changes at zzso 29 or 38 or both and a zzso zzso acid change at zzso 12 had little effect on binding or zzso However, zzso zzso acid changes at zzso 15, 38, and 47 produced dramatic decreases in zzso binding zzso to zzso and zzso activity zzso to zzso These studies indicate that at least three distinct regions of zzso contribute to zzso zzso
