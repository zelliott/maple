We report on the fusion of the zzso leukemia zinc finger protein zzso gene to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene in acute zzso leukemia zzso associated with a zzso zzso We studied two patients with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso using the zzso artificial zzso zzso and the bacterial artificial zzso clone zzso specific to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were split in the patients' zzso zzso cells, and the two zzso zzso were each labeled with both zzso We showed by Southern zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and cloned the fusion transcripts in one patient carrying the zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction using zzso and zzso zzso Both fusion transcripts were zzso This result defines a novel zzso zzso involving two zzso zzso and zzso resulting in an abnormal zzso zzso that could play a critical role in zzso
