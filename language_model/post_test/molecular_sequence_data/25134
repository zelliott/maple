The zzso zzso gene product of human zzso virus zzso zzso is a regulatory zzso zzso protein produced by zzso zzso As a possible negative regulator of transcription, it has been suggested that zzso may be involved in the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso may result in early destruction of zzso cells before viral assembly or of zzso infected zzso It appeared, thus, of interest to investigate the zzso of the zzso in chimpanzees zzso against zzso zzso Two of the six chimpanzees that were injected with soluble zzso zzso in association with other zzso zzso displayed significant and sustained zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso and to the other zzso Using a set of synthetic peptides spanning the entire zzso zzso two zzso zzso could be zzso one within the last 20 zzso of the C zzso of the zzso the other around the region of zzso zzso zzso from the same animals also reacted to zzso in a zzso as well as to some of the peptides in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could thus be determined as being located in the regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results obtained with peptides spanning the region between zzso acid zzso 65 and zzso indicate that at least two additional zzso zzso were present in the region comprised between zzso acid 65 and zzso Interestingly, the extreme C zzso of the zzso encompasses both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these observations should prove useful for the rational design of a zzso zzso
