Construction of a zzso zzso zzso model based on the zzso zzso zzso structure is complicated by the low sequence similarity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso segments that creates significant uncertainty in their zzso We determined the orientation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso segments using zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso in either wild type or single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We zzso spontaneous and induced zzso bond zzso Reduction with zzso significantly zzso zzso currents in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso currents in these zzso and in zzso zzso zzso bonds formed between these zzso pairs, zzso that the zzso separation was at most zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lie on the same face of an zzso The unresponsive ones zzso zzso zzso lie on the opposite zzso In the resting state, the zzso side of zzso faces zzso In conjunction with the zzso structure, our data indicate that alignment of zzso and zzso zzso requires a single gap in the zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso had no effect, but zzso of zzso caused a significant increase in spontaneous channel zzso We zzso that, as the channel opens, the distance and/or orientation between zzso and zzso changes such that the zzso bond zzso the open zzso This begins to define the zzso motion that zzso zzso during channel zzso
