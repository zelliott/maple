DNA replication in zzso T4 requires the assembly of a structure called the zzso zzso near the 3' end of the DNA strand that is to be zzso This structure is a zzso ring of the T4 gene 45 product zzso and serves to regulate the zzso of the DNA zzso within the T4 DNA replication zzso The placement of this ring is performed by an zzso complex of the products of T4 genes 44 and 62 zzso that consists of four zzso zzso and one zzso zzso In an effort to understand the role of zzso zzso in processes occurring during the formation of the zzso T4 DNA sliding zzso we have performed direct zzso and product binding experiments and zzso and zzso kinetic experiments on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and product zzso binding studies show that the zzso complex binds zzso zzso molecules with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules with a zzso of zzso zzso The binding of the other reaction product zzso zzso could not be zzso zzso kinetic analysis of zzso zzso during the zzso process indicates a zzso progress curve, consisting of an initial rapid zzso phase with an zzso of four zzso molecules per zzso complex and a rate of 15 zzso followed by a second slower phase corresponding to the zzso rate of zzso zzso by this zzso The rate of the burst phase is zzso consistent with the previously observed rate of T4 DNA zzso zzso zzso The burst zzso depends solely on the concentration of zzso zzso binding sites zzso These results suggest that the formation of a single T4 sliding clamp requires the zzso of four zzso molecules by one zzso complex in a process requiring zzso to 1 zzso A model describing the zzso process is discussed in the context of these zzso
