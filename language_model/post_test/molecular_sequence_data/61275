zzso groups such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are characterized by their zzso zzso zzso and unique metal zzso zzso The metal zzso zzso can be broadly zzso either as zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso IX zzso zzso or as zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso The X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been solved to zzso A zzso Despite a lack of significant zzso acid sequence zzso the protein structure is zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso contain a zzso zzso previously identified as the metal zzso zzso but zzso contains a second zzso in place of the zzso acid zzso identified as a general base in zzso zzso zzso zzso has confirmed a role for this zzso and a nearby zzso acid in zzso zzso modulating metal zzso specificity as well as zzso zzso zzso to the predicted zzso binding site in zzso zzso the zzso binding site in zzso is clearly defined within a large horizontal zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso The structural similarity has implications for the understanding of the evolution of this zzso zzso zzso
