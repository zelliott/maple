The zzso zzso hormone zzso gene is expressed in both zzso and zzso unlike that of all other zzso zzso zzso in which expression is limited to zzso Previous studies of the zzso region of the zzso zzso promoter have revealed unique characteristics as well as similarities with the human zzso promoter, which demonstrates a similar pattern of zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso gene and have used tissue culture systems and transgenic mice to characterize its zzso Unlike the human promoter, the cloned zzso zzso promoter failed to direct zzso expression in either tissue culture or transgenic mouse models, suggesting an entirely different mechanism for zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso promoter was able to direct zzso expression in both tissue culture and transgenic mouse zzso In zzso cells, 550 base pair zzso was sufficient for zzso This expression involves promoter elements identified in other species as playing a role in zzso zzso but zzso of these elements reveals differences in their relative contributions to promoter zzso In mice, zzso zzso of zzso sequence allowed specific expression in zzso but not in zzso or zzso The pattern of zzso regulation observed in transgenic mice matched neither the repression that has been observed with human and bovine zzso promoters in transgenic mice nor the stimulation in zzso levels reported in zzso suggesting a unique mechanism that is not zzso in the transgenic zzso Thus the zzso zzso promoter uses a combination of zzso and unique features of gene regulation to direct its pattern of zzso zzso
