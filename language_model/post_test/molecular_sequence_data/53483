For several decades, zzso has been the drug of choice in the long-term treatment of zzso illness, but the molecular zzso zzso its therapeutic effects remain to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso C signaling system is inhibited by zzso at zzso relevant zzso and is a candidate target of zzso zzso zzso Two genes zzso human zzso have so far been isolated, namely zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Interestingly, several studies have indicated the presence of a zzso locus for bipolar disorder on zzso zzso zzso is therefore a candidate for genetic studies on both zzso and zzso treatment of zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso structure of zzso is composed of eight zzso ranging in size from 46 zzso to zzso zzso The promoter region contains several zzso elements and lacks a zzso features typical for zzso zzso By a preliminary zzso screening of zzso zzso in a sample of 23 Norwegian bipolar patients, we have identified nine single zzso zzso zzso Seven of the zzso were located in the zzso one was a silent transition in zzso 2 zzso and one was a transition in zzso 5 zzso resulting in a predicted zzso acid substitution zzso Our data show that even in a small sample of bipolar patients, several zzso of the zzso gene can be zzso zzso is therefore an intriguing candidate gene for future association studies of zzso zzso
