zzso gene transfer has been identified in only a small number of genes in zzso zzso an zzso which is naturally competent for zzso This report provides evidence for the genetic transfer of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso protein 3, in zzso zzso zzso structures of the zzso gene were found in several clinical zzso of zzso zzso To identify the origin of the mosaic zzso complete sequences of the corresponding gene from seven type strains of zzso species were zzso zzso of these sequences with mosaic regions identified a zzso zzso of the zzso gene between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains harboring identical zzso sequences were zzso by zzso gel zzso zzso Divergent zzso patterns among zzso zzso zzso strains from different hospitals indicated the potential for the genetic transfer of the zzso zzso gene between these zzso Moreover, transfer of the zzso gene from zzso strains to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains was evaluated in zzso zzso of a zzso strain (a zzso zzso of strain zzso and zzso strains resulted in the emergence of zzso and zzso clones at zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of these doubly resistant zzso by DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso testing, and zzso by zzso revealed that the zzso genes of zzso strains had transferred to zzso strains during zzso In conclusion, horizontal transfer of the zzso gene in zzso zzso can occur in an zzso and an zzso zzso
