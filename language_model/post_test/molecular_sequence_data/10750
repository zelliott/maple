We have isolated a full-length zzso corresponding to the zzso gene in zzso An unusual feature of the zzso is that it contains runs of zzso repeats in the zzso untranslated region, typical of genes that exhibit zzso It has a striking pattern of differential expression and is greatly enhanced in various fetal zzso This predicted protein encodes a unique zzso zzso that contains a large percentage of highly charged zzso and a possible nuclear zzso zzso A comparison to zzso sequence shows that zzso comprises 13 zzso spanning zzso zzso An examination of the human population indicates that the longest zzso run is zzso and varies in length from 8 to 12 zzso
