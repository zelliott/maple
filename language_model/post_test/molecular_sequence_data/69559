We have cloned a gene zzso a zzso protein by zzso screening of a zzso zzso library with a zzso zzso containing the sequence from the zzso promoter of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 collagen IV zzso The middle portion of this zzso acid protein has a region zzso to bacterial DNA zzso and the more zzso portion contains several zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 1 zzso also called replication factor zzso a human replication protein zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso generated against part of the zzso protein reacted specifically with the zzso component of the zzso human A1 complex, indicating that it is the zzso counterpart of the A1 zzso zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso fusion protein by gel zzso zzso revealed that it had a preference for a run of zzso on one zzso zzso analysis using zzso proteins revealed that the DNA zzso domain was required for zzso zzso The finding that the region required for the binding of zzso A1 zzso to DNA has similarity to a domain found in DNA zzso suggests that this region may be zzso by both proteins in recognizing zzso
