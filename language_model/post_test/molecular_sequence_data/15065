zzso disease zzso a zzso complex disorder of zzso zzso is often associated with other inherited zzso zzso genes involved in zzso zzso cases will not only help understanding the specific underlying diseases, but it will also give an insight into the development of the most frequent isolated zzso The association between zzso and zzso is not surprising as a large number of patients have been reported to show the same clinical association, most of them showing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a neural zzso zzso often involved in isolated zzso zzso zzso defects are believed to be necessary but not sufficient for the occurrence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this paper, we have carried out the molecular characterization of a patient affected with zzso disease and zzso zzso with a de zzso zzso balanced zzso zzso In particular, we have taken advantage of this zzso zzso to gain access to the zzso background possibly leading to zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso and molecular characterization of zzso and zzso the genes involved in the balanced zzso allowed us to zzso besides the zzso zzso zzso different additional factors related to zzso and zzso pathways which may have contributed to the genesis of enteric zzso in the present zzso
