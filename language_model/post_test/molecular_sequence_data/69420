zzso zzso zzso have been immortalized by the transfer of the zzso zzso gene into primary cultured cells from embryonic rat zzso The lines obtained are zzso zzso retain growth zzso and are able to zzso unless they are zzso with transforming zzso Depending on the growth conditions, these immortalized cells express zzso either zzso or zzso markers and zzso After being seeded in zzso zzso they display zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso and then they express zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso When grown in zzso zzso the cells express at first zzso zzso and then zzso zzso and zzso after reaching zzso zzso and zzso become zzso whereas the cells begin to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso These results indicate that the cell lines can undergo a differentiation reminiscent both of zzso zzso and of plastic zzso zzso zzso The cells were also genetically marked by the stable introduction of the zzso reporter zzso Thus, the lines could be useful for studying direct interactions in zzso or for zzso zzso They should also provide a model for studying the mechanisms involved in the commitment and in the control of proliferation and differentiation of this cell zzso This suggestion is consistent with the data indicating a growth zzso differential expression of a novel gene zzso a protein with a zzso zzso
