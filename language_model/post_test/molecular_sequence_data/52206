The binding of zzso hormone receptors to DNA is enhanced by zzso with nuclear zzso One such zzso partner has recently been characterized as the zzso X zzso zzso acid has been identified as a natural zzso for zzso X zzso suggesting a potential zzso interaction between zzso hormone and zzso acid in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso A transient zzso zzso was used to test for such an zzso When a complex zzso hormone response element composed of both direct and zzso repeat zzso was tested, these two zzso activated gene expression zzso In contrast, when the response element consisted only of directly repeated zzso zzso zzso X receptors enhanced zzso hormone zzso but zzso acid induced no additional zzso The results suggest a unique mechanism to achieve differential suggest a unique mechanism to achieve differential zzso hormone sensitivity of zzso zzso genes within a zzso Genes with appropriate response elements will show amplification of the zzso hormone response by zzso acid in the presence of zzso X zzso other zzso zzso genes will be influenced by zzso X zzso but not zzso zzso
