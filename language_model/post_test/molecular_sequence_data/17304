zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with cell death of the zzso pancreatic zzso in patients with Type 2 Diabetes zzso A likely cause for the zzso of human zzso is that it destroys the barrier properties of the cell zzso Here, we show by zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso that the process of zzso zzso formation is accompanied by a loss of barrier function, zzso lipids are extracted from the membrane and taken up in the forming zzso zzso No membrane interaction was observed when zzso zzso were zzso It is proposed that zzso zzso from the cell membrane is responsible for zzso membrane damage and that this represents a general mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso forming zzso
