A zzso toxin isolated from the Chinese scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel activity in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors partially zzso from rabbit skeletal zzso In zzso binding experiments, the toxin increased the affinity of zzso for the zzso from a zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso which is an enhancement similar to that seen with known zzso zzso such as zzso and high zzso of zzso In contrast, toxin enhancement was not observed with zzso zzso although intrinsic binding activity and stimulation by the conventional zzso zzso were zzso In single channel recordings of zzso activity, the toxin increased the open channel probability zzso from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Further toxin enhancement of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso was observed using zzso receptors in the presence of zzso When zzso receptors were zzso in the presence of zzso however, they showed a high value of zzso zzso and no further increase was observed following application of the zzso zzso derived from two different experimental methods consistently suggest that a zzso required for zzso enhancement is absent from the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of receptors prepared using three different protocols showed that zzso was missing from the zzso zzso zzso The scorpion toxin minimally enhanced zzso channel activity of cardiac zzso From these results, we conclude that the toxin zzso increases the activity of zzso zzso receptors by an indirect zzso possibly binding to associated protein zzso zzso is a strong candidate for such a zzso
