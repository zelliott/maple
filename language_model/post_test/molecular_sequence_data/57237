zzso of zzso gene expression of the components of the zzso system zzso in humans may play an important role in cardiovascular regulation and zzso Studies of human tissue zzso zzso however, have been limited by the lack of availability of sufficient amounts of fresh human zzso and a sensitive method for detecting specific zzso To demonstrate the presence of components of local zzso in humans we used the zzso chain reaction zzso after reverse zzso to detect zzso zzso and zzso zzso in small quantities of human zzso zzso indicated that all components of the zzso were widely expressed in human organ zzso In order to study changes of gene expression in small tissue samples zzso zzso zzso obtained from patients, we established a competitive zzso zzso for zzso of zzso using a zzso deletion zzso of the human zzso zzso as an internal zzso zzso concentration was zzso in the kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso and zzso vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso The method described here may serve as a highly sensitive tool to zzso zzso in gene expression in man under various zzso zzso This study should provide the zzso basis for future studies of tissue zzso in human physiology and zzso
