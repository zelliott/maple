The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of the core zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor, zzso Both are required for zzso transcription, but how the two proteins interact to create a functional, zzso zzso is still zzso zzso is similar to the single zzso zzso zzso which does not require additional factors for zzso initiation but whose activity is modulated during infection by association with zzso zzso In this study we used the zzso structure of zzso and zzso zzso as a model to define a potential zzso interaction surface on zzso making zzso zzso in zzso at positions predicted to reside at the same location as the zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso as having reduced interactions with zzso in a zzso zzso and a zzso petite zzso in zzso Although the zzso zzso has full activity in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso it is zzso for selective zzso from linear DNA templates containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter zzso can be rescued by template zzso but not by addition of a zzso zzso The fact that zzso of zzso results in selective zzso defects indicates that the core zzso like zzso plays an important role in promoter zzso
