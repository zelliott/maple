We report solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso type 1 integral membrane protein zzso zzso by the zzso zzso On the basis of a combination of zzso and zzso zzso chemical shifts under zzso spinning zzso effects of local mobility on zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso line zzso and zzso zzso exchange, we develop a model for the structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our data are largely consistent with earlier structural studies of zzso peptides by zzso and co-workers, in which solution zzso and solid-state zzso without zzso were used, but our data provide new information about local variations in the degree of mobility and structural zzso In addition, our data indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso extends beyond the zzso core of the zzso We find no evidence for zzso in the zzso and zzso contacts of the zzso zzso with the exception of two distinct chemical shifts observed for the C alpha and C beta atoms of A18 that may reflect distinct modes of zzso zzso These results have possible implications for the zzso structure of zzso zzso that form zzso zzso zzso
