In this study we zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso C1 from zzso zzso strain zzso As expected, the zzso zzso acid sequence of this strain was highly similar to sequences of zzso identified in two other strains of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli by the zzso expression system, and zzso by a zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso had an approximately zzso higher zzso and 15 zzso zzso than zzso for the zzso zzso zzso while zzso was zzso times faster than zzso and zzso in degrading the zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso resulted in a range of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating zzso zzso The zzso method used for zzso in this study is generally zzso to family 18 zzso and their zzso including inactive zzso some of which tend to bind almost zzso to zzso zzso The high specificity of the interaction with the zzso column material is zzso by aromatic zzso that occur in the zzso zzso and surfaces of the zzso
