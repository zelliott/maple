zzso evolution is most commonly studied by analyzing related protein sequences and generating ancestral sequences through zzso and zzso zzso methods, and/or by zzso ancestral proteins in the lab and performing zzso binding studies to determine zzso zzso and dynamic evolution have largely been left out of molecular evolution zzso Here we incorporate both structure and dynamics to zzso the molecular principles behind the divergence in the evolutionary path of the steroid zzso zzso We determine the likely structure of three zzso zzso ancestral steroid zzso proteins using the zzso and Assembly zzso with zzso zzso Our predictions are within zzso zzso zzso zzso of the respective crystal structures of the ancestral steroid zzso Beyond zzso structure zzso a particular feature of zzso is that it generates protein dynamics zzso We investigate the differences in zzso dynamics of zzso proteins by obtaining the most collective motion through essential zzso zzso our analysis shows that zzso zzso proteins of the same family do not share the same dynamic zzso while those sharing the same function are simultaneously clustered together and distant from those, that have functionally zzso Dynamic analysis also enables those zzso that most affect dynamics to be zzso It correctly predicts all zzso zzso and zzso necessary to evolve new function and zzso of zzso zzso necessary to recover ancestral zzso
