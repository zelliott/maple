zzso bacterial blight zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most important bacterial disease of zzso a staple food source for millions of people in developing zzso Here we present a widely zzso strategy for zzso the zzso components of a pathogen zzso We report zzso draft zzso for 65 zzso strains and deduce the zzso zzso of zzso across the areas where zzso is zzso Using an extensive database of zzso proteins from animal and plant zzso we identify the zzso repertoire for each zzso strain and use a comparative sequence analysis to deduce the least zzso of the zzso zzso These highly zzso zzso have been maintained over 11 countries, three continents, and 70 y of evolution and as such represent ideal targets for developing resistance zzso
