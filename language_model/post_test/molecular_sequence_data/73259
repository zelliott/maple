When zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso from human liver, two preparations were zzso One contained a zzso zzso as the main and minor smaller zzso including a zzso zzso and this preparation showed both the zzso and zzso zzso The other preparation was a zzso of the zzso zzso and showed only the zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that the native zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso which was zzso modified during zzso The zzso for the human zzso zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequences of the peptides derived from the components of the zzso preparations were located in the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso The preparation containing the zzso zzso was treated with a zzso and two zzso fragments were zzso The zzso and zzso fragments were located on the zzso and zzso sides, respectively, of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso The protein expressed by the zzso with the entire coding region exhibited both the zzso and zzso activities, and that expressed by a truncated version covering the zzso side exhibited only the zzso zzso The cloned zzso was identical to the human 17 zzso zzso IV zzso
