zzso and zzso studies have suggested that the plant plasma membrane zzso controls many important aspects of plant zzso including growth, development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have started the genetic analysis of this zzso by zzso both zzso and zzso clones of an zzso gene from zzso zzso The cloned gene is interrupted by 15 zzso and there is partial conservation of zzso boundaries with respect to animal zzso and zzso In general, the relationship between zzso and the predicted secondary and zzso structure of different zzso with zzso intermediate support a somewhat zzso correspondence between zzso and structural zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the plant zzso is more closely related to zzso and zzso zzso than to bacterial zzso or to animal zzso zzso and zzso There is evidence for the existence of at least three zzso of the plant zzso zzso These results open the way for a molecular approach to the structure and function of the plant zzso zzso
