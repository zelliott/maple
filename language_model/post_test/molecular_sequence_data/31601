In the zzso zzso nucleus, zzso zzso increases the expression of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso beta zzso has been localized to zzso zzso little is known about the zzso regulation of the zzso gene by zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso zzso also increases zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso regulates the zzso promoter through direct interactions with zzso A zzso cell line, zzso which zzso expresses zzso was zzso zzso with a zzso of the human zzso zzso region zzso cloned into a zzso reporter zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso caused a zzso increase of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso to bovine serum zzso which is cell membrane zzso had no effect on zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso or zzso zzso activity suggesting a classical zzso zzso In zzso analysis revealed an zzso element zzso zzso located within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this site abolished zzso zzso zzso These results support the concept that there is a direct and functional interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter to regulate zzso zzso We illustrate a direct regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso via a newly identified zzso zzso within the zzso promoter: zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by an zzso zzso while zzso membrane zzso form of zzso did not induce zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso
