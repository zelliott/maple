Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso and degrades zzso in red zzso Among the zzso acid zzso involved in its active site there are two zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso during the zzso process and zzso for which only speculative data have been made about the potential role during the zzso Another zzso acid zzso zzso had not been described as part of this active site but we have recently shown that a natural zzso zzso was highly zzso and showed severe zzso of its zzso zzso To understand better the exact role of these zzso replacements of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were performed by zzso zzso The results obtained in this report show that replacement of the zzso zzso completely abolished the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso our results afford arguments that it plays an essential role in the three zzso zzso zzso all these activities are abolished in the two zzso and zzso zzso whereas they are zzso though strongly diminished, for the zzso zzso In addition zzso at zzso could be distinguishable from those at zzso since the former resulted in a zzso zzso whereas no significant change in heat stability was observed for the zzso It is noteworthy that the zzso zzso is protected against zzso instability by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the three zzso showed characteristics identical to those found in the natural zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso of zzso activity, consistent decrease of zzso and zzso zzso activities whereas the zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso these zzso were unstable at 55 degrees C but zzso was able to protect them against zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was stable at 55 degrees zzso Its zzso and zzso zzso activities were normal but its zzso and zzso zzso activities were zzso In addition, zzso values for zzso were increased zzso in the zzso but normal in zzso activities, whereas zzso values for zzso were normal in zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
