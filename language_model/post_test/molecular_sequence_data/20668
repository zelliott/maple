zzso zzso is a recently identified zzso and zzso zzso derived from a portion of the zzso zzso zzso We provide zzso and expression data suggesting the existence of 13 zzso nuclear zzso predicted to maintain the open reading frames of 15 distinct full-length zzso zzso At least ten of these nuclear genes are expressed in human zzso and respond to zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparisons of the nuclear zzso zzso and their zzso in other species reveal two consensus zzso encompassing zzso 5-11 zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso in position 19 may determine whether the zzso is zzso or not, while zzso in position 13 may be important for cell surface zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in which zzso in position 13 is replaced with zzso is reduced compared to the wild type zzso zzso
