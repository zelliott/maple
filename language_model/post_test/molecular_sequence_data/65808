zzso of steroid receptors results in global changes of gene expression zzso Recent studies showed that steroid receptors control only a portion of their target genes directly, by promoter zzso The majority of the changes are zzso through zzso zzso The zzso that relay the hormonal signals to large-scale zzso changes are, however, zzso We report here that zzso a novel zzso nuclear zzso has the characteristics of a zzso regulator and may link zzso pathways to zzso We showed earlier that zzso is involved in the hormonal regulation of zzso arrest in cancer zzso To investigate its function we cloned and characterized zzso zzso and performed zzso and expression zzso zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso gene lineage and arose by zzso in early zzso The conservation and domain differences we found suggest, however, that zzso acquired novel zzso functions zzso the zzso zzso in zzso the hallmarks of zzso regulators, are absent in the zzso zzso Our results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso interface and we also identified its zzso and nuclear import signal zzso The results indicate that zzso in addition to its zzso zzso has the features and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso
