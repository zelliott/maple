The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that shows weak similarity to zzso zzso The protein is targeted to the sites of cell division and mature cell poles where, in zzso it controls the site specificity of cell zzso Although clear zzso of zzso are present only in zzso bacteria, and its role in division site selection is not zzso in the zzso zzso zzso coli, a zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion was targeted accurately to division sites and retained at the cell pole in this zzso zzso the same fusion protein was also targeted to nascent division sites and growth zones in the zzso zzso zzso zzso mimicking the zzso of the zzso zzso cell division protein zzso and zzso The results show that a targeting signal for division sites is zzso across the zzso zzso
