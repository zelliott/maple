zzso is a nuclear protein found highly expressed in normal zzso in those cells capable of zzso and in zzso zzso We report the cloning of zzso zzso human and zzso zzso The clones zzso a zzso zzso approximately two-thirds of the zzso predicts an zzso alpha zzso containing two possible nuclear zzso signals and a potential zzso zzso zzso The zzso third is exceptionally zzso comprised of approximately zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso the predicted zzso of human zzso is zzso Human and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso the predicted proteins are zzso identical and zzso zzso Although the structure of zzso is suggestive of a zzso factor, zzso did not significantly zzso zzso of a reporter construct when fused to the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso experiments, zzso inhibited the ability of a broad assortment of zzso pairs to transform rat zzso zzso including zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso and E6 + zzso In related experiments, zzso inhibited the ability of zzso zzso cells to grow in soft zzso whereas it failed to affect zzso focus formation in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a key role in zzso cell populations where it may act in the nucleus to limit their sensitivity to zzso
