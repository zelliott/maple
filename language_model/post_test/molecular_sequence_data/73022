The zzso like the human produces cortisol as its major zzso rather than zzso typical of most zzso zzso It is not known, however, if the zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso for cortisol formation, also exhibits zzso activity and if it zzso the formation of zzso zzso at the adrenal zzso To study this, we isolated the zzso of zzso from a zzso adrenal zzso This zzso was zzso and was found to have an open reading frame for a protein of zzso zzso zzso as compared to the human zzso which contains 508 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the coding region, is zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso The zzso was then cloned in the expression zzso zzso 1, which was zzso zzso into zzso 1 zzso The zzso cells were used for zzso studies on the transformation of zzso zzso and zzso When zzso cells were incubated with zzso rapid formation of zzso zzso The intermediate zzso accumulated initially with subsequent metabolism to zzso Likewise, when incubated with zzso zzso and zzso the zzso product zzso was produced zzso In these studies, with respect to the zzso pathway, the expressed zzso zzso gave similar results to bovine zzso zzso inserted in the same expression zzso However, in contrast to the bovine zzso which converted low amounts of zzso to zzso the expressed zzso zzso zzso showed an active metabolism via the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, using the complete zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso as the probe, demonstrated a strong presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso a weaker presence in zzso and zzso and no zzso species in brain, zzso and zzso zzso analysis using an zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso adrenal cell suspensions and zzso preparations were used to demonstrate the zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso both zzso were formed during zzso However, the ratio of zzso was much lower in adrenal cells than in zzso zzso 1 cells, indicating the presence of putative factors in zzso adrenal cells, favoring the zzso activity rather than that of the zzso In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that the zzso adrenal is both a zzso and a cortisol producer, and, therefore, this animal could be a suitable small animal model for the study of the role of zzso in relation to human zzso and zzso
