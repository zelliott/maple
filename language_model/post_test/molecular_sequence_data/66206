The zzso and zzso growth mode, the presence of zzso zzso zzso and the nitrogen availability were considered as parameters to study the regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso start point of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins with proposed regulatory function, was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso respectively, were used to zzso promoter zzso In zzso growth under nitrogen zzso the zzso promoter zzso showed increased zzso while in the zzso zzso the activity of zzso was reduced to zzso of the wild type and was independent of nitrogen zzso zzso activity in zzso was assessed using 2, zzso or 0 zzso of zzso as nitrogen source, zzso zzso activity was increased during early zzso growth, whereas in mature zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso to stalks of zzso zzso zzso led to an increased zzso activity at the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was confirmed by electron zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cultures was less dependent on the conditions zzso and presented an zzso zzso In zzso zzso was strongly activated during early stages of zzso development, but was inactive in mature zzso Under nitrogen zzso zzso zzso resembled that of zzso These data suggested a differential regulation of zzso zzso genes in zzso and zzso cells, as well as an important regulatory function of zzso when considering nitrogen zzso Interestingly, in zzso zzso zzso gene regulation showed a spatial distribution similar to zzso zzso zzso
