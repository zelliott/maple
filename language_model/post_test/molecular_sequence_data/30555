A zzso library was prepared from zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso probing was used to identify clones for zzso which are zzso by zzso juvenile hormone zzso In zzso transcribed zzso from these clones were translated in zzso and challenged with zzso specific for a known zzso juvenile zzso zzso protein zzso that is associated with zzso zzso Three clones were found which zzso zzso translation zzso their identity was confirmed by comparison of the zzso sequence of the mature zzso protein with the zzso zzso As zzso from the zzso zzso the protein encompasses zzso zzso acid zzso including a zzso signal zzso widely distributed as well as more localized stronger sequence similarities indicate that the protein is zzso related to zzso and zzso insect zzso However, on the basis of zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso zzso and hormonal sensitivity, the protein is distinct from previously described insect zzso Its juvenile hormone zzso can be ascribed to suppression of the zzso zzso zzso analysis using the cloned zzso as a probe demonstrated that the transcript zzso zzso zzso is of very low abundance during the penultimate stadium but becomes very abundant during the last zzso stadium, when juvenile hormone rapidly zzso Furthermore, treatment of larvae with a juvenile hormone analog strongly suppresses the abundance of the zzso
