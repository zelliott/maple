zzso a known inhibitor of the zzso II involved in processing of zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction at zzso doses of zzso the amount needed to increase zzso activity is zzso fold higher than required to completely inhibit zzso zzso Human zzso zzso when treated with these relatively high zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed a zzso fold increase in zzso incorporation into the zzso as compared to zzso of zzso zzso Analysis indicated zzso of zzso type, free zzso in the soluble zzso of the zzso zzso analysis of zzso obtained by zzso labeling of human zzso zzso showed synthesis of a new zzso at 58 zzso of zzso that contained zzso of the total zzso incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso This zzso fraction was resistant to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso O and zzso but was susceptible to zzso by Jack bean zzso and was bound zzso zzso to zzso zzso A similar zzso zzso profile was obtained from zzso labeled with zzso from mouse zzso melanoma and baby zzso kidney cells subsequent to zzso zzso zzso analysis of free zzso obtained from zzso revealed the presence of a zzso These results indicate the zzso of a free zzso zzso rather than expected zzso structure on treatment of cells with relatively high zzso of zzso
