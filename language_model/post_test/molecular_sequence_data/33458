A zzso zzso producing zzso was isolated and identified as zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso analysis reveals the presence of at least three zzso zzso The crude zzso exhibited zzso activity at 60 degrees C and pH zzso zzso composition and culture conditions for the zzso production by zzso zzso zzso were zzso using two statistical zzso The zzso statistical design was applied to find the key ingredients and conditions for the best yield of zzso zzso Five significant variables zzso grain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and initial zzso were selected for the zzso zzso The response surface zzso approach was used to determine the optimal zzso and zzso The zzso medium contained zzso zzso zzso grain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pH zzso The medium zzso resulted in a zzso increased level of zzso production zzso zzso compared with that obtained with the initial medium zzso zzso A successful and significant improvement in the production of zzso by the zzso strain was accomplished using inexpensive carbon zzso zzso grain of zzso allowing a significant reduction in the cost of medium zzso
