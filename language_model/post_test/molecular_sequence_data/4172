zzso protein zzso zzso play a vital role in cellular growth control, but far less is known about these zzso pathways in the context of embryonic zzso zzso and magnitude of zzso zzso are crucial factors in cell fate decisions, and reflect a balance between the activities of upstream zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso This zzso selectively interacts with, and is zzso activated by, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 and, to a lesser extent, the zzso zzso zzso These properties define the ability of this zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the zzso protein is predominantly zzso Furthermore, zzso B causes a complete zzso of the protein to the nucleus, implicating a zzso zzso region zzso zzso nuclear export signal in determining the zzso zzso of this zzso Finally, zzso in zzso zzso studies in mouse zzso reveal that the zzso gene is expressed specifically in the zzso developing liver and in migratory muscle zzso Our results suggest that this zzso may have a critical role in regulating the activity of zzso zzso during early development and zzso
