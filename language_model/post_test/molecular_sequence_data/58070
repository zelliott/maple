zzso the zzso of a family of zzso zzso integral membrane zzso associates zzso with a variety of zzso molecules and growth factors and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso in mature zzso and in a zzso regulated manner on zzso and induced zzso cells during zzso zzso appears to be involved in controlling the shape and organization of cells and zzso To better understand the function and regulation of zzso we determined the structure of the mouse zzso gene zzso zzso is approximately zzso zzso in size and is organized into five zzso that appear zzso in other family zzso zzso 1 encodes the signal zzso zzso 2, the zzso zzso attachment zzso zzso 3, the bulk of the zzso zzso zzso 4, the zzso zzso and zzso 5, the zzso and zzso zzso which are highly zzso between zzso family zzso zzso has three zzso start sites, two zzso sites, and is not alternatively spliced to produce its zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences have promoter activity and contain zzso and zzso boxes as well as a variety of other potential binding sites for zzso factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The structure of the promoter region suggests that control of zzso expression is both zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso discrete functional zzso of the zzso protein that are zzso throughout the zzso family, all zzso genes are likely derived from a common zzso
