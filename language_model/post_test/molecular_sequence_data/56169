The zzso gene encodes a component of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso mapping and primer extension analysis, we have identified the zzso initiation site of zzso The zzso activity from the promoter was detected only for the zzso cells more than 3 h after onset of the stationary zzso zzso from the zzso zzso initiation site was found a zzso sequence partially zzso to the promoter consensus sequence for the E zzso E zzso of zzso zzso Thus, it was strongly suggested that the identified zzso promoter, like some other crystal protein gene zzso was under the control of zzso 35, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
