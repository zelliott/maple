zzso zzso to fish zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from two zzso zzso rearing farms over a zzso zzso zzso were taken from the rearing site, zzso tank walls, water, and feed for larvae, and bacteria with zzso activity against zzso zzso were isolated using a replica zzso zzso zzso 19,000 colonies were replica zzso from marine zzso plates, and zzso strains were isolated from colonies causing clearing zones in a layer of zzso zzso When tested in a well diffusion zzso zzso 173 strains retained the zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tests identified 132 strains as zzso zzso and 31 as zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso gene of three strains confirmed the identification as zzso zzso zzso zzso were especially isolated in the spring and early summer zzso zzso of the 132 zzso zzso strains by randomly amplified zzso DNA with two zzso revealed that the strains formed a very homogeneous zzso zzso it appears that the same zzso was present at both fish farms and persisted during the zzso zzso This indicates either a common, regular source of the zzso or the possibility that a particular zzso has established itself in some areas of the fish zzso Thirty-one zzso were identified as zzso zzso and 18 of these were zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso strains were, in particular, isolated from the zzso tank walls, and it may be possible to establish an zzso beneficial zzso in the rearing environment of zzso larvae and thereby limit survival of zzso zzso
