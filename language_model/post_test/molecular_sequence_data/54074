In the canine model of zzso muscular zzso in golden retrievers zzso a point zzso within the zzso zzso site of zzso 6 leads to deletion of zzso 7 from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso causes early termination of zzso We have designed a DNA and zzso zzso zzso to induce host cell mismatch repair mechanisms and correct the zzso zzso to wild zzso zzso skeletal muscle injection of the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso compartment of a zzso affected male dog, and subsequent analysis of biopsy and zzso samples, demonstrated in zzso repair of the zzso zzso that was sustained for 48 zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated increasing levels of zzso 7 inclusion with zzso An isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed synthesis of zzso zzso product and positive zzso to the zzso zzso repair in muscle tissue was confirmed by restriction zzso length zzso zzso and sequencing the zzso zzso This work provides evidence for the long-term repair of a specific zzso point zzso in muscle of a live animal using a zzso zzso
