zzso A and B are major soluble proteins in zzso zzso Their zzso content is increased in the spontaneously zzso zzso zzso Is zzso zzso zzso storage of the zzso a specific feature of genetic zzso To explore this question, we measured zzso A zzso using a novel, synthetic zzso zzso in rat adrenal zzso 4-6 weeks after induction of the zzso one clip zzso model of zzso hypertension and in zzso control zzso We also measured zzso zzso of zzso A and B and zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso adrenal zzso A was zzso higher zzso zzso zzso in clipped rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were also higher in clipped zzso zzso zzso zzso activity (both zzso and soluble zzso and zzso zzso concentration did not significantly differ between the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso levels in clipped rats were zzso higher zzso zzso zzso than those in the control group, and zzso B zzso zzso levels were zzso higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso higher zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso synthesis and storage of zzso zzso A and B, zzso and their zzso zzso appear to be characteristic of both acquired and genetic zzso
