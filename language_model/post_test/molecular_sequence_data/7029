zzso zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso is primed by the cellular zzso zzso zzso Packaging of this zzso primer during zzso assembly is thought to be zzso by specific interactions with the reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that are required for interaction with the zzso protein remain poorly zzso We have used an zzso gel mobility shift zzso to measure the in zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso forms of zzso zzso The zzso loop could be zzso without eliminating zzso zzso However, zzso in the T zzso C stem were found to partially interfere with zzso zzso and D arm zzso were completely inactive in zzso zzso Interestingly, binding of the zzso protein to zzso zzso zzso the subsequent zzso of template strand to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with this finding, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso protein do contain a viral zzso zzso without an associated zzso zzso zzso We also found that a zzso primer zzso complex is efficiently recognized by zzso protein in zzso Extension of the template zzso over the T zzso C loop did result in complete zzso of zzso zzso suggesting the presence of additional recognition elements in the T zzso C zzso These results, combined with a comparative sequence analysis of zzso species present in zzso zzso and zzso motifs selected in zzso for high affinity zzso zzso suggest that zzso recognizes the central domain of the zzso zzso structure, which is formed by interaction of the D and T zzso C zzso
