The polarization of zzso cells is controlled by the concerted activities of zzso localized zzso The zzso zzso first identified in zzso zzso are common regulators of cell polarity zzso from zzso and flies to zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins and protein complexes establish cell polarity in zzso We have mapped zzso complexes formed around the putative human Par zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We employed a zzso approach zzso tandem affinity zzso zzso of protein complexes from cultured cells and protein sequencing by tandem mass zzso From these data we constructed a highly interconnected protein network consisting of three core complex zzso formed around zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The network confirms most previously reported zzso In addition we identified more than 50 novel zzso some of which, like the zzso zzso zzso occur in more than one distinct zzso We demonstrate that the complex formation between zzso zzso and zzso results in the zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso and to tight junctions and show that the zzso complex may activate zzso which are known to introduce zzso binding sites into several zzso Our findings suggest zzso and/or signaling events between the distinct Par complexes and provide a basis for further zzso of the molecular mechanisms that govern cell zzso
