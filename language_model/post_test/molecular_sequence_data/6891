Using the zzso shuttle zzso approach, we determined two zzso zzso zzso zzso (3 and 6 zzso in African green monkey kidney cells zzso One hundred and zzso independent clones (101 zzso zzso 45 at 3 zzso and 56 at 6 zzso 20 zzso showing functional zzso of the zzso gene were zzso One hundred and five plasmids zzso zzso zzso 41 at 3 zzso and 50 at 6 zzso 14 zzso showing no large zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced and 9 zzso showed at least one zzso in the zzso zzso The analysis of the 122 zzso zzso zzso and 66 at 3 and 6 zzso zzso revealed that: zzso the majority of the zzso were zzso base pair zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequent in the zzso (6 zzso than in the spontaneous zzso spectrum zzso zzso zzso zzso exact zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained at 3 and 6 zzso zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso were zzso located in both zzso and generated either a common hot spot zzso zzso zzso or hot spots exclusive for each zzso concentration (3 zzso position zzso zzso 6 zzso position zzso zzso zzso the occurrence of zzso transitions was significantly different as a function of zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso exact zzso the zzso G being almost exclusively preceded by a zzso zzso zzso at 6 zzso and by either zzso or zzso at 3 zzso and zzso by applying zzso rules, we found that sequences encompassing the three zzso hot spots shared identical zzso parameters for no more than 2 zzso steps zzso (or 3 zzso steps zzso to the zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is responsible, either directly or zzso for the majority of zzso zzso while zzso and/or zzso are probably responsible for zzso zzso The results suggest also that, in zzso cells, the efficiency of the repair zzso involved in the removal of zzso is influenced by the DNA sequence zzso All of these factors determine the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the induction of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
