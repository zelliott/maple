zzso zzso forms by zzso zzso The components of the developing zzso zzso are generally specific for that zzso The primary structures of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso been derived from zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso a fourth zzso zzso zzso The longest zzso zzso zzso clone has zzso zzso exclusive of the zzso zzso The primary structure of the zzso protein is zzso zzso acids in zzso Without zzso zzso the zzso protein has an zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso transcripts are not alternatively spliced and use a single zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses with an zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso is zzso and zzso by zzso zzso The parent protein is a zzso zzso that concentrates along the zzso face of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso products containing its zzso zzso are limited to the most superficial layer of the developing zzso zzso while other zzso zzso products are observed in deeper zzso
