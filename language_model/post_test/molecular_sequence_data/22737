A hallmark of prion diseases in zzso is a zzso transition of the cellular prion protein zzso into a zzso zzso termed zzso zzso is highly zzso in zzso moreover, genes of zzso proteins have been recently identified in zzso While there is only little sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso fish proteins were predicted to be modified with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso characterized two zzso proteins from zzso in cultured cells and show that both zzso and zzso are imported into the zzso zzso and are zzso modified with complex zzso and a zzso zzso zzso
