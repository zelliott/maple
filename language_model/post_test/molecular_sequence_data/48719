To investigate the effects of zzso magnetic fields zzso on zzso of mouse embryonic stem zzso zzso zzso bodies and zzso cardiac zzso cells and to assess the impact of zzso calcium zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso 

zzso bodies and zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso The expression of cardiac genes was evaluated by zzso zzso structures were assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells were examined by zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso bodies with zzso zzso increased the number of contracting zzso and cardiac areas as well as zzso expression of the cardiac genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cells zzso (1 zzso elevated both zzso and zzso increased expression of the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso as well as cardiac zzso This effect was due to zzso influx, since zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso absence of zzso calcium impaired zzso zzso Neither the zzso C inhibitor zzso nor zzso inhibited zzso increase in zzso excluding involvement of zzso calcium zzso zzso were generated through zzso zzso since zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso was zzso upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso totally abolished zzso zzso 

The ability of zzso zzso to enhance zzso differentiation of zzso cells allows high zzso generation of zzso without pharmacological or genetic zzso
