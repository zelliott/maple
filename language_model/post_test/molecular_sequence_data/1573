The crystal structure of the putative zzso protein zzso zzso also listed as zzso from zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso to a resolution of zzso A using anomalous zzso data at the zzso peak zzso zzso belongs to a family of proteins whose cellular function is associated with the signal recognition zzso no structural information has been available until now about the members of the zzso zzso analysis revealed that the overall fold of zzso consists exclusively of zzso and that zzso of the structure has good similarity to domain 4 of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This suggests its possible involvement in the zzso function of zzso zzso which includes interaction with zzso
