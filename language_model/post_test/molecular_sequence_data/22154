Alcohol is the major zzso agent for both chronic zzso and alcoholic liver zzso However, as only a minority of zzso develop either chronic zzso or alcoholic liver disease, there are clearly genetic or environmental zzso that determine individual zzso to these zzso 

To determine whether zzso of the zzso gene may account for individual zzso to develop chronic zzso or alcoholic liver zzso 

A controlled zzso 

We analyzed 73 patients with chronic zzso 103 healthy controls, 39 patients with alcoholic liver disease and 29 zzso without liver or pancreatic zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in chronic zzso compared to healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in alcoholic chronic zzso compared to healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The high zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in chronic zzso compared to healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in alcoholic chronic zzso compared to alcoholic controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A reduced capacity to produce zzso may be responsible for the induction of chronic zzso
