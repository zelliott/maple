Two proteins of 13 zzso and 38 zzso the components of zzso zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso for protein zzso tightly associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An zzso with properties of zzso zzso zzso II was detected in zzso preparations from both zzso zzso In zzso zzso another protein zzso with high zzso specificity toward those proteins was also zzso By using zzso zzso the protein band of 13 zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso was resolved respectively into three and four major forms of different zzso The same protein forms were zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso
