Nine zzso virus zzso zzso obtained from broiler zzso zzso and prairie chickens located in three different geographical regions in the USA, and three zzso obtained from known contaminated zzso vaccines were characterized using zzso chain reaction zzso and indirect zzso zzso zzso All zzso were zzso in chicken zzso zzso obtained from a specific pathogen free breeder zzso zzso analysis of all 12 zzso resulted in the amplification of the zzso zzso zzso repeat region zzso none of the zzso exhibited a different pattern or shift from the expected zzso product of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was determined by zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso indicated that all nine zzso from broiler zzso zzso and prairie chickens belonged to zzso 3, and are zzso related to the chick zzso virus zzso strain of zzso the zzso of zzso 3 zzso In contrast, the three zzso from contaminated vaccines were classified as zzso 2, and were zzso related to zzso necrosis virus zzso strain of zzso the zzso of zzso 2 zzso Three zzso representing zzso isolated from broiler zzso zzso and prairie chickens were cloned and further evaluated by DNA sequence analysis of the envelope zzso zzso from DNA sequence analysis confirmed those from zzso and indicated that the three zzso zzso representing those from broiler zzso zzso and prairie chickens are closely related to zzso of zzso with an zzso acid zzso of zzso or greater as compared with zzso with an zzso acid zzso of zzso or zzso Data from this study clearly indicate that zzso 3 is the most common zzso of zzso circulating in three different avian species, namely broiler zzso zzso and prairie zzso located in three different geographical regions in the United zzso
