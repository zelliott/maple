The early zzso increase in Na zzso across tight zzso is characterized by a zzso zzso of zzso Na channels zzso and pumps zzso In order to contribute towards the identification of zzso regulated zzso of this process, we first tested zzso of proteins previously suggested to be zzso zzso were treated for 1 h with zzso zzso zzso a concentration which produces a zzso transport response and at which both zzso and zzso receptors are zzso Northern zzso analysis showed no change in zzso of zzso G protein alpha zzso zzso and zzso energy metabolism zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were slightly increased zzso to zzso In a second approach, we zzso zzso zzso bands generated from A6 zzso by differential display zzso chain reaction zzso After 1 h of zzso treatment, approximately zzso of these appeared to be zzso Four zzso fragments corresponding to early zzso zzso zzso were cloned and for two of them zzso containing entire coding sequences were isolated by library zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and rat zzso a membrane protein structurally related to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso is the A transcript of zzso zzso The rapid zzso of the four zzso zzso to direct zzso effects since they were not inhibited by zzso but were blocked by zzso zzso The zzso values were similar or slightly below those reported for stimulation of Na zzso These characteristics of zzso zzso and their time courses suggest a possible role of one of these induced zzso in the mediation of the early effect of zzso on Na zzso
