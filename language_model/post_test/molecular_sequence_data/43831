A zzso zzso was developed for the detection and identification of zzso and zzso zzso The design of the zzso primer pair as well as the zzso zzso used for species identification was derived from a comparison of the sequences of the zzso zzso genes of various zzso zzso The zzso targeted a consensus sequence for a variety of zzso zzso The zzso was tested for sensitivity and specificity with zzso zzso and 85 zzso zzso To assess clinical zzso zzso blood samples from four defined groups were zzso group A zzso zzso zzso zzso groups B to D zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso without zzso colonization zzso zzso zzso zzso 29) and with zzso colonization zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients with documented invasive zzso infection zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso detected and, by zzso zzso identified most of the clinically relevant zzso and zzso species at 1 zzso of zzso zzso was zzso sensitive for all zzso and zzso tested, with zzso zzso being the only zzso species zzso with the zzso zzso zzso None of 35 group A patients and only 3 of 65 group B and C patients were zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso for specimens from patients with zzso (21 patients in group zzso was zzso if two specimens were zzso For zzso 3 of 189 specimens from patients at risk but with negative cultures were positive by the zzso for a specificity of zzso zzso preceded zzso signs by a median of 4 days zzso 4 to 7 zzso for 12 of 17 patients with zzso zzso or pulmonary zzso For the 10 patients with zzso responding to zzso therapy, zzso zzso became persistently negative after 14 days of treatment, in contrast to the case for 11 patients, who remained zzso positive while not responding to zzso zzso Thus, the described zzso zzso allows for the highly sensitive and specific detection and identification of zzso pathogens in zzso and in zzso zzso data from the screening of a selected group of patients revealed some value in the early diagnosis and monitoring of zzso zzso
