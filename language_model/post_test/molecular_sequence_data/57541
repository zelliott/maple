Since the inception of coronary zzso zzso with or without aspirin has been routinely given zzso to avoid coronary zzso zzso Recently, the direct zzso inhibitor zzso has been demonstrated to zzso zzso zzso The present study was a zzso dose escalation of zzso to determine its appropriate dose and feasibility as the sole zzso during coronary zzso 

At 11 participating centers, zzso patients undergoing zzso coronary zzso and zzso with 325 zzso aspirin daily were enrolled in sequential groups of zzso administered zzso instead of zzso as zzso group 1: zzso zzso zzso infusion, zzso zzso (54 zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion, zzso zzso (44 zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso and group 5: zzso zzso zzso infusion, zzso zzso (54 zzso The zzso infusion was maintained for 4 hours; the primary end point was abrupt vessel closure within 24 hours of the initiation of the zzso zzso zzso times zzso and activated partial zzso times zzso were serially zzso zzso vessel closure occurred in 18 patients zzso By intention to treat, the abrupt closure event rate for groups 1-3 was zzso compared with zzso in groups 4 and 5 zzso zzso zzso There were no significant bleeding complications except for one patient in group 1, who received a zzso zzso A zzso curve of both zzso and zzso was zzso no coronary zzso zzso occurred in the small number of patients with ACT zzso 300 zzso 

The present study documents for the first time that it is possible to perform coronary zzso with an zzso other than zzso in zzso zzso zzso was associated with a rapid zzso zzso zzso effect, minimal bleeding zzso and at doses of zzso zzso a rate of zzso for abrupt vessel zzso
