zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso widely used for the production of fermented dairy zzso The two-dimensional zzso zzso protein profile was obtained from three independent analyses of zzso gels of soluble proteins of the strain zzso About zzso spots were detected by silver zzso and the average molecular weight and zzso point of each protein spot were calculated to be 41 600 and zzso zzso Twelve proteins were zzso by zzso techniques because their concentration was too low for direct sequencing from zzso Eleven were located in the zzso zzso profile after silver zzso These preliminary results contribute to the setting up of a two-dimensional image (or reference zzso of the proteins from zzso zzso in order to identify and compare strains of various origin or to follow zzso process such as zzso zzso zzso of two strains zzso and zzso of zzso zzso grown in exponential phase at 42 degrees C with zzso were compared with an image analysis zzso Among the zzso located proteins in the zzso zzso profile, nine were found in zzso and eight in zzso zzso One protein was specific to zzso The eight proteins could play the role of internal zzso PAGE markers of zzso and Mr for zzso zzso
