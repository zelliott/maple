zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only identified zzso zzso zzso strain capable of productive replication at a high zzso dose of virus zzso zzso in zzso To evaluate whether lower doses of zzso would zzso zzso rabbits and to obtain an estimate of the 50% infectious dose, zzso zzso rabbits were zzso orally with zzso at zzso doses of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Based on zzso virus zzso or infectious virus zzso zzso replication was observed with zzso doses of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso transmission of zzso to one of three zzso rabbits occurred 4-5 days after onset of virus zzso shedding in zzso zzso zzso infected at zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso developed zzso immune responses and were completely zzso protected from zzso zzso zzso zzso These data confirm that zzso can replicate zzso and spread zzso in zzso In attempts to zzso the genetic basis of the unusual replication efficacy of zzso in zzso the sequence of the gene zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of three zzso zzso revealed a high degree of zzso acid identity zzso with zzso Since zzso and zzso strains also share similar zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso might replicate efficiently in rabbits because of the high zzso of these three gene products, each implicated in host range zzso
