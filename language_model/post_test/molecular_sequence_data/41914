The zzso of normal, zzso animal cells contains gene sequences which are closely related to zzso infectious zzso zzso These zzso are called zzso zzso which have been isolated from a variety of zzso The zzso zzso zzso are stable genetic entities that are inherited in zzso zzso In this study, we found the existence of many related zzso zzso in human zzso by zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also contained a variety of restriction zzso length zzso zzso We carried out molecular cloning of four zzso fragments among their zzso zzso zzso The four zzso were named zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A single copy of zzso 2 and 3 was integrated in human zzso whereas zzso of zzso were zzso In sequence comparison, all of the four zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was located only on Y zzso and had the zzso sequence with human zzso zzso zzso on Y zzso The zzso sequence of zzso as well as zzso might have an important role on investigating the origin and differentiation of Y zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso of not only primates but lower zzso such as zzso It is suggested that zzso might be integrated into zzso zzso in early stage of zzso zzso zzso was a fragments of zzso zzso containing a sequence having zzso to zzso small nuclear zzso and other moderately repetitive sequences within the envelope zzso zzso existed only in the zzso of human and zzso zzso but not in those of lower zzso
