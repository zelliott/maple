The zzso zzso Factor zzso belongs to the family of zzso proteins that use the energy of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in a variety of cellular zzso Several zzso genes are disrupted in cancer, suggesting a role of tumor zzso Similarly, the zzso gene was recently found to be zzso by zzso in a number of advanced colon and gastric zzso However, other zzso indicated a zzso zzso zzso in cell lines derived from various zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso 

In the present study, we investigated zzso expression by zzso in a model of kidney tumors induced by continuous administration of zzso to male Syrian golden zzso A strong labeling was already detected in small tumor zzso making zzso an early cancer marker in this zzso Although every cell stained for zzso at this early stage, the number of zzso cells decreased to zzso with cancer zzso and these positive cells were dispersed in the tumor zzso zzso expression was zzso in the zzso cell line established from kidney tumors, but again only zzso of positive cells were found in zzso produced by zzso cells in nude zzso 

In conclusion, our data suggest that zzso gene zzso is linked to initial steps of zzso in this model and should be investigated in early stages of other zzso
