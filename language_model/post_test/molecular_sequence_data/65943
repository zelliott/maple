The zzso factor zzso is an upstream regulator in early zzso development and a key zzso of zzso in embryonic stem zzso zzso binds to promoter elements of hundreds of target genes and regulates their expression by an as yet unknown zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and analysis of its interaction with a DNA element derived from the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso acid pairs, unique among HD zzso appear to affect the mechanism of zzso DNA recognition as well as maintain the integrity of the structural zzso To assess selective DNA recognition by zzso we performed zzso mobility shift zzso using a panel of modified DNA binding sites and found that zzso HD zzso binds the zzso zzso A series of rational zzso experiments probing the role of six zzso zzso of zzso on its DNA binding function establish their role in affecting binding affinity but not binding zzso Together, the structural and functional evidence establish zzso as a distant member of a zzso HD despite having considerable variation at the sequence zzso
