zzso of enveloped viruses into cells is initiated by binding of their envelope zzso zzso to cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso fever virus zzso has two zzso zzso and zzso with poorly understood role in binding to susceptible zzso We expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso and identified independently folded soluble zzso fragments, one of which zzso zzso zzso bound zzso susceptible cells supposedly by interacting with a putative zzso This zzso binding domain zzso was used to identify its interacting partner by zzso and mass zzso Thus we identified the human cell surface zzso as a putative zzso entry zzso zzso was expressed on all susceptible cells tested but not on the surface of cells resistant to zzso zzso Further studies are needed to explore the zzso function as a plausible zzso zzso and the molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso The identification of the zzso zzso and its binding partner could provide novel targets for therapy and tools for prevention as well as more complete understanding of the mechanisms of zzso entry and zzso
