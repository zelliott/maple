DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso circular zzso is scattered in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and has significant consequences for evolution of the zzso zzso zzso We determined the complete zzso sequence of zzso a zzso virus of zzso zzso a zzso zzso to zzso by comparison with zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso and zzso the defining features of this important zzso The zzso zzso DNA contains nine zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso viruses and five zzso unique to zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso were zzso identical to those of their zzso zzso zzso The zzso predicted zzso 1 product (Mr zzso was considerably smaller than those of known zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, in contrast to those zzso zzso lacked an zzso with recognizable similarity to a zzso zzso 2 of all three viruses had a zzso among the products of genes of zzso a virus of zzso zzso another zzso The results suggest that, at most, only slightly more than half of zzso zzso consists of genes shared by all zzso viruses of the zzso
