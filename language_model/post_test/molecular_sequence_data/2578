Mouse melanoma cells in culture respond to zzso hormone zzso by demonstrating increased activity of zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso Because this stimulation is strictly dependent upon continued zzso and translation, we have carried out studies to determine if zzso increases the level of zzso zzso The abundance of zzso message levels in melanoma cells treated with either zzso or zzso zzso was determined by Northern zzso analysis utilizing a zzso base pair mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso expression library generated from zzso isolated from zzso zzso melanoma zzso The abundance of zzso zzso was determined in an zzso cell clone zzso and a zzso cell clone zzso The zzso cell line had five times as much zzso activity and almost 10 times more zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso increased in both cell lines after zzso zzso The zzso line treated with zzso for three days showed a fivefold increase in zzso activity and a twofold increase in zzso zzso The zzso cell line treated with zzso for three days showed a zzso increase in zzso activity and an zzso increase in the abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso activity and the zzso of zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso acting through zzso promotes an zzso of zzso zzso
