zzso of the zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso factors and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a feature of many human zzso and may be unrelated to tissue zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso regulates zzso and zzso expression in zzso by targeting the alpha zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in sporadic clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso and zzso However, zzso without zzso zzso may demonstrate zzso zzso suggesting that zzso independent pathways for zzso zzso also zzso In zzso three candidate zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be dependent or independent of zzso zzso 

To investigate zzso zzso and FH for zzso zzso in sporadic zzso 

Gene zzso was zzso in primary zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso high performance liquid zzso followed by direct sequencing of zzso zzso zzso FH and zzso zzso analysis were performed by single stranded zzso zzso and direct sequencing of zzso zzso 

No zzso were identified in the three genes zzso 

There was no evidence to suggest that zzso zzso occur in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso in sporadic zzso
