zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso The results of zzso for the level of accumulated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso strain by primer extension experiments and for the level of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso of the zzso gene is induced zzso zzso by zzso as compared to zzso as the sole nitrogen source in the presence of zzso as carbon zzso zzso induction is zzso by zzso as compared to zzso as the carbon source, and by zzso zzso zzso repression is relieved in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso This suggests that zzso repression of zzso and zzso metabolism are due to the same mechanism in zzso which involves zzso zzso
