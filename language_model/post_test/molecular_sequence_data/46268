zzso zzso are zzso complexes that are formed by highly specific interactions between one of the repeated zzso zzso present in the scaffolding protein and a zzso module of the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso has a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso in which two zzso acid zzso are species specifically zzso within the two segments of the zzso zzso it can recognize zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The importance of these two zzso zzso zzso which are part of the recognition site of the zzso and zzso interaction, was investigated by introducing zzso into the first and/or the second segments of the zzso zzso zzso in the first segment did not affect the interactions between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso in the second segment prevented binding to zzso zzso A second round of zzso within the first segment zzso the affinity for both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso However, this was not observed for a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the combination of the first and second zzso segments is important for the target zzso
