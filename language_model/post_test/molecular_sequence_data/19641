Patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso exhibit higher levels of zzso zzso DNA zzso in their brain, suggesting a reduced or defective zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, this study investigated 14 zzso patients and 10 zzso controls for zzso of the major zzso removal gene zzso Whereas no zzso were detected in any control samples, four zzso patients exhibited zzso in zzso two carried a common single base zzso deletion that alters the zzso terminal sequence of zzso and the other two had zzso zzso leading to single zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protein zzso by the zzso zzso completely lost its zzso zzso activity, and that the two single zzso zzso proteins showed a significant reduction in the zzso zzso These results were consistent with the fact that nuclear extracts derived from a limited number of zzso patients with zzso zzso exhibited greatly reduced zzso zzso activity compared with zzso controls and zzso patients without zzso zzso Our findings suggest that defects in zzso may be important in the zzso of zzso in a significant fraction of zzso patients and provide new insight into the molecular basis for the zzso
