zzso zzso zzso deer zzso zzso zzso and six mule deer zzso zzso zzso from south-central British Columbia, Canada, were tested for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by zzso with universal zzso zzso zzso detecting a wide range of zzso No deer tested positive for zzso zzso with universal zzso zzso zzso followed by sequencing of cloned fragments detected an zzso zzso in one of 23 zzso zzso and six of six zzso MD and zzso zzso in four of 23 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was genetically distinct from zzso and all other recognized members of the zzso Four of six zzso MD and 0 of 23 zzso zzso were zzso positive by zzso with zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequences of zzso zzso fragments were identical to each other and to the respective region of the zzso gene of an zzso zzso which we detected previously in naturally infected cattle from the same area, suggesting the possibility of biological transmission of this zzso between cattle and wild zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein of zzso were detected using a competitive zzso zzso zzso in two of six zzso MD, but not in zzso The two zzso MD were zzso positive for both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected in this study, suggesting a reaction of zzso against one or both of these zzso with the zzso zzso
