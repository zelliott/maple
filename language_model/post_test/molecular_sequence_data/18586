zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely recognized as a key zzso in zzso metabolism in zzso However, nothing is known about this gene family in zzso zzso rubber zzso Here, we identified six zzso genes in zzso that comprise the entire zzso family in this zzso Analysis of the gene structure and zzso of the zzso genes demonstrates evolutionary conservation in the zzso families across zzso and other plant zzso The expression of zzso genes was investigated via zzso sequencing and quantitative zzso in various zzso at various zzso of leaf development, and under zzso stresses and zzso zzso The zzso genes exhibited distinct but partially redundant expression zzso Each tissue has one abundant zzso zzso with zzso 4 and 5 being the zzso zzso in latex zzso of zzso zzso bark and zzso zzso zzso and 6 were barely expressed in any tissue zzso In mature leaves zzso all zzso genes were expressed at low levels, but zzso and 4 were abundantly expressed in immature leaves zzso Low temperature and drought treatments conspicuously induced zzso expression in root and zzso suggesting a role in stress zzso zzso and 3 transcripts were decreased by zzso treatment, consistent with the reduced zzso activity of zzso zzso in the latex in response to zzso zzso Our results are beneficial to further determination of functions for the zzso genes in zzso trees, especially roles in regulating latex zzso
