zzso zzso zzso was rapidly isolated from spinach leaves with special care to suppress zzso zzso The molecular mass of this zzso preparation was estimated to be 35 zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Limited zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was effectively suppressed by high pH (at pH zzso concentrated zzso and low zzso On the basis of these zzso a new isolation procedure was designed to obtain zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The resulting final preparation still contained two zzso zzso One appeared to zzso to the longest zzso so far reported for spinach zzso zzso et zzso 1984, zzso 23, zzso while the other lacked a zzso zzso from its zzso zzso Conventional preparation procedure without suppression of zzso action yielded an zzso preparation with a molecular mass of 33 zzso This zzso preparation consisted of three zzso They lacked 11 to 17 zzso zzso while their zzso structure was retained zzso These results showed that zzso degradation of the spinach zzso zzso during zzso took place exclusively at its zzso zzso and further suggested that zzso zzso with zzso structure should be the mature zzso zzso functional in the zzso zzso
