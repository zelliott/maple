zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso distribute in the collecting duct of the zzso Although the function of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso has been investigated in detail, the role of zzso in the collecting ducts has not been zzso In the present study, we have investigated the role of the zzso zzso in zzso promoter zzso We cloned the zzso region of rat zzso zzso and investigated zzso promoter activity in the zzso cell line zzso to express rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a transient increase, followed by a sustained decrease, of zzso promoter activity in these zzso This zzso decrease of zzso promoter activity was inhibited by zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso this decrease of zzso promoter zzso On the contrary, zzso increased zzso promoter zzso These zzso and zzso effects were not observed on the deletion segment of the zzso region lacking zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, 1) expression of the zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso cells, and 2) expression of the zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso These opposite effects of zzso and zzso appear to be regulated by the same promoter region of zzso and zzso
