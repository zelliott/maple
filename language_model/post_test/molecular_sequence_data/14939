Given that the intensive application of zzso in aquaculture, animal zzso and malaria treatment has lead to an increase in zzso discharge into the environment, there is an increasing need to find a way to zzso zzso zzso The bacterial strain zzso was isolated from a marine environment and is capable of degrading zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso based on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso after zzso zzso zzso was zzso into mineral salt plus zzso media containing zzso zzso for 2 zzso The degradation efficiency under different environmental conditions was characterized using zzso The optimal temperature and pH for zzso zzso were around zzso and zzso zzso The optimal zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso were determined to be approximately zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso of zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso showed significantly reduced zzso to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is a new bacterial resource for degrading zzso and indicate the potential of the isolated strain in the zzso of zzso zzso
