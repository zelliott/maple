Factor VIII zzso administration elicits specific zzso zzso zzso in about zzso of patients with zzso zzso The majority of such zzso zzso with zzso C2 zzso zzso is a zzso human zzso zzso zzso directed toward the C2 domain, which is representative of a major class of human zzso zzso zzso zzso were raised to zzso to establish their zzso potential toward zzso One mouse zzso zzso zzso specifically prevented zzso binding to zzso C2 domain and fully neutralized zzso functional zzso zzso Modeling of the 3-D zzso of zzso zzso and alignment with the 3-D structure of the C2 domain showed putative 31 zzso zzso acid zzso either identical or zzso to the C2 zzso These included one C2 zzso site, zzso but not zzso Forty putative contact zzso with zzso were zzso zzso zzso neutralized zzso zzso activity in mice with zzso A zzso with human zzso zzso zzso allowing full expression of zzso zzso It also neutralized in an zzso zzso approximately 50% of zzso zzso zzso obtained from 3 of 6 unrelated zzso zzso is the first example of an zzso zzso that fully restores zzso activity in zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso The present results establish the in zzso and in zzso proof of concept for zzso zzso of a major class of zzso zzso
