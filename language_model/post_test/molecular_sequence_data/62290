zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that functions in zzso gene zzso zzso formation, DNA repair, and suppression of DNA zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso zzso but its zzso roles are still not zzso We found that the level of zzso expression during zzso was zzso The highest zzso zzso expression was detected as early as embryonic day zzso zzso Although the level was zzso during zzso a high level of expression was still found in the late embryonic stage zzso In zzso zzso was expressed at high levels in the heart, brain, spinal cord, and zzso root zzso The expression levels in these zzso were high on zzso and low on zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction showed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso content in the heart between zzso and zzso After zzso the expression level in the heart remained constant up to 27 months of zzso The expression pattern of zzso protein in embryonic hearts was consistent with that of zzso These results suggest new roles of zzso not only in early zzso but also in zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso
