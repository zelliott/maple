This report concerns the study of zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso expression in primary tumors of the urinary zzso zzso chain zzso techniques and computerized image analysis were zzso The data obtained were related to tumor grade, DNA zzso and tumor zzso A point zzso zzso at zzso zzso 12 was found in 30 of 67 zzso The zzso frequency was greater in grade III zzso than in grade II zzso zzso no zzso were observed in grade I zzso The zzso was observed more often in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso No other substitution at zzso 12 was seen and no zzso 61 zzso was zzso The tumors were also tested for the zzso zzso at position zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 and zzso D zzso were identified in seven high-grade zzso zzso six were zzso The levels of the zzso gene product zzso were approximately 10 times higher in tumors with zzso D zzso than in those zzso These findings confirm on human zzso tumors the observations of the effect of zzso zzso zzso reported on the zzso cancer cell line zzso Our results are the first demonstration of zzso zzso D zzso in human tumor zzso and suggest that concurrent zzso at zzso 12 and zzso D of this gene within the same tumor may contribute to the aggressive behavior of human zzso zzso
