zzso an adhesive surface zzso produced by zzso coli and zzso was proposed on the basis of genetic evidence to follow a distinct assembly zzso involving an zzso intermediate of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of which can be induced at the cell surface by a zzso protein zzso Here we show zzso that zzso is actively zzso to the zzso milieu and that zzso is surface zzso We demonstrate that the putative zzso assembly factor zzso is an outer zzso zzso zzso is highly resistant to zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso During zzso zzso zzso is required to maintain the stability of zzso and zzso In line with this, it is possible to zzso the zzso levels of zzso and zzso by varying zzso levels of zzso This suggests that, in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso Moreover, zzso production and zzso levels of zzso and zzso can be increased above zzso levels by zzso of zzso meaning that the quantity of assembled zzso zzso can be controlled by this zzso
