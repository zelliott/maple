zzso zzso type 2 is selectively expressed in zzso target zzso where it zzso zzso selectivity for the zzso zzso by zzso zzso with a high affinity for the zzso zzso The present investigation aimed to zzso the mechanisms accounting for the rigorous control of the zzso gene in zzso Using zzso zzso in zzso zzso via zzso zzso we identified potentially important regions for zzso regulation in human cell zzso two zzso regions in the first zzso (I and zzso and two upstream elements zzso and zzso The zzso suggest a correlation between the extent of in zzso protein occupancy at three of these regions zzso II, and zzso and the rate of zzso zzso in cells with high zzso intermediate zzso zzso and zzso or low zzso zzso levels zzso Moreover, gel shift zzso with nuclear extracts from these cell lines revealed that decreased zzso expression is related to a decreased binding activity with zzso containing the putative regulatory zzso zzso zzso identified the majority of the components of the binding complexes as the zzso factors zzso and zzso Finally, transient zzso with various deletion zzso reporters define positive regulatory elements that might account for zzso and selective expression of zzso zzso type zzso
