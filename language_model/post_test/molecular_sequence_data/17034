We report the complete sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso isolate from the Dead zzso The zzso is organized into nine circular zzso of varying zzso compositions ranging from zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests a common zzso for the two organisms and a zzso of significantly reduced size in the zzso Both of these zzso zzso use the same strategy of high surface negative charge of folded proteins as means to circumvent the zzso phenomenon in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso approach, including primary sequence similarities, protein family signatures, structure zzso and a protein function association network, has assigned putative functions for at least zzso of the zzso predicted zzso a far larger number than is usually achieved in most newly zzso zzso Among these assigned functions were genes zzso six zzso 19 zzso and/or zzso domain signal zzso and an unusually large number of environmental response zzso five times as many as those zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is significantly more zzso capable of exploiting diverse zzso In comparing the zzso of the two zzso zzso in addition to the expected extensive zzso we discovered several differences in their zzso strategies and zzso responses such as distinct pathways for zzso breakdown in each zzso Finally, as expected from the larger zzso zzso zzso encodes many more functions and seems to have fewer nutritional requirements for survival than does zzso zzso zzso
