An zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes an zzso zzso zzso was found to be more sensitive to zzso stress caused by organic zzso compared with the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso strain had multiple defects in a large array of cellular functions that were consistent with zzso of zzso properties, such as cell zzso in stationary phase, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abilities, as well as zzso zzso and zzso All zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso by in trans expression of zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso strain was found to affect the same set of zzso suggesting that the zzso effects were caused by the zzso zzso zzso was also found to be fully zzso but it lost zzso at a higher rate than the zzso during growth, such that most zzso cells were zzso in stationary zzso Despite these zzso the zzso did not differ from the zzso in short-term colonization of sterile wheat roots when zzso alone, and in competition with the zzso zzso this implied that zzso activity may not zzso the cells with a competitive advantage in colonization under these zzso Although the exact function of zzso in affecting these zzso remains to be determined, changes in cell zzso surface properties, zzso zzso and zzso are common zzso responses to various stresses in bacteria, and the data obtained here suggest that zzso contributes to modulating such stress responses in zzso zzso
