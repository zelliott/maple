Three dominant proteins zzso 48, and 49 zzso were detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso in zzso preparations of the zzso zzso zzso (AP) of zzso zzso All three proteins bound to the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and were associated with maximum zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence for the zzso and zzso proteins matched that reported by others for zzso whereas the sequence for the zzso protein was unique and was not zzso to any known zzso Time course studies demonstrated the simultaneous presence of all three zzso supporting evidence that the zzso and zzso proteins were not breakdown products of zzso Previous studies did not detect zzso in zzso gels of zzso zzso preparations stained with periodic acid and silver, making zzso an unlikely explanation for the observed differences in the molecular masses of the zzso Some zzso zzso directed against the zzso protein reacted with the zzso and zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso Other zzso zzso however, reacted only with the zzso zzso We conclude that three zzso zzso proteins occur in zzso zzso zzso two have the same zzso acid N zzso as that reported for zzso whereas the third has a unique zzso All three proteins should be considered when zzso studies to determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso or when preparing specific zzso for zzso capture zzso
