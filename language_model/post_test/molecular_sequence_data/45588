A new, apparently innocuous virus was found while investigating the cause of zzso slow growth syndrome zzso in cultured black tiger shrimp zzso zzso It was identified via zzso zzso clones of zzso coli containing randomly amplified zzso fragments produced from total zzso acid extracts of zzso from zzso zzso Of zzso zzso 30 that failed to give positive dot zzso zzso with a zzso zzso shrimp DNA probe were zzso and compared to zzso zzso Of these, 22 corresponded to known shrimp DNA zzso Of eight that did not, one zzso showed significant deduced zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the viruses in the family zzso and alignment revealed commonly zzso zzso acids including a zzso motif believed to be at the zzso active zzso However, zzso analysis showed that the virus sequence did not cluster with the zzso or other known zzso virus zzso Thus, in accordance with frequent practice, it was named according to the area where it was first collected as zzso virus zzso In zzso zzso with a zzso zzso insert revealed strong zzso zzso confined to the zzso organ zzso the heart and zzso zzso tissue in both normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso clone sequence also gave positive results with both normal and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso of zzso tissue revealed zzso particles of approximately 27 zzso diameter zzso the zzso size zzso in locations that matched those of positive in zzso zzso reactions in parallel zzso Although not directly associated with zzso in zzso zzso the presence or effect of this virus with other zzso species is presently zzso
