zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Unlike zzso which acts on several neutral and basic zzso zzso zzso is highly specific for zzso zzso zzso Based on molecular modeling and simulated zzso zzso zzso a zzso mouse zzso carrying two zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso was generated zzso zzso This zzso and two previously constructed zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso were characterized to investigate the role of zzso and zzso in the zzso specificity of mouse zzso The zzso and zzso zzso acquired a broad specificity for several neutral and basic zzso zzso and showed a considerable decrease in activity against zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, did not show any additional specificity for neutral or basic zzso acids and its activity against zzso zzso acids was greatly zzso The kinetic properties of these zzso indicated that the zzso zzso is important for the zzso activity and zzso specificity of mouse zzso However, zzso is, apparently, only marginally involved in zzso recognition, but is important for zzso zzso zzso the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso differed significantly from that of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has subsidiary effects on zzso zzso Additional experiments using several zzso and zzso zzso also suggested the involvement of zzso in the zzso specificity and zzso activity of mouse zzso and that zzso is possibly involved in zzso recognition by this zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso and zzso play crucial and subsidiary zzso respectively, in the zzso specificity of mouse zzso
