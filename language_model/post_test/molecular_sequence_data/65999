To investigate the zzso of zzso and zzso single zzso zzso zzso of T cells zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso population and address the question whether they are in linkage zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene were examined by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso methods in 147 healthy zzso Han zzso zzso equilibrium and zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the 3 zzso were in agreement with zzso zzso Minor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso The dominant zzso zzso the three zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that all of the zzso of linkage zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene are in complete linkage zzso Our study has provided population genetic data on zzso gene in Chinese zzso Han population and a basis for searching zzso zzso zzso zzso
