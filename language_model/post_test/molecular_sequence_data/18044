zzso zzso have been induced against the synthetic zzso with sequence zzso This zzso represents zzso zzso of the mature von zzso factor zzso zzso and contains the sequence zzso thought to be important in zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Twelve zzso were zzso eight of which bound to native zzso as well as to the zzso zzso zzso onto zzso zzso These zzso defined at least three distinct zzso as demonstrated by zzso interaction with peptides having a single zzso substitution at each position in the zzso In particular, two zzso bound to zzso on zzso that included one or more of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thought to be involved in binding to zzso zzso whereas one zzso bound to an zzso that did not include any of those zzso Nevertheless, the three zzso zzso with each other, a finding explained by the fact that the corresponding zzso had at least two zzso in common, namely zzso and zzso In spite of the zzso for binding to zzso only the two zzso whose zzso included zzso in the zzso sequence inhibited zzso interaction with zzso zzso The third zzso had no zzso effect even though it was bound to an zzso located at a distance of only few zzso on the zzso terminal side of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso raised against a single synthetic zzso with sequence limited to zzso zzso may exhibit distinct zzso specificity and may be used to define functional zzso in zzso with a high degree of zzso
