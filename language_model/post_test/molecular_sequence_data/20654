The zzso zzso zzso in higher plants forms a zzso web of membrane zzso and small zzso that zzso the zzso but in particular form a zzso network at the zzso of the cell which may be anchored to the plasma zzso The network is associated with the zzso zzso and demonstrates extensive mobility, which is most likely to be dependent on zzso zzso The zzso is characterized by a number of zzso which may be associated with specific functions such as protein storage, or with direct interaction with other zzso such as the zzso apparatus, zzso and zzso In the present review we discuss the nature of the network, the role of zzso molecules such as the recently described zzso family of proteins and the function of some of the major zzso within the zzso zzso
