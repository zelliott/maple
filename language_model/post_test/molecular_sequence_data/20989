The zzso zzso zzso is identified from the brain and spinal zzso zzso library of zzso zzso It contains a 450 zzso zzso corresponding to a deduced protein of 149 zzso zzso At zzso acid zzso gecko zzso shares more than zzso identities with zzso zzso and especially, it shares zzso identity with human zzso suggesting that the selective pressure must have been extremely high for the conservation of zzso during the zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso shows that gecko zzso is zzso expressed in all zzso zzso In zzso zzso reveals that zzso transcript mainly appear in the gray matter of spinal zzso The change of zzso expression in spinal zzso after tail zzso is examined by zzso zzso zzso expression increases at 1 day and 3 day after zzso and decreases to the control level at I zzso However, the expression level increases again at 2 zzso These suggest that zzso may be associated with the immune protection of the injury, as well as in the zzso of spinal zzso
