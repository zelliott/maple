A zzso zzso method for the analysis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth hormone zzso has been developed and zzso zzso was performed at 4 degrees C for a zzso period with zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso column, was incorporated for separation of the zzso products and peak identification was carried out by mass zzso zzso The zzso procedure and subsequent zzso were linear in the initial concentration range of zzso zzso zzso to 1000 zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso retention times was low and the zzso peak area zzso was less than zzso for all but three of the zzso The utility of the zzso zzso and zzso procedures has been demonstrated by assessing chemical changes in zzso induced by incubation at elevated zzso Upon incubation of zzso in zzso M zzso buffer at pH 9 zzso strength adjusted to zzso with zzso and 37 degrees C over a period of 400 zzso significant degradation in the regions corresponding to the zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso linked by a zzso bond to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso linked by a zzso bond to zzso zzso was zzso The disappearance of the zzso corresponding to fragments zzso and zzso both displayed apparent zzso degradation zzso over the time period investigated with zzso of 131 and 154 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
