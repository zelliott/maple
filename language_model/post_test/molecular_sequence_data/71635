zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been suggested to play both zzso and zzso roles in zzso but its zzso during development is poorly zzso We have isolated here zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and have shown that zzso zzso has two structural zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso most likely a zzso spliced form, zzso to the previously described human and mouse zzso while zzso is most probably a novel, zzso zzso form of zzso As a consequence of this zzso alternative zzso zzso lacks the zzso zzso sequence of zzso which contains a zzso sequence (or a motif for rapid zzso Western zzso analysis reveals that zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso (presumably in zzso and very zzso in the stomach and, during development, only after the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso is expressed mainly in the zzso and in both primary and secondary zzso and early zzso up to the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may play both zzso and zzso roles, but in a zzso and temporally complementary manner during zzso development, and that zzso rather than zzso (or the conventional form of zzso may play an important role in early zzso We discuss the possibility that a counterpart of zzso zzso might also exist and function in early zzso zzso
