The alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso barrel fold, one of the most common structures in zzso To test the conservation of the global fold in the isolated zzso coli zzso we have obtained a majority of the backbone assignments for the zzso zzso by using standard zzso zzso zzso methods on zzso zzso and zzso protein and on protein selectively zzso at key zzso zzso The secondary structure mapped by chemical shift index, nuclear zzso enhancements zzso and zzso zzso exchange, and several abnormal chemical shifts are consistent with the conservation of the global TIM barrel fold of the isolated zzso coli zzso Because most of the zzso zzso that are slow to exchange with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso is likely to play an important role in stabilizing the previously detected folding zzso for zzso coli zzso A similar combination of uniform and selective labeling can be extended to other TIM barrel proteins to obtain insight into the role of the motif in stabilizing what appear to be common partially folded zzso
