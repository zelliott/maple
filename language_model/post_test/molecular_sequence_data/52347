The zzso carrier protein zzso zzso I in the plant fatty acid zzso zzso the zzso of zzso units to a growing zzso leading to the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso contain three zzso sensitive zzso zzso I zzso alpha 2, alpha zzso and beta zzso The zzso gene zzso the beta 2 zzso has been isolated and zzso The gene spans zzso zzso and contains seven zzso separated by six intervening sequences varying from 75 to 1008 base pairs in zzso The mosaic gene structure is different compared with that of the zzso zzso in the zzso rat and goose fatty acid zzso Southern zzso analyses of zzso DNA from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso addition lines indicate that zzso is a single copy gene located on zzso zzso zzso extension analyses identified four zzso start sites located zzso zzso upstream from the translation initiation zzso The zzso promoter lacks an appropriately positioned zzso box and contains a zzso region including two zzso elements similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this regard zzso closely resembles a set of zzso expressed zzso zzso In zzso with this zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that the zzso transcript is present in barley roots, zzso zzso developing zzso and zzso
