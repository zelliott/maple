zzso A and B zzso disease zzso are zzso storage disorders resulting from the deficient activity of acid zzso zzso Type A NPD is characterized by the absence of residual zzso activity, massive zzso of zzso and cholesterol within zzso and a zzso neurodegenerative course that leads to death by 3 years of zzso In contrast, type B NPD patients have low, but zzso levels of residual zzso activity and little or no zzso zzso Thus, individuals with type B NPD may survive into late adolescence or adulthood and are considered excellent candidates for zzso cell gene zzso To facilitate the development of gene therapy for this disorder, a novel procedure was devised to isolate metabolically corrected type B NPD cells in the absence of marker gene zzso Type B NPD cells were zzso with zzso zzso expressing zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso and subjected to zzso zzso cell sorting zzso Two zzso cell populations were isolated, corresponding to zzso corrected zzso low zzso and zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso corrected cells were enriched for zzso zzso Moreover, the corrected cells could be zzso and continued to express high levels of zzso activity after numerous passages, consistent with the fact that they were zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso type B NPD zzso resulted in a homogeneous cell population with low zzso whose zzso distribution overlapped that of the corrected zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that nearly all of these zzso cells expressed zzso activity and could zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
