Five families of transgenic mice were derived from zzso zzso injected with gamma zzso a fusion gene consisting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region containing promoter I linked to a zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso The zzso was expressed selectively in the zzso eyes, and brains of all families as determined by reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso protection zzso and in zzso zzso In two of five families, kidney zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso developed in male zzso males also expressed higher levels of gamma zzso zzso Early zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso as defined by alkaline zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and electron zzso and could be correlated with the presence of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso Advanced zzso also involved other segments of the zzso and consisted of zzso lined by a flattened zzso layer of attenuated zzso No zzso could be identified within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and collecting zzso by in zzso zzso and they most likely arise by external zzso Animals from the two transgenic strains exhibiting zzso zzso die of zzso failure beginning at 8 months of zzso No difference in zzso parameters or DNA zzso between transgenic and control zzso was identified by flow zzso zzso No zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso effects of the zzso zzso in this model system consist of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This model appears to provide a useful in zzso system for the study of zzso zzso function and control of zzso cell zzso
