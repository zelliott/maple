Mouse embryonic zzso zzso can be differentiated into fully functional zzso in response to bone zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso a critical zzso factor for the multiple steps of zzso has been reported to be zzso during this zzso But the molecular mechanisms by which zzso promotes zzso still remain largely zzso The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the underlying zzso In the zzso zzso efficiently induced zzso expression along with zzso differentiation in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor for zzso pathway, blocked zzso zzso differentiation as well as zzso expression and its zzso of downstream zzso zzso expression of zzso a natural zzso for zzso pathway, only inhibited zzso protein function without rendering any effects on its zzso zzso A zzso box was identified in zzso promoter as the zzso responsible for zzso zzso This study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso expression and activity in zzso and suggests differential roles of zzso and zzso pathways in modulating the function of zzso during zzso
