zzso large cell zzso zzso are mainly characterized by the zzso zzso zzso that involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and generates the fusion protein zzso with intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers several signaling zzso leading to increased cell growth, resistance to zzso and changes in zzso and migration of transformed zzso To search for new zzso interacting zzso we developed a mass zzso zzso approach in zzso cells expressing an zzso zzso and identified the zzso zzso zzso as a candidate zzso We found that zzso was able to bind zzso in zzso experiments and to induce its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso both in zzso cells and zzso cell zzso In primary zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso of zzso mainly stained zzso zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso zzso was dependent on zzso as it significantly decreased after short hairpin zzso zzso zzso knock zzso In addition, only the zzso active zzso but not the zzso dead zzso formed a complex with zzso zzso and growth factor zzso binding protein 2 zzso where zzso bound to the zzso zzso through its zzso zzso zzso knock down by specific zzso decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 and of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso resulting in impaired zzso cell proliferation and growth zzso Finally, migration of zzso cells was reduced by zzso zzso These findings show a direct involvement of zzso in zzso zzso highlighting its critical role in zzso cell proliferation and zzso
