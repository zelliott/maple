A rapid screening test was recently established for the detection of zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso a region identified as the locus for zzso resistance zzso The detection method involved the amplification by zzso chain reaction zzso of the zzso region and the identification of zzso by zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis zzso of the amplification zzso Experience using two different zzso formats for the evaluation of zzso cultures and zzso is presented here; the previously described manual procedure for the detection for the detection of zzso amplification products and an automated zzso by which zzso products were detected on a zzso DNA zzso zzso All 17 different zzso zzso known to date were consistently zzso zzso could be used for the evaluation of minimally grown cultures zzso zzso medium with a growth index of zzso or zzso zzso and for direct screening of microscopically positive zzso with greater than 10 organisms per field zzso zzso Implementation of this technique could result in rapid detection of zzso resistance in zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso
