zzso regulation is a fundamental process for regulating the flux of all zzso zzso For the last several decades, the zzso zzso has served as a valuable model for studying zzso More recently, the switch that controls the zzso has also been successfully adapted to function in zzso zzso Here we describe how, using directed evolution, we have created a novel switch that recognizes an zzso operator zzso The new switch has a zzso with altered zzso zzso for operator recognition and a redesigned zzso interface to create a zzso zzso Quite unexpectedly, the zzso switch functions better than the natural zzso It can repress more tightly than the naturally occurring switch of the zzso zzso it is less leaky and can be induced more zzso Ultimately, these novel zzso could be evolved to recognize zzso promoters and used to regulate gene expression in zzso zzso
