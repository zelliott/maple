Human zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso and shown to consist of two, zzso associated zzso chains of molecular masses 50 and 8 zzso zzso sequencing provided the basis for determination of the full-length zzso for this novel zzso Based upon this information and results from protein analysis and mass zzso we propose a scheme to define the structural organization of zzso in relation to its precursor forms, zzso and zzso The 8- and zzso chains which make up the active zzso zzso respectively, at the zzso and zzso regions of the inactive zzso zzso The zzso zzso is produced by zzso and loss of an internal linking zzso This paper is the first to suggest that human zzso is a zzso zzso
