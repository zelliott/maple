The zzso zzso are currently placed in zzso IV and zzso which are distinguished by cellular division in one plane zzso zzso and in more than one plane zzso zzso zzso Published zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence data support the zzso of the zzso zzso with members of zzso V embedded within zzso zzso It has been zzso that members of zzso V arose from within zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences of the zzso gene zzso from representatives of zzso IV and V was performed by using zzso zzso The zzso zzso are supported as being zzso with the zzso zzso as their closest zzso However, neither zzso IV nor zzso V is zzso with representatives of both zzso zzso in two sister zzso Analysis of zzso does not support recognition of two distinct zzso
