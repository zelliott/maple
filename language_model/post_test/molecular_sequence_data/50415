A zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso to zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso which forms critical branches in zzso has been isolated by an expression cloning approach using Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased activity of this zzso and the zzso occurrence of the zzso core 2 structure zzso beta zzso beta zzso has been observed in a variety of biological zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso due to the zzso syndrome and zzso Since zzso cells do not express this zzso zzso cell lines were established to zzso express zzso large tumor zzso zzso which enables transient expression zzso Because the zzso used was found to detect most efficiently the zzso products attached to zzso the zzso cells were also zzso zzso with zzso zzso By using this particular zzso cell line, a zzso that encodes a protein determining the formation of the core 2 structure was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicts a protein with type II membrane zzso as has been found for all other zzso zzso cloned to zzso The expression of the presumed zzso domain as a fusion protein with the zzso binding domain of protein A enabled us to demonstrate unequivocally that the zzso encodes the core 2 zzso the zzso responsible for the formation of Gal beta zzso beta zzso zzso No activity with this zzso was detected toward the zzso for other beta zzso zzso
