The sense of smell is arguably our most primal faculty and also the least zzso Even our own zzso impaired species is capable of detecting approximately 10,000 distinct scents zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) Cell 65, zzso To achieve that amazing diversity, zzso have approximately 1,000 zzso zzso which accounts for approximately zzso of their entire zzso zzso zzso (1999) Science zzso zzso The zzso receptors zzso are believed to be zzso zzso zzso with an zzso site on the zzso domain and a G zzso site on the zzso zzso zzso first bind to an zzso which then zzso some structural change that triggers the G protein zzso and the following cascade of events leading to nerve cell zzso The structural details of zzso however, remain to be zzso In this paper, we will describe a hypothesis in which metal zzso play an important role for zzso zzso We analyze the predicted structure and consensus sequence of the zzso and propose a zzso site in the loop between fourth and fifth zzso zzso zzso We have prepared zzso a zzso that contains this putative binding site and find that it not only has high affinity for binding zzso and zzso zzso but that it also zzso a dramatic transition to an zzso structure upon metal zzso zzso Based on these zzso we propose a zzso mechanism for the possible structural change in zzso upon zzso zzso This mechanism involves membrane penetration of the 4-5 loop after zzso charge zzso by metal zzso zzso
