zzso sequences from the family of zzso coupled receptors have been aligned according to the zzso zzso procedure of zzso and zzso zzso transform analysis of this reveals that parts of five of the seven putative zzso regions exhibit a zzso of zzso zzso which is compatible with the zzso of the zzso This would place the zzso zzso on one side of the zzso which may face the inside of the proposed seven zzso zzso zzso
