To establish the size and organization of the rice zzso zzso family, we have isolated 30 zzso clones from three independent zzso zzso zzso characterization of these clones indicates that they fall into 5 zzso groups containing a total of 10 zzso Two clones belonging to the Group 3 zzso class have more than one gene per cloned zzso The zzso sequence of one clone from Group 1, zzso zzso was determined and compared to other known cereal zzso sequences revealing that zzso zzso is the zzso analog of the rice zzso zzso zzso The rice zzso genes in Group 1 are analogous to the zzso genes in barley and zzso zzso zzso contains sequence motifs common to most actively transcribed genes in zzso Two consensus zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso zzso regions of zzso genes of rice, barley and zzso The former sequence may be specific to zzso gene while the latter sequence may be related to a zzso box found in many plant zzso Another sequence called the zzso box zzso was found in the zzso genes as well as other genes regulated by zzso acid zzso Comparisons based on zzso acid sequence alignment revealed that the zzso families in rice, barley and wheat shared a common zzso which contained three zzso Some of the descendants of the zzso zzso gene appear to have lost the middle zzso while others maintain all three zzso
