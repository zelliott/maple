Many protein zzso involved in cell signaling contain or interact with zzso zzso and the design of molecules that zzso signaling pathways represents a zzso goal of chemical zzso Previously we described a protein design strategy in which the zzso zzso in avian pancreatic zzso zzso presents short zzso recognition zzso The miniature proteins designed in this way recognize even shallow protein zzso with high affinity and zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso can present the short zzso recognition zzso within the zzso protein of zzso zzso Like miniature proteins that use an zzso for protein recognition, the miniature protein designed in this way displays high affinity for a natural zzso target, the zzso domain zzso and achieves the elusive goal of zzso zzso discriminating well between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most importantly, the miniature protein zzso with zzso in zzso zzso egg zzso zzso decreasing zzso zzso of zzso zzso and causing extreme speed variations and zzso tail zzso Our results suggest that miniature proteins based on zzso may represent an excellent framework for the design of zzso that differentiate the roles of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso
