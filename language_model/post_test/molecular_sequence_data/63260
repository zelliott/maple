The genetic variations of the zzso virus and its human host constitute major obstacles for obtaining potent zzso zzso responses in individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds infected with different zzso zzso In this study, we developed and used a novel zzso to select 184 predicted zzso representing seven different zzso class I zzso that together constitute a broad coverage of the different zzso strains as well as the human zzso zzso Of the tested 184 zzso class zzso zzso 114 were recognized by at least one study subject, and 45 were novel zzso not previously described in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we identified 21 zzso zzso that induced zzso responses in at least 4 of the 31 zzso A majority (27 of 31) of the study population recognized one or more of these highly zzso zzso We also found a limited set of 9 zzso that together induced zzso zzso responses in all zzso patients in this zzso Our results have important implications for the validation of potent zzso responses and show that the goal for a vaccine candidate in inducing broadly zzso zzso immune responses is zzso
