zzso isolated from coffee beans zzso the terminal zzso zzso from zzso chains on blood group B red cells, thus generating group O zzso Such zzso converted red cells not only maintain full zzso integrity and viability in zzso but also demonstrate immune tolerance and a normal life span in zzso In order to produce large quantities of zzso zzso for use in the study of zzso conversion, we zzso the zzso coding for coffee bean zzso into the zzso site of the zzso zzso in order to express the zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso colonies were screened for high-level expression of zzso based on zzso zzso In order to increase zzso production, the growth conditions in the shake flask culture and zzso culture were zzso Under the conditions applied, biologically active zzso was produced and zzso into the culture medium at a level of approximately zzso g per liter of the zzso zzso The protein was zzso to apparent zzso by a simple zzso zzso as suggested by a single band of 41 zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Its zzso was further confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be the choice as host for the large-scale production of zzso zzso used for blood type zzso
