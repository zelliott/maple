To define the minimal zzso length needed for gene delivery into zzso cells, we zzso several peptides with shortened chain lengths from the zzso of the original zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which have been known to have gene transfer abilities into zzso Each synthetic zzso was studied for its ability to bind and zzso with zzso DNA and the structural change of the zzso caused by binding with the DNA to establish a relative in zzso gene zzso efficiency in zzso zzso As a result, the deletion of eight zzso acid zzso of zzso had little influence on their ability, whereas that of 12 zzso acid zzso remarkably reduced the abilities to make zzso and transfer the DNA into the zzso In the case of the zzso zzso series zzso deletion of zzso acid zzso caused a considerable reduction in abilities to bind and form zzso with DNA and to transfer the DNA into cell in due zzso In zzso 16 and 17 zzso acid zzso were sufficient to form zzso with the DNA and transfer the DNA into the cells in the deletion series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it was indicated that reduction of membrane zzso activity of the zzso complex due to deletion of the zzso chain length caused suppression of the zzso efficiency even if the complex was incorporated into the zzso Transfer of the complex to zzso zzso by membrane zzso activity of the zzso is an important step for efficient protein expression from its zzso The results of this study will make it easy to design and zzso a functional gene carrier zzso such as a zzso zzso used in targeted gene zzso
