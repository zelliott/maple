zzso zzso zzso zzso are critical for the development of zzso zzso responses and the expansion of zzso T zzso zzso Identification of relevant zzso zzso zzso remains an important step in the development of an zzso zzso zzso vaccine against zzso infectious anemia virus zzso a naturally occurring zzso of zzso This study describes zzso zzso zzso in zzso carrier horses to two zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the relatively zzso zzso gag zzso Using partially overlapping zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso were identified within zzso One zzso was identified which reacted with peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from all five zzso horses, and three other peptides were identified which reacted with zzso from four of five zzso zzso Four additional peptides containing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso Multiple zzso were recognized in a region corresponding to the major zzso region of the human zzso virus, a region with significant sequence similarity to other zzso including zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso disease virus, zzso virus, and zzso arthritis encephalitis zzso zzso zzso to zzso peptides from zzso carrier horses also zzso Multiple zzso peptides were shown to be zzso but not all infected horses had zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso The identification of peptides zzso with zzso from zzso horses, some of which zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso should contribute to the design of synthetic zzso or zzso zzso vaccines for zzso
