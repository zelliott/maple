zzso zzso various zzso along the zzso by interacting with the zzso through its light chain zzso zzso light chains zzso zzso its zzso repeat zzso domain to interact with over 10 different zzso Despite a high sequence identity between their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit differential binding properties towards some zzso We determined the structures of human zzso and zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso using X-ray zzso and investigated the different mechanisms by which zzso interact with their zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we attributed the specific interaction between zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso cargo to zzso zzso in the fourth zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is adjacent to other zzso and zzso creating a positively charged polar patch within the groove of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso did not interact with zzso Based on these finding, we propose that zzso of zzso can form zzso zzso zzso with its neighboring zzso to interact with zzso similar to that of zzso organizing zzso zzso interaction with heat shock zzso For the binding of zzso shared by zzso and zzso we propose a different site located within the groove but not involving zzso We further propose a third binding site on zzso which involves a stretch of polar zzso along the zzso zzso that may form a network of hydrogen bonds to zzso and zzso Together, these results provide structural insights into possible mechanisms of interaction between zzso zzso zzso and various cargo zzso
