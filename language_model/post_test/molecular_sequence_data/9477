Signaling and zzso are tightly integrated processes that zzso many cellular responses to the zzso A network of signaling events, often zzso by zzso modification on zzso can lead to long-term changes in cellular behavior by altering the activity of specific zzso regulators and consequently the expression level of their downstream zzso As many zzso zzso methods are now available that can simultaneously measure changes in hundreds of proteins and thousands of zzso it should be possible to systematically reconstruct cellular responses to zzso in order to discover previously zzso signaling zzso This chapter describes a zzso method for discovering such pathways that aims to compensate for the varying levels of noise present in these diverse data zzso Based on the concept of constraint zzso on networks, the method seeks to achieve two conflicting zzso zzso to link together many of the signaling proteins and zzso expressed transcripts identified in the experiments zzso using previously reported zzso and zzso zzso while zzso keeping the resulting network small and ensuring it is composed of the highest confidence interactions zzso A further distinctive feature of this approach is the use of zzso data as evidence of upstream signaling events that drive changes in gene zzso rather than as proxies for downstream changes in the levels of the zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that by applying this method to zzso and zzso data from the zzso response in zzso we were able to recover functionally coherent pathways and to reveal many components of the cellular response that are not readily apparent in the original zzso Here, we provide a more detailed description of the method, explore the zzso of the solution to the noise level of input data and discuss the effect of zzso zzso
