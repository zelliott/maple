zzso factor zzso zzso is required for zzso of zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to numerous studies establishing a role for higher zzso zzso in multiple steps of the zzso cycle, relatively little has been reported regarding the functions of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso shuffle zzso zzso and primer extension analyses were employed to probe the functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 35 zzso zzso substitution zzso and 19 zzso substitution zzso identified 5 zzso exhibiting altered properties in zzso zzso extension analyses revealed that the conditional growth properties exhibited by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with pronounced upstream shifts in zzso initiation in zzso zzso of double zzso strains demonstrated functional interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results demonstrated an altered interaction between zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso These results provide direct evidence for the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the mechanism of zzso start site zzso and support the view that a zzso zzso II interaction is a zzso in this zzso
