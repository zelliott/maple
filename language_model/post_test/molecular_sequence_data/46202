The major plasma protein of the eastern zzso zzso zzso was zzso characterized and named zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso consistently made up more than zzso of eastern oyster plasma and zzso fluid zzso Three different forms of zzso were observed under zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso designed from partial zzso acid sequences obtained by tandem mass zzso of zzso zzso identified zzso of complete zzso zzso 192 zzso acid zzso Based on the deduced zzso acid sequence of mature zzso its molecular mass was calculated to be zzso and was lower than the molecular mass of zzso zzso measured by zzso This difference is likely due to zzso modifications of zzso as the zzso protein was found to be zzso zzso and likely zzso The zzso acid sequence showed high similarity to the major plasma protein of the Pacific oyster zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a recently described protein labeled as an zzso zzso zzso from the Sydney rock oyster zzso zzso While zzso was found to possess a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, the domain was not completely zzso which explained why zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso by in zzso zzso and its expression measured by quantitative real time zzso was significantly higher in winter than zzso Although the zzso of zzso and zzso proteins is uncertain, the reported ability of zzso to zzso iron and possibly limit the availability of this essential metal to pathogens suggests a potential role in host defense for this group of dominant plasma zzso Other possible functions of zzso in zzso wound repair, metal transport and shell zzso are discussed leading us to conclude that zzso is likely a zzso zzso
