zzso replicate in the zzso and do not require the nucleus function for virus zzso in zzso However, zzso zzso protein of two zzso zzso zzso respiratory syndrome virus and zzso zzso virus, has been observed to zzso in the nucleus and zzso of zzso and zzso cells in addition to their normal zzso zzso In the present study, the N protein of zzso zzso virus zzso of mice was examined for nuclear zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was determined by tagging N with enhanced green zzso protein zzso at the zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso fusion proteins localized to the nucleus and zzso of zzso zzso zzso N also accumulated in the zzso region, the site of virus zzso The zzso sequence contains a putative zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso consisting of zzso To determine its functional significance, a series of deletion zzso of N were generated and individually expressed in zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso was essential for nuclear zzso In addition, the zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso nuclear zzso may occur via the zzso nuclear transport zzso These results provide further evidence for the nuclear zzso of N as a common feature within the zzso
