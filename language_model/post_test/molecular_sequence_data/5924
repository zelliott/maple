zzso cloning in zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate an organic zzso transport protein from rat zzso A zzso library was constructed from zzso zzso zzso and screened for zzso transport of zzso zzso A 2, zzso pair zzso clone containing a zzso pair open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso zzso acids long was isolated and named zzso zzso transport of 50 zzso M zzso was independent of imposed changes in membrane zzso Transport was significantly inhibited at 4 degrees C, or upon incubation with other organic zzso but not by the organic zzso zzso by the zzso resistance zzso inhibitor zzso A, or by zzso External zzso and zzso (1 zzso both zzso for zzso zzso exchange, also inhibited zzso suggesting that zzso is functionally similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this conclusion, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso preloaded with zzso whereas the zzso zzso which is not accepted by the zzso zzso did not zzso Finally, zzso zzso transport was zzso with an estimated zzso of 70 zzso zzso Each of these properties is identical to those previously described for the zzso zzso zzso in isolated membrane zzso or intact zzso zzso
