zzso is an ubiquitous zzso binding protein in zzso zzso Lack of both zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in impaired zzso and an arrest in zzso A restriction zzso integration approach was applied to zzso cells to identify zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A zzso with zzso development and restored zzso was zzso The gene affected was found to code for an integral membrane zzso of a predicted size of 88 zzso containing two zzso zzso one at the zzso zzso and the other at the zzso zzso It is zzso to zzso zzso and represents the first member of this family in zzso zzso therefore the name zzso is zzso zzso disruption of the zzso gene in the zzso background also rescued the zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso in zzso and zzso structures on the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso in zzso and gel zzso zzso A direct interaction between zzso and zzso could not be zzso and it is unclear how far upstream in a regulatory cascade zzso might be zzso However, the zzso binding of zzso points towards a function via the zzso pathway, a major regulator of zzso
