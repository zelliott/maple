zzso in the hook gene alter zzso trafficking of zzso zzso in zzso To dissect this zzso in more detail, we developed a new approach to zzso the zzso taken by the Bride of zzso zzso zzso after its zzso into zzso zzso A zzso protein consisting of zzso fused to zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso This zzso was fully zzso it rescued the boss zzso zzso and its trafficking was indistinguishable from that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was used to follow zzso trafficking on the zzso level through early and late zzso in zzso zzso In both zzso and hook zzso eye zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso accumulated in mature zzso bodies zzso within zzso zzso such zzso was not observed in hook eye zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed a loss of mature zzso in hook zzso tissue compared with wild type, whereas more than twice as many zzso late zzso were zzso Our genetic analysis indicates that Hook is required late in zzso trafficking to zzso regulate delivery from mature zzso to zzso late zzso and zzso
