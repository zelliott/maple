The zzso zzso zzso has three types of zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso and, in adult fish, these cells are organized into a stripe zzso The mechanisms underlying formation of the stripe pattern are largely zzso We report here the identification and characterization of a novel dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso which was generated by zzso zzso using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused zzso stripe zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were isolated independently and zzso were located within the fifth zzso of a novel zzso which we named zzso zzso an zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to linkage group zzso close to zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso boundaries and zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso is an zzso of mouse zzso the gene zzso in the zzso zzso mouse zzso The zzso zzso is dominant and causes defects in zzso formation in zzso and zzso This study revealed that the zzso locus is important for pattern formation in fish but is involved in distinct zzso events in different zzso
