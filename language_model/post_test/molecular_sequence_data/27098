The zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction is an extensively studied zzso zzso zzso possesses approximately 150 putative resistance genes zzso zzso binding site zzso and zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso The majority of these belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative studies with the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains expressing single corresponding zzso genes have been particularly fruitful in zzso specific and common resistance signaling zzso However, the major zzso class is represented by a single known zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso We previously identified zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain 61 as an zzso gene that signals through zzso zzso zzso indicating that the corresponding resistance gene zzso belongs to the zzso zzso Here we report the identification of zzso based on a zzso screen and zzso zzso Among resistance proteins of known function, the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows highest similarity to the zzso resistance protein zzso that determines resistance to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Similar to zzso and other zzso zzso zzso generates alternatively spliced zzso although the alternative transcript structures are zzso zzso We previously characterized zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso in zzso also enhanced zzso immunity in zzso zzso In conclusion, the cloning of zzso and comparisons with zzso will contribute to a closer dissection of the zzso resistance zzso in zzso
