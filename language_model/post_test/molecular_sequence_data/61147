The acid zzso zzso which accumulates in plant zzso and probably is involved in the zzso and turnover of zzso zzso is itself a zzso with at least one zzso and one zzso zzso The puzzling finding that zzso zzso carries its own zzso suggests that the zzso have unique zzso and important functions in protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso As a first step towards the zzso of this zzso we zzso the zzso of jack bean zzso and determined their structures by sugar composition analysis, mass zzso and zzso The structures of two zzso were identified in an approximate ratio of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation and sequencing of zzso strongly suggests that one zzso and one zzso zzso are linked to specific zzso sites of the large zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is a good zzso of the zzso zzso can only be removed from the zzso after zzso and zzso of zzso bonds by a reducing agent, suggesting that this zzso is buried within the folded zzso and, thus, protected from its zzso zzso zzso and reduction of the native zzso led to a marked decrease in zzso zzso However, the activity could largely be recovered by zzso in an appropriate zzso zzso In contrast, recovery of zzso activity failed when the zzso zzso was removed by zzso prior to zzso indicating that this zzso appears to be important for zzso zzso
