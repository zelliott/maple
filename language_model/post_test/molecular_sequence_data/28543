The family of insulin zzso zzso zzso has been reported to play important roles for signal zzso of various zzso Four members of the zzso family have been zzso Each zzso is believed to have different zzso however, the distinct zzso roles of each zzso are zzso This study was undertaken to determine the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells as fusion with a green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein was analyzed by fluorescent zzso Surprisingly, zzso was localized not only adjacent to the plasma membrane but also in the zzso We confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso that zzso zzso protein is also localized in the nucleus of zzso cells that were zzso with zzso zzso In addition, we detected zzso zzso in the nucleus of isolated rat zzso We then studied zzso zzso of deletion zzso and fragments of zzso fused with zzso We found that the region corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso binding domain played an important role in nuclear zzso This region includes sequences that are unique to zzso We then investigated zzso zzso of other zzso fused with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were mainly localized in the zzso or plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding domain fused with zzso zzso region, increased zzso of the reporter gene containing zzso binding site in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso is determined by a different mechanism from other zzso zzso and that zzso possesses a zzso zzso
