We measured sensitivity to zzso modification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly blocked transport zzso zzso located in the middle of the eighth zzso domain of the light zzso zzso was found to be the main target of zzso zzso an zzso reducing zzso reversed zzso and zzso effects only when applied from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso protected from the zzso with an zzso similar to the zzso Protection was not zzso suggesting that it did not depend on large zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to Ala and zzso slightly modified the zzso and a zzso zzso abolished transport function without compromising zzso expression at the plasma zzso The results indicate that zzso is a functionally important zzso accessible to the zzso zzso environment and is structurally linked to the zzso zzso and/or the zzso binding zzso
