zzso sodium channels are vital membrane proteins essential for electrical zzso in humans, they are key targets for the development of pharmaceutical zzso Here we report the crystal structure of an zzso zzso of zzso the bacterial channel pore from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It differs from the recently published crystal structure of a closed form of a related bacterial sodium channel zzso by having its internal cavity accessible to the zzso surface as a result of a zzso about a central zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This produces an open zzso gate of sufficient diameter to allow hydrated sodium zzso to pass zzso zzso of the open and closed structures provides new insight into the features of the functional states present in the zzso cycles of sodium channels and the mechanism of channel opening and zzso
