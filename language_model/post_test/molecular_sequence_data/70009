zzso is a major zzso protein in zzso cells that is thought to be involved in zzso zzso The discovery that zzso zzso between the zzso and the nucleus raises the possibility that it is also involved in transporting zzso or nuclear proteins to the zzso The three structural zzso of zzso bear a striking resemblance to the zzso of a previously identified zzso protein zzso although the two proteins do not share a high degree of sequence zzso zzso specifically recognizes the nuclear zzso sequence zzso of both the zzso virus large T zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis, and is a candidate for a zzso involved in the initial stages of nuclear zzso We report here that zzso either zzso from Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells or expressed in zzso also specifically recognizes the zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso sequence by zzso zzso zzso The zzso recognition site is located within the zzso domain of both zzso In showing that zzso a protein that moves between the zzso and the nucleus, also has the ability to interact with nuclear zzso signals, our data support the idea that shuttling zzso proteins play a role in nuclear zzso
