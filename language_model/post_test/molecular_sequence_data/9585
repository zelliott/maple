One of the major goals of the human zzso project is to establish a physical map of each human zzso with a density of zzso site zzso markers exceeding one every 100 zzso We report here the generation of a human zzso zzso radiation hybrid zzso map that includes 556 zzso Of these zzso 132 zzso are ordered with a maximum likelihood ratio of zzso compared with the next most likely zzso An additional 113 zzso were ordered relative to these backbone markers with a maximum likelihood ratio of zzso but zzso Together, these 245 zzso form an ordered framework map for the zzso Using this zzso zzso more markers were localized based on zzso analysis with the ordered zzso On average, there are 50 markers in common with the zzso map presented here and other zzso 5 maps included in the current whole zzso zzso zzso and physical zzso The accuracy of all the maps is evident in that there are no more than two discrepancies between any one of them and these zzso All of the maps encompassing zzso 5 complement each other providing excellent zzso coverage with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso map contains zzso of these independent zzso In addition, our zzso map contains zzso derived from clones suitable for fluorescent in zzso zzso allowing alignment to the zzso zzso Together, these maps will assist in the assembly of zzso zzso and will aid in the identification of disease zzso on zzso 5 by zzso cloning and zzso candidate zzso
