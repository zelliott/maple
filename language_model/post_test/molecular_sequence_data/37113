The human zzso gene has seven generally zzso promoters and one, the so-called zzso promoter, whose status remains zzso We re-evaluated this promoter in the light of recently available human and mouse zzso zzso and attempted to compare its activity in zzso with that of the muscle zzso We find that the zzso promoter lies immediately adjacent to the chronic zzso disease zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso zzso This makes the supposed zzso zzso primary transcript 7 zzso in size, with an expected zzso time in excess of 2 zzso We also find that zzso promoter use in peripheral blood zzso is negligible compared to that of the muscle promoter in the same zzso Together with the presence in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and lack of zzso linkage in the zzso we propose that the zzso promoter is not a biologically significant part of the zzso zzso
