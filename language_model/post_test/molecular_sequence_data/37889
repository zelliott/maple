Although smooth muscle cells zzso are critical components of the circulatory system, the regulatory mechanisms of zzso differentiation remain largely zzso In the present study, we examined the mechanism of zzso differentiation by using zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso open reading frame, and the predicted zzso acid sequences were highly zzso in zzso zzso transcripts were first detected in heart zzso head zzso and the zzso side of the lateral plate zzso at the zzso stage, possibly representing the precursors of muscle zzso At the zzso stage, zzso transcripts were restricted to the vascular and visceral zzso zzso was strongly induced by basic zzso growth factor zzso in animal zzso Although expressions of zzso cardiac zzso were not affected by the expression of a zzso zzso zzso its injection dramatically suppressed the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a useful molecular marker for the zzso lineage in zzso and that zzso signaling plays an important role in the induction of zzso and in the differentiation of zzso
