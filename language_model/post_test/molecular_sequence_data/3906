The zzso of zzso genes depends on the maintenance of DNA zzso patterns during zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso form of the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso that is zzso and stored in the zzso zzso and zzso to the eight-cell nucleus during zzso development, where it maintains DNA zzso patterns on zzso of imprinted zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso protein is also expressed in the zzso zzso and may account for maintenance zzso at zzso stages other than the eight-cell zzso However, using an zzso that detects zzso but not zzso no zzso protein was detected on zzso or by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso protein produced in the zzso from a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of eight-cell zzso but not to zzso of other zzso The highly restricted nuclear zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso development add further support to the notion that DNA zzso other than zzso are required for maintaining imprints during zzso zzso
