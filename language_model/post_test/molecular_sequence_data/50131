Previously, we have shown that primary zzso sensory zzso are necessary for disease activity in T zzso immune zzso in zzso In the present study, we analyzed the possible role of substance P zzso an important zzso zzso of these nerve zzso in an in zzso mouse model of liver zzso Liver injury was induced by bacterial zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso nerve fibers by zzso zzso treatment zzso circulating levels of the zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso and protected mice from zzso liver zzso Likewise, zzso of mice with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dose zzso protected mice from zzso liver zzso The presence of the zzso in the zzso liver was demonstrated by reverse zzso chain reaction, sequence analysis, and zzso zzso blockade reduced inflammatory liver damage, zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To get further insight into the mechanism by which zzso blockade attenuated zzso liver damage, we analyzed plasma levels and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blockade clearly inhibited zzso production of zzso and zzso whereas synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso might be potent drugs for treatment of inflammatory liver disease, most likely by zzso SP zzso
