The cotton zzso zzso a zzso zzso is zzso by a complex gene family which, based on zzso can be divided into two zzso zzso and zzso Southern blots revealed several members of the zzso zzso and a single member of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso was isolated from this zzso According to reverse zzso chain reaction, transcripts of both zzso and zzso genes appeared in roots from the second day post zzso and in zzso zzso whereas the zzso levels were too low to be detected in the zzso Initially, zzso zzso activities were found to be high in the zzso then dropped in aerial zzso but increased in roots during zzso zzso zzso contents followed the same zzso In fully developed plants, the transcripts of zzso were detected in zzso leaves and zzso as well as in the zzso and petals 3 d before zzso but not at the day of zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were not detected in any of these aerial zzso The zzso zzso contents increased in petals but decreased in zzso after zzso Treatment of zzso zzso stems with a zzso zzso zzso activated zzso transcription, but a significant level of zzso transcripts was detected both before and after zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso the zzso gene was activated by the same zzso zzso followed by the synthesis of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene expression during development and in response to zzso as well as the spatial and zzso pattern of zzso zzso constitute a chemical defense machinery in cotton zzso
