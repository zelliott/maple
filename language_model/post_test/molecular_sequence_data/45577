zzso regulates the proper placement of the zzso zzso ring at zzso by inducing the zzso movement of zzso zzso While the zzso of zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso a clear functional role of the zzso has not been zzso We previously determined that zzso from zzso zzso zzso was functional in zzso coli zzso Thus, using zzso coli as a model zzso zzso zzso zzso function was examined by generating zzso acid zzso of highly zzso zzso zzso and by testing the ability of the zzso proteins to interact with zzso zzso zzso to induce a zzso zzso upon zzso to initiate zzso zzso and to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were unable to bind to zzso thus, they did not induce a zzso zzso promote zzso zzso or stimulate zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced abilities to bind to zzso we show that differences in zzso binding to the zzso of zzso alter the ability of zzso to properly stimulate zzso zzso We present four major findings from our studies of zzso both the zzso and zzso of zzso interact with zzso interaction between zzso and zzso is required for the recruitment of zzso to the coiled zzso zzso of zzso does not require zzso zzso and, the extent of zzso zzso stimulation depends on the binding strength between zzso and the zzso of zzso
