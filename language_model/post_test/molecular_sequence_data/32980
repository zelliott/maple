The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso integration of viral DNA into the host zzso We previously developed peptides that inhibit IN in zzso and zzso replication in zzso Here we present the design, synthesis and evaluation of several derivatives of one of these zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso corresponding to the zzso half of zzso zzso zzso was easier to zzso and much more soluble than the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound IN with improved affinity and inhibited IN activity as well as zzso replication and integration in infected zzso While zzso bound the IN zzso its shorter derivatives bound zzso zzso zzso the zzso binding sites in IN provided a model that explains this zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is an improved lead compound for further development of IN zzso
