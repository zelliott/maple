A zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso and gliding marine zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from coastal surface seawater near Taichung zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly zzso zzso and thus formed yellow colonies on marine zzso The novel strain showed an unstable zzso position, although sharing high zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso species zzso zzso The polar zzso profile of strain zzso consisted of zzso five unidentified zzso one unidentified zzso two unidentified zzso and one unidentified zzso The major zzso of the total) fatty acids were zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso was the sole respiratory zzso and the major zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso unique polar zzso zzso presence of significant amounts of zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a low amount of zzso and several additional distinguishing zzso features clearly zzso strain zzso from the type species of the zzso zzso and zzso Thus, based on data from the present zzso study, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of a new zzso within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso descriptions of the zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso
