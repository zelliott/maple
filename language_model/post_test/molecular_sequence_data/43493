zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso intermediate at sites containing the sequence zzso The T zzso is linked via a zzso bond to zzso of the zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in formation of a zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso reaction is zzso zzso pH zzso zzso and is zzso by a factor of zzso than the rate of zzso strand transfer to a zzso terminated DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso in lieu of the active site zzso form no zzso zzso intermediate and catalyze no zzso DNA zzso This suggests that zzso occurs subsequent to formation of the zzso zzso zzso and not via direct attack by water on zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The rate of zzso is zzso to zzso concentration and is optimal at pH zzso
