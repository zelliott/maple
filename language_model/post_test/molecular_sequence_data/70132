A zzso chain reaction zzso test for zzso zzso was developed based on a 218 zzso segment of a DNA zzso zzso zzso that is specific for this zzso The method involved two consecutive amplification zzso with the second set of zzso being zzso inside the first zzso The method reliably detected 50 zzso zzso This zzso test was applied to 32 bovine zzso specimens containing high, moderate or low numbers of zzso zzso organisms as determined by zzso The zzso test detected all specimens containing zzso or zzso 1600 colony forming units zzso zzso six of ten specimens with zzso zzso zzso but only two of 13 specimens containing zzso or zzso 112 zzso zzso The sensitivity of this test was better than that of a commercial zzso test which was carried out on the same zzso zzso
