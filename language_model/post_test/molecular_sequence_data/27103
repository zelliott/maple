zzso markers are useful for comparative zzso analysis and can also serve as zzso functional zzso Here, we report the development of zzso zzso markers and the evaluation of the possibility of functional assessment of markers tagging zzso which carries zzso fly resistance genes zzso To identify transcripts specific to zzso zzso sequences in combination with wheat zzso zzso were zzso Total 275 zzso mapped to the long arms of zzso group 2 zzso were zzso To obtain a cluster corresponding to each of the wheat 275 zzso zzso sequences of zzso rice, zzso and rye were pooled for zzso zzso Out of 275 clusters zzso it was possible to design 112 zzso primer pairs for zzso zzso Out of 112 zzso primer pairs, 45 primer pairs zzso produced zzso from at least one species (three wheat zzso or zzso Among the 45 zzso zzso were associated with one of known functions and zzso of the zzso associated with known functions were also associated with one of the GO zzso On the basis of the zzso sequence alignment of each of 45 zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso were suitable for designing zzso zzso zzso which are specific to zzso rye zzso zzso Six primer pairs zzso successfully produced zzso in the zzso zzso lines and not in the zzso zzso assessment of one of the zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso fly infested zzso Under zzso fly zzso significantly high expression of a gene zzso by a zzso marker zzso was observed 1 day after zzso zzso zzso marker development from this study provides a basis for the development of zzso markers for detecting zzso zzso In addition, these markers could be employed in zzso functional analysis of genes on zzso
