zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso plays a critical role in the recruitment of zzso to the site of zzso zzso invasion and zzso share many similarities with zzso trafficking, which is critically regulated by zzso and their zzso In this study, we aimed to assess the role of zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

zzso expression was determined by Western zzso in two human zzso clones zzso and zzso with different zzso zzso We silenced zzso expression through zzso zzso zzso and examined the zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso cell through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by gelatin zzso 

We found that expression of zzso was correlated with the aggressive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso of zzso cells, but had only a minor effect on cell zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso zzso significantly reduced the expression level of zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso contributes to zzso cell migration by stimulating cell invasion, independent of cell zzso zzso might be a new target for zzso zzso
