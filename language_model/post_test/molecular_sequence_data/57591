Studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso class zzso zzso 1 locus is associated with an increased predisposition to primary zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used to compare the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso 0 in patients with end stage primary zzso zzso and a group of controls without evidence of liver zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso zzso in the primary zzso zzso and control groups was zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the primary zzso zzso group all subjects were of the common zzso 0, zzso A, zzso B or zzso A, B zzso while in the controls, one subject showed an zzso with an zzso mobility compatible with it being a product of the putative zzso zzso As the zzso zzso might be changed by the disease process, the zzso chain reaction was used to amplify the zzso zzso 5 region of zzso and show that in 13 control subjects and 11 patients with primary zzso zzso zzso positive and negative zzso were associated with corresponding zzso expressing and zzso zzso zzso The control subject with zzso 3 zzso showed a positive zzso
