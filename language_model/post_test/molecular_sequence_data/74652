zzso an zzso zzso from zzso tissue zzso exerts beneficial zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the zzso gene zzso and its expression in two genetically different breeds of zzso lean type, large white zzso and fat type, zzso zzso DNA, zzso and protein extracts from 10 LW and 10 zzso pigs were analyzed by sequence analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso fast protein liquid zzso and northern and western zzso zzso analysis revealed an identity of zzso between the zzso gene from the two breeds, but the expression of the zzso protein was higher in LW than in zzso zzso We identified sexual zzso of zzso in both breeds, namely a balanced distribution of the low zzso ( approximately 50 zzso whereas the middle zzso ( approximately zzso zzso were increased in zzso In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrate that zzso is produced and zzso differently in the two breeds of zzso namely zzso is more abundant in LW than in zzso Moreover, the visceral AT of LW expresses more zzso than the subcutaneous zzso This relationship is absent in zzso These observations provided the first evidence that zzso expression is correlated with the zzso zzso in zzso
