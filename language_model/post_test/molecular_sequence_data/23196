We examined 158 strains belonging to different zzso species isolated from hospitalized acute zzso cases for zzso to zzso Compared to other species, a high percentage of the zzso zzso strains were resistant to zzso and zzso Based on zzso values, 6 zzso zzso strains were selected and the zzso sequences for the zzso regions zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso In resistant zzso double zzso zzso and zzso and a single zzso zzso were detected in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
