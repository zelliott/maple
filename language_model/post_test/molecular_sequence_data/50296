A series DNA zzso of zzso base pairs has been prepared for the study of zzso resonance energy zzso Each of the DNA zzso contains two zzso zzso (one in each zzso at zzso sites for introduction of the desired donor and zzso zzso The zzso zzso have been prepared as pure zzso or zzso derivatives or as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are employed as the respective donor and zzso zzso A series of zzso pairs was generated by labeling of the appropriate zzso zzso with the desired zzso and zzso the two complementary DNA strands (one containing the zzso and one containing the donor zzso to form the zzso zzso The zzso zzso containing two zzso attached zzso exhibited some zzso zzso and the extent of this zzso was dependent upon the zzso orientation of the zzso The zzso derivatives direct the zzso out, away from the the DNA zzso while the zzso derivatives direct the zzso toward the major zzso As expected, the zzso labeled duplexes were more stable than the corresponding zzso labeled zzso However, all of the duplex structures formed were stable under the conditions used to measure energy zzso Energy transfer could be observed with these complexes from the zzso of the donor zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso Using zzso theories, distances separating the zzso could be calculated that were generally in reasonable agreement with the distances expected in an idealized zzso DNA zzso However anomalous results were obtained for one zzso pair where the expected distance was less than 20 zzso Fluorescence zzso values determined in solutions of varying zzso were quite high suggesting that the zzso did not experience complete freedom of movement when attached to the DNA zzso
