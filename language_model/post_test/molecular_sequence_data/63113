zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a European zzso zzso that has spread to many parts of the zzso The present work shows that it is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30) combining the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso species of similar geographic zzso zzso zzso has two nuclear ITS sequences that closely match those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso using zzso DNA of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso has differentiated the ancestral sets of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso in zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also consistent with an zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso A marked preponderance of ITS repeats from zzso zzso over those from zzso zzso indicated that concerted evolution has resulted in partial zzso of these sequences by depletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In parallel with this, the zzso phenomenon of zzso dominance has been observed in zzso zzso such that the zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso whilst that from zzso zzso remains highly condensed throughout the cell zzso zzso zzso therefore, appears to have arisen by way of zzso between forms of the zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso The observed zzso changes in zzso resulting from zzso zzso provide evidence for the process of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
