Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which play a critical role in control of cellular proliferation and zzso zzso activated forms of Ras proteins are associated with a broad range of human zzso The zzso of the zzso modifications that occur at the zzso zzso of Ras and the demonstration that zzso of Ras by zzso protein zzso is essential for zzso cellular transformation has opened up a new and promising approach to the development of zzso zzso We report here a novel series of potent zzso protein zzso zzso zzso represented by zzso zzso This compound zzso both rat brain and zzso human zzso with an zzso of approximately 250 zzso while it is only zzso active against rat brain zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 114 zzso zzso zzso has been observed using both zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso in two different zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso also inhibit zzso of Ras in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso with zzso values in the low zzso zzso At these zzso they do not inhibit zzso zzso or zzso of zzso In addition, we observed that zzso cells undergo pronounced zzso changes upon zzso of zzso forms of zzso containing zzso sequences allowing zzso zzso or zzso zzso but not upon zzso of activated Ras lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes can be partially reverted with zzso zzso zzso zzso can block zzso changes induced by zzso but not zzso Recently, a number of other zzso zzso have been zzso Most of the compounds reported to have zzso activity are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our zzso zzso are novel in that although they compete with Ras protein in kinetic experiments they are entirely zzso in nature, they do not have zzso zzso functions, and they are active in cells at low zzso zzso
