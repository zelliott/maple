A gene zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was chemically zzso and expressed in zzso cells and in a zzso zzso To facilitate both the assembly of the synthetic gene and further zzso and gene fusion studies, several unique restriction zzso zzso sites were included in the coding sequence without altering the zzso protein zzso The synthetic zzso coding sequence was fused to a translation start signal and placed under zzso early zzso zzso zzso of the zzso synthetic gene together with a reporter gene zzso zzso zzso or zzso linked to an zzso zzso confirmed that the synthetic gene product exhibits similar activity to zzso expressed from zzso zzso DNA in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso zzso of the synthetic zzso coding sequence was also shown to produce functional zzso following zzso into zzso cells containing an integrated reporter gene with the zzso zzso linked to zzso
