Cancer cells undergo zzso transition zzso as a program of increased invasion and zzso during cancer zzso Here, we report that a novel regulator of zzso in cancer cells is protein zzso D1 zzso which is zzso in advanced zzso breast, and gastric zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso prostate cancer cells zzso suppressed expression of zzso genes and increased zzso markers such as zzso whereas small interfering zzso zzso of zzso increased expression of zzso zzso Further, zzso inhibited tumor growth and zzso in a tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso factor zzso a master zzso regulator and zzso of zzso zzso triggering nuclear export of Snail via zzso zzso Snail zzso zzso causes acquisition of zzso traits and expression of stem cell zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso functions as a tumor and zzso zzso at least partly by regulating zzso zzso and that loss of zzso may contribute to acquisition of an aggressive zzso zzso
