zzso encodes a protein required for programmed cell death in zzso whose zzso activity is zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso are relevant for zzso killing zzso the zzso region, which zzso zzso by zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso activity, and the internal zzso domain, which triggers a zzso zzso We explored the role of these two zzso in zzso killing of zzso cells by zzso The zzso domain is essential for zzso zzso activity in mouse cells, whereas the zzso domain is zzso The zzso domain is required and sufficient for zzso targeting to zzso and for zzso c release in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso activities do not require zzso or zzso function, revealing zzso activity as the first zzso stimulus able to trigger the zzso death zzso in zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso
