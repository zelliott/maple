zzso is a zzso zzso required for copper zzso and related to Wilson disease of zzso In addition to various zzso corresponding to other zzso zzso zzso includes an N zzso extension zzso with six copper binding zzso We obtained high yield expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso isolated with the zzso fraction of cell zzso accounts for zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso yields 30 zzso of zzso of zzso at 37 degrees C, pH zzso zzso zzso with zzso occurs with zzso zzso and is totally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate of zzso accounts for a small fraction of the total zzso and is prevented by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso copper binding motif in zzso zzso zzso of zzso following chase with zzso zzso occurs with an initial burst involving zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and continues at a slow rate involving zzso zzso If a copper zzso is added with the zzso chase, the initial burst is smaller, and further zzso is totally zzso Analysis by zzso and mass zzso demonstrates that the zzso stable zzso involves zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and occurs with the same pattern ex zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The overall copper dependence of zzso and zzso zzso suggests long range zzso effects, including interactions of zzso and zzso zzso with strong influence on zzso zzso
