A combination of sequence zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and structural information for zzso leads to the hypothesis that zzso zzso and zzso 18 are active site zzso in zzso These zzso were zzso to replace zzso side chains and the zzso proteins were isolated and zzso zzso and competitive displacement studies using zzso a fluorescent analog of zzso zzso indicate that these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retain the ability to zzso bind zzso zzso at the active zzso These observations suggest the structural integrity of the zzso zzso zzso The functional importance of zzso zzso was evaluated by kinetic zzso The zzso and zzso decreases in zzso observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso support assignment of a crucial zzso role to zzso zzso A zzso decrease in activity and a zzso inflation of the zzso for zzso is documented for the zzso zzso indicating that zzso 18 influences the active site but is not crucial for reaction zzso zzso of the influence of zzso zzso zzso appears to represent the first documentation of the functional importance of a zzso in the zzso zzso site and zzso insight into zzso reactions zzso by a variety of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
