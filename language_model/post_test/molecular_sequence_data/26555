This unit describes a zzso protocol for zzso induced zzso stem cells zzso from human zzso by zzso of synthetic zzso The zzso of zzso cells requires transient expression of a set of zzso factors that collectively activate an zzso gene regulatory network specifying the zzso zzso The necessary zzso factor expression was first zzso using zzso however, as viral integration into the zzso is problematic for cell therapy applications, the use of zzso zzso such as zzso is increasingly zzso Strong points of the zzso approach include high efficiency, rapid zzso and zzso of a zzso phase to purge the zzso Still, the method is relatively zzso and has, up to now, involved the use of zzso cells, which brings drawbacks including poor zzso to clinically oriented zzso zzso Using the methods described here, zzso zzso can be performed without feeders at zzso labor and material costs relative to established zzso
