zzso commitment of zzso cells is associated with the establishment of specific zzso programs of zzso However, how zzso cell differentiation affects the program of DNA replication has not been zzso To gain insight into zzso between zzso zzso regulation and initiation of DNA zzso we took advantage of an in zzso differentiation system of zzso T cells, in which one can manipulate their differentiation into zzso or zzso zzso We searched for replication origins in the zzso zzso locus and compared their profiles in the two zzso cell lineages which were derived in zzso from the same precursor T zzso We identified a replication origin zzso downstream from zzso 4 of zzso and showed that this origin functions in both zzso and zzso zzso A distant regulatory element called zzso zzso zzso sequence 1) in the zzso zzso region zzso with a zzso zzso zzso site and is required for efficient, coordinated expression of zzso zzso zzso initiation from zzso is significantly reduced in zzso and zzso cells derived from zzso zzso However, the replication timing of this locus is consistently early during S phase in both zzso and zzso cells under either the zzso or zzso deletion zzso Thus, the zzso zzso element in the zzso region regulates replication initiation from a distant replication origin in a manner independent from its effect on zzso zzso but not the replication timing of the segment surrounding this zzso
