zzso properties are potentially useful in predicting functional differences between aligned protein zzso We present a method that considers zzso properties from ancestral sequences predicted to have given rise to the zzso of interest by gene zzso zzso between two map zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a region that had an excess of change in properties after gene zzso followed by conservation within the two zzso This region corresponded to that zzso defined as important for zzso and zzso zzso The derived scores for the region of interest were found to differ significantly in their distribution compared to the rest of the protein when the zzso test was applied zzso zzso zzso Thus, the incorporation of ancestral zzso properties is useful in predicting functional differences between protein zzso In addition, the method was applied to the zzso and zzso components of the zzso and zzso zzso These proteins showed a similar pattern in their evolution and regions predicted to zzso functional differences are zzso
