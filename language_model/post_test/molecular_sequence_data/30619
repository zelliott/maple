The sequences preceding the zzso zzso start site are able to direct efficient zzso only upon introduction into cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso In transient expression zzso the activity of a reporter gene zzso linked to this promoter is zzso higher in zzso differentiated zzso cells than in zzso zzso cells which no longer express their zzso zzso This tissue specificity depends on the very zzso promoter region, composed of a zzso box, the zzso element and a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso box leads to a two- to zzso decrease in activity, deletion of the zzso element zzso results in loss of zzso The zzso is a zzso binding site for zzso a strictly liver specific zzso zzso When the affinity of this factor for zzso is decreased by bacterial zzso zzso includes a dam zzso zzso by zzso or by its replacement with the zzso element from the zzso gene zzso the activity of the short promoter zzso plus the zzso zzso is zzso This activity can be rescued in the presence of the more upstream zzso zzso zzso and the zzso box zzso respectively, by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are then absolutely zzso Our results suggest that the upstream elements contribute to promoter activity by stabilizing the zzso complex and not by direct interaction with zzso or the zzso zzso It is probable that these zzso essentially zzso in already differentiated zzso cells, play a crucial role during development or differentiation to activate the promoter in cells that contain a low concentration of zzso and/or an zzso unable to open inactive zzso zzso
