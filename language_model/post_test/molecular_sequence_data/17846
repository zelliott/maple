The invasion and zzso of cancer cells is a complex zzso process involving destruction of basement zzso as an early event in the zzso zzso Recent evidence implicates zzso zzso zzso zzso such as type IV zzso as playing a central role in this tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Two distinct type IV zzso zzso are now zzso zzso and zzso studies of several human tumors show correlations between invasive potential and the 72 zzso type IV zzso zzso Studies in zzso tumor models suggest that the 92 zzso type IV zzso may play an important role in these models, but data on human tumors and human tumor tissue is zzso Evidence suggest that the regulation of the 72 zzso type IV zzso zzso activity may occur at many levels, including zzso mechanisms, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and specific zzso of active zzso Thus the invasion of human tumor cells through basement zzso may be the result of net type IV zzso activity that is the result of a balance of activated zzso species and zzso
