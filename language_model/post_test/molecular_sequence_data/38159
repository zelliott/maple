Relative to zzso zzso zzso from zzso the comparable zzso in zzso contains an additional 9 zzso domain at its zzso The domain is zzso to the zzso associated zzso zzso zzso of the light harvesting zzso zzso The zzso consequences of the genetic removal of this domain from the zzso zzso which encodes zzso have been studied in zzso zzso zzso The in frame deletion of 75 zzso at the zzso rendered zzso length zzso zzso with normal functionality in linear zzso electron zzso Salt shock correlated with increased abundance of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso stopped salt zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso electron zzso Both zzso determination of the storage of energy from zzso I specific zzso light, and the zzso zzso of zzso suggest lack of function of the truncated zzso in the zzso zzso complex zzso step of the zzso zzso zzso electron transfer zzso Independent zzso studies and analysis of zzso distribution through activity zzso after native zzso zzso showed that association of zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of the extended zzso domain of the zzso The truncated zzso gene was also transformed into a zzso zzso zzso deficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88 (1991) zzso zzso zzso of the double zzso supported our conclusion that both the zzso zzso complex and zzso contribute independently to the zzso zzso zzso zzso step in zzso zzso zzso electron zzso The distribution, binding properties and function of zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso zzso will be zzso
