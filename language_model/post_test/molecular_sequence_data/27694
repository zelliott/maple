The nuclear gene for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned using synthetic zzso zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso The gene zzso codes for a basic protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and resides on zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso gene and the zzso sequence of the isolated protein revealed the existence of a leader zzso sequence of 12 zzso acid zzso No significant similarity to known zzso protein sequences of other organisms was zzso
