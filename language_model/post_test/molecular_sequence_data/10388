We have characterized a zzso zzso putative transport related zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four of these gene products zzso are zzso to members of the zzso zzso (ABC) zzso of bacterial transport zzso zzso zzso identified as zzso has significant sequence similarity to a family of zzso zzso zzso proteins and to a family of zzso proteins that may have dual roles as zzso binding proteins and zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso protein zzso whereas zzso and zzso are related to the zzso membrane protein components of ABC transport zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso The last open reading frame zzso of the zzso zzso encodes a protein that is highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extension results demonstrated that the zzso zzso is transcribed from a zzso zzso promoter zzso Northern analysis and reverse zzso chain reactions provided evidence for the presence of a primary zzso zzso transcript and a secondary, less abundant, zzso zzso The zzso zzso is flanked by a Holliday structure DNA zzso zzso zzso and two zzso representing a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a previously characterized gene zzso a membrane zzso zzso The presence of a complex zzso containing a putative ABC transport system and a zzso zzso indicates a possible linkage between transport and gene regulation in zzso
