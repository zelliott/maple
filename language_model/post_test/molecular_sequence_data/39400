zzso of sodium channel zzso a finely tuned process that critically regulates the flow of sodium zzso into excitable cells, is a common functional consequence of inherited zzso associated with zzso skeletal muscle disease, zzso and cardiac zzso zzso the structural basis of zzso is key to understanding these zzso Here we identify a novel role for a structural motif in the zzso zzso of the heart zzso sodium channel in determining channel zzso zzso modeling predicts an zzso zzso interface between paired zzso hands in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso The predicted interface is zzso among almost all zzso zzso proteins and is the locus of a number of zzso zzso Using the structural model as a guide, we provide zzso and zzso evidence that the structural integrity of this interface is necessary for proper zzso channel zzso zzso We thus demonstrate a novel role of the sodium channel zzso zzso structure in the control of channel zzso and in zzso caused by inherited zzso that disrupt zzso
