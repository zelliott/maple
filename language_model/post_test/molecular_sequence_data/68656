A new diagnostic technique, universal zzso generator zzso has been developed to detect zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Since it is a zzso chain zzso technique, it may be used to detect zzso S and zzso C zzso in adults, zzso or from zzso during the first 10 weeks of zzso zzso gene zzso sequences are amplified by the zzso chain reaction, and are zzso with a zzso universal zzso zzso zzso S and C zzso are identified by characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso The technique is simple and rapid to do, even by zzso laboratories, and is zzso to large-scale screening for zzso S and C zzso as well as prenatal diagnosis of zzso cell zzso
