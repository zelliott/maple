The origin of the zzso central nervous system zzso is zzso One theory is that a zzso was present in the first zzso and that it gave rise to both the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Another theory proposes that the zzso zzso arose by a dramatic process of zzso and zzso from a diffuse nerve net zzso with the skin of the animal, such as zzso worms zzso zzso are supposed to zzso We show here that juvenile and adult zzso worms in fact have a bona fide zzso zzso dense zzso of zzso associated with a zzso forming two zzso zzso and zzso The latter is zzso in the zzso as a zzso neural zzso zzso to previous zzso the greater part of the adult zzso skin is zzso although elements of the peripheral nervous system zzso are found zzso We use molecular markers to show that several zzso types are zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso These zzso features, whatever their zzso with the zzso zzso imply that nervous system zzso predates the evolutionary separation of zzso and zzso zzso
