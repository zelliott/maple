Human zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso to zzso from the zzso cell line and partially zzso zzso zzso derived from this sequence were used to screen a zzso library prepared from zzso zzso One positive clone was zzso and contained most of the coding sequence as well as a long incomplete 3' untranslated region zzso base zzso This zzso sequence was shown to zzso zzso by zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso the remainder of the zzso zzso was obtained by primer extension of zzso zzso zzso using a probe complementary to the zzso coding zzso The coding sequence for zzso was placed under the control of the zzso zzso promoter, and the protein expressed in zzso coli formed a complex with zzso that could be detected zzso By zzso sequence analysis, zzso zzso encodes a protein containing 415 zzso acids with a predicted zzso Mr of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso is very similar to zzso zzso (3 zzso acid zzso and shows extensive zzso with members of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was found to be more zzso to zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso appears to have no typical zzso signal zzso The 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso contains a putative regulatory sequence that has been associated with the inflammatory zzso
