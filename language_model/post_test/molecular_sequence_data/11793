Two different zzso zzso experiments on the zzso II zzso protein of zzso zzso indicate that zzso rules relating sequence directly to zzso are dependent on which sets or groups of zzso are zzso zzso Previously reported zzso zzso of this zzso protein (based on both zzso and structural zzso showed that substituting zzso acids with large zzso volumes at zzso beta 31 caused the zzso protein to have a spectrum characteristic of zzso I zzso The six zzso that underwent zzso zzso were modeled to lie on one side of a zzso zzso that binds zzso In a second experiment described here, we have not used structural models or zzso in choosing zzso zzso Instead, a set of six zzso zzso was selected for zzso zzso In this latter experiment, the zzso zzso at zzso beta 31 was not a determining factor in whether zzso or zzso zzso were zzso therefore, we conclude that the zzso rules for zzso prediction are context zzso While zzso prediction is context dependent, the ability to identify elements of primary structure causing zzso diversity appears not to zzso This strengthens the argument for performing zzso zzso with an arbitrary grouping of zzso if structural models are zzso
