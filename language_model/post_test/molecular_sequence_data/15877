The zzso zzso zzso of prune zzso causes no zzso by itself, but causes zzso in individuals zzso for the zzso zzso zzso prune zzso We have recovered 12 zzso zzso of zzso of zzso All of the zzso fail to complement a zzso cell lethal zzso in the abnormal wing discs zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso of prune is a zzso in the zzso zzso First, zzso zzso leads to reduced zzso of the zzso gene product, but does not affect zzso zzso Second, when a copy of the zzso gene is cloned from zzso of prune zzso flies and injected into zzso zzso express the lethal interaction with zzso In individuals of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is present at normal levels but the zzso zzso fails to zzso The absence of the zzso gene product in such individuals is the cause of zzso Although the zzso zzso is a zzso of a zzso zzso its sequence is similar to zzso V of zzso zzso zzso
