A cholesterol zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from fresh zzso of a clouded zzso zzso zzso and was studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that the novel strain formed a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso its closest zzso being the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with sequence similarity values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence of strain zzso exhibited similarities of zzso with those of the type strains of recognized species of the zzso zzso being most similar to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 87 and zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso fatty acid analyses and zzso zzso data readily distinguished the new isolate from its nearest zzso zzso zzso is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
