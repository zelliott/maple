The recent discovery of a single point zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso 2 zzso in a considerable fraction of patients has shed light on the molecular zzso in Philadelphia zzso chronic zzso disorders zzso zzso We established a robust and reliable method for detection of the zzso zzso in bone zzso cells derived from archival bone zzso zzso based on zzso chain reaction and subsequent restriction site zzso In a series of proven zzso zzso classified according to World Health Organization criteria zzso zzso zzso we detected the zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso chronic idiopathic zzso zzso of advanced chronic idiopathic zzso and zzso of essential zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso 10), acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso 10), secondary zzso zzso zzso 10), or normal bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso site analysis was also suitable for zzso cell populations derived from peripheral blood and bone zzso zzso Besides providing support in the differential diagnosis of zzso versus zzso zzso this newly developed zzso reveals considerable zzso between zzso different disease entities, indicating that additional genetic zzso might be responsible for the established differences of zzso zzso
