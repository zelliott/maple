A number of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were isolated by screening a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso DNA with a probe derived from the zzso zzso zzso gene (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies on one of these zzso zzso are zzso zzso is located between zzso and zzso on the X zzso A full-length zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that shows many of the zzso features of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the functional expression of the zzso the corresponding zzso was produced, in zzso and zzso into zzso zzso When expressed alone zzso shows no zzso channel zzso When zzso with a zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso which is itself unable to form functional zzso zzso contributed to the formation of a functional zzso This is the first functional expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and supports the interpretation that the differentiation between alpha and zzso zzso dates back to the earliest stages of the evolution of the zzso
