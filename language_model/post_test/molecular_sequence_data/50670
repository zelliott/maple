zzso of a bovine zzso zzso library with zzso resulted in the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso and shown to contain an open reading frame with a putative protein of 261 zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso zzso leader zzso and a zzso leader sequence of 16 zzso zzso zzso was shown to share a high level of zzso acid sequence zzso over portions of its sequence to human, zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a potential zzso site zzso a zzso zzso binding region, a high level of zzso zzso and a high abundance of acid zzso acids characteristic of zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid region of zzso (the first 82 zzso zzso and 42 zzso acids at the C zzso had the highest level of zzso with the zzso at zzso The middle portion of the zzso had greatly reduced zzso ranging from 50% zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso acids zzso There were also deletions and additions of sequence in zzso that were not found in the other zzso The zzso suggest that these proteins are highly related and may be derived from a common gene by alternative zzso A zzso zzso zzso probe constructed from zzso containing a region with low zzso to the zzso zzso acids zzso with less than zzso zzso plus zzso acids zzso and untranslated zzso was used in northern blots and zzso protection zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
