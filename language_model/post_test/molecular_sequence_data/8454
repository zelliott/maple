Previously, we reported 12 synthetic zzso and zzso recognition regions representing surface areas of the zzso zzso of zzso influenza zzso In the present study, four of these peptides were examined in zzso mice for their ability to produce protective immunity against lethal infection with a dose equivalent to 10 zzso of influenza zzso These peptides corresponded to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of the selected zzso in their free form, evoked zzso zzso that zzso with intact zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso also zzso zzso delayed type hypersensitivity zzso zzso These two zzso when injected into mice, not only failed to protect the zzso mice against challenge with influenza virus, but in fact caused greater zzso to viral infection as compared to control animals that had been injected with zzso In contrast, peptides zzso and zzso which were unable to induce adequate zzso zzso responses, zzso zzso and zzso protection, respectively, compared to the control group that received only saline zzso zzso zzso to P zzso zzso
