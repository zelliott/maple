The complete zzso sequence has been established for two genes zzso and zzso coding for different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Two further genes zzso and zzso of this zzso have been partially zzso The complete open reading frames code for zzso of zzso zzso acids in zzso These two open reading frames are similar with less than 12 percent zzso zzso differences and less than 9 percent zzso zzso acid zzso The open reading frames of the two partially zzso genes zzso to the zzso part of the zzso coded and are similar to the corresponding parts of the completely zzso zzso The deduced translation products of the two complete genes differ in their calculated zzso values by zzso pH zzso The genes code for zzso which contain 12 or 11 zzso zzso zzso not present in the proteins isolated from the zzso Other zzso zzso also have similar zzso extensions which probably play a role in zzso targeting and zzso of the newly zzso zzso A comparison of 19 related zzso from bacteria and zzso with the zzso product revealed zzso percent zzso acid zzso zzso reconstruction based on zzso zzso acid differences with maximum zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso and distance based zzso zzso methods showed that the zzso zzso zzso is the most divergent of all zzso zzso zzso indicating its long independent evolutionary zzso
