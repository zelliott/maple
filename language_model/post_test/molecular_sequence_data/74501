When zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is grown in a medium with zzso as the carbon source, the culture zzso to a lesser extent in stationary phase than when the bacteria are grown in a medium containing zzso zzso of zzso the major zzso of zzso zzso is not influenced by the carbon zzso zzso studies with a fusion protein consisting of the zzso protein of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain of zzso revealed that cell walls of cells from both subspecies grown on zzso bind less zzso than cell walls of cells grown on zzso zzso grown on zzso or zzso and treated with zzso acid prior to zzso binding bind similar amounts of zzso Analysis of the composition of the zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells grown on zzso or zzso showed that the zzso composition is influenced by the carbon source: cells grown on zzso contain zzso with less zzso than cells grown on zzso In conclusion, growth of zzso zzso on zzso changes the zzso composition in the cell wall in such a way that less zzso is able to bind to the zzso resulting in a decrease in zzso
