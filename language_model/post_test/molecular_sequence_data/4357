zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA with zzso zzso produces highly repetitive fragments of 281 and 385 zzso that were cloned and zzso The shorter zzso zzso to the unit repeat zzso of a satellite zzso The longer zzso was found to be part of a zzso repeat of another satellite DNA zzso that was cloned intact as an zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso to zzso from which it seems to be derived by a single zzso Among all species tested, only the related brown zzso zzso zzso contained zzso repetitive zzso The overall number of zzso and zzso repeats per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso repeats are organized in separate zzso but repetitive units formed by various combinations of the two repeats were also observed on Southern zzso The amount of these extra repeats varies greatly among animals from the same population, representing a rare case of individual zzso in the satellite DNA zzso FISH with zzso specific for both zzso or for zzso only, labeled the zzso and zzso zzso of all zzso This indicated that zzso and zzso are zzso within the same zzso regions of the zzso
