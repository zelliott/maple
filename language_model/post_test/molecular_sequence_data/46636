The zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso cells from zzso of patients with zzso childhood acute zzso zzso the result being the zzso fusion gene carrying a sequence different from zzso or zzso Because the protein newly formed by zzso zzso fusion is probably not tolerated by human immune system, the fusion region is a good candidate for tumor zzso expressed only in zzso zzso zzso zzso We established two human zzso zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso reacting to the zzso fusion region, from two unrelated healthy zzso In order to do this, we zzso peripheral blood zzso cells with synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso fusion zzso Both zzso and zzso proliferated in response to zzso zzso fusion protein as well as to a zzso zzso in the context of zzso and zzso respectively, and killed B zzso cells zzso with the zzso Furthermore, these zzso clones proliferated in response to several altered zzso zzso carrying a single zzso substitution in the zzso zzso and some induced zzso of proliferation and production of zzso zzso These zzso altered zzso zzso can be given consideration for zzso zzso
