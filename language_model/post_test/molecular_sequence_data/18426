A protocol has been developed for the zzso of zzso from the honey zzso zzso zzso zzso allows for the first characterization of a zzso from the large order zzso zzso zzso are unusual among insect zzso in that they contain only one type of zzso The honey bee zzso was isolated from zzso of honey bee queens by a combination of density zzso zzso zzso zzso and affinity zzso The native zzso particle is a very high density zzso containing approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the major zzso zzso The equilibrium density zzso zzso is the same as that for zzso zzso zzso which contains a much higher proportion of zzso The zzso bound zzso zzso of the particle is high in zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso is similar to those of zzso from other insect zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso was determined, the first such sequence for any insect zzso When analyzed by sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resolved into a single band with an apparent Mr of zzso zzso zzso under reducing and native conditions yielded estimated Mr values of about zzso
