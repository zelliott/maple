A number of zzso studies of the zzso zzso protein have established that the fatty zzso site is within an zzso zzso zzso The same studies have also suggested the existence of a region physically distinct from the fatty zzso site which connects the cavity of the protein with the external zzso zzso referred to as the zzso In an effort to examine the portal region, we have used zzso zzso to introduce the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein has been isolated, zzso and its stability and binding properties studied by zzso zzso As assessed by zzso zzso the zzso form exhibited a slight overall zzso relative to the zzso protein under both acid and alkaline zzso zzso to the cavity in both the zzso and zzso proteins was observed by zzso analysis of the modification of a cavity zzso zzso by the zzso zzso agent 5, zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso of zzso zzso was modified zzso faster than the zzso zzso The zzso binding properties of both the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were analyzed using a fluorescent probe at pH zzso and zzso The apparent zzso zzso for zzso acid were approximately zzso greater than the zzso zzso independent of zzso In addition, there is a zzso increase in the zzso for zzso acid for the portal zzso relative to the zzso at pH zzso To study the effect of pH on the double zzso it was zzso and analyzed in two distinct space groups at pH zzso and zzso While in general the differences in the overall main chain zzso are zzso changes were observed in the zzso structures near the site of the zzso At both pH values, the zzso side chains are positioned somewhat differently than in zzso zzso To ensure that the zzso had not altered zzso conditions near the binding site, the zzso coordinates were used to monitor the zzso zzso from the head group site to the positions near the portal zzso The differences in the zzso zzso were small in all regions, and did not explain the differences in zzso zzso We present these results within the context of fatty acid binding and suggest zzso association is more complex than that described within a single equilibrium zzso
