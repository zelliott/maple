The seeds of peas zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressing a gene for zzso zzso zzso from the common bean zzso zzso are protected from damage by old world zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we used zzso zzso zzso mass zzso to compare the zzso modifications of zzso from transgenic sources with the processed forms of the protein from several bean zzso All sources showed zzso with differences in the relative abundance of particular zzso due to differences in the frequency of addition of zzso variable processing of zzso and differences of zzso zzso zzso The structural variation among the zzso was generally within the range of the bean zzso Previously, mice showed allergic reactions following zzso of transgenic pea zzso but not bean zzso Here, only minor differences were observed following zzso zzso Both of the transgenic pea and bean forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses, suggesting that both proteins are zzso and could potentially be zzso
