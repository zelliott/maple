The protein zzso is a potent zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso raised against the entire envelope zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso recognized by zzso is located within the third zzso region zzso of zzso Recently, several zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and selection were zzso 

Virtually complete zzso assignment of the variable zzso zzso of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso was accomplished and the combining site structure of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was solved using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Five of the six zzso determining regions zzso of the zzso adopt standard zzso zzso whereas zzso of the heavy chain assumes an unexpected zzso The zzso recognized by zzso encompasses 14 of the 18 zzso zzso The bound zzso assumes a zzso zzso with a zzso loop located at the very center of the binding zzso The zzso and zzso surface areas buried upon binding are zzso A and 743 zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso mean zzso The surface of zzso interacting with the zzso is more extensive and the zzso zzso orientation in the binding site is significantly different compared with those derived from the crystal structures of a zzso zzso of the zzso MN strain zzso zzso to three different zzso zzso 

The surface of zzso that is in contact with the zzso zzso zzso is likely to zzso to a zzso region in the native zzso zzso Some zzso of this region of zzso are involved in zzso zzso and in discrimination between different zzso receptors zzso by the zzso Several highly variable zzso in the zzso loop limit the specificity of the zzso zzso helping the virus to escape from the immune zzso The highly zzso zzso sequence might have a role in maintaining the zzso zzso of the zzso loop despite zzso deletions and zzso in the zzso zzso
