We cloned mouse zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso from mouse zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso and unexpectedly found four zzso zzso of zzso by reverse zzso zzso and sequence zzso The alternative zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 227 zzso zzso zzso Cell death of zzso cells, induced by serum zzso was enhanced by zzso and the action of zzso was inhibited by A1 zzso These results indicate that A1 can inhibit cell death not only via the well known zzso related to the zzso family but also through direct interaction with zzso in zzso zzso zzso
