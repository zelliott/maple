Eight strains of zzso bacteria were isolated from the water column of Lake zzso zzso Dry zzso zzso using cold enrichment zzso The zzso were zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso All zzso grew at 0 degrees C, and all but one grew at zzso temperatures characteristic of the water column of Lake zzso Growth temperature zzso varied among zzso but the majority showed zzso near 15 degrees C, indicative of zzso zzso One isolate was truly zzso growing zzso around 10 degrees C and not above 20 degrees zzso Half of the zzso grew at zzso salt while the other half did not, and all but one isolate grew at 2 zzso of zzso Our zzso are the first zzso from the water column of Lake zzso to be characterized zzso and zzso and show that zzso species of at least two major zzso of zzso inhabit Lake zzso
