A zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso sequence was identified in human tumor zzso It was found to be the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we report on the expression in zzso coli and functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in one step through an zzso affinity zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and retained its zzso zzso of zzso zzso rabbit zzso The zzso zzso from an affinity column as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso at relatively high protein zzso comparable to those used to mediate zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso appears as a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso proteins followed by zzso treatment revealed that the zzso is probably a peripheral membrane protein zzso both the zzso and the zzso zzso are exposed on the outer cell zzso These results point to the membrane disposition and orientation of the zzso and suggest a mechanism for a zzso relationship of zzso zzso
