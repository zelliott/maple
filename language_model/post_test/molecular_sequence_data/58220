We have used zzso display technology to identify peptides binding zzso a zzso zzso raised against the zzso 42,000 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso surface protein 1 zzso By screening a constrained zzso library, seven independent clones binding zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso for these peptides was lower than for the natural zzso and the zzso binding was strictly associated with the viral context and the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that five of them shared zzso with the zzso 42,000 zzso zzso zzso and therefore appears to identify the zzso zzso However, the other two zzso while related to each other, did not zzso to any sequence in the zzso zzso To evaluate their zzso interest, these zzso were injected into mice belonging to zzso zzso and zzso zzso All animals developed a strong immune response against zzso particles but only zzso mice produced zzso zzso with zzso All zzso in zzso mice zzso a specific response against zzso even those sharing no sequence similarity with the zzso Moreover, the zzso of these immune zzso and the zzso response against zzso were comparable, suggesting zzso could be used as components of a zzso vaccine based on the zzso zzso of zzso
