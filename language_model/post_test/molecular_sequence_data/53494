A zzso zzso screen was performed to identify possible zzso zzso interactive with zzso zzso a zzso factor with zzso activity, expressed during early brain and zzso zzso The screen resulted in the identification of a zzso protein known as zzso or zzso zzso interactions were confirmed by affinity zzso and by zzso Northern analysis confirmed earlier reports of ubiquitous zzso expression in adult zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso revealed expression primarily in the developing nervous system, with strong expression in the zzso root zzso and developing zzso In contrast to previous reports, both zzso and nuclear expression of zzso was zzso The results reported here confirm and extend earlier reports of zzso zzso They suggest for the first time, that in addition to acting as a zzso of zzso activity, zzso may function, as do other zzso zzso to promote the formation of zzso complexes involved in shuttling information between the zzso and the zzso
