zzso zzso cells swarm at 30 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C, and the underlying mechanism is not zzso Our previous studies had shown that a temperature zzso from 30 to 37 degrees C reduced the expression levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso genes that comprise a zzso system, also resulted in precocious swarming zzso at 37 degrees zzso To further characterize the underlying zzso in the present study, we report that expression of zzso and synthesis of zzso are significantly increased in the zzso zzso strain at 37 degrees zzso zzso extension analysis for determination of the zzso start zzso of zzso revealed two zzso start sites, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso approximately P) binding site by an zzso mobility shift zzso showed direct interaction of zzso approximately zzso but not zzso zzso zzso with the zzso promoter zzso A zzso I zzso zzso using a zzso zzso approach further determined that the zzso approximately P binding site is located between base pair positions zzso and zzso from the translation start zzso zzso in the zzso promoter zzso The binding site zzso with the zzso zzso promoter zzso A modified zzso zzso zzso was subsequently performed to confirm that zzso binds to the zzso promoter region in zzso In conclusion, our results indicated that activated zzso signaling directly zzso zzso promoter activity at 37 degrees zzso This zzso effect was comparatively alleviated at 30 degrees zzso This finding might explain, at least in part, the phenomenon of zzso of zzso zzso swarming at 37 degrees zzso
