In this study, the evolutionary history of the variable second zzso of zzso and its adjoining zzso b are compared across a number of species and subspecies of the Australian zzso Three lineages are identified in the second zzso across a range of zzso zzso Two of these zzso separated by the zzso of a probable zzso short zzso zzso element and by point zzso outside the zzso region, are both found in each of the major zzso of the endemic Australian zzso This pattern of ancestral zzso is reflected in the adjoining zzso 2 zzso although zzso constraints confirm that the zzso is not identical to that of the associated zzso zzso In addition, the coding sequences show evidence of the retention of ancestral zzso with identical zzso sequences found in two divergent species, and some indication of gene conversion detected for the zzso zzso
