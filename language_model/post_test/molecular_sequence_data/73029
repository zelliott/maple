To identify new proteins involved in zzso signal zzso and zzso regulation, we used a zzso zzso system to identify proteins that interact with the zzso zzso zzso We cloned a mouse zzso which encodes a novel approximately zzso protein that binds to zzso we have designated the protein as zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso exhibits zzso with members of the zzso protein zzso zzso also contains three zzso repeat zzso zzso the zzso sequence is present in proteins required for cell cycle control and zzso synthesis and in steroid zzso zzso zzso experiments in mouse zzso cells reveal that zzso is zzso and associates with zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso treatment zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the response of the zzso gene to zzso Our data suggest that zzso influences zzso zzso and/or nuclear targeting of zzso
