zzso are cell zzso bacteria that evolved by drastic reduction of the zzso zzso Complete zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed the presence of numerous copies of four distinct large zzso zzso repetitive elements zzso One copy each of zzso zzso and zzso are localized within the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and their involvement in sequence variation in zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso has been zzso Here we analyzed a clinical strain of zzso zzso designated zzso isolated from a 1993 outbreak of respiratory infections in San Antonio, zzso Based on the type of zzso within the zzso zzso we classified clinical isolate zzso as type 2 with unique minor sequence zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed sequence divergence in two previously zzso hypothetical genes zzso and zzso zzso Closer inspection of this region revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso previously zzso unique zzso sequences found only in zzso zzso zzso and sequence analyses revealed a zzso event involving three zzso genes that resulted in fusion of zzso and zzso reading frames and loss of all but a short zzso of another zzso zzso zzso The multiple copies of unique zzso elements spread throughout the zzso could allow vast numbers of sequence variations in clinical zzso Comparisons of zzso acid sequences showed the presence of zzso zzso motifs in zzso and zzso proteins in reference strain zzso and the absence of these motifs in the fused protein of zzso The presence of tandem zzso and other repeats points to possible regulatory functions of proteins zzso by zzso zzso
