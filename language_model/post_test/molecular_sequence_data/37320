In zzso zzso terminal zzso growth is accompanied by a decrease in levels of zzso zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso and zzso The decrease in zzso is essentially due to an increase in zzso degradation by zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso in growing healthy zzso In contrast, the decrease in zzso is partly due to a decrease in zzso expression by zzso cells and also to an increase in zzso zzso degradation, as previously shown in zzso and zzso In the present work we show that bovine and zzso zzso zzso fluid contains a zzso activity that degrades zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso levels of native zzso as assessed by Western zzso zzso in comparison with the corresponding zzso In contrast, much higher levels of zzso and zzso zzso fragments were found by zzso in bovine and zzso zzso zzso fluid than in the corresponding zzso Moreover, bovine and zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to induce zzso degradation of zzso zzso and this degradation was enhanced by zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was surprisingly zzso in both species by a zzso zzso raised against human zzso In addition, zzso human zzso zzso was able to cleave zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso generating zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be less sensitive than zzso to zzso by zzso in zzso As in zzso fluid, zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso enhanced by zzso and inhibited by a zzso derived from the zzso domain of zzso zzso Finally, zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was due to a direct interaction of zzso with zzso rather than with zzso Overall, these data show that in bovine and zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso During zzso growth, the increase in zzso zzso by zzso as well as the decrease in zzso zzso are responsible for the decrease in intact zzso levels and the increase in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the increase and decrease in zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, as well as the zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso present in zzso or other zzso might participate in higher zzso levels and a decrease in zzso zzso
