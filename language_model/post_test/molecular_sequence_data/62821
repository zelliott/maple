To monitor the expression of zzso plant genes in zzso a collection of zzso transgenic lines of zzso zzso were generated with the promoter trap zzso zzso which carries a zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene linked to the right zzso zzso By detection of zzso in zzso zzso zzso lines were identified showing zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso To facilitate the identification of zzso zzso expression patterns, a pooled seed stock was zzso Several lines showed sugar, salt, and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 215 promoter trap lines indicated that about 50% of plants contained single zzso whereas zzso carried two and zzso carried three or more zzso zzso zzso the zzso insert junctions isolated from 17 zzso lines identified zzso tags in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso generated by zzso insertions in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso specific expression of eight zzso zzso genes was confirmed to be similar to the zzso patterns observed in the corresponding zzso zzso Here, we describe the characterization of a zzso zzso reporter gene fusion with the zzso ABC zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed similar induction by salt, zzso and zzso treatments and zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results illustrate that zzso gene traps are well suited for monitoring the expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso
