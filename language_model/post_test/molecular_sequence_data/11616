In order to study the effect of zzso of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso on its interaction with DNA zzso zzso delta and its loading onto DNA by replication factor C zzso we have zzso a single zzso zzso located at the zzso interface zzso to zzso This zzso zzso had a profound effect on zzso since it completely abolished zzso formation as seen by zzso zzso zzso and native gel zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein was unable to stimulate DNA synthesis by pol delta and did not compete effectively with zzso zzso for pol zzso although it was able to zzso and could to some extent interact with zzso of functionally active zzso We thus conclude that zzso molecules that are not part of a circular zzso complex cannot interact with the pol delta zzso zzso the zzso protein could not be loaded onto DNA by zzso and did not compete with zzso zzso for loading onto DNA, indicating that zzso zzso may also be a prerequisite for its recognition by zzso The adverse effects caused by this single zzso suggest that zzso of zzso is essential for the zzso to keep their overall structure and that the structural changes imposed by zzso are important for interaction with other zzso
