zzso is a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the active portion of the zzso inhibitor protein of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso Van Patten, zzso zzso and Walsh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso responsible for the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of protein zzso were further investigated using deletion and substitution zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso 5, 23, and 24 were not required for activity since the zzso zzso retained full zzso zzso removal of the first seven zzso acids from the zzso zzso of zzso caused a progressive zzso loss of zzso zzso In contrast, substitution of either zzso zzso or zzso with zzso or zzso by zzso in zzso produced less than zzso decreases in zzso Of the 2 aromatic zzso in zzso the individual substitution of zzso and zzso by zzso caused, respectively, zzso and zzso decreases in zzso zzso demonstrating important roles for zzso This zzso portion of the zzso is believed to contain a significant portion of zzso Many recognition or structural zzso are also essential in the zzso portion of zzso In addition to the basic zzso provided by the three zzso several other of the zzso are critical for full zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in either zzso or zzso lowered the zzso potency by zzso and zzso zzso Separate replacement of zzso or zzso in either zzso or zzso caused zzso decreases in zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso together (in zzso produced a synergistic loss of zzso zzso zzso a doubly zzso analog exhibited a zzso increase in Ki zzso We conclude that zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso each contribute important features to the binding of these zzso peptides to the protein zzso either by providing recognition zzso inducing structure, and/or allowing essential zzso backbone zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
