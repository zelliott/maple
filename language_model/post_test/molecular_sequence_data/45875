An abundant zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso is an interesting example of a zzso zzso It consists of two functionally unrelated zzso an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain, which are connected by an approximately zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso as a zzso zzso Interestingly, the concerted action of all three zzso of zzso produces a new zzso activity, zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso The present studies had two zzso First, to explore the modular organization of zzso through the production of hybrid zzso by domain replacement with zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso The second was to explore the molecular basis for the distinct zzso mechanisms of zzso and related zzso utilizing zzso Our studies revealed that zzso cannot substitute for the zzso domain of zzso in order to catalyze the zzso zzso It is apparently due to inability of zzso to catalyze the zzso of zzso in the absence of the zzso of the zzso reaction despite the high similarity of the zzso centers of the two zzso Our results further imply that zzso in place of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso center is an important zzso for zzso zzso as opposed to zzso zzso
