The gene zzso which encodes a zzso in zzso zzso is transcribed by zzso in the zzso This zzso is responsible for the resistance to hydrogen zzso shown by zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso is also a zzso general stress zzso since it is strongly induced by heat, salt and ethanol stress, as well as by energy zzso The zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso promoters of zzso zzso and the zzso start points used by zzso and zzso differ by only one zzso Our results indicate that the level of zzso level in zzso spores depends mainly on zzso because zzso zzso show normal zzso activity in dormant and zzso zzso zzso zzso also develop the zzso resistance to zzso stress that is typical of zzso zzso zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso expression remains zzso The results indicate an overlap between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and the zzso implications of this overlap are zzso
