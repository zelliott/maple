A zzso zzso strain, zzso was isolated from zzso penguin zzso from zzso and zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of the novel strain showed the highest similarity zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso The novel strain showed a zzso change from rod to zzso The growth temperature range of strain zzso was zzso degrees C, with optimal growth at 20 degrees zzso The strain grew over a zzso range of between 0 and 3 % zzso zzso and the optimal pH for growth was pH zzso zzso zzso contained zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso The major zzso was zzso The zzso zzso type was of the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso cellulose and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso In addition to these zzso zzso zzso zzso studies clearly differentiated strain zzso from zzso zzso The combined results of zzso zzso and zzso studies indicated that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is proposed in recognition of the zzso strong zzso zzso
