zzso zzso were used in the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify a specific zzso DNA fragment, located in the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso This set of zzso zzso and zzso was able to discriminate between the pathogen and other zzso species as well as zzso zzso it detected down to 3 zzso of zzso zzso DNA, zzso about one zzso zzso These zzso zzso proved suitable for the routine identification of zzso zzso cultures, starting from one single colony on solid medium or from a liquid culture in zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso was designed for use on zzso zzso This system, which, for capture, relied on a zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso and, for zzso on a zzso zzso zzso probe, proved fully specific, highly sensitive and rapid for the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso cultures at low growth zzso
