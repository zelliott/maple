The human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso increases zzso gene expression and zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of zzso through the zzso long terminal repeat zzso and that short transcripts corresponding to prematurely terminated zzso are released and accumulate in the absence of zzso Here, using a transient expression zzso we tested clustered and zzso zzso as well as 3' zzso in the zzso responsive region zzso and observed that the primary sequence in the loop and secondary structure in the stem of the zzso in zzso are required for zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso revealed that zzso must be near the site of zzso initiation of zzso for zzso by zzso zzso zzso and an zzso in zzso demonstrated that an intact zzso is required for the recovery of prematurely terminated zzso Short and full-length transcripts were observed also with zzso type 2 zzso in the absence and presence of zzso zzso We conclude that an intact zzso in zzso is essential for zzso by zzso and that initiation of zzso by zzso promoter factors and zzso of zzso by zzso are zzso
