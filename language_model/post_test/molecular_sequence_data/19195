zzso zzso malaria is geographically the most widely distributed and prevalent form of human zzso The development of drug resistance by the zzso to existing drugs zzso higher focus to explore and identify new drug zzso zzso zzso have key roles in zzso biology and are involved in nutritional zzso zzso from infected zzso and invasion of the new target zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso that remain attractive drug targets and are important vaccine candidates due to their high expression profiles in the blood zzso zzso proteins have a unique putative zzso zzso zzso motif that has either zzso or zzso in its active zzso In zzso zzso zzso is the highest transcribed member of this zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the genetic zzso of zzso central zzso domain and deduced its zzso model by zzso modeling and also performed MD simulations to acquire refined protein zzso zzso analysis of zzso domain of zzso from Indian field zzso reveals that the central domain is highly zzso The high sequence conservation of the zzso zzso domain coupled with its high expression raises the possibility of it having a critical role in zzso biology and zzso being a reliable target for new selective zzso zzso zzso The zzso model showed the presence of an unusual zzso zzso hairpin motif between zzso zzso similar to zzso binding motif of zzso zzso Our zzso model will aid in designing zzso zzso against this zzso
