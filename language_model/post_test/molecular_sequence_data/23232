The zzso diversity in the zzso zzso hot spring in zzso province, Thailand was investigated by a zzso molecular zzso This zzso pool is located in the central part of Thailand and contains zzso mineral water that is believed to relieve muscle ache and zzso The water flow year-round with temperature ranging between zzso degrees zzso Community DNA was extracted directly from zzso samples by zzso to depth of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso were amplified by zzso using zzso specific for the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso products were cloned and zzso For the bacterial zzso clone library, 200 clones were randomly selected for further zzso After restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of zzso clones and exclusion of zzso sequences 36 zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso spanned a wide range within the domain zzso occupying zzso major lineages zzso Almost a quarter zzso of the clones were classified as zzso The other clones were grouped into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lineage zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The four remaining zzso zzso each, were assigned to zzso zzso zzso and the candidate division zzso For the zzso zzso zzso gene sequence library, 25 distinct zzso were zzso 17 clones were found to be associated with zzso and 8 clones were associated with zzso The findings of the molecular survey of this so far not investigated site showed that zzso zzso hot spring is a potential rich source of unique bacterial and zzso zzso The great majority ( approximately zzso of the zzso sequences detected in zzso zzso were zzso
