zzso II, which converts the energy of zzso zzso zzso into the movement of zzso zzso is a zzso of two heavy zzso two essential light zzso and two regulatory light chains zzso zzso zzso II is known to be regulated in zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso II heavy chain was replaced with a zzso form that lacks the binding site for zzso carried out zzso and almost normal development, processes known to be dependent on functional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein suggests that a complex of zzso and the zzso binding site of the heavy chain plays an zzso role for zzso zzso activity and a structural role for the movement of zzso along zzso
