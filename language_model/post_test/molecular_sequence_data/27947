Three distinct clones zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso were characterized from a rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso long and coded for the 470 zzso acids of the zzso zzso of the liver zzso This zzso is zzso on zzso 32 by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a coding region identical to that of clone zzso but it included a putative zzso of 959 zzso In clone zzso zzso zzso the sequence upstream from zzso acid 33 differed from that in clone zzso and coded for a unique zzso portion of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat zzso was zzso with zzso zzso corresponding to the unique zzso portions of clones zzso and zzso zzso and Northern blots showed signals indicative of three distinct zzso zzso There were a zzso zzso typical of cardiac zzso a zzso zzso typical of liver, corresponding to clone zzso and a zzso zzso typical of skeletal muscle, corresponding to clone zzso zzso extension analysis showed that clones zzso and zzso were nearly complete since their respective zzso sequences were at most zzso zzso and 44 zzso shorter than the corresponding zzso These data provide a molecular basis for the existence of zzso zzso
