The rat zzso II type zzso zzso zzso gene is expressed in a zzso zzso We demonstrated that the negative regulatory element zzso between zzso and zzso is active in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso cells have a zzso factor bound to the zzso By means of a zzso I footprint zzso we identified the core of the zzso as an zzso sequence zzso located at zzso zzso to zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso core sequence bound to nuclear zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso to zzso eliminated the specific zzso binding and restored expression of the zzso in transient zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso did not zzso affect the zzso zzso zzso No zzso was found with known zzso suggesting that this is a novel zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso specific binding protein in zzso cells and the rat brain, but not in the liver, zzso adrenal zzso and zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso of the rat zzso is an zzso sequence located at zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso protein is a specific binding zzso and suggest that this protein may be a zzso factor which determines the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
