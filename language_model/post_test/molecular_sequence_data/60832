zzso is a ubiquitous and essential zzso responsible for regulating cellular levels of zzso The zzso gene exists as single, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to assemble as zzso zzso is zzso as an auxiliary gene in a number of virus zzso The origin of viral zzso genes has remained unresolved since their initial zzso A comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso acid sequence relationships was performed to explore the evolutionary dynamics of zzso in viruses and their zzso Our data set, comprised of 24 host and 51 viral zzso includes representative sequences from available zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso including zzso These zzso acid sequences were aligned by using a hidden zzso model approach developed to align divergent zzso Known secondary structures from zzso zzso were mapped onto the aligned duplicate and zzso zzso We show how duplicated zzso might fold into a zzso and we zzso that zzso zzso also assemble as zzso zzso analysis revealed at least five viral zzso sequence lineages in zzso zzso clusters with zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have identified all five as strong examples of horizontal transfer as well as additional potential transfer of zzso genes among zzso between zzso and zzso and between zzso The evidence for horizontal transfers is particularly interesting since zzso zzso genes have zzso while DNA virus zzso genes do zzso This implies that an zzso zzso agent facilitated the horizontal transfer process between host zzso and DNA zzso
