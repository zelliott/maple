Previously, we characterized the zzso of an zzso type A particle zzso to the 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which displaced two of the six zzso motifs associated with zzso stability in an zzso zzso To determine whether this zzso was involved in the zzso transformation of the parental zzso zzso cell line, the zzso zzso and rearranged zzso zzso genes were isolated and zzso into a gene transfer zzso Moreover, the zzso terminal repeat zzso and the zzso 3' zzso zzso motifs were deleted zzso + delta zzso and zzso + delta zzso in some zzso zzso to ascertain their role in the transformation zzso The zzso was also added to these zzso zzso + delta zzso + zzso zzso + delta zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso to determine whether it was necessary for zzso zzso The ability of the modified zzso genes to abrogate the zzso dependency of zzso cells had the following rank order: zzso was greater than zzso + delta zzso + zzso which was greater than zzso + delta zzso + zzso which was greater than zzso + delta zzso which was equal to zzso + delta zzso which was greater than zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was zzso longer in cells containing a zzso as opposed to a zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso cells that expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso after injection into zzso nude zzso These results indicated that two events could zzso in the zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso addition of a zzso zzso present in a zzso zzso and zzso disruption of an zzso stability zzso
