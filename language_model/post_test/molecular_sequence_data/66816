zzso infection of zzso B virus zzso is one of the major causes of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso B virus X protein zzso has been long suspected to be involved in zzso although its zzso role remains zzso zzso is a zzso regulator that zzso transcription, signal zzso cell cycle progress, protein degradation zzso zzso and genetic stability by directly or indirectly interacting with host zzso This review focuses on the biological roles of zzso in zzso replication and cellular transformation in terms of the molecular functions of zzso Using the transient zzso replication zzso zzso expressed zzso could stimulate zzso zzso and replication with the zzso zzso to the level of those with the wild zzso The zzso zzso is mainly contributing to the zzso role of zzso on zzso replication although the other functions may affect zzso zzso Effect of zzso on cellular transformation remains controversial and was never addressed with human primary or zzso zzso Using the human immortalized primary cells, zzso was found to retain the ability to overcome active zzso zzso zzso that requires full-length zzso At least two functions of zzso the zzso function and the ability to overcome zzso zzso may be zzso involved in zzso zzso
