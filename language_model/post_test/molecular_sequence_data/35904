To identify zzso zzso which play roles in zzso early development, the 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso was performed on mouse embryonic stem zzso zzso Among eight zzso zzso thus identified, we report here a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso structures linked zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso zzso indicated the presence of zzso motif and three zzso growth zzso zzso put between two zzso zzso and three zzso type III zzso in its zzso zzso It is strongly expressed in zzso cells and later stages of zzso but at low levels in zzso zzso It is also expressed at a low level in neural precursor cells from 10-day zzso but at high levels in embryonic day 15 and zzso zzso In adult zzso it is expressed zzso
