zzso is a zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the highly zzso DNA element I zzso of zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the gene zzso zzso The gene codes for a protein of molecular weight zzso When expressed in zzso coli, the zzso gene directed the synthesis of a zzso protein having the same gel mobility as zzso zzso zzso We have given the zzso gene the genetic designation zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was mapped and found to reside on zzso X, zzso zzso from zzso zzso were constructed in which most of zzso was zzso Such strains lacked zzso zzso activity and were zzso however, zzso gene disruption resulted in a zzso increase in cell doubling time and a zzso increase in the rate of zzso zzso zzso An unexpected consequence of zzso gene disruption was zzso zzso genetically linked to zzso This result and the recent finding that zzso sites in the zzso promoter are required to activate zzso zzso Thomas, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso is both a zzso protein and a zzso zzso
