The zzso protein zzso is one zzso of zzso zzso interaction during acute zzso To investigate the molecular regulation of zzso function, we have examined the expression of zzso zzso in target rat zzso after administration of zzso a potent zzso of acute zzso In the course of these studies we isolated two unique rat zzso zzso zzso Both zzso fragments show extensive zzso sequence zzso to previously isolated mouse and human zzso zzso However, they differ for the presence of sequences that zzso complement regulatory zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that different animal species express zzso zzso that zzso different numbers of zzso zzso The isolation of these two rat zzso zzso fragments, which differ only for the presence of zzso represents the first direct evidence for the existence of zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso Moreover, the sequence of the zzso zzso is consistent with its origin from an zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso We have demonstrated the presence of the two predicted zzso species in rat heart tissue and have investigated their expression in response to zzso Although both zzso zzso were greatly induced by zzso the zzso form was more abundant in both treated and control zzso This difference in zzso abundance may indicate different levels of zzso zzso proteins that perform functionally distinct tasks in zzso dependent inflammatory zzso
