Whereas zzso zzso binds to its zzso zzso zzso and zzso with equal affinity of approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso interact differently with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding site was mapped by zzso zzso at six selected zzso acid positions, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso predicted to be involved in zzso binding differences between zzso R and zzso These zzso did not alter the affinity for zzso zzso However, the affinity for six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was altered to varying degrees, resulting in differences up to zzso Replacement of the small zzso for the bulky zzso in position 110 resulted in a reduced affinity for all six zzso In contrast, replacement of the large zzso for the smaller zzso in position 120 caused a dramatic increase in zzso up to a zzso of 7 fM for zzso zzso modeling revealed that the binding sites for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are partially zzso Whereas zzso zzso binds on the zzso surface of zzso zzso the zzso zzso penetrate deeper into the zzso region of the zzso in particular zzso The zzso data point to significant differences in the shape of the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso The most important factor determining the specificity of zzso zzso seems to be the shape of the binding pocket on the zzso
