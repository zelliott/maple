zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso human zzso protein resulted in three zzso zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso All zzso zzso specifically reacted with zzso human zzso zzso and also with zzso protein in total extracts of all human cell lines zzso including the zzso cell line zzso the B cell line zzso the zzso zzso cell line zzso and a zzso cell line derived from patients with zzso zzso The zzso zzso were able to zzso the zzso human zzso protein expressed in wheat germ zzso but failed to zzso zzso zzso from cell zzso The zzso pattern of the zzso strongly differed between the zzso cells and the zzso cell zzso zzso cells displayed an intense zzso zzso and in addition distinct fine nuclear zzso In contrast, in the zzso cell line no zzso zzso but only zzso of distinct nuclear zzso was zzso Using deletion zzso of zzso the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were partially zzso All three zzso appeared to recognize distinct zzso that are located in the regions of zzso bordered by zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso can be of great use in studying the cellular processes in which the zzso protein is zzso
