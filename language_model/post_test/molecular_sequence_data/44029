zzso zzso and optical detection of zzso state magnetic resonance zzso are employed to investigate the interaction of zzso the zzso protein of the zzso zzso leukemia virus, with zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid protein containing a single zinc finger zzso zzso that includes Y at position 28 and W at position zzso In addition, the interactions of a zinc finger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a doubly zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the positions of Y and W are zzso also are zzso The zzso focus on the direct involvement of the sole W zzso in the zzso acid zzso Fluorescence zzso and zzso zzso indicate complex formation of zzso with several zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso binds with the highest zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Neither zzso nor zzso exhibits significant zzso zzso by these DNA zzso zzso of zzso to fluorescent zzso zzso was detected with greatly reduced affinity relative to zzso but binding of zzso was zzso These results are in general agreement with zzso and zzso zzso monitoring zzso zzso of zzso to zzso leads to a zzso red shift, reduction in the zzso splitting zzso parameters D and zzso and a significantly reduced zzso zzso each consistent with aromatic stacking interactions between W and the zzso These effects are smaller with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso produces no significant changes in the zzso state parameters of zzso no stacking interactions are observed even for zzso zzso yields large zzso red shifts in zzso and zzso and reductions of D, but no significant heavy atom zzso These effects probably are due to enhanced local zzso caused by zzso but any stacking interactions in these complexes would exclude van der zzso contacts between W and the zzso zzso
