The trafficking of zzso virus zzso zzso was investigated under both infection and zzso zzso In initial zzso zzso performed in infected cells, the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso served as positive controls for zzso from the plasma zzso zzso we discovered that zzso in zzso cells was also zzso and followed a similar trafficking zzso This observation was unexpected because all zzso zzso zzso have short zzso not known to contain trafficking zzso Further investigation demonstrated that zzso zzso when expressed alone with its zzso zzso was capable of zzso in a zzso manner, independent of zzso zzso or zzso Upon inspection of the short zzso zzso tail, we discovered a putative zzso zzso motif zzso When the zzso was replaced with an zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso an zzso zzso dependent on zzso zzso we further documented that zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso In control experiments, we showed that zzso zzso and zzso also zzso in an zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso tail to other zzso zzso zzso revealed two important findings: zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 and 2 zzso lacked an zzso zzso while all other zzso zzso zzso contained a potential zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso tails were likely longer in length (18 zzso zzso than predicted in the original sequence analyses (12 and 16 zzso zzso zzso The longer tails provided the proper context for a functional zzso zzso
