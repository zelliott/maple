Human zzso virus zzso infection that generally causes a strong zzso response toward zzso may sometimes occur in a zzso form, characterized by zzso in zzso based on structural zzso zzso zzso infected individuals, however, often have an zzso response against the zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso a factor implicated in zzso of viral zzso In order to define the specificity of zzso zzso we looked for zzso response against more than 600 overlapping zzso representing the total zzso sequence of three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nine distinct zzso zzso zzso were recognized by zzso from zzso zzso individuals by the zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso from zzso zzso individuals, with no zzso to zzso structural proteins but reacting with the zzso zzso protein in Western zzso recognize the same zzso zzso zzso based on the defined zzso zzso can therefore be used to diagnose early or zzso zzso zzso
