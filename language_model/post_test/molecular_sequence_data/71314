Human complement component zzso is an unusual complement factor since it shows no zzso to other complement proteins but is a member of the zzso zzso So far, it has been found exclusively in zzso zzso linked to zzso by zzso zzso We have used dot zzso and Northern zzso analyses of a large number of different human zzso to survey systematically the expression pattern of zzso Our experiments clearly showed that besides in liver, this gene is also expressed in fetal and adult zzso Renal expression of zzso is not dependent on zzso zzso since we could not detect zzso expression in zzso Thus its zzso function is not restricted to a specific action in association with complement zzso As a prerequisite for further characterization of the structure and binding activities of the zzso zzso we have expressed the zzso zzso in zzso zzso To increase the probability for proper folding of the characteristic zzso zzso bridge the zzso protein was produced by zzso to the zzso
