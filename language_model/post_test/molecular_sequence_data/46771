zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso virus zzso have been associated with resistance to zzso zzso and possible recognition of zzso zzso We zzso a zzso segment of the zzso gene to determine the frequency of zzso in zzso strains recovered from zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso specimens zzso zzso zzso 102 zzso type 1 zzso 98 zzso zzso Four zzso sites were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among the zzso only zzso resulted in a change of zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso only one zzso zzso which resulted in an zzso acid substitution zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso determination of resistance to zzso by a plaque reduction zzso of 48 zzso zzso was not correlated with the sequence results of 11 strains in that 7 of these with zzso zzso were susceptible to the drug in zzso In addition, of 32 zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso had no zzso detected in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso There was no statistical difference in the frequency of zzso according to the source of the zzso We conclude that the detection of zzso acid zzso in a previously implicated zzso segment of the zzso gene cannot be interpreted as indicative of either zzso resistance or zzso of zzso strains from zzso zzso and zzso zzso
