Although it has been known for more than three decades that administration of zzso zzso including zzso produces liver zzso proliferation of smooth zzso zzso and induction of liver zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the mechanism of this zzso response remains largely zzso An important advance was the recognition that, unlike cultures of continuously zzso liver cell lines or cultures of primary zzso adult rat zzso maintained on either plastic or zzso dishes, zzso cultured on a basement membrane zzso zzso formed rounded clusters and permitted zzso induction in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso 

We cultured adult rat zzso on Type 1 collagen zzso and allowed the cells to spread, zzso and firmly attach to the zzso zzso incubation in medium containing zzso as a soluble zzso fully zzso in a zzso manner, the ability to respond to zzso with induction of zzso zzso zzso Repeating this experiment with medium containing equivalent amounts of zzso zzso a major component of zzso or with zzso or zzso two peptides known to mimic various activities of zzso similarly restored zzso responsiveness to zzso cultured on zzso In contrast, use of equal amounts of zzso a scrambled zzso relevant to zzso produced no such zzso None of these treatments caused a zzso or any other zzso change in the zzso cellular zzso making it unlikely that zzso or zzso in cell shape account for loss of such differentiated liver functions as zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso on zzso zzso cultured on zzso in the presence of either zzso zzso B and D, zzso or zzso did not show induction of zzso zzso by zzso specifically, while the amounts of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

We conclude that the process by which zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso appears to require highly concerted effects of specific zzso components prominently involving zzso This likely occurs through a signal zzso process requiring probably both zzso and zzso zzso
