zzso interactions are the basic language of biological zzso They establish the forces interacting between the building blocks of proteins and other zzso thus determining their functional zzso Because molecular interactions trigger virtually every biological process, approaches to decipher their language are zzso zzso force zzso zzso has been used to detect and characterize different types of molecular interactions that occur between and within native membrane zzso The first experiments detected and localized molecular interactions that stabilized membrane zzso including how these interactions were established during folding of zzso secondary structure elements into the native protein and how they changed with zzso temperature, and zzso zzso also enables investigators to detect and locate molecular interactions established during zzso and inhibitor zzso These exciting applications provide opportunities for studying the molecular forces of zzso Further developments will zzso the origins of molecular interactions zzso in their zzso interaction zzso zzso and dynamics characteristic of biological zzso
