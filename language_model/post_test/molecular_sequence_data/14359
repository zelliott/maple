zzso zzso like most zzso zzso possesses an essential zzso zzso the zzso Several zzso membrane proteins lack the zzso targeting sequences of zzso zzso zzso bearing these membrane proteins are detected during zzso enlargement, but the means of cargo selection remains zzso We used a combination of deletion zzso point zzso and protein zzso to identify a short motif prior to the first zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso zzso 16 was essential for proper zzso any substitution resulted in zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 17 was also important, with significant zzso body zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of at least eight zzso acids from the zzso domain was required for full motif zzso zzso placed zzso motifs are present in zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso domain from zzso zzso was able to route zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso showed that both the zzso and zzso of zzso are exposed to the zzso We propose that this zzso motif zzso zzso trafficking via interactions that occur on the zzso face of nascent zzso destined for the zzso
