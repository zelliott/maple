The zzso mouse strain zzso has long been known for shedding large amounts of mouse zzso tumor virus zzso particles in milk and for the development of zzso early zzso tumors at a very high zzso zzso We have established one zzso zzso zzso that shows a pattern of virus expression and tumor zzso similar to that in zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the milk and zzso tumors of zzso mice for virus characterization by reverse zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of the open reading frame zzso of the zzso long terminal repeats zzso Our results show that these mice express a mixture of at least three different zzso zzso two of which, designated here as zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The third virus, zzso zzso appears to carry the signature of an zzso zzso zzso Similar studies done with the milk and zzso zzso of another zzso zzso revealed that they do not express zzso in their zzso The zzso and zzso mice also exhibited differences in their zzso zzso zzso Twelve spontaneously developed zzso tumors of zzso mice were examined for possible zzso and/or zzso zzso that are usually found to occur in most mouse zzso tumors as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso This work led to the isolation of one zzso junction zzso and one zzso junction zzso from 2 of the 12 zzso Further analyses showed that both junction fragments contained the zzso zzso zzso ORF, indicating that this virus was involved in the development of both zzso Whether zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso plays any role in zzso tumor development in zzso mice remains to be zzso Overall, the present study zzso to our surprise, that zzso zzso mice zzso unlike other native mouse zzso three strains of zzso and zzso the zzso are completely different from the virus expressed by another zzso of zzso mice, the zzso zzso
