The products of zzso synthesis are routinely zzso by zzso zzso with single wavelength detection at 214 zzso Additional information regarding the zzso product and any zzso sequences can be obtained by high resolution zzso combined with high sensitivity spectral analysis using zzso array zzso Full spectral characterization can be used to ascertain the presence of aromatic zzso acid zzso as well as side chain modifications such as blocking groups for protection of zzso side zzso Many of the protecting groups used in solid phase synthesis contain distinctive structural features that can be identified by their zzso Although the synthesis protocol provides for zzso of these groups, it is possible that the product mixture may include some residual blocked zzso Since the presence of blocking groups will affect the properties of the zzso zzso detection and complete removal are zzso zzso analysis using zzso array detection in conjunction with high resolution zzso zzso can be used to identify protected zzso acid zzso in synthetic zzso
