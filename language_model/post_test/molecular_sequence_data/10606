A full-length zzso clone of a previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated by using a zzso cloning strategy and has been shown to be expressed in a nervous system and spinal zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that MSP is most similar in sequence to zzso zzso and tissue zzso and is predicted to have zzso zzso zzso MSP zzso was found to be approximately zzso greater in the zzso of the rat and human, as compared with most peripheral zzso and within the zzso was found to be highest by a factor of four in the zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso of zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso also were elevated in the spinal zzso but were more widespread in peripheral zzso as compared with zzso In the adult rat zzso spinal cord, in zzso zzso of MSP zzso demonstrated zzso higher levels in the white, as compared with the gray, zzso MSP zzso expression was shown to increase zzso in the white matter and zzso in the gray zzso at 72 zzso after zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso MSP zzso remained elevated in the zzso gray matter, including expression associated with the motor zzso of zzso IX, at 7 d after the initial zzso zzso Together, these observations indicate that MSP is in a position to play a fundamental role in normal zzso and in the response of the spinal zzso to zzso
