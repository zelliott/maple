zzso play important roles in various biological phenomena, but the lack of a systematic procedure for producing complex structures of zzso severely restricts their application in the medical and industrial zzso In this paper, we propose a basic strategy for the preparation of substantial amounts zzso zzso of zzso zzso where the structure of each zzso is mapped with its zzso position in liquid zzso as well as the empirical zzso In model experiments using zzso egg white and zzso as starting materials, the former provided a series of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso in addition to two zzso type zzso In contrast, egg zzso gave predominantly zzso zzso zzso together with a zzso type one, reflecting the difference in the origins of the zzso Due to the total identity of the zzso obtained to human ones, the present strategy should provide a practical scheme for the production of zzso zzso zzso
