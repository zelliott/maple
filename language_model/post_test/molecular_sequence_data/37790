zzso DNA sequences from zzso and Kurds were analyzed in order to test the possible correlation between female lineages and languages in these two neighboring West zzso zzso zzso sequence pools in both populations are very similar despite their different linguistic and prehistoric zzso Both populations present zzso lineages that clearly belong to the European gene pool, as shown by 1) similar zzso and sequence zzso 2) a large number of sequences shared with the rest of European zzso 3) zzso genetic zzso and 4) zzso of the present lineages into the major European zzso zzso already zzso The zzso position of the populations from the zzso according to classical genetic markers is not recognized in the present Georgian zzso sequence zzso This result suggests that the differentiation of zzso sequences in West zzso and the zzso features of Caucasian populations should be attributed to different zzso Moreover, the putative linguistic relationship between Caucasian groups and the zzso another zzso population within Europe for classical genetic zzso is not detected by the analysis of zzso zzso
