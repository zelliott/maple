To determine the gene sequences of canine and zzso cardiac zzso I zzso express the protein from the cloned gene in zzso and validate the use of a commercial zzso serum zzso in these species via detection of the expressed protein or comparison of sequence zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso from 5 healthy adult zzso dogs and 5 healthy adult domestic zzso zzso 

The zzso was extracted from zzso samples, and zzso was zzso via reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso The canine zzso for the coding region was expressed in cell culture and analyzed by western zzso and sandwich zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso genes were cloned and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the canine and zzso zzso genes with human and zzso zzso genes were high; the greatest zzso was detected between canine and zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso canine zzso protein was detected by a commercial serum zzso zzso and by western zzso zzso 

zzso indicated that commercial zzso zzso can be used to measure serum zzso concentration from dogs and zzso Additionally, our preliminary characterization of the zzso zzso gene may facilitate further investigation of zzso and its role in familial zzso zzso in zzso
