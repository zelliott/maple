We have explored the potential of zzso gene transfer zzso hybrids as a source of zzso human zzso fragments from which zzso can be zzso zzso characterization of the zzso hybrid zzso with a full panel of markers from zzso zzso 6 showed that the human DNA content derives largely from zzso and zzso A zzso library has been constructed from zzso DNA, and 370 zzso containing human DNA have been isolated and overlapping clones ordered into 20 zzso Regional zzso of representative clones from each zzso determined by fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso places 13 zzso in zzso and 6 in zzso zzso screening of zzso libraries with selected zzso has identified two expressed zzso Since there are a number of medically important genes in both these regions of human zzso 6 with several disease zzso linked to the zzso region in zzso and various tumor zzso genes to zzso this library will provide a valuable resource to aid the isolation of candidate genes for these zzso In addition, unique markers for detailed physical and genetic mapping of these regions of human zzso 6 can be easily zzso
