zzso is a human zinc finger zzso gene whose expression is induced with zzso zzso by diverse zzso in several cell zzso Since its zzso sequence predicts a protein which contains zinc finger zzso zzso may play a zzso regulatory role in cellular zzso The present study was undertaken to: 1) examine the zzso organization and zzso zzso sequence of zzso so as to identify upstream regulatory zzso 2) test whether these elements are functional in gel shift zzso and by transient zzso and 3) examine whether pathways other than protein zzso C lead to serum induction of zzso and if they do, ask whether the different pathways zzso on a serum response zzso The zzso gene spans zzso zzso and has one zzso The translation initiation site is located within the first zzso The zzso start site of zzso was determined by zzso zzso and primer extension analysis and a zzso box was identified 28 zzso zzso Two putative serum response zzso designated zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso By deletion analyses and zzso serum and zzso responsiveness of the cloned zzso promoter region was traced to the zzso region in transient zzso zzso performed in zzso zzso zzso Both protein zzso C dependent and independent pathways were found to zzso on the zzso box to induce the expression of zzso
