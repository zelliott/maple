zzso were found of having a strong capacity of zzso small size zzso zzso and presenting zzso zzso to either zzso and zzso T zzso The class zzso presentation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso requires an zzso processing which might follow the zzso route to enter the classical zzso class I presentation zzso In contrast, presentation of zzso zzso zzso zzso to specific zzso T cells has been observed with different zzso and is not blocked by zzso D, suggesting that zzso released from zzso may directly bind to zzso class I molecules on the cell zzso In the case of zzso class zzso T cells, zzso or treatment of zzso with zzso zzso A and zzso zzso the presentation of zzso and soluble zzso zzso These findings illustrate the capacity of zzso zzso to enter different presentation pathways and should facilitate the development of zzso zzso
