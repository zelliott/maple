Several zzso proteins participate in the zzso changes that occur during zzso zzso The gene zzso one of these zzso the zzso factor zzso was identified and characterized from zzso of zzso zzso The sequence contains zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso giving a protein of 93 zzso belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso revealed a consensus site for zzso binding zzso to the zzso sites of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the central domain revealed the presence of four repeats of a zzso motif zzso zzso of the zzso In addition, a stretch of 105 zzso acids was highly divergent when compared with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso This sequence showed short motifs that are zzso to zzso zzso We found that zzso from zzso zzso binds to zzso In addition, upon zzso of the zzso this protein localized in the zzso and the zzso region, zzso a role for zzso in movement and capping of surface receptors in zzso zzso
