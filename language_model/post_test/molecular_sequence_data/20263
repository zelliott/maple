A group of zzso zzso organisms zzso was enriched in an zzso zzso sequencing membrane zzso showing deteriorated enhanced biological zzso removal zzso Based on zzso zzso gene clone library and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso were identified as novel members of the zzso cluster in the zzso accounting for 90 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bacterial cell area in the reactor zzso zzso in combination with FISH and zzso zzso zzso revealed that these zzso zzso could take up and transform zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso acid and zzso into zzso under zzso zzso In contrast, under continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso the only cultured strain from the zzso was able to take up zzso with concurrent zzso consumption and zzso production under zzso zzso Under subsequent zzso conditions, the accumulated zzso was zzso and the biomass zzso levels were zzso These findings not only zzso these zzso zzso as zzso organisms, but also revealed unexpected levels of zzso zzso and zzso diversity among members of the zzso zzso
