Genes have a major role in the control of zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso Here we have identified two zzso disease zzso families, confirmed zzso linkage and refined the disease locus to a limited zzso region containing the gene zzso the zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso HDL zzso zzso is a more frequent cause of low HDL zzso On the basis of independent linkage and zzso zzso we localized the zzso locus to the same zzso region as the TD zzso zzso in zzso were detected in both TD and zzso indicating that TD and zzso are zzso This indicates that the protein zzso by zzso is a key gatekeeper influencing zzso cholesterol zzso hence we have named it cholesterol zzso regulatory protein zzso
