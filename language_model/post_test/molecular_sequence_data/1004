zzso zzso is a critical zzso in inflammation and zzso immune zzso The zzso binding proteins zzso are a family of proteins that bind to, and inhibit the activity of, zzso Using point zzso we analyzed the zzso virus zzso to identify zzso involved in zzso Because zzso can bind both human and zzso zzso and because it is highly zzso to the zzso virus zzso we set out to identify zzso that may be involved in species zzso Several of the zzso resulted in complete zzso of binding zzso Three zzso zzso and zzso significantly affected binding with both species of zzso but not to the same zzso zzso zzso showed reduced affinity for human zzso while binding to zzso zzso was not zzso This study demonstrated that interaction of zzso with zzso was similar to other zzso however, novel zzso interactions were zzso
