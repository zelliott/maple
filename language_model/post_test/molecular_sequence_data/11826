A plant zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned from rice zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter is a zzso zzso and cannot use zzso zzso or zzso as sulfur sources but exhibits zzso activities of the zzso necessary to zzso zzso and has normal sulfur zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso proteins with similar function in sulfur zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed a zzso protein that was shown to catalyze the conversion of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso activity is zzso sensitive to zzso zzso and zzso and activated by zzso The zzso by zzso depends on the zzso ratio and is zzso by high zzso zzso The zzso specificity and zzso of zzso zzso are very similar to the Chlorella zzso zzso zzso Our evidence suggests that this zzso regulates the flux of sulfur in the zzso zzso by converting zzso to zzso Several zzso that are essential for the activity of this zzso were identified by zzso zzso and the possible role of zzso in salt tolerance is zzso
