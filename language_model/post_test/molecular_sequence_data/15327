zzso zzso are known to have important zzso functions, but their diversity in most environments remains vastly zzso Here we analyzed an zzso zzso gene library from a subsurface zzso and zzso microbial community growing in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the majority zzso of the sequences belonged to zzso zzso falling into the deeply branching lineage named the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the class zzso were also zzso The zzso group represents zzso novelty, with zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso gene sequences of organisms from other zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso were designed to target each of these groups in zzso samples, enabling abundance and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the populations vary significantly with the habitat and no group is zzso Surprisingly, many of the zzso lineages (with the exception of the zzso are closely related to zzso suggesting that they recently adapted to this extreme zzso zzso analyses presented here confirm that the number of zzso species associated with the acid mine drainage zzso communities is zzso This finding is consistent with previous results showing a limited diversity of zzso bacteria, and viruses in zzso environments and suggests that the environmental pressures and interplay between the members of these communities limit species diversity at all zzso zzso
