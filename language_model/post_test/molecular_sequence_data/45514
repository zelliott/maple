Recent investigations on the stability of proteins have demonstrated various structural factors, but few have considered sequence factors such as protein zzso These motifs represent highly zzso regions and describe critical regions that may only exist on proteins that remain functional at high zzso This investigation presents a method for identifying and comparing corresponding zzso and zzso sequence motifs between protein zzso zzso motifs that are zzso only in the zzso or zzso zzso are zzso Analysis of the results shows that, although the zzso of most protein families share similar zzso some zzso motifs are present in particular zzso zzso The zzso zzso motifs are zzso only in zzso organisms, revealing that zzso principles support zzso
