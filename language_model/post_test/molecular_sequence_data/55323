A large body of functional and zzso evidence have previously illustrated the impact of specific zzso class I zzso on clinical outcome during zzso infection, and these observations have recently been zzso in zzso wide association studies zzso Yet because of the complexities surrounding zzso approaches and the lack of knowledge relating to the identity of rarer single zzso zzso zzso zzso it has proved difficult to discover independent zzso zzso associated with zzso immune zzso This is especially true of the candidate zzso within the zzso region where many of the recently proposed disease influencing zzso appear to reflect linkage with zzso zzso class I zzso Yet zzso zzso zzso may exist but remain overlooked zzso to the complexities associated with their zzso Here we focus on the ancestral zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso shown historically to be in complete linkage zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Many of the ancestral zzso within the extended zzso promoter have been associated with both zzso conditions and disease zzso however, the direct role of these zzso on zzso expression remains zzso Yet, because of the important role played by zzso in zzso infection, and given the proximity of the zzso zzso to the core promoter, its location within a putative zzso region previously characterized in mice, and its disruption of a zzso zzso zzso zzso we chose to carefully evaluate its impact on zzso zzso Using a variety of approaches we now demonstrate that carriage of the A zzso is associated with lower zzso production, via a mechanism not readily explained by promoter zzso nor the binding of zzso factors or zzso We propose that the zzso zzso could represent a minor zzso zzso that additionally contributes to the zzso zzso effect during zzso zzso
