Renal zzso zzso synthesis and urinary zzso are reportedly diminished during zzso zzso kidney zzso in animal models, and provision of zzso abrogates zzso injury in this setting, but data in human zzso is zzso Therefore we first examined zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and then zzso potential zzso and zzso mechanisms for its zzso 

zzso zzso activity zzso was evaluated in urine from patients with established or zzso zzso versus zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso was then zzso by zzso and zzso zzso in established zzso versus healthy zzso To examine zzso control of zzso zzso we tested blood and urine DNA for changes in promoter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso displayed a modest reduction of zzso zzso but unexpectedly, established zzso displayed substantially elevated urine zzso zzso zzso higher than healthy controls, and zzso greater than zzso zzso We then zzso potential mechanisms of the zzso zzso zzso patients had lower zzso higher heart rate, and higher zzso zzso than healthy controls, though zzso zzso was not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in blood than urine DNA, while zzso zzso in blood DNA was significantly higher in established zzso than healthy controls, though zzso zzso in urine tended to be higher in zzso zzso consistent with zzso but not zzso changes in zzso zzso in zzso On zzso zzso zzso displayed coordinate changes in zzso zzso and promoter zzso though zzso opposite to zzso Control zzso repetitive zzso zzso in blood and urine DNA was similar between zzso and zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso patients was zzso this increase is likely to be due in part to increments in zzso tone during zzso zzso zzso changes at zzso may also play a role in early changes of zzso expression and thus zzso zzso or zzso
