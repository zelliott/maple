The zzso zinc finger protein zzso 3 zzso plays a critical role in pancreatic development and has been implicated in a syndrome with zzso diabetes and zzso zzso In this study, we examine three steps critical in the mechanism of the zzso regulation by zzso its zzso to the nucleus, DNA binding and zzso zzso We demonstrate that the putative zzso nuclear zzso signal is not required, but the zzso zzso of the fourth zinc finger is essential for the nuclear zzso of zzso We identify zzso as the consensus sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso site zzso All five zinc finger motifs are critical for efficient binding of zzso to zzso We show that zzso functions as a potent zzso of zzso zzso and contains a zzso function at its zzso A zzso in zzso observed in zzso patients results in a zzso zzso and a zzso truncated zzso We demonstrate that this zzso does not effect the nuclear zzso but results in the loss of zzso zzso zzso The loss in zzso zzso function may be responsible for the abnormalities observed in zzso
