Holliday junctions zzso are zzso DNA structures that arise during zzso zzso which must be removed to enable zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso can both process zzso zzso and they bind in close proximity on the zzso scaffold, hinting at possible zzso However, the cellular roles of zzso zzso are not yet zzso Here, we use mouse zzso and structure function analysis to investigate zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed that they are essential for zzso resolution in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso act together to resolve zzso in a manner that requires zzso to zzso We also show that zzso like zzso is required for repair of DNA zzso zzso but this role appears to be independent of zzso zzso at least in mouse zzso These findings shed light on zzso resolution in zzso and on maintenance of zzso zzso
