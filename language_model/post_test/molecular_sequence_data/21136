zzso zzso are important local zzso molecules in many zzso and zzso of animals including zzso For applications in medicine and animal care, zzso are mostly zzso from animal zzso or chemically zzso To generate a clean, reliable, and inexpensive source for zzso we have now engineered expression of a suitable zzso gene in zzso coli and achieved production levels of up to zzso zzso The zzso gene cloned from the red zzso zzso zzso appears to be fully functional without any zzso modifications in zzso zzso A crude extract of the zzso zzso coli cells is able to convert in zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso Furthermore, these zzso coli cells produced zzso in a medium supplemented with AA and zzso the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of the functional expression of a zzso gene and zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso The successful microbial synthesis of zzso with reliable yields promises a novel pharmaceutical tool to produce zzso at significantly reduced prices and greater zzso
