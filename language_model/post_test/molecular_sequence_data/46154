Most bacterial zzso bind one or more zzso atoms at different locations and are a suitable case of study for investigating structural effects related to calcium zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso Generally zzso in microbial zzso can play a crucial role in the stabilization of the whole three-dimensional structure by zzso long-range zzso It has been recently demonstrated that calcium binding influences zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso through the restriction of zzso plasticity of specific zzso Moreover, calcium depletion results in a highly cooperative protein zzso zzso protein zzso To further shed light on molecular mechanisms and structural features connected to calcium binding in microbial zzso we present a molecular dynamics investigation, based on zzso approach at different temperatures, of zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso It turns out that additional zzso zzso which are zzso in other microbial zzso help in overcoming effects induced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso upon zzso induced in the calcium binding zzso
