CA 125 has long presented problems to both clinicians and investigators because there was no definitive information on its structure and zzso Here, we describe our work on cloning the CA 125 gene with the anticipation that such information will provide the basis for understanding its structure and its zzso role in both normal and zzso zzso The CA 125 protein core is composed of a short zzso tail, a zzso domain and an extraordinarily large zzso zzso zzso This structure is dominated by a repeat domain composed of 156 zzso acid repeat units which zzso the zzso binding zzso The zzso also includes an zzso terminal domain of zzso sequences which would account for most of the zzso known to be present in CA zzso CA 125 is an unusually large zzso zzso Its release from the surface of the cell is most probably dependent on zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso The zzso domain is characterized by a large number of repeat units (probably zzso which zzso an interactive zzso bridged zzso and the site of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the gene provides us with the ability to initiate the quest to understand the biological function of CA zzso
