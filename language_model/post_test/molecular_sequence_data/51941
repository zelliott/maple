zzso analysis of the zzso gene was performed on two Japanese siblings with zzso The zzso from one patient contained 7 additional bases between zzso 3 and 4 zzso sequence of zzso zzso This zzso resulted in a frame shift, and a termination zzso appeared at zzso acid zzso zzso and sequencing of zzso DNA detected a single base transition zzso at the zzso side adjacent to the zzso zzso This zzso created a consensus AG zzso in the zzso zzso site, and produced almost exclusively an abnormal zzso containing the zzso by alternative zzso The calculation of the sample score of the zzso site supported this zzso zzso zzso restriction site analysis of amplified zzso and zzso DNA showed that these patients were zzso for this zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso in zzso 3 causes zzso zzso in these zzso
