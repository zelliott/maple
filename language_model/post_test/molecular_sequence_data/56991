The zzso gene of zzso zzso was cloned as a gene that zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso on the zzso zzso coli zzso The cloned zzso gene also zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso permitted zzso zzso 80 induction in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso sequence determination revealed that the zzso product consists of 348 zzso acids zzso corresponding to 38 zzso and shows significant similarity to zzso proteins from other zzso zzso Next, a portion of zzso from zzso zzso was cloned by using zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso design based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to availability of efficient zzso and transformation systems in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were obtained by zzso gene replacement with the cloned zzso zzso zzso gene which was zzso by zzso of the zzso gene from zzso The zzso zzso obtained in this way showed similar zzso to those of zzso coli zzso zzso such as increased sensitivity to zzso and to zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso
