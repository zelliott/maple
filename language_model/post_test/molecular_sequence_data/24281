zzso zzso are generally modular proteins that contain zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso have been grouped into zzso families, and three-dimensional structural data are available for half of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a modular zzso that contains a zzso from family 6 zzso for which no structural data are zzso We have determined the crystal structure of this module to a resolution of zzso zzso The protein is a zzso that contains two potential zzso zzso designated zzso A and zzso The zzso interacts primarily with zzso and zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso identified zzso A, containing zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso The overall fold of zzso is similar to proteins in zzso families 4 and 22, although surprisingly the zzso site in zzso and zzso is equivalent to zzso B in zzso These structural data define a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and demonstrate that, although zzso have evolved from a relatively small number of ancestors, the structural elements involved in zzso recognition have been assembled at different locations on the ancestral zzso
