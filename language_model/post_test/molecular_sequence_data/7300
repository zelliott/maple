The complete zzso sequences of two zzso isolated from goose and zzso duck were zzso The two virus zzso share zzso zzso sequence identity, indicating that they are closely zzso The coding regions are bracketed by zzso terminal repeats containing zzso This is similar to the zzso organization of human zzso zzso virus 2, and zzso zzso acid sequence comparison shows that the closest relative of the goose and zzso duck zzso is zzso virus zzso This is surprising, because the goose and zzso duck zzso do not require any helper virus for productive zzso suggesting that zzso virus 2 has been derived from a zzso zzso
