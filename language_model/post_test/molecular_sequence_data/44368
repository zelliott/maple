zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso by zzso of a strain of zzso coli defective for the presence of zzso These genes zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 546 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the regions near the zzso ends of these zzso genes were similar to those of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The remaining part of each zzso gene towards its zzso end showed a characteristic zzso zzso had two putative zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso had regions that were very similar to the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of four distinct zzso forming zzso from the N zzso a response zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, a response zzso domain, and the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso domain in its zzso zzso zzso of these genes was examined by reverse zzso The transcript of zzso was shown to be zzso in this zzso The cellular zzso zzso level in the zzso of the zzso zzso was much lower than that in the wild zzso
