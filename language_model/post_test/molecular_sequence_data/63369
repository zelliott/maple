The hypothesis was tested that sequence diversity in breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso region is a significant zzso of zzso zzso The zzso promoter and zzso 1 were zzso in zzso DNA from the zzso discovery resource zzso 44 zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso were zzso in donor human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso had lower zzso expression in multiple zzso The zzso 1 zzso zzso was associated with high expression in zzso zzso was associated with low expression in zzso zzso was associated with higher expression in the zzso and White zzso The zzso promoter zzso was significantly associated with higher zzso expression in multiple zzso Patients with the zzso zzso had substantially higher clearance of zzso zzso We next determined whether zzso expression was related to zzso alternative zzso or alternative promoter zzso Liver zzso expressed an alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skipping zzso zzso Although zzso zzso did not zzso carry the zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower among Hispanic zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and may be due, in part, to zzso zzso 2 zzso Analysis of zzso expression imbalance zzso showed that zzso samples with zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso however, no linked zzso were zzso zzso used multiple zzso and zzso zzso using alternative zzso zzso had lower zzso In conclusion, zzso expression in zzso liver, and zzso is associated with novel promoter and zzso 1 zzso
