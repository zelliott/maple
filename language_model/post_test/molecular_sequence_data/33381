In protein zzso zzso zzso zzso must recognize zzso zzso from the 20 kinds of zzso acids and the zzso zzso from different zzso in order to generate zzso In general, an zzso possesses one kind of gene corresponding to zzso However, it has been recently found that some organisms have two different genes for zzso in the zzso suggesting that their proteins zzso and zzso function separately and complement each other in the zzso of zzso one for zzso and the other for zzso of zzso zzso In order to clarify their three-dimensional structures, we performed X-ray analyses of two zzso assigned zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso These proteins were zzso in zzso coli, zzso and zzso The crystal structure of zzso has been successfully determined at zzso A zzso zzso is a zzso zzso composed of two identical zzso each containing two zzso for the zzso reaction and for zzso zzso The essential editing domain is completely missing as zzso These structural features reveal that zzso zzso only the zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting the necessity of the second zzso zzso for zzso Since the zzso sequence of zzso is similar to the sequence of the editing domain of zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been expected to catalyze zzso of a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
