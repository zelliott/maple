zzso I zzso a protein of 33 zzso derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is able to inhibit the growth of zzso zzso malaria zzso with an zzso in the low zzso zzso zzso was proposed to act as an zzso channel zzso although experimental validation of this mechanism is zzso The surface zzso of zzso have some sequence similarity with the zzso protein sequences zzso by zzso a zzso zzso essential for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and invasion into zzso As zzso has emerged as an interesting drug target, we explored the hypothesis that zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso 

zzso modeling and zzso calculations showed that one loop could interact with the binding site of zzso The calculated free energy of binding averaged zzso zzso corresponding to a predicted zzso zzso constant of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso and the in zzso zzso zzso culture in a range compatible with our zzso zzso Using contact analysis and free energy decomposition we propose that zzso A14 and zzso are important in the interaction with zzso 

Our zzso reverse engineering supported the hypothesis that zzso targeted zzso and this was confirmed by experimental evidence showing that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This outlines the usefulness of advanced zzso tools to predict the function of a protein zzso The structural features of zzso represent an interesting protein scaffold for future protein zzso
