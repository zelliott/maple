The minimal zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso factor consists of two zzso zinc fingers and an additional 20 zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso The accessory sequence likely plays a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into the fingers of an zzso zzso construct zzso to serve as a probe of the proximity of the accessory sequence to the zinc zzso zzso signals from the accessory region are not zzso by zzso zzso Previous studies showed that this region is random zzso in the zzso construct in the absence of zzso it does not adopt a fixed orientation with respect to the zzso zzso In contrast, many zzso of the accessory region are zzso by zzso in the zzso form of the zzso suggesting this region becomes zzso This observation agrees with previous results showing a zzso transition for the accessory region upon DNA zzso Furthermore, these results indicate that the accessory region lies close to the fingers in the zzso zzso This region thus does not extend along the DNA away from the zinc zzso it more likely binds the same stretch of DNA contacted by the zinc zzso zzso to the behavior of other zzso proteins that zzso an accessory zzso sequence suggested that the region of zzso zzso to the zinc fingers might form an zzso Analysis of sequential zzso in the accessory region of zzso zzso reveals no zzso zzso
