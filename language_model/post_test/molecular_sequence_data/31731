zzso zzso is widely used as a model for investigation of the relationships between aging, zzso restriction and zzso via the zzso zzso zzso formation 2) zzso for zzso peptides and zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso of zzso zzso zzso but the identity of the zzso zzso that may link these processes is zzso We unexpectedly find that of the eight putative zzso zzso zzso genes only the two zzso zzso of one gene have a zzso transport function in an zzso expression zzso We have named this gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso leads to loss of zzso transport and reduced zzso metabolism in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso thus play a key role in zzso energy supply to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to an extension of lifespan zzso but not zzso to that observed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results of the present study are consistent with zzso and zzso zzso stimulating zzso transport in zzso zzso and this process being associated with the longevity zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso constitutes a common axis for the lifespan extending effects of zzso restriction and reduced zzso zzso zzso
