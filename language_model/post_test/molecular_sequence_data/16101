In human zzso the two heavy chains are zzso in the central portion of the zzso by two zzso bridges forming a double chain zzso zzso zzso in parallel zzso For our synthetic studies we have chosen the sequence portion zzso zzso zzso By the use of a combination of the zzso and the zzso groups selective zzso pairings in two successive steps produced the hinge zzso in parallel and zzso alignment as homogeneous and well characterized zzso zzso zzso interchange experiments on the zzso zzso led to over zzso conversion to the parallel zzso zzso random zzso was found to generate again mainly the parallel zzso thus strongly suggesting that this sequence portion contains sufficient structural information for a correct assembly of the two heavy chains of zzso without decisive contribution of a protein zzso zzso
