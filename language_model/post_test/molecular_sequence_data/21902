The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is required for the control of activities involved in scavenging zzso from the environment during periods of zzso zzso Increased scavenging activity reflects the development of zzso zzso transport and the expression of zzso zzso that can cleave zzso from organic compounds in the zzso A comparison of gene expression patterns using zzso analyses and quantitative zzso with zzso and zzso zzso cells deprived of zzso has revealed that zzso also controls genes zzso proteins with potential zzso zzso zzso proteins can serve as alternative electron zzso that help prevent zzso caused by zzso of the zzso electron transport zzso In accordance with this finding, zzso zzso zzso die when subjected to elevated light zzso at these zzso the zzso cells still exhibit rapid zzso zzso to zzso deprivation also involves a reduction in the levels of transcripts zzso proteins involved in photosynthesis and both zzso and zzso translation as well as an increase in the levels of transcripts zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso cells (but not zzso zzso also display expression patterns associated with specific responses to sulfur zzso suggesting a zzso zzso link between the signal zzso pathways involved in controlling zzso and sulfur zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso is critical for the survival of cells under conditions of zzso zzso availability and that it plays a key role in controlling both scavenging responses and the ability of the cell to manage excess absorbed zzso zzso
