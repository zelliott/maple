An zzso zzso clone zzso the complete sequence zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein precursor from the male silk zzso zzso zzso was isolated using zzso zzso The cloned zzso was expressed and the translation product detected by specific zzso The deduced protein sequence consists of a signal zzso of 21 zzso acids and a mature binding protein of 142 zzso acid zzso The predicted structure of this protein is zzso to zzso from different insect species which have previously been identified, but shows no similarities to zzso proteins from zzso suggesting that soluble zzso proteins in insects and zzso represent an evolutionary zzso
