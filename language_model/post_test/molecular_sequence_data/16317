A simple and widely zzso procedure for constructing synthetic zzso of a zzso involving the synthesis of only one strand of DNA, has been zzso The method is suited for cases in which a cloned DNA with a sequence related to the gene to be constructed is zzso First, a zzso DNA which is zzso throughout the region of interest is zzso This zzso region is then used as a template to correctly align and allow zzso of synthetic zzso corresponding to the entire zzso To favor the replication of the strand zzso the synthetic zzso a template strand containing some zzso of zzso for zzso is zzso This procedure was used to construct a synthetic zzso zzso gene V which differs from the zzso zzso gene at 45 positions out of zzso The synthetic gene was designed to include nine restriction sites without altering the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso The gene construction was found to be very efficient, and about zzso of the resulting plasmids contained the desired synthetic zzso The synthetic gene was found to be fully active and could substitute for the zzso gene in zzso zzso
