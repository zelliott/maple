We reported previously that zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes the differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso However, little information is available about the mechanism of action of zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, using the technique known as differential zzso chain reaction, we identified a novel zzso zzso that corresponded to a transcript whose level was increased by zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both these transcripts were also expressed at high levels in the heart and zzso We isolated a full-length zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library derived from zzso cells using the original zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence and of products of zzso and translation in zzso indicated that the transcript of the gene did not include any extensive open reading zzso zzso zzso after zzso of transcript in zzso cells zzso the deposition of calcium of these cells and the formation of zzso zzso but did not affect the activity of alkaline zzso Our results suggest that zzso promotes the expression of a novel transcript, which might stimulate the zzso of zzso zzso
