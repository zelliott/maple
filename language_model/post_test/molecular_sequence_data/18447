The zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso activated nuclear zzso In addition to steroid hormone zzso this family also includes receptors for zzso hormone, zzso acid and zzso D3 as well as some receptors with as yet unknown zzso the so called orphan zzso It is possible that the zzso zzso is a member of this family as well although this cannot be definitely assessed until the zzso has been zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso believed to be involved in zzso induction of certain zzso of zzso zzso has recently been shown to be a member of the steroid zzso zzso family and it is conceivable that other zzso zzso might act via as yet zzso receptors belonging to the same gene zzso zzso we should learn significantly about principles of zzso regulation by considering basic mechanisms of zzso zzso the zzso zzso probably represents the most extensively studied member of the nuclear zzso zzso Our laboratory has been particularly interested in structural aspects of this zzso and has used gene technology to zzso its different zzso particularly the zzso domain, the structure of which has been resolved using zzso
