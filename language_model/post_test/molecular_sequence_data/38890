Human infection with zzso zzso is an important cause of morbidity and zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso are incapable of de zzso zzso zzso and must acquire zzso from their host, so the zzso salvage zzso offers a number of potential targets for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso is the predominantly salvaged zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso salvage zzso of this zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso was solved using molecular replacement and refined by simulated zzso at zzso A resolution to an zzso of zzso The overall structure and the active site geometry are similar to human zzso zzso although there are significant zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has several unique features compared to the human zzso including a zzso deletion in one of the four linking segments between the two zzso which is probably responsible for a major change in the orientation of the two zzso with respect to each zzso These structural differences suggest the possibility of developing specific zzso of the zzso zzso
