The expression of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso was studied in the rat zzso Using zzso levels of zzso zzso were determined relative to the expression of a constantly expressed zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso bulb, and the zzso of adult and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso bulb by Northern zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso expression is present in the zzso bulb and in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso cultures obtained from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso confirmed the expression of zzso zzso in these zzso Our results show that zzso is not restricted to the zzso zzso but is also present in specific regions of the zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may act in the regions that possess zzso gene expression to affect the electrical activity of certain zzso zzso
