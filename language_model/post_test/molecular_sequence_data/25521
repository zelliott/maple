Two classes of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which differ in length due to different positions of their respective 3' ends, were isolated by screening an embryonic zzso zzso These zzso zzso to a single zzso site at position zzso on the right arm of the second zzso A unique zzso zzso zzso species was zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso to full-length zzso and that the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso is close to zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript accumulates in zzso is zzso inherited by the zzso and present at every other zzso stage zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso This protein contains four zzso zzso which show limited primary sequence divergence during evolution, in contrast to the zzso third of the zzso The zzso long zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to exist also in other zzso including zzso zzso It suggests that important regulatory sequences intrinsic to the zzso zzso are present within this zzso zzso
