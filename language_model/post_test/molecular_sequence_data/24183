zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso that transfers the zzso side chain to the zzso frame in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso based on the information of the zzso zzso zzso and the function of the gene was zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene enabled restoration of the respiratory ability and zzso synthesis in a zzso zzso that was defective in zzso zzso The zzso fraction that was prepared from the zzso zzso which expressed the zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso This indicated that the zzso gene encodes active zzso with a broad zzso specificity in terms of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the flower zzso and the green fluorescent protein zzso fused with the signal zzso of zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso gene in zzso resulted in the arrest of zzso development at an early stage of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso gene involved in the zzso of zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso development in zzso zzso
