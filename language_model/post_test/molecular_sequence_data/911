zzso zzso zzso play an important role in the protection of cells and zzso space from the products of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso have been described for the zzso gene zzso involves a C to T substitution at zzso zzso 339 and zzso involves a T to C substitution at zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins zzso by the different zzso have been suggested to have different activity zzso 

The zzso zzso was determined using a zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso techniques with restriction zzso zzso zzso 

The most available results were obtained from with 20 zzso primer final concentration in zzso zzso A total of 20 zzso seems the cost-effective primer concentration with maximum zzso There were no difference between the band quality of zzso units of restriction zzso On the other hand, short and long incubation times seem to be similar in order to obtain sharp bands on zzso zzso 

We have extended a method of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This method provides the ability to zzso of zzso and it represents a fast, reliable, cost-effective and zzso methodology to determine zzso zzso in order to perform large-scale population zzso
