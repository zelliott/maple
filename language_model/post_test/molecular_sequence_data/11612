zzso from many bacterial promoters is sensitive to the level of DNA zzso We have investigated the mechanism by which environmentally induced changes in DNA zzso might regulate zzso For the zzso promoter of zzso zzso zzso induced changes in DNA zzso appear to play a primary regulatory zzso Changes in DNA zzso zzso number; delta zzso are zzso into changes in the winding of the strands of the double zzso about themselves zzso delta zzso and/or elastic zzso or flexibility of the DNA zzso zzso delta zzso zzso of the zzso promoter were isolated in zzso or generated in zzso which altered the spacing between the zzso and zzso zzso Studies on these zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso exclude models in which changes in DNA twist play a regulatory zzso Instead, our data suggest that increased DNA flexibility, reflecting the zzso induced increase in negative zzso of DNA, is required for promoter zzso
