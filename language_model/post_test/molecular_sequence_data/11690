The aim of this study was to characterize a zzso protein zzso isolated from bovine liver and to determine the zzso zzso of the protein in rat zzso as well as in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso coupled with zzso were used to isolate crude zzso from bovine and rat zzso zzso zzso was performed to purify the zzso from the crude zzso The protein was identified as zzso V by partial zzso acid sequence zzso zzso of zzso V zzso was examined by using Western zzso after one- or two-dimensional zzso For characterization of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were carried zzso 

zzso zzso showed that zzso V was stained as a zzso pattern along zzso on frozen sections of both zzso and zzso of adult zzso The zzso were seen more clearly in cultured rat zzso zzso zzso of doubly stained zzso with zzso V and zzso by a zzso laser scanning microscope suggests that zzso V is localized in association with the zzso of rat cardiac zzso We also found that zzso V was stained intensely in zzso regions of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso of rat liver and brush zzso web region in the zzso cells of both small zzso and kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso binding experiments revealed that zzso V failed to bind to zzso directly in zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso V is a new component of the zzso in rat zzso and might be involved in regulation of its zzso
