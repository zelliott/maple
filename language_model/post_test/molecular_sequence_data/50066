zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that causes East Coast fever, a severe zzso disease in zzso Previous attempts to produce zzso zzso surface zzso zzso in bacterial or insect cells for vaccine purposes have not resulted in a correctly folded zzso Here, we report the expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso fused to the zzso envelope zzso zzso by cloning the appropriate zzso zzso segments between the signal sequence and the major portion of zzso To further advance the generation of such zzso existing surface display techniques were combined with zzso zzso zzso proteins were present on the surface of zzso viruses as judged by zzso zzso and were exposed on the surface of insect cells, as concluded from zzso studies of zzso zzso insect zzso In zzso dot zzso experiments, a strong reaction was obtained between zzso zzso and zzso particles displaying the zzso zzso zzso This zzso raised against native zzso also specifically recognized the surface of zzso zzso Apparently, a more native zzso was achieved than when zzso was expressed in zzso or in conventional zzso expression zzso The zzso surface expression system, therefore, provides an improved way of expressing this zzso zzso surface zzso
