zzso simulations are used to examine the zzso behavior of several zzso in explicit zzso The particular peptides considered here adopt a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Four distinct molecular sequences are zzso Earlier experimental studies have revealed the formation of ordered and zzso zzso for such zzso depending on zzso The simulations reported here, which are conducted by resorting to zzso techniques, lead to free energy surfaces for zzso of the peptides in water as a function of separation and relative zzso Such surfaces are used to identify the molecular origins for the behaviors observed in the zzso
