The zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso in a zzso binding pocket formed in part by seven zzso zzso The present studies demonstrate that the second zzso loop of the zzso is involved in zzso zzso recognition as zzso zzso zzso of seven zzso zzso clustered in the zzso portion of the second zzso loop was zzso zzso with single zzso acid zzso at each of these positions were zzso zzso into zzso cells, their zzso binding profiles zzso and each zzso was tested for its ability to decrease zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso resulted in receptors with increases in affinity up to zzso for zzso compounds with a C1 zzso zzso but wild type affinities for natural zzso zzso that have a zzso zzso at the C1 zzso In contrast, substitution of zzso with zzso caused a loss of selectivity up to zzso for naturally occurring zzso zzso as compared with the wild type zzso zzso the zzso zzso displayed a decrease in affinity for zzso compounds and an increase in affinity for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for zzso of zzso remained unchanged for each zzso zzso
