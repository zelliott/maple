We have investigated the zzso zzso gene on zzso 1 as a candidate gene in two sporadic cases with zzso disease or zzso motor and sensory zzso zzso type zzso We found different zzso a zzso substitution for zzso 63 in the zzso domain and an zzso substitution for zzso 167 in the zzso zzso The patients were genetically zzso for the normal zzso and the zzso zzso which was absent in their parents and in one hundred zzso healthy zzso The results strongly suggest that a de zzso dominant zzso of the zzso gene is responsible for at least some sporadic cases of zzso zzso
