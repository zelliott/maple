Most advanced zzso lack zzso zzso zzso a key zzso required for the zzso of zzso zzso However, extant representatives of primitive species including sturgeon and many zzso fishes, are exceptional in their ability to zzso zzso acid de zzso In the present study, full-length zzso zzso were isolated from white sturgeon zzso zzso and two shark species belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The open reading frames from all three species contained 440 zzso acids and the deduced zzso had similar zzso profiles, predicted molecular masses and theoretical zzso zzso These zzso sequences exhibited high zzso acid identity zzso with each other, and also shared zzso identity with zzso zzso Based on the zzso sequences obtained from these species, we developed zzso zzso for the isolation of partial zzso sequences by zzso from other primitive species including another shark zzso zzso zzso a zzso dogfish zzso zzso zzso two ray species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, sequence identities of these amplified zzso segments among primitive species were zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso numbers of zzso acid zzso were unique to either fish or zzso and zzso species occupied an intermediate position, sharing several zzso with either fish or zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso distance and likelihood methods of both zzso and zzso acid sequences resulted in trees that were in agreement with known zzso The zzso and zzso activity of zzso were zzso when measured by zzso zzso and reverse zzso
