The zzso and infection imaging properties of a zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analog zzso and zzso were compared in rabbits with zzso coli zzso Six New Zealand white rabbits were injected in the left zzso thigh with a suspension of zzso zzso Twenty four hours later, the animals were injected with: zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso At 2-3 and zzso zzso dual zzso zzso were acquired and the images were corrected for crossover between the two zzso After recording the final images, the animals were sacrificed and zzso was zzso At both imaging times the zzso of the two zzso were markedly zzso The highest zzso of zzso were detected in blood pool structures, liver and zzso In contrast zzso of zzso labeled zzso was greatest in zzso lung and liver zzso with binding to zzso In general, the sites of infection were better zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso ratios increased with time zzso zzso zzso At both times, the zzso for zzso were higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso at 2-3 h and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso These results indicate that although both zzso zzso at sites of infection, the zzso zzso are superior zzso for the rapid detection of focal sites of zzso However, since the mechanisms of zzso are different the combined use of both agents could have value in the general evaluation of zzso
