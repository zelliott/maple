The severity of an influenza epidemic season may be influenced not only by zzso in the surface zzso but also by differences in the internal proteins of circulating influenza zzso To better understand viral zzso evolution, all eight gene segments from 44 human zzso epidemic strains isolated during zzso in Taiwan were analyzed to provide a profile of protein zzso zzso of the evolutionary profiles of the zzso zzso and zzso genes of influenza A zzso viruses indicated that they were derived from a group of zzso zzso first seen in zzso However, the zzso M and zzso genes were derived from a different group of zzso zzso from zzso Tree zzso revealed the zzso and zzso genes could each be zzso into two groups similar to those for the zzso zzso In addition, new genetic zzso occurred during the zzso period and become the dominant strain after one or two zzso zzso of evolutionary patterns in consecutive years is necessary to correlate viral genetic changes with zzso changes as multiple lineages zzso
