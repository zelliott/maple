In the present study, the full-length zzso of a novel zzso zzso protein (named zzso was identified from zzso zzso zzso using rapid amplification of zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso zzso consisting of a zzso untranslated region zzso of 61 zzso and a zzso of 335 zzso with a zzso signal sequence zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso including an zzso domain and an zzso domain, with a theoretical zzso point of zzso and a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso also has a signal zzso of 23 zzso acids and a potential zzso zzso The sequence similarity and zzso analysis indicated that zzso belongs to the group of zzso zzso and is closer to zzso than to the other zzso in zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a putative zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso and has a functional zzso By fluorescent quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso transcripts of zzso were mainly detected in the zzso but were hardly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso fat body, silk zzso head, zzso zzso and zzso After the zzso larvae were infected by zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso a significant zzso in the relative expression level of zzso was zzso All the results suggested that zzso is a novel protein that plays an important role in the zzso zzso and in the immune response of zzso to zzso zzso
