The molecular mechanism for zzso entry remains largely elusive in flowering zzso Only zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are the zzso zzso are known to be required for the initiation of plant zzso The mechanism underlying the zzso of male zzso characteristic to flowering plants, has also been unclear in the plant zzso In other zzso zzso zzso proteins are known to play essential roles in zzso development and zzso zzso Rice zzso protein discovered in this study shows partial similarity with human zzso zzso zzso deleted in zzso zzso zzso though zzso also possesses zzso repeats and a zzso finger zzso zzso analyses of several zzso markers revealed that, in zzso zzso zzso most germ cells failed to enter zzso zzso and zzso and a part escaped from the zzso and underwent zzso with a significant delay or continued zzso zzso zzso detection revealed that zzso zzso zzso localized at zzso zzso region of germ cells during zzso zzso in transgenic rice zzso This study is the first report of the plant zzso zzso which is required for regulating the zzso zzso transition of male and female germ cells and also establishing zzso of male zzso This study will contribute to zzso of similarities and zzso in reproduction system between plants and other zzso
