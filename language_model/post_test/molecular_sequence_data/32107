Human organic zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the zzso and it plays important roles in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although the transport characteristics of zzso have been studied zzso there is no information available for the zzso regulation of zzso The present study was undertaken to identify the zzso and zzso for zzso expression of zzso The zzso start site was located 385 zzso above the translation start site by using zzso amplification of zzso zzso An approximately zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region was isolated and the promoter activities were measured in the zzso zzso cell line zzso A deletion analysis suggested that the region spanning zzso to zzso base pairs was essential for zzso zzso zzso This region lacked a zzso but contained a zzso box and an zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that specific zzso complexes were present in the zzso but not in the zzso box, and zzso zzso revealed that upstream zzso factor 1 zzso which belongs to the basic zzso zzso family of zzso factors, bound to the zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso promoter activity, and zzso of zzso enhanced the zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso This article reports the first characterization of the zzso promoter and shows that zzso functions as a zzso zzso regulator of the zzso gene via the zzso
