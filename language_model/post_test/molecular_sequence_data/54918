zzso is present in various molecular zzso However, its role in these complexes remains zzso We discovered that although zzso is a zzso of the zzso spoke zzso complex in zzso zzso it was zzso in the zzso precursor that is converted into the mature zzso at the tip of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso bound in tandem to the zzso region of a spoke zzso zzso protein 3 zzso that zzso zzso to zzso zzso enhanced the binding of zzso zzso fragments to zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso fragments extracted from zzso contained zzso and putative zzso zzso Lastly, zzso of zzso zzso sites resulted in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and defective associations between zzso zzso and zzso We propose that at the tip of zzso an array of zzso zzso binds to zzso in zzso zzso triggering zzso stalk base formation, and zzso zzso These multiple effects shed new light on fundamental questions about zzso complexes and zzso zzso
