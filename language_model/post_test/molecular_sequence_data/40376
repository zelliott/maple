A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the soil of a zzso field in zzso South Korea, and characterized in order to determine its zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso and the highest degree of sequence similarity was found with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that strain zzso possessed zzso zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso which is common to members of the zzso zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso summed feature 4 zzso and/or zzso iso zzso zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 8 zzso and/or unknown zzso zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unknown polar zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests clearly demonstrated that strain zzso represented a separate species and supported its affiliation to the zzso zzso Based on these data, the new isolate represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
