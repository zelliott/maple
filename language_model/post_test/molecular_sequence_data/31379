The isolation and characterization of complementary zzso zzso which code for an zzso zzso zzso expressed in human breast tumor tissue are described zzso The only information regarding the primary structure of this potentially important zzso has been a zzso repeat zzso We now report the complete zzso acid sequences of different forms of the human zzso tumor zzso as deduced from the zzso sequence of isolated zzso zzso The diversity of protein forms is generated by a series of alternative zzso events that occur in the regions located upstream and downstream to a central tandem repeat zzso zzso zzso coding for the upstream region show that differential usage of alternative zzso zzso sites may generate two protein forms containing putative signal peptides of varying zzso The complexity of possible zzso forms is further compounded by alternative zzso events occurring in the region 3' to the repeat zzso The isolated zzso 3' to the tandem repeats indicate that whereas one zzso transcript is zzso with the zzso and defines an open reading frame zzso containing 160 zzso acids downstream to the repeat zzso a second zzso zzso with a zzso that is generated by a series of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the spliced zzso contains an zzso that is identical for 149 zzso acids downstream to the repeat array with the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso At this point it zzso and continues for an additional 179 zzso zzso The sequence contains a highly zzso zzso zzso located towards the zzso zzso that may zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso presented here, define the complete zzso acid sequences of the zzso tumor zzso and demonstrate the existence of multiple protein forms that probably zzso to different cellular and zzso zzso
