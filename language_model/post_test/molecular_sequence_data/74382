In the absence of an zzso determined zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been explored to zzso binding affinity in terms of zzso and structural zzso Further, zzso on a zzso model of zzso validated the derived zzso and predicted the binding mode of this series of zzso zzso parameters and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as an external test set validation zzso zzso zzso judged the statistical significance and zzso ability of the zzso zzso enabled a better understanding of zzso interaction and provided a zzso interpretation in terms of zzso zzso It identified a unique hydrogen bonding between the zzso of zzso and the zzso nitrogen in the zzso It rationalized the need for R 2 zzso to be bulky and zzso while the zzso at R 8 to be zzso and comparatively less zzso It also explained why at R 6 a variety of zzso are tolerated and how the presence of zzso at R 5 enhances binding zzso
