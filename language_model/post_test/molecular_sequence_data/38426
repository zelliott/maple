A zzso zzso of bacteria zzso zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso was cloned into the zzso zzso The hybrid clone containing zzso zzso with the zzso zzso approximately zzso was shown to manifest a high level of zzso By zzso and restriction analysis of the zzso fragment, the location of zzso genes relative to restriction sites was zzso The zzso sequence of the DNA zzso containing the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was zzso A comparison with the zzso sequences of zzso genes in zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso repetitive zzso sequence zzso of 126 zzso typical for zzso strains was identified in the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is assumed to emerge through zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown to possess a high zzso zzso its activity decreased by a factor of 10 at 44 degrees C for 30 zzso whereas zzso of marine bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by one order of magnitude at 44 degrees C for 1 and 6 zzso zzso The zzso genes of zzso zzso are suggested for use in gene engineering and zzso
