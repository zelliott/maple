The effect of a series of synthetic peptides mimicking the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on fusion of zzso charged zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso at a zzso zzso ratio, respectively, has been zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso respectively, with the zzso acid sequence completely corresponding to the zzso of zzso displayed the highest zzso zzso The extent of fusion was significantly increased at mild zzso pH zzso zzso particularly influenced the zzso activity of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of zzso peptides by proteins and synthetic zzso blocked the fusion zzso The zzso properties of peptides depended on the chain zzso zzso consisting of nine zzso zzso acid zzso had no zzso activity, while zzso an zzso zzso effectively fused zzso The fluorescent probe zzso was used to monitor the zzso of these zzso The zzso of zzso increased appreciably with a change in pH from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced the leakage of the zzso contents from zzso at neutral pH and caused a small, but zzso leakage at zzso zzso zzso and molecular factors influencing the zzso zzso fusion are zzso
