The complete zzso zzso sequence of the rat zzso gene zzso zzso the major zzso protein in zzso zzso growing cells, is compared with the corresponding locus recently characterized in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 200 (1988) zzso In both zzso species the zzso organization has been zzso zzso during evolution, zzso the coding region extends over 9 zzso and is split into 14 zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso Moreover, all the zzso junction positions were strictly maintained during zzso More unexpectedly, this analysis revealed that several zzso contain highly zzso sequence elements of about 120 zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso locus isolated from a Chinese zzso zzso clone established that these regions were under unusually high selective constraints zzso identity between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and, although they do not contain open reading zzso they surprisingly appear to be more zzso than most of the zzso suggesting that they play an important zzso Such an element of 130 zzso presents features of known genes transcribed by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in the rat zzso zzso the zzso and zzso regions of the last zzso are fully complementary over 16 zzso and so are predicted to be included in a prominent stem zzso Moreover, an zzso zzso stem structure can be derived from the mouse zzso including two zzso zzso zzso As the secondary structure would zzso the zzso sequences required for the proper zzso of this zzso in both zzso species, this remarkable finding could be relevant to the regulation of the zzso gene expression at the zzso processing zzso
