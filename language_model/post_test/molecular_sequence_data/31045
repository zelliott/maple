The synthesis of protected zzso zzso using the zzso zzso as the zzso protecting group, their zzso and some possible applications of these zzso for the synthesis of modified zzso gels and the construction of zzso are zzso The selective zzso zzso is achieved under neutral conditions by zzso zzso of the zzso group followed by zzso of the resulting zzso zzso The zzso group can be zzso selectively in the presence of the zzso zzso with hydrogen zzso in zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso can be removed simultaneously with zzso in zzso This method opens up a zzso route to zzso model structures of biological zzso
