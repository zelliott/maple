zzso seminal fluid is a complex mixture of zzso carbohydrates and zzso produced in the male zzso zzso This seminal fluid is transferred together with the zzso during mating and zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso characterization of seminal fluid proteins in the Mediterranean fruit fly, zzso zzso is zzso although studies suggest that some of these proteins are biologically zzso 

We report on the functional zzso of zzso high quality expressed sequence tags zzso from the zzso and male accessory zzso to identify transcripts zzso putative zzso peptides that might elicit zzso responses in zzso The zzso were assembled into zzso zzso of which over zzso produced no hits against the zzso database, and thus may represent novel or rapidly evolving zzso zzso of the coding sequences resulted in a total of zzso putative zzso The zzso zzso is available as a zzso zzso Four hundred peptides were identified with putative zzso activity, including zzso binding zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of a subset of putative zzso zzso transcripts from accessory zzso indicated changes in their abundance after one or more zzso when compared to virgin males of the same zzso These changes in zzso particularly evident after the third zzso may be related to the requirement to replenish proteins to be transferred to the zzso 

We have developed the first large-scale zzso for novel studies on functions and processes associated with the zzso biology of zzso zzso The identified genes may help study zzso evolution, in light of the high zzso potential of the zzso In addition, studies of male recovery dynamics in terms of accessory zzso gene expression profiles and correlated zzso zzso mechanisms may permit the improvement of zzso management zzso
