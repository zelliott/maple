The first step of the currently favored model for the mechanism of zzso of the human zzso element involves the synthesis of full length zzso zzso Previous work demonstrated that the zzso 100 base pairs of the human zzso element zzso has an important role in regulating it's zzso Here we report further deletion analysis revealing the presence of a zzso regulatory element overlapping the region between base pairs zzso and zzso zzso containing this sequence form a specific complex with a nuclear protein extracted from zzso and zzso cells, and with zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso The complex is zzso by zzso binding sites found in other zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso and therefore zzso
