We previously used Southern zzso analysis to detect zzso zzso between male fertile and zzso male sterile zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Two copies of zzso were found in each male fertile and zzso pepper zzso Interestingly, one of the copies of zzso in zzso pepper was a zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso gene was the same in the fertile zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso from that in the zzso 41 zzso downstream of the stop zzso To develop zzso zzso amplified region zzso zzso inverse zzso was performed to characterize the zzso sequences of the zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso of male fertile zzso and zzso zzso pepper zzso Based on these data, two zzso zzso zzso 607 and zzso zzso long, were developed to distinguish zzso from zzso by zzso The zzso zzso bands were verified for 20 zzso containing either zzso or zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso sequences will allow quick and reliable identification of the zzso types of individual plants at the zzso stage, and assessment of the purity of F1 seed zzso The strategy used in this report for identifying zzso markers could be adopted for many other crops where zzso is used for F1 seed zzso
