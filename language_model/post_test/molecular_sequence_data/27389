zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso has been recently identified as a novel inhibitor of zzso and hence called zzso In this study, we expressed zzso zzso domain of zzso protein in zzso coli and analyzed its zzso Using an zzso zzso restriction and zzso method, we obtained an zzso zzso DNA sequence coding for the zzso domain of human zzso The DNA was cloned into expression zzso zzso that encodes a fusion tag of zzso before the zzso The zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was subsequently transformed into zzso coli strain zzso After induction with zzso zzso zzso the cells produced the fusion protein mainly in the form of inclusion bodies as identified by zzso The zzso protein was zzso by affinity zzso through zzso column and recognized by zzso zzso zzso using Western zzso zzso Moreover, we established a simple, efficient and sensitive reporter zzso method to detect the activity of the zzso zzso The results showed that the target protein was biologically zzso
