A zzso expression zzso containing the rec A promoter and a zzso zzso element from the gene 10 leader of zzso zzso was used to direct efficient synthesis of rat zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli has no apparent, deleterious effects on the zzso High levels of expression of zzso zzso in zzso strains of zzso coli, such as zzso is associated with suppression of termination at its zzso stop zzso This can be eliminated by using a zzso as zzso and by zzso zzso of the zzso to create an in frame zzso stop zzso zzso zzso rat zzso lacks its zzso Met zzso It has been zzso with and without bound zzso High resolution zzso zzso studies of the 131 zzso zzso and zzso have revealed the zzso zzso contains 10 zzso zzso organized into two zzso situated zzso The overall zzso of the protein resembles that of a zzso the term zzso The bound zzso is located in the interior of the zzso Its zzso group forms part of a unique five member hydrogen bonding network consisting of two ordered zzso molecules as well as the side chains of zzso and zzso The hydrocarbon chain of the bound zzso fatty acid has a distinctive bent zzso with a slight left-handed zzso zzso This zzso is maintained by interactions with the side chains of a number of zzso and aromatic zzso zzso zzso has a similar overall zzso to zzso indicating that the zzso structure is stable even without bound zzso The space occupied by bound zzso in the core of the zzso is occupied by additional ordered zzso molecules in the zzso zzso in the side chain zzso of several zzso located over a potential opening to the zzso of the zzso and zzso suggest that zzso may play an important role in the binding zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
