A model for the interaction of 31 zzso acid zzso zzso from DNA binding domain of human zzso zzso zzso with a five base pair DNA sequence zzso 3' from zzso regulatory element zzso has been obtained using a zzso procedure based on structural data on model zzso DNA binding domain of zzso zzso zzso imposed by zzso coordination of the zzso zzso with zinc zzso and classical secondary structural zzso zzso of the protein as well as its complex with DNA is obtained by energy zzso followed by refinement by molecular zzso The complex is stabilized by zzso between zzso zzso and zzso with DNA bases zzso zzso and zzso zzso also made zzso with the backbone of zzso The backbone of zzso zzso with zzso of zzso DNA was in distorted B form and showed evidence of zzso zzso zzso
