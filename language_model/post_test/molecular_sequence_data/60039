zzso can function as zzso zzso that undergo a zzso change upon zzso binding to a site other than the active zzso Although zzso zzso are not known to exist in nature, zzso acids appear to be well suited to display such advanced forms of kinetic zzso Current research explores the mechanisms of zzso zzso as well as the strategies and methods that can be used to create new zzso zzso 

In this study, we exploit the modular nature of certain functional zzso to engineer zzso zzso that are activated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso By joining an zzso or zzso domain to a zzso zzso by different stem II zzso we have identified a minimal zzso bridge comprised of a zzso zzso pair that is responsive to zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to its zzso site zzso a zzso change in the zzso that zzso the zzso pair and ultimately favors the active form of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso exhibit rate enhancements of more than zzso in the presence of zzso and of approximately zzso in the presence of zzso 

An zzso strategy for modular rational design has proven to be an effective approach to the engineering of novel zzso zzso This strategy was used to create zzso zzso that function by a mechanism involving zzso structure zzso zzso similar engineering strategies and zzso mechanisms could be used to create a variety of novel zzso zzso that function with other zzso zzso
