zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso that play a crucial role in the regulation of signal zzso zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso To understand the significance of zzso in zzso and zzso processes in the zzso we isolated three zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso from rat kidney by zzso chain reaction zzso Using zzso product as a probe, we isolated a full-length zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso a single membrane spanning protein consisted of zzso zzso zzso with two zzso located zzso zzso zzso By Northern analysis, a ubiquitous pattern of zzso gene expression in rat zzso was zzso In cultured rat zzso cells, zzso zzso was detected and the zzso level was suppressed by either zzso or zzso zzso
