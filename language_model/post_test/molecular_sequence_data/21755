The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is required to establish and maintain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yet little is known about its direct zzso Using different approaches we demonstrate that the induction of zzso causes a significant zzso of the organ boundary gene zzso zzso zzso zzso which is specific and independent of other zzso zzso We further show that the regulation of zzso by zzso is direct and identify putative binding sites in its zzso Continuous expression of zzso in zzso leaf zzso also causes the zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso which provides a negative feedback loop by zzso regulating zzso and zzso The results bring new insights into the zzso links between zzso and zzso zzso factors and contribute to the understanding of the regulatory network controlled by zzso
