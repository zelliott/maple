zzso zzso pockets on the surfaces of a family of proteins can provide insight into zzso geometric features and sites of zzso zzso Here we describe mapping and comparison of the surfaces of aligned zzso structures, using the protein zzso family as a zzso zzso are rapidly zzso using two computer programs, zzso and zzso zzso uses zzso of atomic density to locate grooves and pockets on the molecular zzso zzso a new piece of software, splits the zzso output into distinct zzso The zzso was run on 10 zzso zzso zzso aligned on the zzso and the resulting pockets zzso zzso The active site zzso appears as a large, zzso site that can be subdivided into zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso in the active site zzso between zzso and zzso zzso are visible and zzso The active site zzso cluster zzso showing a zzso spatial relationship between the active site and zzso in the zzso When the zzso is zzso there are multiple mechanisms for zzso the zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel site at the top of the zzso is present in all the zzso and there is a large zzso pocket over the hinge and the zzso zzso Other pockets on the zzso core are strongly zzso but have not yet been mapped to a zzso zzso Sites identified by this zzso have revealed structural and zzso zzso features of the zzso family and potential zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso
