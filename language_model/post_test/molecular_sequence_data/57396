A new zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso provided maximum zzso efficiency for the reduction of zzso from molecular zzso This zzso which is distinct from zzso and for which the name zzso is proposed, is required for zzso of an electron transfer chain between zzso and zzso zzso A zzso protein functions as a zzso in the presence of zzso in the zzso The finding of a zzso zzso c with a molecular weight of 104,000 Da that is also active in this electron transfer chain provides an explanation for the energetic linkage between zzso and zzso proteins in this zzso zzso
