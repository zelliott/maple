zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso results in a large zzso change that zzso a broad zzso surface used to interact with zzso proteins zzso A1 and zzso and facilitate membrane zzso zzso In contrast with other zzso zzso zzso is unable to bind calcium due to deletion and substitution of zzso zzso Despite this, zzso zzso assumes an zzso zzso that is very similar to zzso in its zzso zzso To understand how zzso is able to adopt an open zzso in the absence of zzso seven zzso proteins were constructed where regions from zzso sites I and II, and zzso zzso in zzso were replaced with the corresponding regions of zzso The zzso proteins having zzso in zzso site II displayed increased zzso surface exposure as assessed by zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding in the absence of zzso This response is similar to that observed for zzso and zzso zzso Further, this substitution resulted in zzso binding to zzso zzso for one zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso within site II are important in stabilizing the open zzso of zzso and presentation of its target binding zzso In contrast, zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso displayed poorer zzso surface exposure and, consequently, zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study represents a first attempt to systematically understand the molecular basis for the zzso open zzso of zzso
