zzso liver zzso is zzso by zzso zzso following zzso zzso A zzso plot of zzso versus zzso yields a straight line with a positive y zzso indicative of zzso binding of the inhibitor before an irreversible zzso The zzso constant zzso for the initial zzso zzso complex is estimated at zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso (at pH zzso and 25 zzso A zzso of 2 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso of the inhibitor zzso of zzso at zzso zzso was determined from zzso zzso and from incorporation studies using zzso The irreversible zzso as well as the zzso incorporation could be completely prevented by the presence of zzso during the zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso by occupying its zzso binding zzso zzso phase high pressure liquid zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed one radioactive peak containing two zzso zzso They are zzso and zzso By comparison of these sequences to those of the zzso binding sites of several zzso and zzso it is suggested that the zzso zzso is the one modified by zzso and would be predicted to be the region where the zzso group of zzso zzso
