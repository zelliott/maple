The barley zzso encodes a family of 10 zzso zzso that have not previously been subject to extensive gene expression zzso We show here that expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in barley leaves increased more than zzso during the first 10 d after zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso was zzso zzso zzso provided the first evidence for zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso with correlation to transcript zzso In developing zzso zzso and zzso expression increased zzso and zzso over a zzso after zzso However, among the zzso grain transcripts zzso was the most abundant, whereas zzso was the least zzso Excess zzso zzso three out of the six zzso expressed in leaves of young barley zzso In contrast, most zzso were zzso by excess zzso or zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso which has two zzso elements in the zzso zzso lines zzso zzso barley zzso showed increased sensitivity to excess zzso and zzso but no zzso zzso We suggest that barley zzso are zzso involved in zzso zzso of essential metal zzso and that a subset of barley zzso is specifically involved in zzso zzso
