zzso zzso proteins are abundantly expressed in the zzso and zzso stages of zzso zzso and are recognized as zzso targets by both the zzso and cellular arms of the immune zzso Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of genes zzso zzso proteins in zzso partially protective immunity to zzso zzso infection and disease, suggesting their utility as vaccine zzso For the identification of additional vaccine targets, in this study we screened the zzso zzso expressed sequence tag zzso and zzso sequence survey zzso zzso By applying a variety of zzso zzso tools to the analysis of approximately 2,500 zzso we identified 348 zzso zzso and 260 zzso zzso sequences zzso novel zzso zzso Of these, 19 sequences exhibited the characteristics of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Eight of the selected sequences were amplified to obtain genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are expressed in different zzso stages of the zzso and zzso in the zzso of a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the expression of the zzso zzso by the cloned genes as surface proteins in zzso and/or zzso stages of zzso zzso When delivered as a DNA zzso genes zzso zzso a zzso zzso response in zzso Except for zzso zzso to genes zzso exhibited zzso activity against the zzso forms of zzso zzso a property known to correlate with the immune control of zzso zzso Taken together, our results validate the zzso of zzso in zzso mining, resulting in the identification of zzso zzso zzso proteins that are potential vaccine zzso
