The zzso amplification and subsequent restriction analysis of the zzso region spanning the internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso gene is applied to the identification of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso This methodology has previously been used for the identification of some species of this zzso but in the present work this application has been applied to the identification and zzso of a greater number of species of the zzso zzso with a special survey of species of clinical and zzso zzso Among the species of the zzso zzso the high zzso observed, both in the length of the amplified region zzso between 390 and 900 zzso and in their restriction patterns, allows the unequivocal identification to the species level, with the exception of the group of species that comprises zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that required the sequencing of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso gene or the zzso region for their proper zzso The zzso restriction analysis also failed in the differentiation of species within the pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this case, the high sequence similarities obtained for their zzso zzso domain and the zzso region indicate that each pair of species should be considered as a single zzso The main purpose of this work is to generate a database for a high number of zzso species, of both zzso and clinical interest, and to facilitate their easy, fast, and reliable zzso The present work improves the database available online at the zzso web page zzso with the patterns of 75 species belonging to the zzso zzso
