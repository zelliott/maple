Multiple zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso dominant familial cancer syndrome characterized by tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso and the anterior zzso DNA sequencing from a previously identified minimal zzso on zzso zzso identified several candidate zzso one of which contained 12 different zzso nonsense, zzso and zzso deletion zzso in 14 zzso from 15 zzso The zzso gene contains 10 zzso and encodes a zzso expressed zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid protein product, termed zzso exhibits no apparent similarities to any previously known zzso The identification of zzso will enable improved understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso and should facilitate early zzso
