Visual zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso by binding to the zzso zzso form of the zzso In bovine rod outer segments that were prepared in the presence of zzso zzso two faster zzso forms of zzso with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 44 zzso were observed by Western zzso zzso The zzso form was more evident in rod outer segments of eyes kept in the light than those placed in darkness and was found to be identical to that generated by in zzso zzso of zzso by pure retinal zzso zzso In zzso analysis showed that zzso was zzso only when bound to zzso soluble zzso was not significantly zzso by zzso zzso involves sequential zzso at two, possibly three sites, resulting in the removal of 27 zzso acids from the zzso zzso The remaining zzso protein was resistant to further zzso by zzso Unlike intact zzso the zzso truncated zzso was not readily released from the zzso after the zzso had lost its zzso nor was it released upon the addition of zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso to the same extent as intact zzso In conclusion, these results provide evidence that a zzso form of zzso in rod outer segments is a product of selective zzso by zzso Furthermore, they suggest that this zzso may provide a mechanism for zzso the zzso state of the visual zzso
