zzso are repeats of a DNA base motif zzso zzso mostly CA zzso up to 100 times; they are distributed regularly all over the zzso Many of them are zzso and their high zzso is based upon a variable number of zzso They are widely used for genetic zzso linkage analysis, population zzso evolutionary studies and in forensic zzso Such markers have also been described in the zzso region since 1991, and a growing interest in their potential applications is being zzso The aims of this review are: 1) to outline the presently available information from literature and molecular databases concerning 53 zzso in the zzso region zzso type of zzso number of zzso zzso zzso used for zzso 2) to address the question of technical pitfalls when using such zzso 3) to discuss specific features such as their zzso rate (10 zzso to 10 zzso which is higher than that reported for zzso zzso and their linkage zzso with zzso zzso 4) to present an integrated map of zzso and genes of this zzso and 5) to provide a synopsis of their different applications in zzso fields zzso studies, population zzso zzso point studies, zzso region zzso zzso along with perspectives for future zzso Although some zzso region zzso have already been applied to the analysis of more than 10 diseases, it is now evident that their use in population zzso and the determination of zzso zzso in bone zzso transplantation represent growing areas of zzso
