zzso zzso zzso visual zzso can be divided into two categories that correlate with spectral sensitivity, violet sensitive above 390 zzso and ultraviolet sensitive below that zzso The evolution and mechanism of spectral tuning of zzso zzso are proving more complex than those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso probably evolved from an ancestral zzso zzso although in birds ultraviolet sensitivity has zzso from zzso zzso In certain zzso a single substitution involving the gain of a polar zzso can switch sensitivity from ultraviolet to violet sensitivity, but where such a change is not involved, several zzso may be required to effect the zzso The guinea zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso a distinct zzso from the zzso such as rats and zzso It has been shown by zzso to have two cone visual zzso at zzso and 400 zzso We have zzso the sequence of the zzso zzso and confirmed its violet sensitivity by expression and zzso of the zzso in zzso Moreover, we have shown by zzso zzso that a single zzso is responsible for wavelength tuning of spectral sensitivity, a zzso causing a 60 zzso zzso shift into the ultraviolet and a zzso substitution shifting the zzso 8 zzso long zzso The zzso evolution of this zzso VS zzso provides insight into the mechanism of tuning between the violet and zzso
