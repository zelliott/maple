zzso the central zzso initiation factor of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso III is composed of three zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The orientation of the zzso zzso within the zzso complex has been analyzed at two promoters by two approaches that involve zzso zzso zzso zzso a collection of zzso internal and external deletion proteins has been surveyed for those deletions that alter the interaction of zzso with DNA or change the orientation of zzso relative to zzso a method for regionally mapping zzso between specific DNA sites and zzso protein has also been zzso The results map an zzso segment of zzso to the upstream end of the zzso complex and zzso acids zzso to the principal zzso site, approximately 8 base pairs upstream of the zzso zzso The analysis also indicates that a segment zzso zzso acids zzso zzso away from DNA, and locates the zzso 170 zzso acids of zzso downstream of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso products formed by DNA with adjacent and nearby zzso zzso supports the conclusion that zzso and zzso share an extended interface along the length of the zzso zzso
