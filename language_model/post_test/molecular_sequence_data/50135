The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and has been suggested to play a role in the alternative zzso acid synthesis zzso in the zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso has been reported only in the zzso To investigate the zzso characteristics of the zzso processes in bovine zzso zzso we raised a zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso cells, which have tight junctions that act as a zzso barrier and are involved in producing zzso humor and maintaining zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso reacted intensely with an zzso in the zzso cells of the zzso processes but not with other zzso zzso The zzso profile of zzso zzso from bovine zzso processes showed a zzso protein of molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this zzso protein was identical to human zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was found only in zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest a new zzso function for the zzso zzso zzso in addition to the production of zzso acids and provide new insight into the zzso role of the zzso zzso cells concerning the metabolism of zzso in the zzso
