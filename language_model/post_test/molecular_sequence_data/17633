To examine the zzso production of zzso proteins by zzso zzso we fused the DNA zzso the signal zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso derived from zzso zzso with a synthetic gene zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso The analysis of zzso by zzso revealed an efficient zzso of zzso through the zzso with no zzso zzso among the cellular zzso The zzso zzso was stable in the shaking culture for about 6 zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso reference zzso from zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso from zzso has a lower specific activity, which may be due to a different zzso sequence or to zzso processing of the zzso
