zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a final trimming zzso of zzso zzso peptides bound to major zzso complex class I molecules in the zzso zzso zzso In our previous work, we found that zzso is zzso from zzso in response to zzso by zzso and zzso In this paper, we searched for the zzso acid sequence of zzso protein important for zzso retention by constructing zzso proteins and found that the sequence between zzso and zzso was zzso Moreover, by comparing the zzso organizations of zzso zzso members, the zzso 10 coding zzso which might be inserted into the common ancestral gene of the zzso zzso zzso during evolution, was found to be important for zzso retention of zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso contains zzso acid sequence important for zzso zzso
