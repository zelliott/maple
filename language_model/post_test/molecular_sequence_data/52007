Seven genes and two anonymous markers were mapped to a single linkage group on rat zzso 10 using progeny of an zzso zzso of Fischer zzso and Lewis zzso zzso zzso Two zzso the zzso zzso or cellular zzso of the viral zzso zzso zzso and growth hormone zzso were mapped by Southern zzso analysis of restriction zzso length zzso Five zzso embryonic skeletal zzso heavy chain zzso zzso binding zzso hormone binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso and two anonymous zzso zzso and zzso were mapped using zzso amplification zzso The zzso zzso markers for the five genes were also highly zzso in 10 other zzso rat strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These markers should be useful in genetic analysis of traits described in zzso rat zzso as well as in genetic monitoring of such zzso The zzso in this linkage group covered 50 zzso of rat zzso 10 with the following order: zzso zzso (no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Comparative gene mapping analysis indicated that this region of rat zzso 10 exhibits linkage conservation with regions of human zzso 17 and mouse zzso zzso
