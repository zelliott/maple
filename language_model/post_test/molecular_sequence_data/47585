zzso zzso and zzso define a family of zzso zzso proteins which plays a central zzso role for zzso signaling related to cell zzso zzso function has been specifically implicated in signaling pathways important for cell zzso and differentiation in zzso and zzso zzso While the zzso zzso and zzso site zzso zzso zzso of zzso family proteins are well characterized and binding partners known, to date the highly zzso zzso zzso of the three proteins have lacked functional zzso In this study, we have determined that the zzso domain of zzso contains a divergent zzso zzso zzso This motif mediates zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a recognition specificity similar to that of the zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso We had previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso expressed as a separate domain in zzso zzso cell division patterns, inducing zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso induction by zzso requires an intact zzso further supporting the idea that this motif has an zzso activity for zzso and zzso that zzso zzso activity derives in part from interactions with zzso zzso zzso These combined results provide initial insight into the mode of function of the zzso zzso domain and suggest that the zzso protein may interact with cellular proteins which control zzso
