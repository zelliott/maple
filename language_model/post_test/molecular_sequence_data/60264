zzso zzso activity is instrumental in processes of cellular zzso The zzso invasion of zzso cells during zzso is accompanied by zzso of several zzso zzso including membrane type 1 zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso cells zzso to undergo zzso by a three-dimensional zzso zzso environment increase production of the zzso factor zzso Increased binding of zzso to the zzso promoter zzso with enhanced zzso activity, whereas zzso in the zzso binding site abrogate the increased zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso These data identify zzso zzso of zzso as a mechanism by which zzso cells can initiate an invasive zzso in response to an zzso in zzso zzso environment, thus functionally zzso zzso with a growing number of proteins known to be zzso by zzso in response to tissue injury or mechanical zzso
