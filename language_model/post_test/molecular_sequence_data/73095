zzso 5, an zzso filament attachment protein within the zzso zzso of the basement membrane zone involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso the alpha 3, beta 3, and gamma 2 chains which are zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To facilitate identification of zzso zzso in zzso a strategy based on direct amplification of zzso DNA by zzso or zzso by zzso followed by zzso analysis of the zzso products, was zzso 

zzso pairs for amplification of the complete zzso as well as the 23 individual zzso in the zzso DNA, which zzso the entire gamma 2 chain of zzso 5, were zzso The zzso for amplification of zzso from zzso DNA were positioned at least 24 zzso away from the zzso borders in the zzso zzso zzso For amplification of zzso generated by zzso eight primer pairs covering overlapping segments of the entire coding sequence of zzso zzso were zzso The amplified sequences were scanned for zzso zzso and sequence variations in zzso patients and unrelated control individuals by zzso analysis by means of zzso sensitive gel zzso zzso 

zzso the strategy developed in this study, we identified zzso zzso in three patients with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and eight zzso normal zzso which are useful for linkage analysis, in the zzso zzso 

The methodology described in this study is capable of detecting zzso zzso or small insertions and deletions in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in this gene in zzso patients further emphasizes the role of zzso 5 in providing integrity to the zzso basement membrane zzso
