A statistical study of zzso or zzso boxes and zzso initiation sites in human DNA zzso genes is zzso The range over which the two signal sequences extend is zzso and their information content is zzso The results are compared with those obtained from zzso zzso samples (including sequences from various zzso species and zzso zzso significant differences are found for both signals, and are especially noticeable for zzso initiation zzso The possibility that the latter may contain sufficient information to resolve the remaining ambiguity in the position of the zzso start point once a zzso box has been located is zzso
