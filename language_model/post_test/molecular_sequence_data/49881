When soluble extracts of the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso several proteins were zzso One of the more prominent of these, which migrated with a mass of approximately 46 zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was zzso by column zzso and zzso and subjected to zzso acid sequence analysis via both the zzso technique and mass zzso The best match to the partial sequence obtained was the potential zzso product of open reading frame zzso whose zzso zzso acid sequence displayed many features reminiscent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Open reading frame zzso was therefore zzso and its protein product was expressed in zzso zzso zzso of its zzso capabilities revealed that the protein was a moderately effective PGA zzso that also exhibited low levels of zzso zzso PGA zzso activity was dependent upon the presence of zzso metal zzso such as zzso or zzso The zzso protein underwent zzso when incubated with either zzso or zzso The site of zzso was identified as zzso which zzso to the zzso essential zzso zzso in bacterial and zzso zzso The zzso intermediate behaved in a chemically and zzso competent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the disappearance of radioactive zzso and the zzso appearance of zzso PGA at rates comparable to those measured in zzso zzso of PGA zzso zzso
