zzso zzso was extracted from zzso zzso cell zzso with zzso acid and then isolated by zzso zzso The primary structure was determined by zzso acid sequence analysis of the total protein and of fragments obtained by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso contains 49 zzso acid zzso and is clearly zzso with zzso type 1 zzso zzso of the positions being zzso Surprisingly, rabbit zzso possesses an zzso zzso zzso whereas all zzso and several zzso zzso sequences of this type start with zzso the zzso region being remarkably zzso during zzso
