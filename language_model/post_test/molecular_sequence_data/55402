Little is known about the role of zzso zzso against zzso stresses and zzso zzso contents of zzso In current study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso on the growth of soybean under salt stress zzso zzso cultures of nine zzso zzso were isolated from the roots of zzso soybean plants, and their culture zzso were screened on zzso and zzso rice zzso for identification of plant growth promoting zzso zzso It was observed that zzso isolate zzso significantly promoted the growth of both zzso and zzso zzso was later identified as a new strain of zzso zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soybean plants recorded significantly higher shoot zzso shoot fresh and dry zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, zzso rate and leaf area; under sodium zzso induced salt stress as compared to zzso control zzso An elevated zzso and reduced zzso zzso and zzso contents in zzso zzso zzso zzso soybean plants demonstrated zzso of salt induced zzso zzso Furthermore, reduced zzso acid and elevated zzso acid contents in soybean plants confirmed that lesser stress was convened to zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso We also assessed the role of zzso zzso interaction on IF zzso of zzso and found significantly higher IF contents in zzso zzso zzso soybean zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso interactions with soybean can be beneficial to improve soybean quality and quantity under salt affected agricultural zzso
