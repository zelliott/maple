A zzso zzso alkaline zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso juice of zzso zzso While originally reported to be produced by the zzso only, in this project it was found that the zzso of this zzso was also expressed in the zzso fat body, gut, zzso muscles, zzso zzso brain, and silk zzso of 5th zzso larvae, indicating additional functions to its reported role in zzso acid zzso in the zzso In order to study the functional properties of zzso three zzso expression zzso were generated, characterized by presence or absence of a signal zzso and a zzso and used for expression in zzso zzso tissue culture zzso Western zzso indicated that these different forms of zzso protein were not zzso into the growth zzso while they were detected in the zzso and zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso acids zzso experiments indicated that full-length zzso could digest zzso and that the processed form zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso could degrade both DNA and zzso in zzso cell zzso Using a reporter zzso targeted by zzso zzso zzso it was shown that the zzso property of the processed form could interfere with the zzso zzso zzso of processed zzso protein showed zzso zzso in the cellular zzso and zzso with zzso zzso was also zzso In conclusion, our in zzso studies indicated that zzso protein zzso of zzso can be functional and involved in the regulation of zzso acid metabolism in the zzso In particular, because of its propensity to degrade zzso the zzso might be involved in the innate immune response against invading zzso acids such as zzso zzso
