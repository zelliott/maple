In the present study, four chicken zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso recovered from different geographical regions of India were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso region containing the complete coding region of zzso and zzso zzso and partial coding region of zzso protein were zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of the Indian zzso zzso were aligned and compared with zzso zzso of European, Asian, American and Australian zzso zzso analysis of the Indian zzso zzso were also carried out based on the zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso The results indicated that Indian zzso were genetically evolved from different parts of the zzso Indian zzso zzso was found closely related to European zzso strain, zzso and zzso were closely related to Bangladesh zzso strain and zzso was closely related to Australian zzso zzso The zzso of the four zzso zzso was studied in zzso specific pathogen free zzso zzso zzso SPF zzso zzso were divided into five groups comprised of 10 zzso in each zzso Group 1 was kept as control and groups zzso were infected with each zzso isolate zzso The zzso were infected at a dose rate of 1 zzso cell culture fluid zzso zzso per bird zzso The clinical signs, mortality and packed cell volume zzso and body weight gain were recorded on 5, 10 and 15 days zzso At 15th day, all the birds were sacrificed and various zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso liver and zzso were examined for gross and microscopic zzso The zzso study indicated that all the zzso except zzso were able to produce clinical disease and zzso in young zzso whereas the isolate zzso produced no clinical disease but only induced zzso which was revealed by microscopic examination of the zzso zzso The study showed valuable information on molecular zzso status of zzso zzso prevalent in India for the first zzso
