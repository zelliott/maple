In a protein design study the artificial zzso zzso was zzso with its binding site complementary to the zzso inhibitor zzso which was chosen as a structurally zzso zzso The zzso of zzso took advantage of the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso as a structural zzso Its combining site was reshaped by replacing 19 zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, ten zzso acid zzso were zzso in the framework zzso The crystal structure of the corresponding zzso model zzso which was produced as an zzso zzso in zzso coli, was determined at a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso exhibited symmetry of the space group zzso (a zzso zzso zzso b zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso with two zzso fragments in the zzso unit, which were independently refined zzso zzso zzso The resulting coordinates were used for a detailed comparison with the zzso protein zzso It was found that the mutual arrangement of the six zzso regions as well as most of their backbone zzso had been correctly zzso One major difference that was detected for the zzso of a five zzso zzso in zzso region zzso could be explained by an erroneously defined segment in the structure of the zzso zzso which had been used as a template for this zzso In the light of more recent zzso data it appears that this segment adopts a new zzso zzso Apart from this region, most of the zzso in the zzso site had been properly placed in the zzso zzso There was however one important exception concerning zzso zzso whose zzso zzso had been kept as it appeared in zzso The differing orientation of this zzso in the model compared with the crystal structure of the artificial zzso zzso zzso explains why an zzso affinity could not be detected so zzso The detailed analysis of this and other, more subtle zzso suggests how to make this zzso zzso function by introducing a few additional zzso acid changes into zzso
