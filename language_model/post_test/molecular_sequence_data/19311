The use of zzso elements as a zzso strategy is a powerful tool for gene zzso zzso we describe the development of a zzso system, based on the bacterial zzso zzso which has been used successfully in zzso zzso The zzso carries the zzso zzso zzso which is expressed only when inserted zzso with a zzso gene present in the target zzso Four zzso clones from a zzso zzso zzso library were used as targets in zzso reactions and four zzso libraries were constructed and zzso in zzso zzso zzso resistant to zzso were selected and zzso by zzso in order to identify the zzso zzso of the protein coded by the trapped zzso A definitive zzso zzso for zzso zzso protein fusion was not obtained in any of the four zzso clones zzso However, the constructed zzso element is highly efficient considering the frequency of zzso in large targets and is therefore a useful tool for functional genetic studies in zzso Our data confirm the utility of the zzso zzso system for zzso of sequencing zzso sites into target zzso Furthermore, the high frequency of zzso and even distribution are important in studying zzso regions bearing long and zzso repetitive zzso
