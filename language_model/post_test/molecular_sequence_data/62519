zzso of protein zzso clients to the zzso zzso involves the zzso zzso acting as a scaffold, binding protein zzso via its zzso domain and zzso via its zzso zzso zzso also has a regulatory activity, arresting zzso zzso cycle during zzso zzso We have localized the binding site for zzso to the zzso zzso binding domain of zzso and determined the crystal structure of the zzso core zzso zzso zzso binds to surfaces of the zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso zzso and association with the middle segment of the zzso This interaction fixes the lid segment in an open zzso zzso an zzso side chain into the zzso binding pocket to zzso zzso and prevents zzso interaction of the N zzso
