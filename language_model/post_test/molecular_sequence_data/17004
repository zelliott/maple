The hallmark of a type I zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso B zzso zzso is the presence of zzso zzso comprised of zzso fused zzso acting together to catalyze one round of chain zzso In addition to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso a module may also include a zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso The size, flexibility, and fixed zzso zzso of these zzso zzso present challenges for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we have harnessed the power of limited zzso and zzso protein expression to isolate and characterize individual zzso of module 3 of zzso a zzso protein consisting of a zzso an zzso an zzso and an inactive zzso zzso Two zzso boundaries were identified via limited zzso which led to the production of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso as structurally stable zzso zzso Each protein was shown to possess the requisite zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso both the zzso and the zzso proteins were able to catalyze chain zzso as well as the intact parent zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso enabled direct interrogation of the zzso specificity for both the zzso zzso and the partner zzso zzso and zzso zzso units were found to be equivalent zzso for chain zzso Whereas zzso and zzso of zzso could be exchanged for zzso zzso was a substantially poorer partner for the zzso zzso the newly identified zzso sites were zzso in many zzso zzso raising the prospect of developing improved methods for the construction of hybrid zzso zzso by engineering domain zzso at these zzso zzso
