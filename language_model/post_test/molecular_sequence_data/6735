The synthesis of zzso factors and other zzso in zzso zzso is controlled by the global regulator, zzso zzso of zzso proteins is zzso in the zzso growth phase, whereas expression of surface proteins is zzso by zzso The zzso locus consists of two divergent zzso transcribed from neighboring but zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso reported here, contains 4 open reading zzso zzso C, D, and B, of which A and C appear to zzso proteins of a classical zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso specifies a zzso zzso transcript, zzso III, which is the actual zzso of the zzso response, and, zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that both zzso and zzso are zzso sensitive zzso in an zzso but not in an zzso background) and deletion analysis has shown that all four of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso seem to be absolutely required for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso seem to be partially zzso Since zzso of zzso requires zzso zzso products, the zzso zzso is zzso and is thus admirably suited to the need for rapid production of zzso at a time when overall growth is coming to a zzso
