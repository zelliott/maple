zzso zzso zzso were investigated for their ability to convert zzso to its zzso These zzso included one zzso zzso isolate and 7 zzso 3 zzso and 43 zzso zzso Eleven out of the 53 strains zzso showed the ability to transform zzso to zzso and zzso Among those, zzso zzso zzso 3-1 showed the highest zzso yield zzso from zzso to its zzso In this strain, the addition of up to zzso zzso in the medium enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was about zzso higher than that of the negative control zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso which is comprised a 1776 zzso open reading frame zzso zzso 591 zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso 3-1 and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to have optimum activity at pH zzso and 40 zzso The reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of zzso zzso produced by zzso The amount of zzso increased from zzso to zzso as temperature was lowered from 50 zzso to 30 zzso zzso that zzso activity can be controlled by reaction zzso
