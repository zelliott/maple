In this study, the zzso within the zzso DNA region spanning the internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso gene zzso zzso was used to differentiate species in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso region was zzso and the zzso product zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso in the size of the amplified product and in the restriction patterns enabled differentiation between species in the zzso zzso and between zzso species and zzso species from other zzso in the zzso database ( zzso zzso Moreover, the restriction zzso length zzso zzso patterns of the zzso enabled misidentified strains to be detected and revealed genetic zzso between strains within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Ultimately, the zzso patterns of the zzso zzso failed to differentiate between some zzso and zzso species that could be distinguished on the basis of the sequence of the zzso zzso region or the sequence of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso
