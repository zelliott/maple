zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso a serious infectious disease of zzso zzso zzso are known to change in zzso compared to the in zzso zzso zzso analysis of in zzso zzso is usually not possible due to insufficient zzso Using an in zzso growth chamber model, the zzso fish zzso zzso zzso was cultured in pure culture in zzso in its host, the Atlantic zzso to obtain sufficient biomass to allow zzso zzso Growth of zzso zzso under in zzso zzso conditions resulted in the expression of outer membrane proteins of 73, 76 and 85 zzso which were not present when grown under in zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis identified the 73 zzso protein as a zzso zzso the 76 zzso protein as an outer membrane zzso zzso and the 85 zzso protein as a zzso zzso zzso When cultured in zzso zzso zzso zzso the identical 73, 76 and 85 zzso zzso The results of this study also suggest, at least with respect to the outer membrane zzso that the in zzso zzso growth model largely reproduces the results obtained from growth of zzso zzso within the zzso cavity of zzso
