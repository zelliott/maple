The protein zzso (for abundant zzso zzso composed of one zzso zzso region zzso 2 and two zzso zzso was cloned by screening human and rat zzso libraries with an zzso probe directed to a consensus sequence of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was comprised of 217 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and was found to be ubiquitous in rat zzso A human zzso clone was also found to code for part of the same zzso suggesting that zzso is common to human and zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso similar to zzso the product of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso is most probably a zzso zzso of zzso zzso bound in zzso to zzso zzso including activated zzso growth factor zzso the zzso zzso domain being responsible for the zzso zzso expression of an zzso zzso zzso led to a reduction in cell zzso Considering these observations and the structural zzso to zzso zzso is likely to function as a ubiquitous signal zzso possibly resembling zzso which communicates between a zzso protein zzso zzso and a Ras zzso
