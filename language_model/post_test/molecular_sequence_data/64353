The stimulation of host gene expression by zzso gene products of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to play a critical role in zzso zzso We show, however, that zzso zzso infection strongly zzso host gene expression early in infection by accelerating global zzso zzso This function is zzso by zzso zzso a zzso of a DNA zzso widely present in other zzso but which in zzso has uniquely evolved additional functions that mediate its participation in zzso zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit host gene expression has important implications for models of zzso zzso that invoke zzso of host zzso in zzso infected cells as a source of zzso or zzso zzso
