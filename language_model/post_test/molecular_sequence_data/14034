zzso zzso is the primary pathogen implicated in zzso zzso In this paper we have delineated a 27 zzso zzso termed the zzso locus zzso that was essentially specific for virulent zzso zzso zzso The precise ends of this locus were mapped and the sequences of the junction regions from the virulent strain zzso were compared to corresponding sequences from the benign isolate zzso The left end of the zzso locus was located in a sequence similar to that of the small stable zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli, next to a zzso zzso which indicated that the zzso locus might have arisen by the integration of a zzso However, no zzso sequence could be found at the right end of the zzso zzso In the zzso of the benign strain the sequences bordering zzso were not zzso but were separated by about 3 zzso It was concluded that the divergence of the benign and virulent strains at this locus was a zzso zzso Several potential zzso were identified at the junction regions but only one ORF, zzso a 126 zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso expression system in zzso zzso
