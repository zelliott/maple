We constructed a zzso containing a zzso gene composed of the gene zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and a gene zzso a single chain zzso zzso zzso directed against one of the two zzso of a zzso zzso from zzso Large quantities of the fusion protein were produced in the culture medium of zzso zzso zzso Fusion to zzso did not affect the ability of the zzso to zzso its zzso Similarly, the zzso activity was not impaired in the zzso The fusion protein was zzso from the culture medium in a single step by affinity zzso The zzso obtained consisted of a soluble zzso form of zzso fused to zzso It was zzso and had a molecular weight of 94 zzso The properties of this zzso fusion show that the simple, zzso preparation of various zzso zzso zzso zzso with low molecular weight is zzso In addition, in the construct zzso the zzso domain can be easily changed to another one taking advantage of the zzso restriction sites surrounding this zzso
