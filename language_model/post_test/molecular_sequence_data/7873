zzso zzso has functioned as a model system for the study of zzso zzso since the zzso Application of zzso ranging from zzso zzso to the most sophisticated molecular biological techniques have resulted in a detailed understanding of genes and pathways involved in primary zzso secondary metabolism and development in zzso zzso We have taken advantage of this background in developing zzso zzso as a genetic system to study the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is the product of a lengthy zzso zzso found in the asexual zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses most if not all of this zzso and produces zzso the penultimate precursor of the zzso zzso We have identified a approximately 60 zzso cluster of genes in zzso zzso whose products are involved in zzso zzso This cluster contains at least 20 genes proposed to zzso both zzso activities and regulatory zzso Our results have shown that at least some of these genes are functionally zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that they are regulated in similar zzso Further studies of zzso regulation in zzso zzso should yield information zzso to studies of zzso secondary metabolism in other zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
