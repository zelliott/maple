The partial zzso sequence for an zzso gene from an zzso 76 group A zzso was zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed considerable sequence similarity between the zzso and zzso genes in their proposed promoter regions, signal zzso and 3' zzso Additional analysis indicated that the deduced zzso protein contains a zzso region and membrane anchor region highly similar to that of M zzso In view of these results, we zzso that zzso and zzso genes of group A zzso are the products of gene zzso from a common ancestral zzso It is proposed that DNA sequence similarity between these two genes may allow for zzso zzso zzso as a means of generating zzso diversity in these two surface zzso
