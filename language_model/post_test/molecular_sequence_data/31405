As an zzso insect species, the brown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a serious zzso of rice crops in the temperate and tropical regions of Asia and Australia, which may be due to its robust zzso Here we combined zzso comparative zzso and zzso zzso analyses to identify zzso proteins and zzso Using zzso and zzso populations as sample groups, a total of 54 and 75 proteins were significantly altered in the third and sixth day zzso female zzso respectively, and 39 and 54 of these proteins were identified by zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated higher expression levels in the zzso population in the second day zzso female adults and the second day fifth zzso zzso respectively, and 411 zzso were zzso in both zzso Of these dozens of proteins and thousands of zzso five were zzso expressed at both the protein and zzso levels at all four time points, suggesting that these genes may regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso was chosen for further functional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene reduced the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso disrupted zzso development, and inhibited zzso zzso zzso Our results show that a combination of zzso and zzso analyses provided five candidate proteins and genes for further zzso The knowledge gained from this study may lead to a more fundamental understanding of the zzso of this important agricultural insect zzso
