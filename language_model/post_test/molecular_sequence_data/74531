zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso for zzso cell wall zzso Its zzso in some species, including mouse and human, have been zzso and their importance in zzso immunity has also been zzso However, its zzso in the rat has not yet been zzso In this study, zzso acid sequences of rat zzso were analyzed by rapid amplification of zzso zzso The sequence of rat zzso was found to be highly zzso to that of the zzso It possesses essential motifs for the recognition of zzso and signal zzso However, the position of the start zzso in the detected sequence was not zzso and its zzso tail was shorter than that observed in other zzso Similar to mouse zzso two major zzso of rat zzso that were generated by alternative zzso were zzso a full-length zzso and a shorter zzso deficient in the stalk zzso It was also demonstrated that rat zzso is capable of binding zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso B via zzso and the zzso zzso These results suggest that rat zzso also plays essential roles in immune responses against zzso
