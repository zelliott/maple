It has been found that the double bond of free, zzso zzso in a gel can react with a free zzso group of zzso forming a zzso zzso When zzso was incubated at concentration levels lower than those of free zzso left after zzso a zzso zzso zzso C gel zzso 12 zzso under zzso conditions in zzso M zzso pH zzso for 1 h and then the zzso zzso analyzed by high performance liquid zzso zzso two new peptides were zzso The two new zzso were recovered and zzso by the zzso degradation zzso They zzso to the sequence from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 160 was found to be a zzso reaction zzso Interestingly, only this zzso out of a total of 5 zzso zzso had zzso No other zzso acids (including zzso zzso and free zzso in zzso reacted with free zzso The addition of free zzso to the zzso group could be completely inhibited zzso zzso the gel was extensively washed prior to sample application, or zzso the gel was incubated for 1 h in 100 zzso free zzso
