We have identified the zzso regions of proteins C and E of zzso virus by performing an exhaustive study of membrane zzso induced by two C and zzso zzso libraries on model zzso having different zzso compositions as well as its ability to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso phase zzso zzso C presents one zzso zzso region coincidental with a proposed membrane interacting domain, whereas protein E presents five zzso zones coincidental with different significant zones of the zzso zzso the fusion zzso a zzso zzso a sequence containing a zzso pocket as well as the stem and zzso zzso of the zzso The identification of these zzso segments supports their role in viral membrane fusion, formation of the replication complex and zzso and therefore attractive targets for development of new zzso zzso
