zzso zzso are a prominent class of surface receptors that regulate many aspects of the plant life zzso Despite recent advances the function of most zzso zzso remains zzso zzso it is paramount to investigate these zzso The task is complicated by the fact that zzso zzso belong to a large zzso family with many zzso In general, functional analysis of gene family members by reverse zzso is often obscured by several issues, such as zzso subtle or difficult to detect zzso in zzso or by decision problems regarding suitable biological and zzso zzso zzso in many cases additional strategies have to be employed to allow zzso of hypotheses regarding gene zzso 

We approached the function of genes zzso the zzso zzso FAMILY zzso class of putative zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso comparisons show overall conservation but also divergence in predicted functional zzso among zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso differential zzso As a result, zzso is predicted to exist in a standard zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso version that lacks most of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is zzso by a high degree of zzso between the zzso and Col zzso Two independent zzso zzso zzso showed smaller leaves while zzso plants displayed enlarged zzso This is in addition to the zzso zzso which has been described zzso Additional single and several key double zzso combinations did not reveal obvious zzso zzso zzso expression of several zzso zzso using the zzso promoter, resulted in male zzso To gain possible insights into zzso gene function we employed a zzso analysis of publicly available zzso zzso We performed global expression zzso zzso analysis, and an analysis of the enrichment of gene zzso terms among zzso zzso The zzso analyses raise the possibility that some zzso genes affect different aspects of cell wall zzso The results also indicate that zzso is a minor aspect of the zzso zzso 

The results provide evidence that zzso is a positive regulator of leaf zzso In addition, they suggest that the zzso family is zzso by functional diversity and that some zzso genes may function in cell wall zzso They also indicate that zzso reverse zzso with zzso data mining of zzso expression data aids in zzso hypotheses on possible functions for members of a gene zzso
