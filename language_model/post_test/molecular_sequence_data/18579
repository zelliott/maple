Using a new culture method for zzso soil bacteria, we discovered a novel species, zzso from the forest soil of zzso University campus, South zzso It was a zzso zzso and zzso bacterial zzso It grew over a wide pH range zzso with an optimum range of pH zzso and in a wide range of temperatures zzso with an optimum range of zzso Growth was possible at zzso zzso zzso and the optimal range was between zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that this new species clustered within the zzso zzso it was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The main fatty acid components of this zzso were zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso in this bacterial strain was zzso The polar zzso profile primarily comprised zzso zzso and zzso The zzso DNA zzso composition of the isolate was zzso The zzso zzso results indicated that this strain was distinct from other zzso species, the degree of similarity being zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Based on our results, we regard strain zzso as a novel member of the zzso zzso and we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
