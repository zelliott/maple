The zzso proteins zzso and zzso are components of the terminal zzso of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for a zzso zzso zzso but exhibits accelerated turnover in the absence of zzso Here, we report that a zzso dependency exists between zzso and zzso with zzso subject to accelerated turnover with the loss of zzso Furthermore, the instability of zzso correlated with its failure to zzso to the attachment zzso The zzso domain of zzso is essential for both function and its accelerated turnover in the absence of zzso We constructed zzso deletion derivatives lacking portions of this domain and examined each for stability and zzso The zzso 41 zzso were particularly important for proper zzso and function in cell zzso and zzso zzso but the entire zzso domain was required to stabilize zzso The significance of these findings in the context of attachment zzso assembly is zzso
