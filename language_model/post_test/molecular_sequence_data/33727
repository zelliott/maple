The zzso system of zzso zzso has proven to be an excellent model system for studying the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulating the patterning and initial maturation of the zzso system have been largely worked out, yet important questions remain regarding how the mature tubes zzso with air at the end of zzso and how the zzso system grows in response to the oxygen needs of a developing zzso that increases nearly zzso in volume over a four day zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso a gene that encodes a large zzso protein containing zzso binding and cell signaling motifs in its zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in insect species, but does not appear to have a true zzso in zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso beginning in stage 5 zzso and zzso protein zzso to the zzso plasma membrane in all zzso derived zzso most notably in the zzso zzso zzso zzso animals show defects in zzso inflation at the end of zzso and die primarily as zzso zzso tubes in zzso larvae are often crushed or zzso although zzso patterning and maturation appear normal during zzso zzso zzso larvae also show defects in zzso growth and zzso of their zzso zzso
