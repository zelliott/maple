A zzso zzso the Calvin cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso via zzso differential zzso and used to isolate several full-length zzso clones for this zzso from zzso zzso identity of the zzso mature zzso was shown by an zzso increase of zzso activity upon induction of zzso coli cells that zzso the spinach zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso is shown by processing of the in zzso zzso precursor upon zzso by isolated zzso Southern zzso suggests that zzso is zzso by a single gene in the spinach zzso zzso proteins of both zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso are found to be unexpectedly similar to zzso zzso suggesting a possible zzso origin of these nuclear zzso zzso zzso is the last of the demonstrably zzso Calvin cycle zzso to have been cloned and thus completes the isolation of gene zzso for all zzso of the zzso in higher zzso
