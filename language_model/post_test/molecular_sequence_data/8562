The zzso zzso complex zzso of zzso zzso exhibits unusual biological zzso This zzso complex promotes the formation of zzso zzso and, when administered zzso can prevent zzso induction in a rat model of zzso zzso Each of these biological properties is zzso by a T zzso immune zzso The zzso consists of two distinct zzso zzso A and zzso B, each with repeating units that have positively charged zzso groups and zzso charge zzso or zzso zzso Analysis of these zzso as well as of other charged zzso of bacterial origin, before and after chemical zzso revealed that the zzso charged groups are required for promotion of zzso zzso as well as for the distinct properties associated with the zzso zzso zzso and delineate one mechanism by which these biological responses zzso
