The zzso virus, originally thought to be the cause of a degenerative neurological disease of inhabitants of zzso has been characterized by sequence analysis of its zzso zzso and coat protein coding zzso In the zzso zzso leader, and zzso regions, the zzso identity between the sequences of known strains of zzso virus and zzso virus is about zzso In the zzso region, the similarity drops to about zzso compared to the 50% similarity between sequences of zzso virus and zzso zzso Using the known crystal structure of one zzso virus strain, it is shown that the sequence zzso generally occur at exposed surface zzso zzso virus is the most divergent zzso virus zzso A tissue zzso isolate has been zzso and found to exhibit low zzso in zzso zzso
