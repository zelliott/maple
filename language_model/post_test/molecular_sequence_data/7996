Because of similarities in the cellular fatty acid compositions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we determined the zzso zzso gene sequences of the type strains of these species to assess their zzso A very high level of sequence zzso zzso zzso was found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that these species are zzso closely zzso A comparative sequence analysis revealed that these two species are members of the zzso zzso and are zzso remote from zzso zzso (the type species of the zzso zzso which was found to be a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso On the basis of our zzso findings, we propose that zzso zzso should be reclassified as zzso zzso zzso zzso
