The zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes may be zzso of male zzso The zzso gene on the long arm of the human Y zzso is a strong candidate for the zzso zzso zzso Its role in zzso is supported by its exclusive expression in zzso its deletion in a high percentage of males with zzso or severe zzso and its zzso with a zzso male zzso gene zzso No zzso zzso sequences have been found on the mouse Y zzso Instead, a zzso gene was isolated from mouse zzso 17 and has been considered to be a zzso zzso of zzso However, the zzso between human zzso and mouse zzso is not strong, and zzso contains only one of the seven zzso repeats found in zzso We report the isolation of the human zzso gene by screening a human zzso zzso library with a zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes only one zzso repeat and shares high zzso with the mouse zzso indicating that these two genes are zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso cell lines and zzso in zzso zzso the zzso gene was mapped to zzso a region not known to share zzso with mouse zzso zzso The zzso gene may be involved in some familial cases of zzso zzso male zzso
