zzso zzso and zzso zzso are major toxic and zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso In bacteria and zzso zzso and zzso were recently shown to be repaired by zzso zzso zzso a direct DNA damage reversal zzso No zzso gene zzso have been identified in zzso We report that zzso and zzso are repaired by the zzso base zzso repair zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a different repair mechanism for these zzso in the third domain of zzso In addition, zzso was found to effect a robust zzso of zzso We present a high-resolution crystal structure of zzso which, together with the characterization of several zzso zzso forms a molecular rationalization for the newly discovered base zzso zzso
