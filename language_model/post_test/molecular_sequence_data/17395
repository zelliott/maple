In recent years diverse zzso techniques using green fluorescent protein zzso proteins have been reported, including zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso technique and kindling fluorescent zzso So far, only zzso which is zzso and gives zzso zzso contrast, could be applied for protein zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso is capable of efficient zzso from zzso to green, changing both its zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso light zzso Complete zzso of zzso results in a zzso increase in the zzso zzso ratio, making it the zzso zzso zzso fluorescent protein described to zzso We used zzso as a zzso tag to study trafficking of human zzso zzso in living zzso At moderate zzso zzso zzso can be used as a zzso zzso label for protein tagging and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso
