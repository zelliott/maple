After their release from host cells, most zzso particles undergo a maturation process, which includes viral protein zzso core zzso and increased stability of the viral zzso zzso zzso the viral zzso prevents protein zzso the resulting zzso lack condensed zzso and contain fragile zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is linked to zzso zzso change and increased stability of the zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether protein zzso is sufficient for zzso virus zzso zzso We have observed a novel zzso in a zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso which has normal zzso production, viral protein zzso and zzso zzso However, this zzso also has immature zzso zzso and contains a fragile zzso zzso which is reminiscent of zzso zzso To our knowledge, this zzso provides the first evidence that zzso zzso alone is not sufficient to promote zzso zzso zzso To extend our study further, we examined a zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso that lacks a functional zzso motif and produces immature zzso without major defects in viral protein zzso We found that the viral zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is more fragile and unstable compared with those from zzso zzso Based on the results of experiments using two different zzso zzso from two distinct zzso we conclude that zzso zzso is not sufficient for promoting zzso zzso zzso and we propose that there is a link between the maturation of zzso zzso and the viral zzso zzso
