Research investigating the geographical context of zzso has primarily focused on zzso factors such as the role of zzso glacial cycles, or zzso zzso Few study systems allow a direct comparison of how biological differences, such as zzso zzso affect population genetic structure of organisms that were subdivided during the zzso Mormon zzso exist in solitary and gregarious zzso which broadly zzso with an zzso zzso division across the Rocky zzso zzso individuals form bands that can move up to 2 zzso zzso This study assessed whether population genetic structure results mainly from deep zzso zzso or if we can also detect more recent genetic patterns due to phase and zzso differences superimposed on the older, deeper zzso We found that separation in zzso was a more important influence on genetic divergence than phase, with the Rockies acting as a barrier that separated Mormon cricket populations into eastern and western zzso during zzso glacial zzso However, patterns of isolation by distance differ between eastern and western zzso for both zzso and nuclear DNA, with greater divergence within the zzso solitary zzso An zzso zzso mismatch distribution is compatible with historical population expansion in the western zzso but not in the eastern zzso A persistent (and possibly zzso difference in zzso ability has most likely influenced the greater population genetic structure seen in the eastern zzso emphasizing the importance of the interaction of zzso climate fluctuations and geography with zzso factors in producing the patterns of genetic subdivision observed zzso
