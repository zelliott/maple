zzso zzso is an economically important zzso used as industrial producer of zzso However, with the exception of zzso zzso zzso little attention has been paid to the zzso of other aspects of the metabolism of this zzso In this article we describe the first attempt of systematic analysis of expressed genes in zzso zzso using a suppression zzso zzso approach to clone and identify sequences of genes zzso expressed in media with zzso or zzso as carbon source zzso or zzso zzso A total of 167 clones were zzso 95 from the zzso condition and 72 from the zzso zzso Genes zzso expressed in the zzso condition zzso mainly proteins involved in the zzso electron transport chain and primary zzso Genes expressed zzso in zzso medium include genes for secondary metabolism zzso zzso N zzso different zzso and a gene zzso a putative zzso zzso or zzso The results provided information on how the metabolism of this fungus adapts to different carbon zzso The expression patterns of some of the genes support the hypothesis that zzso zzso higher rates of zzso in zzso zzso while zzso secondary zzso
