The zzso selective zzso zzso associated zzso zzso and five of its zzso having structural modifications at positions 2, 4 and 5 were zzso by the solid phase method using zzso zzso acid zzso zzso as zzso agents and zzso alcohol zzso as the solid zzso The zzso selectivity of these peptides was determined by guinea pig zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso The latter zzso was carried out using modified zzso solution zzso with pure oxygen instead of zzso All the synthetic peptides were found to be zzso zzso
