zzso zzso proteins are displayed on the surface of zzso red blood zzso They play a critical role in the disease, zzso infected cells away from destruction by the zzso and causing many severe zzso A molecular understanding of how these zzso maintain their binding properties while evading immune detection will be important in developing zzso In malaria of pregnancy, zzso from the zzso zzso protein interact with zzso zzso on the zzso zzso This causes zzso of infected red blood cells, leading to zzso inflammation and block of blood flow to the developing zzso This is associated with maternal zzso low birth weight, and premature delivery and can lead to the death of mother and zzso Here I present the structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain from a zzso zzso zzso The domain adopts a fold similar to zzso invasion zzso with extensive loop zzso One loop is flexible in the zzso structure but observed in the presence of zzso or zzso where it completes a zzso zzso This loop, and others surrounding this putative zzso site, are flexible and zzso perhaps protecting the binding site from immune zzso This suggests a model for how the domain maintains zzso binding while evading the immune response and will guide future drug and vaccine zzso
