zzso is a major zzso stress that affects crop productivity zzso zzso can withstand periods of water zzso during the final stage of zzso zzso during which zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, prolonged periods of drought can cause severe plant zzso 

In a previous study, we evaluated the zzso of zzso plants to better understand zzso responses to zzso Among the zzso genes was zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the research reported here was to characterize this zzso zzso encodes a putative protein containing 248 zzso acids with a large number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso in a zzso with zzso from other zzso plants, separate from those of zzso zzso The expression of zzso in different varieties of zzso plants has not shown a clear association with drought zzso 

The zzso of zzso in transgenic tobacco plants increased their tolerance to drought, zzso and zzso stress, as demonstrated by increased photosynthesis, water content, zzso zzso rate, zzso content and reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso rate zzso net photosynthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso and internal leaf zzso zzso were less affected by zzso stresses in transgenic zzso plants compared with zzso zzso Overall, our results indicated that zzso zzso tolerance to multiple zzso zzso highlighting the potential of this gene for zzso zzso
