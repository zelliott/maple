The zzso hormone zzso II zzso binds to and activates the human zzso II type 1 zzso zzso of the G zzso zzso class A zzso Several zzso mechanisms have been proposed for this family, but they have not yet been zzso zzso We previously used the zzso proximity zzso to show that 11 zzso in zzso domain zzso III, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso reside in close proximity to the zzso zzso of zzso With the exception of a single change in zzso zzso the same contacts are present on zzso a zzso active zzso this zzso is a model for the active form of the zzso In this study, two series of 53 individual zzso zzso were constructed in zzso I, II, IV, and V on both zzso zzso The zzso were zzso with a neutral zzso zzso and the resulting complexes were zzso with zzso zzso Although no new contacts were found for the zzso zzso two were found in the zzso active zzso zzso in zzso II and zzso in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct zzso contact with zzso II and zzso V has been zzso These contact point differences were used to identify the structural changes between the zzso and zzso complexes through zzso modeling and restrained molecular zzso The model generated revealed an important structural zzso of several zzso from the zzso to the activated form in the zzso zzso
