zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to represent a major control point of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso We demonstrate structural and functional conservation between the zzso from humans, a budding zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the human and zzso zzso proteins deduced from cloned zzso were compared to those of the known zzso zzso zzso All are predicted to zzso zzso zzso proteins of approximately 50 zzso with similar zzso zzso zzso sequence conservation exists in regions of the zzso proposed to interact with its zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso Many of the highly zzso regions are also present in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which catalyze zzso zzso zzso reactions analogous to that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso clones zzso zzso zzso or hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso requirement of zzso zzso cells bearing zzso gene zzso showing that these zzso can functionally replace the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells or in cultured human zzso by treatment with the zzso zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso in all three cell zzso
