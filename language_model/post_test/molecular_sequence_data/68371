zzso toxin is a powerful zzso known to inhibit neurotransmitter zzso The zzso toxin light chain is a zzso that zzso some members of the zzso gene family with high zzso Here, we report the expression of a synthetic gene zzso the zzso toxin light chain in the zzso zzso of transgenic zzso zzso was severely impaired and mature zzso were completely zzso Late zzso exhibited zzso shapes and zzso zzso The number of zzso cells was greatly zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed that the toxin acts on zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited an zzso distribution of zzso filaments and many cells contained large zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso toxin is active in zzso cells and suggest an important function for members of the zzso gene family during the late stages of zzso
