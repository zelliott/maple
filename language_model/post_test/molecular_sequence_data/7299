According to zzso data, about 100 years ago an avian influenza virus passed the species barrier zzso zzso to pigs and zzso from there) to zzso In 1979 an avian influenza A virus (as a whole, without zzso again entered the pig population in northern Europe, forming a stable zzso Here it is shown that the early North European zzso viruses exhibit higher than normal evolutionary rates and are highly variable with respect to plaque zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the idea that, in order to pass the species barrier, an influenza A virus needs a zzso zzso to provide an additional number of zzso from which the new host might select the best fitting zzso A zzso zzso could be of advantage under such stress conditions and might enable a virus to pass the species barrier as a whole even twice, as it seems to have happened about 100 years zzso This stressful situation should be over for the recent zzso zzso since the viruses seem to be adapted already to the new host in that the most recent zzso least in northern zzso genetically stable and seem to have lost the putative zzso zzso zzso
