zzso zzso is an enteric human pathogen but is widespread in the zzso zzso is determined by a number of zzso factors, including the zzso zzso zzso the zzso island zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso The presence of the 3 zzso factors varies among zzso zzso zzso We developed a zzso sequence typing zzso scheme to address the population structure of zzso zzso and the evolution of its zzso The seven zzso genes selected for zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso analysis of 83 zzso of zzso zzso representing 19 different zzso and six different genetic groups, identified 61 sequence types zzso and 12 zzso zzso Out of 26 zzso changes that occurred in the 12 zzso complexes, 13 were zzso events while 13 were zzso events, indicating that zzso and zzso contributed equally to the diversification of the zzso zzso The zzso were separated into 2 distinctive zzso A and zzso zzso A is the major zzso with 53 zzso (including zzso zzso zzso and is distributed worldwide, while cluster B is restricted to the Far zzso The zzso gene is widely distributed on the zzso tree, with zzso in cluster A and zzso in cluster zzso zzso is present in cluster A only but is sporadically absent in some cluster A zzso In contrast, an zzso is present only in a limited number of lineages and must be gained by lateral zzso Three zzso carry all 3 zzso factors and can be regarded as zzso zzso zzso from the same ST may not carry all 3 zzso factors, indicating frequent gain or loss of these zzso The differences in zzso among zzso zzso strains are likely due to the variable presence and instability of the zzso zzso
