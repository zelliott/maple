We report studies of the contribution of DNA structure, holding the sequence constant, to the affinity of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso for zzso We used zzso chains as models of known zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso protein zzso consensus zzso zzso and zzso response element zzso zzso in their free and zzso zzso The proteins were selected to provide examples in which the zzso binding site for the zzso is zzso or is not zzso covered by the zzso Additionally, peptides related to the zzso and zzso families, which have different zzso effects on their zzso sites, were zzso We observe that proteins of the zzso class, which induce a tendency to bend toward the minor groove at the center of the site, inhibit zzso sites located at the center of the free zzso or zzso DNA zzso In the case of zzso which does not induce DNA bending, there is no effect on zzso zzso of the zzso site, but we observe a zzso zzso of the cutting pattern in the zzso zzso This effect may arise from either a subtle local zzso zzso not accompanied by zzso or a localized reduction in DNA zzso Whereas zzso binding is not inhibited by the zzso zzso binding of zzso to its DNA target is significantly zzso and zzso cutting of DNA at the center of the zzso complex site is strongly reduced by protein zzso This result probably reflects zzso zzso of drug binding by the zzso
