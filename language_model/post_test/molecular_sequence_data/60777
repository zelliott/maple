The negative signaling zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso resides primarily in zzso compartments such as the zzso apparatus of T zzso However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that influence this zzso In this study, we demonstrate binding of the zzso zzso complex zzso with the zzso motif of the zzso domain of zzso zzso occurred primarily in the zzso compartment of T cells, unlike with zzso binding that occurs mostly with cell surface zzso Although evidence was not found to zzso zzso binding in the retention of zzso in the zzso zzso appears to play a role in shuttling of excess zzso from the zzso to the zzso compartments for zzso In support of this, increased zzso synthesis resulted in an increase in zzso binding and a zzso increase in the appearance of zzso in the zzso zzso At the same time, the level of zzso zzso was maintained at a constant level, suggesting that zzso binding represents one mechanism to ensure steady state levels of zzso zzso in T zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso complex (but not zzso also binds to zzso and zzso complexes, thus providing a possible link between these two receptors in the regulation of T cell zzso
