Along the green lineage zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are mainly zzso transmitted and their evolution is thus zzso The mode of zzso inheritance in their zzso is less zzso The inability to make clear zzso zzso is partly due to a lack of information for deep branching organisms in this zzso Here, we investigate zzso evolution in the early branching green zzso zzso zzso using population zzso data from the complete zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure is consistent with zzso evolution in zzso while we find evidence for zzso in the zzso zzso The number of zzso events in the zzso of the zzso suggests that zzso and thus zzso zzso is not zzso zzso with the evidence of zzso we find that the ratio of the number of zzso to the synonymous zzso per site is lower in zzso than in the zzso zzso We also find evidence for the segregation of two selfish genetic elements in the zzso These results shed light on the role of zzso and the evolutionary history of zzso inheritance in the green zzso
