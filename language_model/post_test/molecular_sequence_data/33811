zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso and is arguably the most important zzso disease affecting sheep in the zzso The disease is highly contagious and causes and considerable zzso and irritation and is therefore a major welfare zzso Current methods of treatment are zzso and in order to zzso novel methods of disease control a more comprehensive understanding of the zzso is zzso To date, no full zzso DNA sequence or large scale transcript zzso are available and prior to this study only 484 zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were accessible in public zzso 

In order to further expand upon the zzso coverage of zzso zzso thus zzso novel insights into the zzso biology we undertook a larger scale zzso approach, incorporating newly generated and previously described zzso zzso transcript data and representing the largest collection of zzso zzso zzso to zzso We zzso zzso zzso and assembled these along with 484 previously generated zzso zzso zzso which resulted in the identification of zzso unique zzso zzso zzso zzso searches identified 961 zzso with significant hits zzso zzso zzso and zzso novel zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso analysis allowed the functional zzso of 880 zzso and included predictions of signal zzso and zzso zzso allowing the identification of potential zzso zzso zzso factors, and mapping of zzso zzso 

This zzso currently represents the largest collection of zzso zzso zzso all of which are publicly available in the zzso zzso database zzso zzso numbers zzso - zzso zzso analysis of this zzso identified important zzso including house dust zzso zzso and tick zzso zzso These findings offer new insights into the underlying biology of zzso zzso zzso further investigations into zzso biology and the identification of novel methods of zzso
