The molten zzso state of zzso zzso is more stable than that of zzso and is stabilized by zzso zzso interactions and zzso zzso zzso We constructed a zzso protein which is produced by replacing the flexible loop zzso zzso in human zzso with the zzso D zzso zzso in zzso zzso to investigate the possible role of the zzso D for the high stability and zzso packing interaction in the molten zzso state of zzso zzso The stability of the molten zzso state formed by the zzso protein to zzso zzso unfolding is the same as that of zzso zzso and is substantially greater than that of human zzso although only six zzso come from zzso zzso Our results also suggest that the non-native interaction in the molten zzso state of zzso changes to the zzso packing interaction due to zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso in the molten zzso state of the zzso protein is similar to that in the molten zzso state of zzso zzso in which packing interaction around the zzso zzso in the native state is partially zzso zzso the zzso D in zzso zzso is one of the contributing factors to the high stability and zzso packing interaction in the molten zzso state of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso packing interaction can stabilize the zzso intermediate which is stabilized by the zzso zzso zzso
