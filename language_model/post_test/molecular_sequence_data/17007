The minimum zzso structure required for binding to the potent zzso protein zzso zzso was determined by zzso difference zzso zzso zzso Despite the low molecular mass of the protein (11 zzso zzso zzso allowed the precise atomic mapping of the interactions between zzso and various zzso and zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso on the zzso viral surface zzso zzso Contacts with zzso containing the terminal zzso unit of zzso were observed, while zzso and zzso zzso and zzso showed no zzso demonstrating that the terminal zzso structure plays a key role in the zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that, for zzso zzso and zzso the protein is in close contact with zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso terminal zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso complex was markedly different, with zzso on all sugar units displaying equal enhancements, suggesting that zzso is able to discriminate between the three structurally related zzso
