Renal cell zzso is resistant to chemotherapy and zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression could significantly increase the zzso in zzso cell zzso To further investigate the function of zzso in zzso resistance to zzso a stable zzso zzso cell line was zzso zzso of zzso led to significant growth suppression in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso and zzso zzso zzso with low zzso expression accumulated more strongly in the G zzso phase after treatment with chemotherapy and zzso The Human Cell zzso and DNA zzso Signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed and 3 genes zzso and 16 genes zzso after zzso zzso were zzso zzso gene grouping showed that genes involved in the M phase, S phase and DNA replication did not differ between the two cell zzso G 1 phase related genes zzso zzso zzso were zzso and G zzso checkpoint genes zzso zzso and zzso were strongly reduced by zzso zzso DNA zzso genes zzso zzso were significantly zzso The results prove that zzso of zzso in human zzso is associated with the zzso zzso of zzso might be a potential strategy to sensitize zzso to chemotherapy and zzso
