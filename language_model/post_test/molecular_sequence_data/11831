The differences in zzso specificity between zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso and human zzso virus zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso Various zzso zzso which are predicted to form the zzso binding site of zzso zzso were replaced by the equivalent ones in zzso and zzso zzso The expressed zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso indicates the zzso zzso and a series of zzso containing single zzso acid zzso in positions zzso to zzso zzso at the predicted zzso zzso of zzso zzso have a strong influence on the zzso specificity of this zzso as observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso at the zzso region of zzso zzso often rendered zzso with low activity zzso zzso Three zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the major zzso of the differences in zzso specificity between zzso and zzso zzso
