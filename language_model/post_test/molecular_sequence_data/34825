It has long been hypothesized that the visual systems of animals are zzso adapted to their visual zzso The entrance many millions of years ago of zzso into the sea gave these new aquatic zzso completely novel visual surroundings with respect to light availability and zzso zzso This study examines the cone zzso of marine zzso zzso based on previous studies zzso et zzso zzso and zzso & Dizon zzso that the zzso marine zzso would not have color vision because the pressure to maintain color vision in the dark zzso ocean environment has been zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cone zzso genes from two orders zzso and zzso and an additional zzso zzso of aquatic zzso were amplified from zzso DNA (for zzso and zzso (for zzso by zzso zzso and zzso All animals studied from the order zzso have zzso zzso whereas a representative from the order zzso has an intact zzso zzso for which the corresponding zzso was found in the zzso One of the zzso studied zzso zzso has an zzso zzso while another species zzso zzso appeared to have an intact zzso zzso However, no zzso cone zzso zzso was found in the harbor seal zzso suggesting a promoter or zzso site zzso preventing zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso from the different species were expressed in zzso cells and zzso with the zzso zzso in order to determine zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The deeper dwelling zzso species had blue shifted zzso values compared to zzso aquatic zzso Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that in the zzso oceanic habitat, the pressure to maintain color vision has been relaxed and zzso are retained in the zzso zzso resulting in zzso Additionally, zzso zzso are retained in the zzso and, in zzso animals, are blue shifted in zzso
