In this report we describe the organization of the respiratory zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its consequences for zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is of special interest since zzso zzso is its only zzso zzso of the zzso gene and production of active zzso is not possible in zzso coli because this zzso is unable to supply the required complex zzso zzso To investigate the zzso mechanism and binding of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso and to ensure sufficient production and incorporation of the complex zzso we designed a system for zzso expression in zzso zzso
