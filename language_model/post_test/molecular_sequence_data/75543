Three promoters direct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are used during the exponential growth phase, whereas zzso is used only during the stationary zzso We examined the use of these promoters in zzso plasmids and found that expression from zzso was prevented by a zzso in zzso which encodes the secondary zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently and accurately used the zzso promoter in zzso zzso this zzso which is essential for exponential growth, is transcribed during the early phase of zzso by this secondary form of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of the zzso promoter and the zzso promoter, which also is used by zzso zzso zzso revealed sequences at the zzso and zzso regions of these promoters that may signal recognition of promoters by zzso zzso zzso
