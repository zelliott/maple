zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso has seen increasing use for analysis of zzso protein zzso for zzso zzso zzso However, there is no commonly accepted zzso for this purpose beyond the use of zzso zzso whose zzso zzso span a lower zzso zzso zzso 

We have used the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso mode for the purpose of zzso zzso The average zzso values of zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso The quality of the zzso was assessed from the observed zzso zzso mass error of zzso of the zzso protein from an zzso bacterial cell zzso of zzso coli zzso as well as from zzso of bovine zzso The zzso zzso mass errors of these two zzso were also used to assess instrument zzso using the zzso zzso zzso of zzso B zzso 

A general improvement in zzso zzso mass accuracy was observed using the zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso which resulted in a more significant zzso zzso identification of these zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso may be useful as a zzso for zzso of small and zzso protein zzso The uniform fragmentation efficiency of zzso across its sequence suggests that it may be useful as a zzso standard to assess zzso instrument performance as well as establishing appropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
