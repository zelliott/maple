The zzso zzso zzso was selected as model zzso in order to understand the zzso features of the zzso loop of zzso disease virus zzso A throughout exploration of the zzso space has been carried out by means of molecular dynamics zzso and energy zzso The calculations have been carried out using the zzso force zzso zzso effects have been included by an effective zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso The lowest energy zzso presents a secondary structure constituted by an zzso at the zzso end followed by two zzso in the central zzso The rest of the accessible zzso found present also a high tendency to form zzso Finally, a 100 zzso MD trajectory calculation at zzso K suggest a stability of the secondary structure elements of the lowest energy zzso
