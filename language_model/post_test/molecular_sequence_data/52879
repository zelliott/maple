The high degree of structural order inside the nucleus suggests the existence of an internal zzso Our studies on the east gene of zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus as a model, demonstrate the involvement of an zzso nuclear structure in modulating nuclear zzso zzso a novel ubiquitous zzso the product of the east zzso adult sensory zzso zzso is localized to an zzso domain of the zzso Nuclear levels of EAST are increased in response to heat zzso zzso in nuclear zzso whether caused by heat shock or by transgenic zzso results in the expansion of the zzso domain zzso by zzso with a zzso increase in the spacing between zzso Moreover, EAST functions to promote the preferential zzso of the proteins zzso and zzso in zzso regions of the zzso We propose that EAST mediates the assembly of an zzso nuclear zzso which, through zzso of its volume, can zzso the spatial arrangement of zzso
