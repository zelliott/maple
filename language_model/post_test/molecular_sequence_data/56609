We present evidence for the existence of a conservative zzso zzso system in zzso by demonstrating zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso DNA with the host zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso The putative zzso gene of zzso was expressed in zzso coli yielding a protein of about 39 zzso This protein alone efficiently zzso linear DNA zzso containing zzso zzso and viral zzso attachment zzso zzso with either zzso or positively zzso zzso DNA was less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also promoted by the zzso zzso The zzso 44 zzso zzso attachment zzso present in all zzso sites contained sufficient information to allow zzso whilst the zzso sequences zzso the zzso These features clearly distinguish the zzso zzso zzso system from others and make it suitable for the study of regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso interaction and investigations of the evolution of the zzso zzso
