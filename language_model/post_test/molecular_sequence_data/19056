zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso repair, although its role in this process is not well zzso Here we show that zzso coli zzso binds zzso zzso during zzso zzso and, using its zzso activity, forces zzso zzso to slide backward along zzso By inducing zzso zzso exposes DNA zzso zzso by blocked zzso zzso allowing zzso zzso repair zzso to gain access to sites of zzso Our results establish zzso as a bona fide zzso zzso factor that contributes to zzso integrity by resolving conflicts between zzso and DNA repair zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso factor zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso to DNA repair by promoting backtracking and recruiting zzso zzso repair zzso to exposed zzso Because backtracking is a shared feature of all cellular zzso zzso we propose that this mechanism enables zzso zzso to function as global DNA damage scanners in bacteria and zzso
