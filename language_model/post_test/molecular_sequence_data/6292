zzso zzso type II is a highly specific zzso zzso that has the ability to remove zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso or very closely related zzso or zzso zzso In this paper we report on the zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso activity from the zzso zzso of bovine zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso nearly zzso by a combination of conventional column zzso steps with a zzso of zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso showed the activity to be an integral membrane zzso This zzso zzso zzso activity was found to have a relative molecular mass of 240 zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis on a zzso zzso column showed that the zzso activity displayed a very narrow zzso specificity zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso or the very closely related zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and had a zzso of 100 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso but showed less sensitivity to zzso It also showed some zzso by zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso In zzso we have zzso a zzso zzso from the zzso membrane of bovine zzso This zzso displays characteristics consistent with it being classified as a zzso type II zzso with only minor differences from other zzso in this zzso
