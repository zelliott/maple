zzso zzso zzso is a member of a large family of zzso transfer zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in certain zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso groups but does not appear to be present in zzso To probe the early evolution of zzso zzso we have amplified the zzso for zzso from three zzso and from the zzso sponge zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis using maximum likelihood of these zzso and sponge zzso with other AK sequences revealed that the AK from the zzso zzso zzso clusters with the AK from the glass sponge zzso and is part of a larger cluster containing zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a distinct cluster apart from all other AK zzso zzso searches of the recently released zzso zzso zzso database showed that this species has three unique AK zzso virtually identical to the zzso zzso zzso and the other two showing great similarity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three distinct AK genes are likely present in zzso Two of these zzso display extensive similarity to both zzso and an AK from zzso Previous work has shown zzso evolved from an zzso zzso prior to the divergence of zzso The present results provide evidence suggesting that the initial gene zzso zzso leading to the zzso lineage may have occurred before the divergence of the zzso and animal zzso
