The zzso zzso which is altered or deleted in patients with zzso zzso disease, encodes the small protein zzso (for zzso zzso that is expressed in T and zzso zzso A zzso zzso in close proximity to an zzso site was defined as the zzso promoter of mouse zzso and a highly zzso zzso segment was defined as the human zzso zzso When an zzso consensus site was zzso no reporter activity was zzso zzso mobility zzso zzso revealed that the two zzso factors zzso and zzso bind to the human and mouse zzso The involvement of zzso and zzso in expression of zzso was functionally confirmed by zzso studies of their zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso very rapidly in mouse T cells, and its 3' untranslated region zzso has zzso activity in zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso As judged by zzso mobility shift zzso this rapid degradation of zzso zzso was due to a balance in binding of the factors zzso and zzso to its 3' zzso Although the zzso zzso level decreased upon triggering of the T cell zzso zzso the zzso degradation rate itself was not altered by zzso zzso
