zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence showed that a 22 zzso protein which is unique in the zzso fraction is an unidentified protein zzso in the open reading frame zzso and shows a zzso with the zzso protein zzso of zzso We named this protein zzso (for the zzso protein zzso zzso of each fraction with an zzso zzso during the zzso isolation showed that zzso is highly concentrated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso is localized to zzso in zzso and a significant amount of zzso is associated with the zzso On the other hand, Northern zzso showed that a large amount of large and small zzso zzso zzso was not associated with the zzso and remained in the zzso after the isolation of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso led to a zzso zzso but the zzso of the zzso in the zzso carrying the zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest that a significant amount of zzso plays a role as a major component of the zzso
