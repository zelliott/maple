In our search for zzso factors induced by zzso we have analyzed immediate early gene zzso in a model of zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso of early growth response zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factors responsible for its zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso increased zzso 1 h after zzso zzso accompanied by a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso induction appeared not to be related to proliferation since it was amplified in zzso zzso at a time when cells were zzso to zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso 1 zzso of the zzso promoter revealed that a zzso region zzso to zzso contributes about zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells and approximately zzso zzso in zzso zzso This region contains three juxtaposed zzso zzso response zzso site pairs known to be important for zzso activity in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso and zzso sites within this region each reduced zzso zzso of the zzso Use of these zzso zzso in zzso showed that disruption of either zzso or zzso sites zzso zzso complex formation at the composite zzso DNA binding of zzso complexes, but not zzso complexes, in zzso was rapidly and zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso indicated these zzso complexes contained serum response factor zzso and the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in a marked increase in zzso induction of zzso promoter activity, although zzso with expression zzso for either zzso factor alone did not significantly enhance the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stimulates zzso of zzso primarily through zzso of these zzso factors at multiple sites on the promoter and that stabilization of zzso complexes with zzso at these sites zzso this zzso
