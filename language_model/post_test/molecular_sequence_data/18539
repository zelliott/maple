Animals deploy various molecular sensors to detect pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins identify viral zzso and initiate innate immune zzso The three human zzso recognize different types of zzso molecules and protect against different viral zzso The zzso protein family is widely thought to have originated shortly before the emergence of zzso and rapidly diversified through a complex process of domain zzso zzso to these findings, here we show that full-length zzso and their downstream signaling molecules were present in the earliest animals, suggesting that the zzso immune system arose with the emergence of zzso zzso differentiation of zzso occurred early in animal evolution via simple gene zzso followed by modifications of the zzso pocket, many of which may have been zzso zzso zzso analysis of human and ancestral zzso revealed that the ancestral zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso binding arose through changes in the zzso pocket following the zzso of the ancestral zzso which may have occurred either early in zzso or later, after zzso split from zzso The sensitivity and specificity with which zzso bind different zzso structures has repeatedly adapted throughout zzso evolution, suggesting a long-term evolutionary arms race with viral zzso or other zzso
