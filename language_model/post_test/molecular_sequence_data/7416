We are characterizing the alternatively spliced human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts expressed by human zzso zzso zzso coupled to the zzso chain reaction zzso has been used to identify four alternatively spliced zzso that differ in the region joining the two zzso zzso Two of the transcripts represent previously reported zzso zzso differentiated by the presence zzso or absence zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which in the rat produce functionally distinct zzso Different zzso represent two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that show the presence of an zzso zzso for zzso in any other zzso This new zzso designated zzso C, is 54 zzso in zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso processing zzso and is located 3' of zzso A in human zzso zzso We propose that zzso regulation of zzso zzso would provide a mechanism for control of zzso zzso by these zzso of the zzso zzso
