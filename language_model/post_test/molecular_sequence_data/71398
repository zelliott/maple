We have isolated zzso representing more than 50 different genes from libraries of zzso egg cells and zzso of zzso expression of which is zzso or zzso after in zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso isolated are seven which zzso proteins that are probably involved in translation and two zzso proteins probably involved in DNA zzso The latter genes are strongly induced on zzso This indicates that zzso gene zzso zzso - the switch from maternal to embryonic control of development - occurs in the zzso shortly after zzso in higher plants - earlier than in animal systems so far zzso Four novel transcripts for zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and translation were zzso in more zzso The expression of all four genes zzso with cell division activity and is strongly induced during the zzso phase of the zzso cell zzso A different mode of regulation operates in the first embryonic cell zzso relatively large amounts of transcript are stored in the zzso egg cells, and by 18 h after zzso two zzso genes are induced while a third is zzso These results indicate that using the combination of zzso culture techniques with novel molecular methods, it is possible to isolate and study numerous genes expressed in female zzso and zzso of higher zzso The detailed analysis of the four zzso protein genes demonstrates that the zzso and zzso cell cycles are zzso zzso
