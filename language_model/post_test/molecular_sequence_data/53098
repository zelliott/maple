We have investigated the zzso in chimpanzees of twelve synthetic peptides derived from four new zzso zzso molecules expressed at zzso stages of the human malaria zzso These zzso molecules were initially selected through their ability to be recognized by stage restricted human zzso Twelve zzso to zzso peptides representing potential human zzso or zzso zzso were selected from these zzso and zzso Six of these were modified by a zzso zzso chain in order to zzso their zzso Strong zzso and zzso cell responses were induced in chimpanzees by zzso injected without zzso and by peptides in zzso All twelve peptides induced zzso zzso zzso responses, as well as the zzso of zzso zzso of them at very high zzso and zzso peptides induced zzso zzso The immune responses zzso in this way were zzso with native zzso zzso as shown by recall studies with zzso stage zzso and proved to be long-lasting (up to 10 months after zzso Our results support the strategy employed to select these four new zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso are both efficient and clinically zzso
