zzso E is a key regulatory zzso that controls the principal zzso for zzso degradation in zzso zzso The cellular concentration of this zzso is governed by a feedback mechanism in which zzso E tightly regulates its own zzso zzso is zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the determination of the secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso comparison and chemical zzso together with dissection studies to identify the zzso zzso element that mediates zzso Our findings reveal that the structure and function of the zzso zzso zzso are zzso well zzso despite extensive sequence zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso are multiple zzso secondary structure zzso two of which function in zzso to mediate feedback regulation of zzso gene zzso The more potent of these two elements is a zzso structure containing an internal loop whose sequence is the most highly zzso of any region of the zzso zzso zzso Our data show that this zzso functions as a sensor of cellular zzso E activity that directs zzso by modulating the degradation rate of zzso zzso in response to changes in zzso E zzso
