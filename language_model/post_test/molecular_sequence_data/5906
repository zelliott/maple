zzso zzso is a gastrointestinal pathogen of humans and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that zzso on zzso zzso resistance to serum killing and the ability to attach to and invade cells in zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso is regulated by temperature and growth zzso In stationary phase, zzso transcript is only detected when bacteria are grown at the host temperature of 37 degrees zzso Our laboratory previously described a group of zzso zzso which expressed zzso in stationary phase at 28 degrees zzso In one of these zzso zzso zzso the zzso 10 inserted into a gene zzso a protein with zzso identity to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso in stationary phase at 28 degrees C was also zzso in a directed zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso transcripts in the zzso and zzso zzso strains indicated that there is a single start site of zzso of zzso and that the effect of the zzso zzso was on the initiation of zzso at this zzso Similar to zzso coli, a zzso zzso was identified downstream of zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of both zzso transcript levels and cell zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso has a role in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
