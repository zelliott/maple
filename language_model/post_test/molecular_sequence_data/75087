A zzso zzso I zzso of the DNA of the zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene of zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been zzso The 3' regions of the zzso and zzso coding sequences show considerable zzso sequence zzso and the zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of these zzso are quite zzso 73 of the zzso 142 zzso acid zzso are zzso and of the 69 zzso 55 are zzso Comparisons between zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso of the fungus zzso zzso (an zzso that also degrades the zzso cell wall) strongly suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso and of the zzso might be responsible for the specific recognition of zzso cell walls, as well as for the zzso zzso of the zzso activity of these zzso by the zzso zzso acid or by high zzso of zzso In addition, the active center of these zzso should be located in their zzso zzso Our results suggest an evolutionary relationship between zzso and host zzso
