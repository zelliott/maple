Human zzso virus type 1 zzso long terminal repeat zzso sequences were characterized from six zzso pairs following vertical zzso The zzso sequences exhibited a low degree of zzso within mothers, within zzso and between zzso linked zzso zzso However, zzso sequences were more zzso between zzso zzso individuals compared with linked zzso zzso These data were further supported by low estimates of genetic diversity and zzso of each zzso pair's sequences into a separate zzso as well as the presence of common signature sequences between zzso zzso The functional zzso essential for zzso zzso function, including the promoter zzso enhancers (three zzso and two zzso the zzso regions zzso zzso sites, two zzso one zzso site, one zzso and one zzso and the zzso region were generally zzso among zzso zzso Taken together, limited zzso and conservation of functional zzso in the zzso following vertical transmission support the notion that a functional zzso is critical in viral replication and zzso in zzso mothers and their infected zzso
