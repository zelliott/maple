We report on the interactions of alfalfa with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A hypersensitive response was observed when leaves were infiltrated with zzso zzso zzso zzso which remained strictly limited to the injected zzso The compatible interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized by zzso symptoms and the spreading of the zzso into the leaf zzso zzso of transcript zzso were conducted with zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In incompatible interactions the maximum zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso transcripts was observed 6 zzso zzso In the compatible interaction, the induction of these transcripts was delayed until zzso zzso zzso and the level of their zzso was considerably zzso zzso this molecular analysis to the root system showed that the reaction of roots during an incompatible interaction was quite comparable to that of zzso To complete these zzso expression of genes zzso zzso zzso proteins in leaves was also analyzed by zzso chain zzso zzso zzso of a zzso transcript zzso a zzso protein was observed 6 to 30 zzso zzso in the incompatible zzso
