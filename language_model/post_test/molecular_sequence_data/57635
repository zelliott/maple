The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes an zzso whose zzso of the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso virus major coat protein zzso is necessary for viral zzso We show that the first 4 zzso acids of the zzso gag protein zzso zzso are a portable signal for zzso zzso by zzso zzso acids 2, 3, and 4 are each important for zzso by the zzso zzso In zzso cells, only three zzso proteins are known to have the zzso zzso zzso suggesting an explanation for the slow growth of zzso zzso on zzso carbon zzso
