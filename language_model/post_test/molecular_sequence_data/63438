To construct a zzso expression zzso for the small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso targeting zzso gene was designed according to the sequence of zzso zzso available in zzso Three zzso sequences were zzso and the corresponding zzso were zzso and inserted into zzso zzso for constructing the zzso zzso which were transformed into zzso zzso zzso The zzso after identification by zzso and DNA sequencing, were zzso into zzso cell line via zzso and the zzso and protein expressions of zzso gene in the cells were determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso 

Three zzso plasmids were identified by zzso and sequence analysis, the results of which showed correct zzso of the designed sequences in the zzso zzso and Western zzso showed substantially decreased zzso and protein expressions of zzso gene in the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso expressing the zzso targeting zzso gene has been successfully constructed, which provides the basis for studying zzso interference of the zzso zzso
