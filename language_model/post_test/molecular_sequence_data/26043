The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso (also known as zzso zzso 1), a zzso acid zzso with two novel finger zzso of the zzso zzso recognizes a consensus zzso motif present in zzso elements of the majority of zzso zzso We have performed a zzso analysis of this protein to evaluate its potential as a zzso zzso and to examine the role of the finger zzso in DNA zzso Using a zzso zzso we find that zzso is a potent zzso zzso with several zzso zzso but that this is revealed only in zzso cells and with reporters containing minimal promoters onto which either a single or multiple zzso sites are zzso The two fingers of zzso are functionally distinct and cooperate to achieve specific, stable DNA zzso The zzso finger is necessary only for full specificity and stability of zzso whereas the zzso finger is required for zzso The role of each finger is more pronounced with some zzso sites than with others, suggesting a diversity of interactions between zzso and different target zzso The complex zzso and zzso properties of zzso are likely to contribute to the ability of this single protein to participate widely in gene expression throughout zzso zzso
