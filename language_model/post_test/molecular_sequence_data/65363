zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the assembly of the plasma zzso zzso While the human zzso contains a single copy of the zzso zzso 3 copies exist in the rat (1 zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso Here, we confirm that the mouse zzso contains 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and demonstrate that these genes are expressed in a zzso zzso To determine the roles of these genes in zzso development and zzso we disrupted zzso which is expressed primarily in the zzso zzso mice were viable, but lacked plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso a novel zzso zzso that lacks zzso domain zzso Moreover, despite normal tail vein bleeding times, zzso mice displayed a significantly prolonged time to carotid artery zzso following Rose Bengal administration and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a single zzso zzso is responsible for production of plasma zzso and that plasma zzso contributes to induced zzso zzso in zzso
