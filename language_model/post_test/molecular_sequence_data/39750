Analysis of protein zzso within the zzso zzso zzso has revealed an abundant and zzso set of core zzso modifications zzso to zzso zzso With zzso release, an array of zzso and zzso were detected with zzso extensions on the 3- and zzso of the penultimate and reducing zzso zzso A full complement of structures includes a range of zzso possessing a zzso zzso at the 3- and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release failed to liberate many of these extended structures from reduced and zzso peptides and, as a consequence, such profiles were markedly deficient in a representation of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso was notably resistant to a range of commercial zzso For zzso the fragments were zzso with synthetic products and library standards using sequential mass zzso zzso A zzso observed at the zzso of penultimate zzso indicating a zzso branch on some structures, was not further characterized because of low zzso abundance in zzso Additionally, a zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso was also distinguished on select zzso Similar branch extensions on zzso core zzso zzso have recently been reported among other zzso Natural zzso and numerous zzso complement the zzso which totals well over 100 individual zzso Complex zzso were detected at lower zzso indicating zzso zzso and zzso zzso A range of zzso zzso complex zzso were also confirmed following a signature zzso loss of PC during zzso analysis, although the precursor zzso was not observed in the mass zzso In a similar manner, numerous other minor zzso may be present but zzso in zzso profiles dominated by zzso zzso All zzso structures, including multiple zzso were determined without zzso by zzso zzso zzso in Paul and linear zzso trap zzso zzso
