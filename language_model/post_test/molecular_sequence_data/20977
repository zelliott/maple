The zzso zzso factor (also known as zzso is required for development of zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso and zzso Presumably, zzso regulates the expression of multiple genes required for expansion and differentiation of these zzso cell zzso However, only a few genes regulated by zzso have been zzso In the present studies we have identified zzso I zzso as a target gene for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have provided evidence that zzso binds close to the zzso zzso that contains the initiation zzso Although this zzso has previously been considered to be located far from the zzso initiation site, transcript mapping in zzso cells indicates that zzso zzso synthesis is initiated close to the mapped zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using a short hairpin zzso zzso have provided evidence that zzso plays a role in stimulating expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with a zzso reporter gene are consistent with the presence of an zzso zzso promoter in the zzso zzso In zzso binding studies have provided further evidence for a zzso site within this region of the zzso zzso zzso the studies provide evidence that zzso is a target gene regulated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Because zzso has been extensively studied as an important zzso of zzso signaling in regulated zzso it seems likely that zzso of zzso gene expression is part of a mechanism zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
