The zzso zzso protein zzso is a typical representative of a zzso of zzso molecular zzso with characteristic structural and functional features, one of which is the location of two zzso zzso zzso close to the putative binding zzso We show that these zzso form a zzso bond, the reduction and zzso of which significantly increases the zzso constant of the zzso (where Caf 1 is a zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso a zzso of zzso M for the intact protein to one of zzso M for the modified zzso The importance of the zzso bond for the formation of functional zzso in zzso was demonstrated using an zzso coli zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso In accordance with the CD and zzso zzso the zzso bond is not important for maintenance of the overall structure of the zzso zzso but would appear to affect the fine structural properties of the zzso binding zzso A three-dimensional model of the zzso complex was designed based on the published crystal structure of zzso (a zzso required for Pap zzso zzso zzso with a zzso corresponding to the zzso of the zzso zzso In the model the zzso bond is in close proximity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are assumed to anchor the zzso group of the zzso The importance of this characteristic zzso bond for the orchestration of the binding site and zzso zzso as well as for the folding of the protein in zzso is likely to be a common feature of this zzso of zzso zzso A possible model for the role of the zzso bond in zzso assembly is zzso
