The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II in zzso coli, is a member of the zzso zzso which is induced by zzso zzso By evaluating zzso expression driven by the zzso promoter carrying different lengths of upstream region in a zzso we found that the zzso element resides between 56 and 94 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso zzso protein bound to this region and protected zzso between positions zzso and zzso from degradation by zzso zzso This region contains a putative zzso sequence zzso in reverse zzso The zzso protein zzso specifically with four zzso zzso within the zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso interference zzso These results clearly indicate that zzso binds to the reversed zzso sequence in the zzso zzso while in other known genes of the zzso zzso it binds to the normally oriented zzso zzso modes of interaction between zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
