Four novel zzso toxins that act on zzso sodium channels have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso from zzso zzso The pharmacological profiles of these new toxins were characterized by zzso zzso on six cloned zzso sodium channel zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These novel toxins zzso zzso sodium channels with properties similar to those of typical zzso zzso both by causing a zzso shift in gating zzso and by blocking the inward component of the sodium zzso zzso is one of the most potent zzso zzso of zzso sodium channels described thus far from zzso zzso modulating zzso with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differing by only one zzso acid, are potent zzso of different zzso sodium channel zzso from the central nervous system, except for zzso which is only affected by zzso The potency of zzso is lower, although this toxin seems to be more selective for the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso In addition to these results, molecular modeling indicates that subtle differences in toxin surfaces may relate to their different pharmacological zzso Furthermore, an evolutionary trace analysis of these toxins and other structurally related zzso zzso toxins provides clues for the exploration of zzso interaction and future zzso zzso
