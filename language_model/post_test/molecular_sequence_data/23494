zzso of the integrated zzso zzso zzso is an essential step in the zzso life cycle and thus an appealing target for zzso intervention to restrict zzso zzso A fundamental role in this process is exerted by the viral protein zzso a powerful zzso of viral gene zzso This protein binds a structured zzso sequence at the zzso of all nascent viral zzso and promotes zzso by zzso the recruitment to the viral promoter of cellular factors required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to these zzso activities, zzso is released from the cells and enters zzso cells when present in the zzso environment, a process that is possibly involved in zzso disease zzso Given its zzso functions, the protein represents a highly appealing target for drug zzso Here I will zzso the known molecular mechanisms by which zzso exerts its activities and review the currently available compounds that interfere with the process of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
