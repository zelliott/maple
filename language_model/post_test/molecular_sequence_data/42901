zzso study of the zzso and evolution of the complement system has always been hampered by the difficulties involved in functional zzso These tests rely on the zzso of the components from different zzso Whereas all zzso species appear to have almost identical classical, alternate and zzso zzso zzso zzso show minor zzso The source of the zzso zzso used to demonstrate classical zzso zzso has also been shown to be zzso The use of zzso directed against complement components has been beneficial in the study of zzso but zzso with zzso proteins limited their zzso The isolation and zzso of complement components and the zzso zzso including zzso acid analysis and zzso sequencing resulted in an enormous increase in our knowledge of the evolution of the complement zzso zzso acid sequence analysis together with gene cloning of all human complement components finally revealed a number of zzso unknown features concerning the domain structure of the components and the relation of certain motifs and repeats to other zzso The use of zzso zzso in Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA from various species enabled an extension of our scope of the zzso of zzso In this article we summarized the data on the zzso and evolution of the first component of complement and the associated zzso We provide evidence for the conservation of the classical zzso and zzso in particular which appears to zzso the divergence of the zzso fish from the higher zzso The possibility that the classical zzso could zzso the alternate zzso is zzso
