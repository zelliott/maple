A gene zzso a putative membrane protein has been identified from zzso zzso zzso zzso following an zzso of a zzso zzso II zzso DNA library with zzso raised against zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the entire zzso insert revealed six open reading zzso all but one of which have sequence zzso in the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso protein was further identified by independent expression of these reading frames in zzso zzso The gene encodes an integral membrane zzso expression of which in zzso coli results in a profound zzso zzso
