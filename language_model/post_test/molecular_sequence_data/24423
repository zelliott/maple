We have identified and characterized by transient zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequence in the first zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, such as zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains one zzso sequence zzso termed the zzso box, and two zzso repeated zzso sequences zzso termed the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further zzso including zzso studies and zzso mobility shift zzso using a series of deletion and zzso zzso indicated that zzso a putative zzso may be required to predominate over its competition with another unknown putative zzso termed the zzso zzso factor, for binding to both the zzso box, which overlapped with the zzso zzso element, and the zzso zzso element in the zzso sequence in order to achieve a full zzso zzso We also discuss a possible mechanism underlying the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso
