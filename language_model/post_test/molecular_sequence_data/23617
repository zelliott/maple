The influence of the zzso ratio and energy depletion on zzso and degradation of the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso concentration of the zzso zzso and zzso was monitored while varying the number of cells at fixed zzso concentration and incubation volume, or changing the concentration and incubation volume at fixed cell zzso The zzso of zzso was shown to be dependent on the zzso zzso At given zzso concentration and incubation volume, the zzso concentration of zzso increased with lower cell zzso At given cell number, doubling of the incubation volume increased zzso zzso concentration to a similar extent as the doubling in incubation zzso From a practical view, this means that the zzso ratio has at least the same importance for the zzso of zzso as the used zzso zzso No influence of the zzso ratio was found for the cellular zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso or a zzso zzso zzso investigated in parallel for comparison zzso Energy depletion resulted in significantly reduced quantities of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that this difference is mainly due to a zzso zzso degradation product, which is lacking in zzso zzso The mechanism of its generation is not likely to be zzso degradation of zzso material, as it is not zzso or zzso
