A small zzso showing zzso activity was zzso from culture zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso This sequence identified a gene zzso zzso a protein zzso of 229 zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso in the zzso DNA sequence database of zzso zzso constructed by the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the zzso The predicted protein was composed of a zzso zzso domain and a zzso domain from its zzso The zzso gene was cloned into an expression zzso and expressed in an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso activity with zzso and zzso blue zzso The zzso was most active at pH zzso at 40 degrees zzso The zzso zzso spectrum and thin layer zzso (TLC) analyses indicated that one zzso zzso contained a tightly bound zzso zzso as a prosthetic zzso An iron zzso was also detected in an zzso zzso
