zzso zzso are critical for membrane zzso and zzso transport of certain zzso zzso zzso have a zzso zzso core bearing a zzso zzso zzso on the third zzso zzso through which the zzso is linked to zzso but diverse zzso precursors with zzso on zzso and zzso have also been zzso We report on two essential zzso genes whose products are required late in zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of human zzso a protein implicated in the addition of zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso but the rescued zzso are temperature zzso zzso of zzso or zzso function in zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso and formation of complete zzso precursors and leads to zzso of two zzso whose zzso head groups contain four zzso but differ in the positioning and number of side zzso probably zzso The less polar zzso bears zzso on zzso whereas the more polar zzso has zzso on zzso The latter finding indicates that zzso is not required for adding zzso to zzso zzso zzso a member of a family of zzso is a candidate for the zzso responsible for adding zzso to zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso strain prevents formation of the zzso bearing zzso on zzso and zzso strains accumulate a zzso zzso that bears zzso on zzso We further show that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells resembles that of cells lacking zzso a sequence zzso of zzso known to add zzso to zzso of a late-stage zzso zzso This result suggests that in zzso a zzso can affect zzso addition to zzso by zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso in zzso cells, which prevents zzso addition to zzso Because zzso and zzso affect zzso transfer to zzso and zzso respectively, these proteins may act in partnership with the zzso zzso although their involvement in a given zzso transfer reaction varies between zzso zzso roles for zzso in the supply of the zzso donor are zzso Because zzso and zzso cells accumulate zzso of zzso with zzso on zzso and on zzso respectively, and because the zzso that accumulate in zzso strains are likely to have been generated independently of one another, we propose that the zzso zzso assembly zzso is zzso
