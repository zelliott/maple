zzso proteins direct the nucleation and assembly of linear zzso filaments in a variety of cellular processes using their zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso of zzso zzso and in the absence of zzso zzso they are maintained in an inactive state by zzso interactions between their regulatory zzso region and a zzso segment referred to as the zzso zzso Although structures are available for the isolated zzso segment in complex with the interacting region in the zzso it remains unclear how this leads to zzso of zzso assembly by the zzso zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of the zzso regulatory region of zzso zzso in complex with a zzso zzso containing both the zzso and zzso zzso In the crystal structure and in solution, these fragments form a zzso complex composed of two interlocking zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is likely a consequence of the particular zzso construct zzso as we show that a nearly full-length zzso protein is zzso as are other zzso zzso complexes containing longer zzso zzso The structure provides the first view of the intact zzso of a zzso revealing the relationship of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of alternative zzso zzso interactions within the zzso provides two general models for zzso in intact zzso In both models, engagement of the zzso by the zzso is incompatible with zzso filament formation on the zzso and in one model the zzso binding surfaces of the zzso domain are directly blocked by the zzso
