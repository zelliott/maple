Several components of the zzso zzso zzso family of proteins allow the formation of the DNA repair complex zzso formed by proteins such as zzso and zzso Because the genes that participate in the DNA repair zzso have been described as zzso breast cancer zzso zzso we zzso that zzso in zzso genes could also be associated with sporadic breast cancer zzso We studied seven zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in a total of 897 consecutive and zzso sporadic breast cancer cases and zzso unaffected controls from the Spanish zzso We observed a statistically significant association with sporadic breast cancer for the zzso zzso zzso located on zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso analyses confirmed this association, where one zzso and pooled zzso carrying it were associated with more than zzso risk zzso and zzso zzso zzso for potential zzso zzso in zzso was performed, detecting one in the putative promoter region, which is located in a zzso zzso motif with consensus binding sites for some zzso factors, suggesting a functional zzso Our data indicate that a relationship between zzso and sporadic breast cancer risk may zzso
