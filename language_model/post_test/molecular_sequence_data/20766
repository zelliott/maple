A novel zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso system was established for the zzso degradation of zzso under mild zzso In this process, the environmentally acceptable and inexpensive molecular oxygen was first used as zzso the metal zzso was immobilized in zzso liquid as zzso and the zzso solution as medium carried the zzso and the zzso Under vigorous stirring and heating, the zzso fully contacted the zzso in the emulsion and zzso efficiently zzso into zzso zzso At the end of the reaction, the zzso system could be easily separated by simple zzso and could also be zzso in subsequent runs without apparent change in zzso These characters are in favor of the elimination of pollution and the reduction of the economic cost in the large-scale production of the zzso zzso derivatives in chemical zzso
