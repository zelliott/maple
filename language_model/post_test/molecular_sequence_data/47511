zzso zzso of the zzso fold are of great interest because they provide detailed understanding of their zzso properties and their proposed role in a number of zzso and pathological zzso We have been developing the zzso inhibitor zzso to be a zzso inhibitor that is selective for members of the zzso class of zzso zzso of zzso activity through the use of zzso and engineered zzso results in zzso of rat prostate differentiation and zzso of the growth of human zzso zzso cancer zzso In an effort to identify the zzso that may be involved in these zzso reverse zzso with zzso zzso zzso was performed by using zzso zzso zzso These zzso were designed by using zzso protein sequences unique to zzso zzso zzso Five zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso protein C, zzso IV, and a zzso that we refer to as zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso shows that it encodes a mosaic protein that contains a zzso signal anchor, two zzso zzso four zzso repeats, and a zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso shows broad expression of zzso in a variety of zzso zzso with high levels of expression in the human gastrointestinal tract and the zzso A zzso fusion of the zzso zzso domain was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso of the zzso activated zzso domain, suggesting a possible role for zzso in prostate differentiation and the growth of zzso zzso
