zzso is an zzso protein of the zzso recognition motif zzso class and, in zzso zzso is required for embryonic zzso In attempting to determine the function of human zzso we uncovered a zzso error in the published sequence to reveal that zzso is, in fact, zzso a recently described zzso zzso We then went on to show that zzso zzso in nuclear zzso and zzso supporting its potential role in zzso or zzso zzso zzso imaging of full-length and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso is crucial for targeting to zzso Unlike many other zzso factors, however, zzso does not contain an zzso or any other known targeting zzso zzso redistributed to zzso clusters upon the addition of a zzso zzso whereas other zzso factors display increased zzso to zzso in the absence of zzso This finding is consistent with the potential existence of a novel zzso targeting zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are the same zzso are localized in zzso and zzso but can zzso to zzso zzso consistent with a novel zzso zzso
