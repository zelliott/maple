To investigate the role that the individual zzso play in the zzso zzso activity of the zzso protein we have investigated the ability of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins to zzso various zzso zzso zzso to either end or to the zzso of an zzso 60 bases zzso The results show that the only zzso which can zzso the zzso in the absence of the other zzso is the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso is displaced only if it is zzso to the zzso at the zzso end or the middle, suggesting that the zzso protein zzso along the zzso in the 3' to zzso direction, zzso zzso zzso as it zzso We have shown that zzso zzso and zzso complexes zzso the zzso but, unlike zzso they do not require a zzso zzso region for zzso action, but can zzso the zzso from either end of the zzso The level of zzso activity of the zzso complex is considerably greater than that of zzso alone, and the activity of the zzso complex appears to be greater zzso This hierarchy of activity is also shown by DNA binding studies, but is not reflected in the zzso activities of the zzso We have also shown that the ability of zzso to cleave various sites on the zzso zzso is modified by the presence of zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso changes may be induced in zzso upon zzso zzso We discuss a model for the zzso zzso motion of the zzso zzso along zzso zzso In this model, the zzso zzso binds to zzso DNA and then zzso along it, one base at a time, in the 3' to zzso direction, by a zzso mechanism in which repeated stretching and contraction of the protein is coupled to zzso zzso The zzso protein in the zzso complex is proposed to act as a zzso zzso which increases zzso by preventing zzso
