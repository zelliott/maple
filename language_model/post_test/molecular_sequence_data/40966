The acquisition of zzso genes by zzso zzso has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in humans, and the gain of four zzso by zzso zzso is linked to the evolution of this zzso pathogen from an ancestral strain of the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso A recent study determined that the culture zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso strains possessed zzso activity but lacked known zzso zzso Here, we report the identification and activities of three novel zzso zzso The products of zzso zzso and zzso share zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and gamma zzso zzso production, in zzso Although none of these zzso genes were zzso within functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were located next to a zzso zzso suggesting that they were acquired by horizontal zzso Eighty-one of 165 diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso strains screened, including 7 out of 15 zzso from cases of disease in humans, contained at least one of these new zzso zzso The presence of zzso or zzso but not zzso was significantly associated with zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso population zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso We conclude that horizontal transfer of these novel zzso from and within the diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso population is likely to have implications for veterinary and human zzso
