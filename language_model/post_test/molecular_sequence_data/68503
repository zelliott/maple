zzso I is a zzso and zzso protein of synaptic zzso with an essential function in zzso zzso binding by zzso I may be zzso by its C2 zzso sequence motifs that have been implicated in the zzso regulation of a variety of zzso However, it is currently unknown if C2 zzso are sufficient for zzso binding or if they even directly participate in zzso zzso In order to address this question, we have studied the zzso properties of the first C2 domain of zzso zzso Our results show that this C2 domain by itself binds zzso and zzso with high affinity zzso binding at 4-6 zzso free zzso and exhibits strong positive zzso The C2 domain is specific for zzso charged zzso and for those zzso zzso that are known to stimulate synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies establish that C2 zzso can serve as independently folding zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso specificity and the zzso of zzso binding by the C2 domain from zzso I support a role for this protein in zzso the zzso signal in neurotransmitter zzso
