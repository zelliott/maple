A highly sensitive zzso based on zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso from the viral zzso of zzso viral zzso has been developed for plum pox zzso zzso zzso The reaction, called zzso zzso yields a specific zzso zzso The zzso step, by allowing the use of large sample volumes and by the viral particle zzso it zzso dramatically increases the sensitivity of the zzso As few as 8000 target viral particles per zzso of plant extract could be detected by zzso When compared to direct zzso zzso et zzso 1991), molecular zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso this result zzso to a zzso zzso and zzso increased sensitivity, zzso The high sensitivity of zzso was confirmed during an indexing trial with field samples collected from naturally infected zzso This very powerful technique should have wide ranging applications for the detection of a number of other viruses and pathogens for which specific zzso and sequence data are zzso
