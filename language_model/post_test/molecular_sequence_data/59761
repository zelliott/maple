zzso zzso systems must regulate the expression of their genes so that the zzso zzso is modified at all times by the zzso to protect the host cell from the potential lethal action of the zzso restriction zzso Since type I zzso systems can be transferred to zzso zzso coli cells by zzso or transformation without killing the recipient, they must have some means to regulate their restriction activity upon entering a new host cell to avoid restriction of unprotected host DNA and cell zzso This is especially true for zzso a type zzso family member, which is coded for by a zzso zzso Control of zzso restriction activity is most likely at the zzso level as the transfer of the zzso system into a recipient cell that already expressed the zzso zzso of this system was not a lethal zzso Additionally, the zzso of restriction activity upon transfer of the genes coding for the zzso zzso system to a recipient cell are the same, irrespective of the modification state of the recipient cell or the presence or absence of the zzso zzso zzso in the new host zzso The mechanism controlling the restriction activity of a type zzso zzso system upon transfer to a new host cell is different from that controlling the zzso coded type zzso and zzso zzso zzso The previously discovered zzso zzso which affects the establishment of the type zzso system zzso was shown to affect the establishment of the type zzso system zzso but to have no influence on zzso
