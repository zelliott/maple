We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediates robust functional responses in the absence of zzso This zzso active zzso was isolated from a library of receptors containing randomly introduced zzso in the sixth zzso domain and contains the zzso zzso 465 for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Although these individual zzso are not zzso in other zzso zzso they are predicted to be at the junction between the sixth zzso domain and the last zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was subjected to detailed pharmacological zzso All of the zzso tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fully suppressed both the zzso and zzso activities of zzso revealing that these zzso are negative zzso zzso zzso The potency of these zzso was similar at the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso binding site of this zzso is zzso The zzso had increased sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as measured both by functional response and by zzso zzso These effects are explained and predicted by a model in which the primary effect of the zzso is to alter a spontaneous equilibrium existing between the active and inactive states of the zzso
