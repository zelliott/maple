zzso leukemia factor zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso regulatory zzso We have characterized the rat zzso gene and studied its expression and zzso The rat zzso gene is transcribed from two alternative zzso alpha and zzso with different zzso zzso and tissue zzso The alpha zzso zzso produce a 43 zzso zzso zzso abundant in brain, liver and zzso like the previously described human zzso zzso The beta zzso zzso zzso use a zzso zzso to initiate translation of a novel 36 zzso zzso zzso which is shorter at its zzso relative to the 43 zzso zzso zzso is expressed uniquely in the liver, where it is the most abundant zzso zzso Surprisingly, the two proteins accumulate in the liver with different zzso zzso and have distinct zzso promoter preferences in zzso zzso Thus, zzso stimulates zzso from the cholesterol 7 zzso promoter much more efficiently than from the zzso promoter, while the converse is true for zzso
