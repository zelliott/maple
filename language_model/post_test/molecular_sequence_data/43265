The zzso zzso was reported to zzso modify zzso X of the zzso 20 S zzso and inhibit several of its zzso zzso However, we demonstrate that zzso treatment zzso all the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its more potent zzso zzso zzso inhibit protein breakdown and the zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso 20 S and 26 S zzso although at different zzso Exposure to these agents for 1 to 2 h reduced the degradation of zzso and zzso proteins in four different zzso cell zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso do not inhibit zzso degradation of an zzso zzso These agents block class I zzso presentation of a model zzso zzso zzso zzso or loaded zzso but do not affect presentation of the zzso zzso zzso which does not require zzso for zzso Generation of most peptides required for formation of stable class I zzso is also zzso Because these agents inhibited protein breakdown and zzso presentation similarly in zzso cells (where zzso contain zzso and zzso zzso in place of X and zzso all zzso must be affected zzso These findings confirm our prior conclusions that zzso catalyze the bulk of protein breakdown in zzso cells and generate the majority of class zzso zzso for immune zzso
