zzso zzso traditionally known as an zzso protein present in high zzso in milk and various secretions, has emerged as a zzso protein involved in many aspects of the host defense against zzso Recently, zzso has been shown to inhibit the growth of solid tumors and reduce experimental zzso in mice, suggesting that zzso also may play a role in the defense against zzso Here we provide the sequence of the zzso and promoter region, the zzso assignment, and tissue expression pattern of a novel form of zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of delta zzso zzso is nearly identical to that of zzso zzso however, at the zzso end, we find a novel sequence that replaces the zzso signal zzso sequence of zzso zzso We map the delta zzso zzso to human zzso 3 and find that both delta zzso and zzso sequences zzso to the same cloned zzso to zzso zzso DNA zzso We further show that the delta zzso zzso is the product of alternative zzso of the zzso gene and likely is specified by use of an alternative zzso Although we find delta zzso zzso at various levels in 20 of 20 adult and fetal human zzso we do not find delta zzso zzso in any of 14 diverse zzso cell zzso
