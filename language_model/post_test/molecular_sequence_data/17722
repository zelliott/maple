zzso H zzso zzso zzso is induced by growth factors and zzso such as zzso and zzso and is suppressed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso synthesis by zzso is zzso by a novel zzso control that appears to involve conversion of the PG zzso zzso into a cryptic zzso zzso In order to understand expression of the zzso in more detail, a full length zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a human embryonic lung cell zzso library and the complete zzso including the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso was zzso The coding sequence for the human PG zzso shows greater than zzso zzso with the sheep and mouse zzso A high degree of conservation zzso however, was also observed in the approximately 750 zzso sequence that comprises the 3' zzso domain of both sheep and human PG zzso zzso and with the approximately 900 zzso 3' zzso of the mouse zzso zzso sheep vs zzso zzso human vs zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are distributed throughout the 3' zzso where zzso between species is zzso This high degree of conservation in a zzso region and recent evidence from other genes suggests that these 3' zzso sequences have important regulatory functions possibly related to zzso control of this zzso by growth factors and zzso
