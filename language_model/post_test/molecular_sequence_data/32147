The overall zzso sequence of zzso in zzso zzso was substantially zzso zzso to zzso A in zzso coli, although its possible zzso structure was different from known zzso and it lacked the zzso signature zzso Here, zzso in zzso coli is expressed and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso at an optimum temperature of 70 degrees zzso Its molecular size was zzso zzso indicating that it consisted of one zzso and one zzso zzso zzso revealed that it had an zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso represents a novel group of zzso zzso
