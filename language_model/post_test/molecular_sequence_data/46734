The zzso zzso mediates zzso degradation at zzso zzso and is the principal regulator for maintaining low, often zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso However, a subset of human tumors including zzso zzso harbor high levels of wild type zzso protein localized to the zzso Here we show that the abnormal zzso zzso in such cells is due to a profound resistance to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cell lines failed to decrease the high steady state levels of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso when introduced into these cells, was also resistant to zzso zzso This resistance is not due to a lack of zzso expression in zzso cells or a lack of zzso interaction, nor is it due to a zzso in the zzso state of zzso or zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso from zzso cells is associated with zzso modification of zzso and masking of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This system provides evidence for an important level of regulation of zzso zzso destruction in zzso that is linked to zzso zzso
