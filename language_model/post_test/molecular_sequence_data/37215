zzso is an zzso zzso protein that is concentrated at sites of cell zzso where it associates with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso regulators and is zzso to play a role in zzso dynamics and zzso zzso transcripts are detected throughout zzso embryonic development, and the protein is widely expressed in zzso Here we used a reverse genetic approach to examine the consequences of loss of zzso function in the zzso Mice that lack zzso function are viable and fertile and display no obvious zzso abnormalities in any of the zzso zzso Because zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso family members at certain zzso locations, we carefully examined the zzso mice for evidence of defects that have been observed when zzso proteins are compromised in the zzso Specifically, we evaluated blood zzso function, nervous system development, and skin architecture but did not detect any defects in these zzso zzso is the founding member of a family of proteins that also includes the zzso preferred partner zzso and zzso zzso protein 6 zzso These zzso family members display patterns of expression that significantly overlap that of zzso Western zzso analysis indicates that there is no zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso expression in zzso derived from zzso zzso Because zzso family members may have overlapping functions, a comprehensive understanding of the role of these proteins in the mouse will require the generation of compound zzso in which multiple zzso family members are simultaneously zzso
