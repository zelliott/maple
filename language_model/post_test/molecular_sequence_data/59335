T cells recognize zzso by formation of a zzso complex in which the zzso zzso zzso recognizes a specific zzso zzso within the groove of a major zzso complex zzso zzso It has generally been assumed that zzso recognition of two distinct zzso complexes is due to similarities in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso Here we report results of experiments examining the zzso of zzso recognizing the zzso basic protein zzso zzso and several of its zzso in the context of zzso We demonstrate that single conservative zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso contact zzso at positions 91 and 93 totally abrogate zzso of specific zzso zzso Yet, when a conservative substitution is made at position 91 zzso with a substitution at position 93, the zzso clones regain zzso equivalent with that of the original stimulating zzso Thus, the exact nature of the zzso acid side chains engaging one zzso functional pocket may change the apparent selectivity of the other zzso zzso functional pocket, thus suggesting a remarkable degree of zzso zzso This ability of the zzso complex to undergo zzso changes provides a conceptual framework for reconciling the apparent paradox of the extreme selectivity of the zzso and its remarkable zzso with different zzso zzso
