The tumor zzso zzso is important in the decision to either arrest cell cycle progression or induce zzso in response to a variety of zzso zzso zzso modifications and association with other proteins have been implicated in the regulation of its stability and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Unlike most identified zzso sites of zzso that positively associate with zzso function zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 15, zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso at zzso abrogates zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso target genes of zzso such as zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso manner zzso zzso zzso lost and zzso zzso retained normal zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso the zzso and cell cycle arrest induced by zzso and zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso DNA binding and zzso activity was not affected by zzso of zzso a recently identified zzso zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 36, zzso Our data indicate that zzso of zzso at zzso by zzso is a major mechanism to zzso zzso and can provide a molecular insight for zzso zzso
