zzso variation was studied in a zzso zzso section of the coding region of an zzso gene zzso that maps in the center of the segments rearranged by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We examine 30 zzso zzso lines differing in gene arrangement and three zzso zzso zzso lines as zzso Our data show that zzso is a highly zzso gene at both synonymous and replacement zzso zzso departures from zzso in the distribution of the ratio of silent zzso to divergence predicted by the neutral theory reveals a local excess of silent zzso This is consistent with the presence of two apparent narrow zzso of elevated silent zzso surrounding zzso zzso acid zzso These zzso as well as others at synonymous and zzso sites are shared with zzso zzso We suggest that the presence of shared zzso zzso is probably due to zzso gene flow and/or balancing selection acting on replacement zzso and/or to a decreased probability of loss of ancestral zzso caused by linkage to an zzso inversion zzso zzso zzso and persistence of neutral ancestral zzso zzso however, be ruled zzso The analysis of the distribution of zzso variation among the three zzso arrangements sampled reveals that derived arrangements zzso and zzso are less zzso than the ancestral zzso and that the widely distributed ST and J arrangements are genetically zzso However, a significant number of zzso are shared between arrangements, suggesting frequent exchange either from gene conversion or from double crossovers in zzso Finally, our present results in combination with data of sequence variation at the zzso of inversion J suggest that this old gene arrangement has risen in frequency in relatively recent zzso
