Natural killer cells lyse tumor and zzso infected cells in a specific manner that has not been zzso zzso Target cell expression of major zzso complex zzso class I molecules is correlated with target cell resistance to natural zzso A mechanism to explain this observation is that zzso cells may display two types of recognition and zzso molecules that have opposing functions when bound to target cell zzso One type of surface zzso such as the zzso zzso may activate zzso activity whereas the other, represented by the mouse zzso zzso may engage target cell zzso molecules and inhibit zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are structurally zzso and they are zzso by genetically linked zzso in a zzso region, termed the zzso gene complex zzso on zzso mouse zzso zzso Target cell zzso to natural killing may be dependent upon specific zzso interaction with these zzso or zzso zzso zzso
