zzso expression of the bone protein zzso is controlled at the zzso level by the steroid hormone 1 zzso zzso As this protein may represent a marker for bone activity in human disease, we examined the regulation of its expression at the molecular level by evaluating human zzso gene promoter zzso We describe regions within the promoter that contribute to zzso expression of the gene in zzso cells in zzso Further, we define a zzso DNA element with the sequence zzso which acts in zzso to mediate 1 zzso D3 zzso of the zzso zzso This response element bears sequence similarity with other short DNA zzso particularly those for zzso and zzso hormone, which act together with their respective zzso receptors to zzso gene zzso
