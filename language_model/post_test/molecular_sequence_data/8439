zzso in the gene zzso the protein zzso zzso zzso are associated with the human B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso a point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso with a milder zzso zzso zzso To assess the importance of zzso function in zzso zzso we generated multiple embryonic stem cell clones bearing a targeted disruption of the zzso gene and examined their potential to produce zzso in both zzso and zzso host zzso zzso These mice provide a complementary set of in zzso competition zzso that formally establish the genetic basis for the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso yields a zzso quite similar to that of zzso it also compromises expansion of B cell zzso Our results suggest that the zzso and human consequences of zzso zzso differ only zzso and represent the same disease zzso
