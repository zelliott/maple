By incorporating zzso zzso into a zzso zzso novel zzso with potent zzso activity and low zzso activity were zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the incorporation of zzso zzso decrease the alpha zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso membrane circumstances, which must be regarded as a major factor for the separation of zzso activity from zzso activity for zzso zzso zzso in which dye was released from zzso indicated that the potent zzso activity and low zzso activity of the zzso must be due to their great zzso membrane zzso The present result suggest that backbone modifications can be a great tool for developing zzso with improved biological activity and zzso from zzso zzso
