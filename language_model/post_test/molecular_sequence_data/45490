zzso are zzso molecules that neutralize pathogens and link zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso D zzso one of the five zzso classes present in zzso is expressed as an zzso zzso on zzso B zzso The functional role that zzso plays in the immune response is still poorly zzso but the recent characterization of zzso heavy constant delta genes zzso in a variety of species challenges the view that zzso is of minor importance and is not present in many zzso On the basis of zzso studies, zzso appears to be expressed in the majority of zzso species zzso To zzso at the molecular level, that zzso is present in different species, we cloned and zzso zzso zzso from dogs and five zzso zzso species zzso zzso macaque, zzso macaque, zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that in all six species, zzso heavy chains possess three zzso zzso and a long hinge region zzso by two zzso Only the hinge region of zzso primates is similar to the human hinge region, with conservation of zzso sites and multiple charged zzso at opposing zzso The preservation of zzso in zzso dogs and previously characterized species suggests an important functional role for zzso possibly involving binding to a zzso The high degree of similarity existing between the structural features of human and zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso primates are suitable for in zzso studies designed to define the role that zzso plays in the immune zzso
