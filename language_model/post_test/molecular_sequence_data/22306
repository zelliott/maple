A zzso study of zzso solutions of zzso zzso indicates that zzso binds to the zzso to form a zzso zzso complex with four nitrogen atoms in the copper coordination zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso and zzso data suggest copper binding through the zzso backbone and zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso data show that zzso is zzso below pH zzso and is zzso at pH 9 and zzso The zzso form of the zzso is zzso in solution and is organized into a turn zzso in the presence of 2 zzso zzso of zzso at basic zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso solutions in the g zzso 2 region and within the pH range zzso exhibit zzso zzso A zzso model of the zzso complex gave a zzso separation of 8 zzso
