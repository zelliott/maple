zzso human zzso mouse cell hybrids were used to investigate the genetic basis of human zzso to zzso zzso T cell hybrids between the mouse zzso zzso T zzso line and normal, zzso zzso human peripheral zzso cells zzso were zzso These hybrids zzso zzso human zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso integration occurred only in those hybrids expressing zzso at the cell zzso However, infectious progeny production was demonstrated only in two of the three zzso hybrids zzso By segregation analysis, we could correlate the absence of human zzso 1, 3, and 9 with the lack of infectious viral zzso
