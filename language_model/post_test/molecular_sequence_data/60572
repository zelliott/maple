The zzso genes of two divergent zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are expressed exclusively in zzso precursor zzso A previous study showed that the zzso expression of zzso is controlled by a minimal promoter that is composed of three distinct zzso a region responsible for repression of expression in zzso zzso cells, a region for zzso of expression in zzso cells, and a region for zzso of expression in zzso zzso cells, zzso to zzso to the zzso initiation site, zzso We examined various deletion zzso of the zzso fusion gene and demonstrate that a module between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso region is responsible for zzso expression of the reporter zzso zzso zzso suggested the binding of nuclear zzso to this zzso The zzso region of zzso contains a potential zzso motif zzso around zzso zzso zzso of this motif from the zzso diminished the reporter gene zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and synthetic zzso zzso resulted in zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso motif is responsible for zzso of the zzso These findings revealed striking differences between the minimal promoters of zzso and zzso so far revealed, with respect to their zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso injections of reporter gene zzso namely zzso into zzso eggs and zzso into zzso eggs, suggest zzso in the zzso elements and zzso factors that have occurred during evolution of the two zzso zzso
