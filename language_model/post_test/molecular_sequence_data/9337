A zzso public health prenatal program zzso zzso from central western zzso State has represented a unique opportunity for the early diagnosis of zzso and zzso of strategies to prevent zzso transmission zzso 

To investigate zzso among a prospective cohort of zzso infected zzso zzso 

142 zzso 149 infants zzso were investigated regarding maternal viral load, zzso counts, zzso pol zzso zzso zzso zzso tests zzso zzso sequential zzso zzso zzso zzso were assigned by zzso zzso drug resistance was identified by the zzso zzso Resistance zzso secondary resistance by Stanford zzso Drug zzso AIDS Society zzso 

Mothers zzso zzso years; zzso zzso were diagnosed during prenatal care zzso or previously zzso Recent cases were younger, mostly zzso zzso zzso and zzso prophylaxis predominated in formerly diagnosed zzso Recent cases had higher zzso C zzso One zzso patient had transmitted zzso ten zzso patients had secondary zzso 6 from zzso zzso 4 under zzso Late disclosure of diagnosis, zzso delivery, zzso lack of oral zzso were observed in the three zzso cases zzso zzso Two of three infected infants zzso zzso zzso infected zzso did not have drug resistance zzso Two of the zzso had zzso zzso zzso Among zzso infants the median time to zzso was 12 zzso 

In this study delayed disclosure of diagnosis, zzso preventive measures, drug resistance among zzso women under prophylaxis and zzso in low zzso mothers raise zzso The expansion of zzso C infection corroborates surveillance of zzso diversity in this zzso
