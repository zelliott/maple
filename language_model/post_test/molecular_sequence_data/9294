As our understanding of the dynamics of zzso droplets zzso in animal, plant, and zzso cells is rapidly evolving, still little is known about the formation and turnover of these zzso in zzso Yet with the growing importance of zzso zzso for the production of zzso and high-value zzso there is a need to understand the mechanisms of zzso dynamics in zzso Thus, we investigated the proteins associated with zzso of the emerging zzso model zzso zzso zzso and discovered an abundant zzso zzso zzso surface protein zzso with unique primary sequence but structural similarities to other zzso zzso zzso abundance in zzso cells closely tracked the amount of zzso during conditions of oil zzso and zzso zzso characterization of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed a separation of its physical and structural properties in its interaction with zzso from its zzso or zzso zzso Although zzso presence in zzso predictably affected zzso size, it could not reverse the zzso impact of zzso zzso on zzso zzso during zzso
