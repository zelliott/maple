zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso family of genes encodes a zzso repeat zzso zzso proteins that are thought to be specifically involved in zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso beta zzso zzso has been previously shown to induce the expression of another zzso gene in neural cells, we assessed how zzso affects zzso gene expression in rat primary cerebral cortical cultures and zzso zzso Both zzso and Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso robustly induced the expression of zzso in rat zzso zzso Western zzso analyses also showed that both zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso E zzso significantly increased coincidentally with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso with zzso at plasma zzso and also with zzso zzso in zzso These findings suggest that activated zzso may be involved in the zzso response against zzso
