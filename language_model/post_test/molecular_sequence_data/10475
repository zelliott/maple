The family of zzso zzso molecules play zzso roles in various zzso zzso One member of this family, zzso zzso zzso serves as a zzso that patterns both the zzso and zzso We have now isolated a zzso Daughters against zzso zzso whose zzso is induced by zzso Dad shares weak zzso with zzso Mad zzso against zzso a protein required for zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to Mad or the activated zzso zzso whose zzso zzso the zzso zzso pathway, zzso of Dad blocks zzso zzso zzso of Dad together with either Mad or the activated zzso zzso zzso defects induced by each protein zzso Dad can also antagonize the activity of a zzso zzso of zzso bone zzso zzso as evidenced by induction of zzso or neural fate following zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso mechanism governed by zzso involves a zzso circuit in which zzso zzso expression of its own zzso zzso This feedback loop appears to be zzso in zzso zzso
