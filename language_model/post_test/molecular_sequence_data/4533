zzso bias has been observed in many zzso The usage of selective zzso in a given gene is positively correlated with its expression zzso As an experimental approach to study zzso effects on zzso gene expression in zzso cells, we designed two human zzso zzso zzso one in which native zzso were systematically zzso with zzso frequently found in highly expressed human genes and the other with zzso prevalent in zzso zzso Relative performances of the zzso EPO genes were evaluated with various combinations of promoters and signal leader zzso Under the comparable set of combinations, mature EPO gene with human zzso zzso gave a considerably higher level of expression than that with zzso zzso zzso However, the levels of EPO expression zzso depending on the alternate zzso Since the promoters and the signal leader sequences that we used are known to be equally efficient in gene zzso we hypothesized that the varied expression levels were due to the linear sequence between the promoter and the coding gene zzso To test this possibility, we designed the EPO gene with hybrid zzso usage in which the zzso region of the EPO gene was zzso with zzso zzso and the rest with zzso zzso This zzso hybrid EPO gene substantially enhanced the level of EPO transcripts and proteins up to zzso and zzso respectively, when compared to the level reached by the original zzso Our results suggest that the linear sequence between the promoter and the zzso region of a gene plays an important role in achieving high-level expression in zzso zzso
