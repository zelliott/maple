We identified a novel zzso localized protein in zzso called zzso motif nuclear localized protein 1 zzso which was isolated by visual screening of zzso using random zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso motif and unknown zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain that includes a zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso and the plant kingdom, but in zzso and zzso the zzso containing proteins of do not have an zzso zzso Thus, the zzso domain is evolutionary zzso and has a new function such as zzso DNA zzso zzso was mainly localized in the zzso but little in the zzso and zzso region, and was concentrated in the boundary region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also found in the nuclear zzso zzso In the M phase, zzso was localized on the zzso zzso The zzso motif was essential for zzso attachment region zzso zzso and the zzso region of the zzso was indispensable for nuclear zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a novel plant zzso binding zzso which is related to the positioning of zzso fibers in the nucleus by the presence of an zzso motif and zzso zzso In addition, zzso is located on the surface of zzso during zzso
