Gene zzso zzso symbol zzso is expressed in several types of tumors, but not in normal zzso except zzso and zzso The zzso end of this gene contains eight zzso zzso spread over a zzso zzso These zzso are alternatively spliced to a unique second zzso and a unique third zzso which encodes a protein of 317 zzso zzso The analysis of transcripts found in zzso zzso and a zzso cell line showed that each of the alternative first zzso is used in at least one of these zzso Various regions of the promoter of the fifth alternative zzso zzso were cloned in a zzso reporter zzso and the zzso were zzso in a zzso cell line that expresses zzso Two zzso motifs located between positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start site were found to drive zzso of the promoter zzso A region containing a zzso consensus binding site located upstream of the two zzso motifs was found to be responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoters zzso and zzso which also contain the zzso and the two zzso binding zzso supported a level of zzso comparable to that of promoter zzso whereas promoter zzso which contains only one zzso binding site, was zzso less zzso In line with observations made with gene zzso zzso symbol zzso we found that promoter zzso zzso a high level of zzso in a melanoma cell line that does not express zzso This suggests that the zzso expression of zzso genes is not determined by the presence of specific zzso zzso
