The large diversity of the zzso and zzso zzso is accounted for by zzso assembly of the zzso zzso D, and J gene zzso as well as extensive modification at the junctions during the zzso zzso Those zzso termed zzso processing, consist of removal and addition of an apparently random number of zzso To obtain further insights into the mechanism of the zzso processing, we constructed a large data base of several zzso and zzso coding ends obtained in zzso using conditions that avoid potential bias by cellular selection zzso We show that the processing patterns are not random, but rather specific for each coding end, suggesting that specific motifs in the zzso sequence influence the zzso We found a good correlation between the presence of internal stretches of at least three zzso zzso absence of stretches of zzso zzso and high average zzso zzso Based on a detailed analysis of the processing patterns, we propose that nicks of the hairpin intermediate take place zzso in potential open structures formed by weaker pairings of zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that the sequence of the coding end plays an important role in zzso aspects of the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso sequences might have been selected throughout evolution to participate in an early control of the development of the primary zzso
