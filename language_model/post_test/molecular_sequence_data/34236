zzso belongs to the zzso family and plays an important role as a model plant for which researchers have developed fine-tuned zzso zzso Genome sequencing projects have been initiated for other members of the zzso zzso Among these projects, research on Chinese cabbage zzso zzso zzso zzso started early because of strong interest in this zzso Here, we report the development of a library of Chinese cabbage full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso resource, to accelerate research on zzso zzso We zzso 10 zzso zzso clones and confirmed zzso independent zzso Most of these zzso showed high zzso to zzso zzso but we also obtained more than 200 zzso clones that lacked any sequence zzso to zzso zzso We also successfully identified several possible candidate marker genes for plant zzso responses from our analysis of the expression of the zzso counterparts of zzso marker genes in response to salicylic acid and zzso zzso We compared gene expression of these markers in several Chinese cabbage zzso Our zzso zzso resource will be publicly available from the zzso zzso Center and will help researchers to transfer zzso knowledge to zzso zzso
