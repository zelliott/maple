Two proteins zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso precursor zzso the zzso processing zzso zzso and the processing enhancing protein zzso In order to understand the structure and function of this novel zzso we have isolated zzso of zzso zzso which were temperature sensitive in the processing of zzso precursor zzso Here we report on the zzso zzso which is deficient in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso were able to import precursor zzso but not to cleave the zzso The zzso gene was zzso zzso is a zzso protein consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits remarkable sequence similarity to zzso We speculate that zzso and zzso have a common origin and have evolved into two components with different but mutually zzso functions in processing of precursor zzso
