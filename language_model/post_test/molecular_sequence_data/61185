zzso mapping of the human zzso zzso promoter delineated the most active zzso from zzso to zzso in relation to the zzso start site mapped in this study, in both human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions revealed that a crucial element controlling over zzso of the promoter activity in these cell lines is located between zzso and zzso A zzso altering only two zzso of the zzso consensus sequence present at zzso zzso to zzso has a similar zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that a set of specific complexes between nuclear factors and the zzso promoter are eliminated by this point zzso as well as by competition with an zzso consensus zzso Competition experiments in zzso I zzso correlated with zzso mobility shift zzso and showed that only one of several zzso over the zzso promoter is eliminated by competition with an zzso consensus zzso It extends from zzso to zzso and surrounds the zzso motif present at zzso Thus, a crucial zzso element is present at zzso and binds a zzso recognizing specifically the zzso consensus zzso At least one such complex is eliminated by zzso the nuclear extract with an zzso with broad zzso with zzso and zzso zzso thus confirming that an zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso zzso Several zzso binding motifs at positions zzso zzso and zzso surround this zzso zzso Competition zzso I zzso showed that zzso nuclear factors recognize specifically these sites in both cell zzso Furthermore, a combination of zzso and 3' deletions indicated the presence of positive promoter elements between zzso and zzso as well as between zzso and zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso correlate to suggest that zzso zzso zzso bind at several sites upstream and downstream from the initiation site and activate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso downstream from the zzso initiation site also contain major control zzso 3' deletions from zzso to zzso decreased promoter activity by zzso However, further deletion to zzso increased promoter activity by zzso zzso these data indicate that sequences upstream and downstream from the zzso start site each control over zzso of the promoter zzso zzso this suggests that zzso interactions between factors recognizing downstream and upstream sequences are zzso
