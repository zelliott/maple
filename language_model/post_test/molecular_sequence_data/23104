zzso how an zzso replicates and assembles a zzso zzso with zzso previously measured at zzso presents a model system for exploring questions involving zzso assortment and zzso interactions in zzso The virus family zzso containing nine zzso and more than 200 members, are unique in that they possess a segmented zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso as a model member of this family, we have developed the only functional reverse zzso system for a member of this family with ten or more zzso zzso Using this system, we have previously identified the zzso zzso sequences required by an engineered zzso zzso for efficient incorporation into the zzso of zzso The minimum zzso sequence retains 96 zzso and contains a predicted zzso zzso Within these 96 zzso we have identified three zzso zzso at positions zzso that are essential for the incorporation of in zzso generated zzso into new zzso progeny viral zzso The work presented here builds on these findings and presents the results of an analysis of the required 3' zzso sequences of the zzso zzso 

The minimum 3' sequence we localized retains 98 zzso of the wild type zzso zzso These sequences do not interact with the zzso sequences and modifications of the zzso sequences does not result in a change in the sequences required at the 3' end of the engineered zzso zzso Within the 3' sequence we discovered three regions that when zzso prevent the zzso from being zzso to zzso and subsequently incorporated into progeny zzso Using a series of zzso we were able to obtain additional information about the sequences in these zzso We demonstrate that the individual zzso from, 98 to 84, 68 to 59, and 28 to 1, are required in addition to the total length of 98 zzso to direct an engineered zzso zzso to be zzso to zzso and incorporated into a progeny zzso zzso analysis using a number of zzso zzso software programs revealed three possible structures predicted to occur in all 10 zzso zzso but not predicted to contain zzso individual zzso that we could probe further by using individual zzso zzso The presence of a zzso structure would permit all ten zzso to be identified and selected as a set, while unique zzso within the structure would direct the set to contain 10 unique zzso 

This study completes the characterization and mapping of the zzso and 3' sequences required for an engineered zzso zzso zzso to be incorporated into an infectious progeny virus and establishes a firm foundation for additional investigations into the assortment and zzso mechanism of all 10 zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso As researchers build on this work and apply this system to additional zzso genes and additional zzso zzso a complete model for zzso assortment and replication for these viruses will zzso
