Light harvesting provides a major challenge in the production of zzso from zzso while sunlight provides the energy necessary for zzso production, at the same time it damages the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was searched for open reading frames that might code for yet unidentified zzso proteins with low molecular mass that could be involved in zzso zzso zzso hypothetical zzso corresponding to potential zzso of 100 zzso acids or less, two were identified that had the potential to be zzso because they zzso zzso a potential zzso region, zzso showed sequence similarity with known zzso zzso zzso were zzso in other zzso species, and zzso their zzso adaptation index indicated significant translation zzso The two zzso were located complementary zzso and internal to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso genes and therefore were named zzso and zzso zzso zzso of both genes was zzso however, no translated proteins could be detected zzso Whereas zzso within zzso or zzso did not lead to any obvious zzso it is clear that transcripts and proteins over and above the currently known set may play a role in defining the physiology of zzso and other zzso
