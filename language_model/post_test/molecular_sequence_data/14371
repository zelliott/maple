zzso zzso droplets zzso are storage zzso for neutral lipids derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso family proteins are essential zzso in this zzso pathway, contributing activated fatty zzso Fluorescence zzso showed that zzso is localized to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the distribution dependent on the cell type and the supply of fatty zzso The zzso of zzso was necessary and sufficient for targeting reporter proteins correctly, as demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso was also found to be functionally required for the zzso zzso Selective zzso and in zzso analysis suggest that zzso assumes a hairpin membrane zzso with the zzso zzso zzso acids forming an zzso zzso restricted to the zzso leaflet of the zzso zzso zzso was effectively zzso from the zzso to nascent zzso when neutral zzso synthesis was zzso by the external addition of fatty zzso Cellular fatty acid zzso was increased by zzso and reduced by zzso interference of zzso In conclusion, the structural organization of zzso allows the fast and efficient movement from the zzso to emerging zzso zzso not only zzso fatty acids with zzso but is also involved in the cellular zzso of fatty zzso presumably indirectly by zzso zzso The unique zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso suggests a function in the local synthesis of zzso
