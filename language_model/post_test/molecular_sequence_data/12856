The zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso library prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene is located zzso zzso downstream from zzso a gene that encodes a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in zzso coli and the zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso exhibited biological activity, as determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso using zzso chemicals suggested that the zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, multiple sequence alignment revealed a high degree of similarity to previously described bacterial zzso This family of zzso has been used to selectively remove the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso found on certain blocked proteins and peptides prior to zzso zzso However, the exact biological role of zzso has yet to be zzso
