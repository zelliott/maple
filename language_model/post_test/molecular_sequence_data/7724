Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso system can be useful for studying interactions of the zzso and zzso forms of Ras proteins with the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso In addition, our findings show that a negative result in the zzso zzso system does not indicate that the two proteins tested do not interact under all conditions but only that they do not interact under the specific conditions zzso We recommend that the zzso system be employed in combination with other approaches, including molecular genetic analyses and in zzso binding experiments, for the study of Ras and zzso zzso
