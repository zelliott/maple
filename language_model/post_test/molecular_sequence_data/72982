zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso protein zzso are highly zzso members of a newly defined family of cell zzso molecules belonging to the zzso zzso that recognize terminal zzso acid zzso on zzso and zzso zzso The importance of the zzso zzso on zzso were determined by removal of the eight predicted zzso addition sites by zzso zzso The results suggest that all eight zzso zzso sites are zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be required for zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso does play a role in the proper folding of zzso It was also shown that zzso in the host cell expressing zzso and zzso could inhibit binding to zzso The degree to which zzso and zzso zzso binding was affected by zzso in the host cell was dependent on zzso the level at which zzso was expressed on the surface of the host cell and zzso the presence of zzso zzso on the host zzso The data suggest that zzso on the host cell compete with zzso on the target cell for the binding zzso on zzso
