To study cellular and zzso zzso of zzso we constructed a zzso which would express a zzso zzso zzso having the enhanced green fluorescent protein of the jelly fish zzso zzso fused to the zzso of zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with the zzso expressing zzso The zzso zzso was processed through the zzso zzso and zzso as was shown by fluorescent zzso zzso after zzso at temperatures which block processing at the intermediate compartment and the zzso zzso In a zzso system, zzso zzso could be zzso binding to the surface of zzso breast zzso cells but not zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso localized to the nucleus of zzso cells after 72 zzso in zzso These findings suggest that zzso may zzso bind to and be taken up by zzso breast zzso cells and that zzso may play a yet unidentified role in nuclear zzso
