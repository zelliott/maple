An approximately zzso region encompassing the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso was zzso in 24 worldwide zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence for zzso at the zzso zzso A minimum of three zzso events was zzso in the history of the sampled zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso The estimated zzso diversity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was on the lower part of the range of the corresponding estimates for other gene zzso The zzso of the frequency spectrum toward an excess of zzso zzso together with the zzso distribution of zzso zzso differences at zzso suggests that zzso zzso has recently experienced a rapid population zzso Although this pattern could also be explained by a recent selective sweep at the studied region, results from the other studied zzso and from an zzso survey seem to support the expansion zzso zzso of silent zzso and divergence at the zzso region and at the zzso and zzso revealed in some cases a significant zzso of the direct relationship predicted by the neutral theory, which would be compatible with balancing selection acting at the latter zzso
