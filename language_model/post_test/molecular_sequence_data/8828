zzso zzso cells that lack zzso zzso expression were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein behaves as a zzso zzso at 37 degrees C and as a zzso zzso at 32 degrees zzso Three independent clones expressing the zzso zzso protein were characterized with respect to zzso zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso and zzso zzso zzso responded to zzso zzso at 32 degrees C by undergoing zzso arrest, zzso and zzso zzso was seen in cells representative of all zzso of the cell cycle and was not restricted to cells arrested in zzso The addition of a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to the culture medium of zzso cells blocked zzso zzso and differentiation but not zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso and zzso arrest can be effectively zzso through the action of zzso acting as survival factors and are consistent with the idea that zzso and zzso arrest represent separate functions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso responded to zzso zzso at 32 degrees C by undergoing zzso arrest but not zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso a factor with zzso activity and that zzso zzso a factor with zzso activity and suggest that zzso zzso of these zzso blocks zzso zzso These data provide a framework in which to understand the variable responses of cells to zzso zzso
