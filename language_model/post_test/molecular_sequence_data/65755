We identified and characterized two zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso At the protein level, goldfish zzso and zzso were most zzso to carp zzso and zzso zzso zzso the two goldfish zzso grouped most closely with the carp zzso zzso and zzso species of other zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso expression of goldfish zzso and zzso in all zzso with zzso zzso levels higher than zzso in all zzso zzso A modest zzso in expressions of goldfish zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and significant increase in expression of both zzso in mature zzso were observed in response to zzso with zzso zzso zzso was subsequently expressed using a zzso expression system and the zzso zzso zzso was functionally zzso The zzso induced a zzso zzso response and enhanced zzso of primary goldfish zzso Furthermore, zzso primed the respiratory burst in zzso and induced zzso oxide production of primary goldfish zzso Our results indicate that goldfish zzso is a central regulatory and zzso zzso of inflammatory and zzso responses of the zzso
