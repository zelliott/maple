Nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso in tumor necrosis factor, zzso and zzso zzso pathways requires zzso zzso zzso zzso is a specific feedback inhibitor of zzso zzso in these pathways that possesses dual zzso zzso While the zzso domain of zzso is a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso signaling zzso such as zzso and zzso its zzso domain is a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso To zzso the molecular basis for the zzso activity of zzso we determined its crystal structure and performed a series of zzso and cell biological zzso The structure reveals the potential zzso mechanism of zzso which may be significantly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso onto a zzso zzso surface; this interaction exhibits charge zzso and no zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso does not have specificity for zzso zzso zzso Instead, it effectively removes zzso zzso chains from zzso without zzso the chains zzso Our studies suggest that zzso does not act as a general zzso but has the specificity for particular zzso zzso to assure its zzso in regulating zzso zzso in the tumor necrosis factor, zzso and zzso zzso zzso
