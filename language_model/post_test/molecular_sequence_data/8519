The germ line zzso of a defective zzso into the zzso gene of mice is associated with a zzso zzso Mice zzso for the integration develop zzso at a young zzso The zzso resembles human zzso in its zzso parameters as well as in zzso A human zzso of the zzso gene has been identified, isolated and zzso We here show that this zzso which has a role in the production of zzso oxygen species, can rescue the zzso of zzso deficient mice when introduced by zzso This provides formal proof for the hypothesis that the zzso is caused by the loss of function of the zzso zzso It also provides evidence for the functional conservation of the zzso gene in zzso and points to a potential role of this gene in human kidney zzso
