We previously reported cloning of zzso zzso both components of a protein zzso induced during goldfish zzso nerve zzso The predicted protein sequences showed significant zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are well-established markers of zzso zzso zzso the zzso were designated zzso and zzso (for goldfish zzso zzso zzso of 68 and 70 zzso zzso zzso have now been isolated from zzso zzso a highly related zzso which we have termed zzso zzso protection zzso show that zzso zzso is induced significantly zzso in zzso nerve zzso zzso zzso 7 days following nerve zzso Western blots show a single band in zzso brain and zzso zzso with zzso increasing zzso in zzso zzso 21 days zzso zzso analysis indicated that this increase in zzso protein expression is localized to the retinal zzso cell layer in zzso zzso We have characterized and evaluated the relevance of a zzso zzso zzso motif in zzso to zzso activity by means of zzso zzso Two zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso zzso A zzso zzso within the zzso which zzso to a critical zzso for zzso zzso does not appear to participate in the zzso zzso
