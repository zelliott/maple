In many animals, the germ line develops from a distinct zzso region of embryonic zzso called the germ zzso However, the protein composition of germ zzso and its formation remain poorly zzso except in zzso Here, we show that zzso a recently identified protein component of zzso germ zzso interacts via its zzso domain with a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso eggs and early zzso and zzso to the zzso cloud and germ zzso in stage I and stage VI zzso zzso Although zzso appears unique to zzso zzso zzso which contain an zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso are widely zzso In humans, two zzso zzso and zzso are expressed at varying levels in different cancer cell zzso zzso as well as zzso to zzso human zzso proteins zzso to zzso and associate with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso expressed through the cell cycle, zzso concentrates on zzso structures in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso interferes with cell zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso proteins that likely contribute to a range of zzso and cell division zzso
