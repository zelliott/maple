The zzso zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso exist in tandem zzso zzso to the zzso repeat zzso A clone with a zzso insert containing an array of zzso genes was identified in a zzso zzso library and was characterized by restriction mapping and partial zzso The array consisted of 9 apparently identical zzso genes and their zzso in tandem, followed by a zzso zzso sequence that is likely to be a zzso This gene arrangement, although almost universal in plants and animals, is rare in zzso and zzso
