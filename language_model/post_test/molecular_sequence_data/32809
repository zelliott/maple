The structure of the major zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso A gene cluster zzso a zzso zzso zzso producing a zzso was cloned from the same strain and zzso The cluster consists of four genes zzso zzso zzso and one gene zzso a zzso Two additional zzso transcribed in the opposite direction were found in the zzso zzso zzso one of these encodes an ABC zzso The overall organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resembles a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso strain zzso zzso analyses of the individual zzso from zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of the zzso zzso according to function irrespective of zzso origin - indicating strong functional constraints across zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso to a large extent grouped according to zzso affiliation or position in the respective zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso acids and zzso zzso respectively, form three separate zzso Although zzso events are likely to be involved in the evolution of zzso no clear evidence of genetic zzso between the two zzso gene clusters was zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have an evolutionary history of zzso zzso However, the data indicated that the two classes of zzso zzso gene clusters have evolved zzso
