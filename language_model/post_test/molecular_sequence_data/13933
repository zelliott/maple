zzso and X-ray structures for the zzso zzso A zzso reveal a remarkable difference between the zzso zzso zzso in organic zzso and the zzso bound to zzso We have performed computer simulations of the molecular dynamics of zzso under a variety of conditions and confirmed the stability of these two zzso at room temperature in water and in zzso However, when the free zzso was modeled in vacuum at 600 K, a transition zzso leading to the bound zzso was zzso This involved a change in the zzso zzso zzso bond to a trans zzso and the movement of the side chains forming the dominant zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the opposite side of the plane formed by the backbone atoms in the molecular zzso The final zzso had a backbone zzso zzso from the bound zzso of zzso A and was as stable in dynamics simulations as the bound zzso Our calculations allowed us to make a detailed analysis of a transition zzso between the free and the bound zzso of zzso and to identify two distinct regions of coordinated movement in zzso both of which underwent transitions zzso
