A gene zzso an zzso activity was identified in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which produces only a single band in zzso gels zzso zzso zzso Tobin, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame, designated zzso of zzso zzso that could zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso The calculated molecular mass of the zzso gene product zzso zzso corresponded to that of the zzso activity detected zzso 36 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso deduced from zzso acid sequence analysis and zzso zzso acid sequencing data suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso region of the putative protein zzso by zzso showed 51% identity with the zzso region of the mature zzso from zzso zzso and 50% identity with the zzso region of zzso from zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso expresses a transcript of approximately zzso zzso as predicted from the DNA zzso zzso coli clones carrying the zzso gene exhibited zzso bands of approximately 36 zzso as well as of 19 and 22 zzso in activity zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso data and results of zzso experiments with zzso generated from gene sequences of known zzso genes of zzso zzso clearly indicate that the zzso gene is distinct from other zzso zzso genes reported to zzso
