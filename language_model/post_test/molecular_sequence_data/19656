The smallest known zzso at approximately zzso diameter, are zzso zzso and related species of marine zzso The zzso of zzso zzso has been completed and compared with that of zzso zzso This comparison reveals surprising differences across zzso zzso in the two species from highly zzso zzso in most cases to zzso with almost no zzso Species divergence in these zzso is occurring through multiple mechanisms acting differently on different zzso and likely including acquisition of new genes through horizontal gene zzso We speculate that this latter process may be involved in altering the zzso characteristics of each zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso zzso provides insights into the unique metal metabolism of these organisms, which are predicted to have a large number of zzso zzso zzso are more zzso active than similar zzso lacking zzso and thus the cell may require less of that zzso As reported here, zzso novel fusion zzso and loss of some major protein families including ones associated with zzso are likely important adaptations for achieving a small cell zzso
