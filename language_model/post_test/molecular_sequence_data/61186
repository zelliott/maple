zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli, which codes for a zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso experiments identified three distinct regions of protection by zzso on the zzso zzso DNA, zzso zzso to zzso region 1), zzso zzso to zzso region zzso and zzso zzso to zzso region zzso Within the three regions of the protected DNA, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C or zzso can be zzso zzso mobility experiments showed that the protected regions 1 and 2 are essential for binding of zzso to DNA, whereas the protected region 3 increases the affinity of the DNA to the zzso The zzso of this interaction was found to be two zzso per zzso operator zzso zzso at 5 zzso completely protected the zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso alone failed to protect the DNA even at 100 zzso The apparent zzso for the interaction between the zzso operator DNA and zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso increased to 8 zzso in the absence of zzso Among the various zzso tested, only zzso replaced zzso in the repression of zzso by zzso but the affinity of zzso for zzso operator DNA was 6 times lower than with zzso A zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso protected the same region of zzso operator DNA in the absence of zzso The apparent zzso for the interaction between zzso operator DNA and zzso was 3 zzso in the presence of zzso and 4 zzso without zzso The binding of zzso to zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso indicating a zzso change of the protein upon zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unaffected by zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins apparently mimic in its zzso the native zzso complex, which binds to a DNA sequence motif of zzso
