To explore the propriety of providing zzso B virus zzso zzso F and H with two distinct zzso 

Eleven zzso zzso of zzso F zzso were recovered from patients living in San Francisco, Japan, zzso and Venezuela, and their full-length sequences were zzso zzso analysis was carried out among them along with zzso zzso previously zzso 

Seven of them clustered with reported zzso zzso in the zzso tree constructed on the entire zzso zzso The remaining four flocked on another branch along with three zzso zzso formerly reported as zzso zzso These seven zzso zzso including the four in this study and the three reported, had a sequence divergence of zzso from the other zzso zzso and differed by zzso zzso from zzso zzso of the other six zzso zzso and zzso Based on a marked zzso zzso falling just short of zzso zzso separating the seven zzso these seven zzso zzso were classified into zzso zzso and the former seven into F1 zzso zzso In a zzso comparison of the zzso sequences among the 7 zzso zzso and against 47 zzso zzso as well as 136 representing the other six zzso zzso and zzso two clusters separated by distinct genetic distances zzso 

Based on these zzso zzso zzso zzso into two zzso zzso and zzso would be more appropriate than providing them with two distinct zzso zzso and zzso
