We have isolated two sheep zzso clones which have the same coding regions but have different zzso zzso There is no zzso between these zzso sequences which are zzso to zzso 5 and 6 of the human zzso zzso In humans these zzso are transcribed only during fetal development, but in the sheep these transcripts were detected up to 28 weeks after zzso The sizes of the sheep zzso zzso transcripts are the same as those observed for the human zzso suggesting structural and zzso similarity between the human and sheep zzso zzso The sheep could therefore be a good model system in which to study zzso zzso
