A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from soil of the Spanish island of zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from all other zzso described zzso species by sequence similarity values of less than 97 zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso major polar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso major fatty zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and 10 zzso zzso : zzso and the presence of zzso acids supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso from those related species that showed zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of greater than 97 zzso zzso zzso merits species status, and the name zzso zzso is proposed with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
