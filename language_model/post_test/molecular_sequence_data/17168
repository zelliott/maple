zzso relationships among 37 living species of order zzso spanning a relatively broad range of divergence times and zzso levels were examined using nuclear sequence data from zzso 1 of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and first zzso of the zzso gene zzso 1 zzso These data were used to analyze zzso zzso at the family and generic level as well as the zzso relationships within recently derived zzso zzso results using a combined zzso zzso strongly supported within the zzso zzso the red panda as the closest lineage to zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso (including the giant zzso and zzso Four zzso families, namely the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso were consistently recovered zzso The utilities of these two gene segments for the zzso analyses were extensively explored and both were found to be fairly zzso for zzso associations within the order zzso but not for those of low level divergence at the species zzso zzso there is a need to find additional genetic markers with more rapid zzso rates that would be diagnostic at deciphering relatively recent relationships within the zzso
