zzso f is an essential component of the major zzso complex of the zzso zzso Cloning and characterization are presented here of a novel partial zzso zzso zzso zzso f in the zzso zzso green zzso Chlorella zzso and its involvement in the heat shock zzso response zzso has been zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression is zzso in zzso cells and the protein profile of zzso f highlighted a release of zzso f into the zzso depending on the time zzso from the zzso Evans Blue zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the induction of cell death in cell suspensions treated with zzso extracts from zzso zzso This study identifies zzso f in zzso zzso that seems to be involved in the zzso programmed cell death zzso The data suggest that zzso f zzso its role through a zzso of its zzso and translation levels, together with its zzso zzso This work focuses on a possible role of zzso f into the programmed cell zzso process in a zzso zzso and suggests the existence of zzso programmed cell death machinery in an zzso belonging to one of the primary lineages of zzso zzso
