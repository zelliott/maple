There is growing evidence that zzso have played a major role in zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed the presence of large duplicated regions in the zzso of many zzso organisms, and comparative studies have suggested that zzso of large DNA segments has been a continuing process during zzso However, little experimental data have been produced regarding this zzso Using a gene dosage zzso for growth recovery in zzso zzso we demonstrate that a majority of the zzso strains zzso resulted from the spontaneous zzso of large DNA zzso either zzso or zzso ranging from 41 to 655 zzso in zzso These events result in the zzso zzso of dozens of genes and in some cases in the formation of zzso open reading frames at the junction of the duplicated zzso The types of sequences at the zzso as well as their zzso with the replication map suggest that spontaneous large zzso zzso result from replication zzso zzso events or zzso zzso that do not involve large-scale zzso accounted for the rest of the zzso events (in 26 and zzso of the zzso zzso
