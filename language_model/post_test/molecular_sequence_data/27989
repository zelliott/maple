The molecular properties of zzso zzso type D South African zzso were compared with those of zzso from type D strain zzso zzso and type C strains Stockholm and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the culture zzso in an overall yield of zzso consisted of an intact zzso chain with a molecular weight of zzso Limited zzso of the toxin by zzso formed a zzso structure consisting of a light chain zzso zzso and a heavy chain zzso zzso linked by a zzso zzso and enhanced the lethal activity about zzso zzso against the zzso toxin light chain reacted with zzso toxin but not with C1 zzso On the other hand, zzso against the heavy chain of zzso toxin zzso with type C strain Stockholm, zzso and type C strain zzso toxins in that zzso zzso sequences of heavy and light chains of zzso and zzso toxins were similar but not zzso These results indicate that within the type D zzso zzso differ in molecular structure and zzso
