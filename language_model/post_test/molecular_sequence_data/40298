zzso plays a central role in the global nitrogen cycle and is responsible for significant losses of nitrogen zzso atmospheric pollution by the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, and nitrate pollution of zzso zzso zzso the first step in zzso was thought to be performed by zzso bacteria until the recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cultivated from marine and zzso spring zzso but the relative importance of bacteria and zzso in soil zzso is unclear and it is believed that soil zzso zzso zzso may use organic zzso rather than growing zzso In this soil microcosm study, stable isotope probing was used to demonstrate incorporation of zzso carbon dioxide into the zzso of zzso possessing two functional zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso that zzso the first step in zzso zzso and zzso a key gene in the zzso zzso cycle, which has been found so far only in zzso zzso was accompanied by increases in zzso zzso gene abundance and changes in zzso gene diversity, but no change was observed in bacterial zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso genes were also detected in zzso DNA, demonstrating zzso zzso fixation by zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was further supported by coordinate increases in zzso and zzso gene abundance in zzso zzso The results therefore provide direct evidence for a role for zzso in soil zzso zzso and demonstrate zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
