The zzso acid sequence of rat zzso protein zzso the major zzso in the zzso was deduced from the sequence of zzso in two zzso zzso and confirmed from the sequence of zzso acids in portions of the zzso zzso protein zzso contains zzso zzso acids and has a molecular weight of zzso The protein has 15 zzso zzso 7 are located in the zzso sequence of 15 zzso acids and probably include most if not all of the zzso that are zzso There are related repeated sequences of 10 zzso acids each that occur at four separate positions in zzso and that are very zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso (the extent of the identity is zzso and most likely also to zzso zzso zzso
