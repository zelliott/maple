zzso gene repeats from zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso family of the zzso zzso of the zzso were isolated by zzso amplification and zzso The presence of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso is consistent with the zzso status of this zzso as a zzso zzso Two families of repeats were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso each of which encodes an approximately zzso zzso zzso The zzso repeats also contain a complete zzso zzso gene on the complementary zzso The zzso repeats contain a defective copy of a zzso zzso in which the zzso portion is zzso The zzso regions between the zzso of the zzso genes and the zzso zzso genes in the zzso and zzso repeats are highly zzso All or most zzso genes and zzso genes are located within either the zzso or the zzso zzso The zzso repeats were localized to a zzso zzso while the zzso repeats were localized within at least 4 large zzso
