Signal recognition particle zzso mediates targeting of proteins to appropriate cellular zzso which is an important process in all living zzso In zzso zzso consists of zzso a zzso and zzso zzso that recognizes signal zzso emerging from zzso The zzso zzso of one the most successful zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated with respect to zzso zzso In the present study, zzso of zzso tuberculosis was zzso and was confirmed to be a zzso using thin layer zzso and zzso green zzso The zzso binding ability was confirmed by zzso overlay zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso tuberculosis was zzso by in zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was confirmed by overlay zzso and zzso gel shift zzso The results show that the zzso properties of zzso tuberculosis zzso have been zzso and this is the first report that shows the interaction of components of zzso in zzso zzso namely zzso protein and zzso zzso
