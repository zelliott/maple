zzso acid zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso zzso of zzso acids to zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso Unlike the zzso counterpart, the zzso application of zzso has not been thoroughly advanced because of the difficulties in their expression as zzso protein in zzso zzso In this work, zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso only) was efficiently produced as zzso protein in zzso coli in the active form as zzso This zzso zzso shows the classical properties of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso shows distinctive features that makes it attractive for zzso zzso high zzso stability (it is fully stable up to zzso and high temperature zzso stable activity in a broad range of pH zzso weak zzso by the product zzso and by zzso and tight binding of the zzso zzso This latter property significantly zzso zzso from the zzso coli zzso zzso represents an appropriate novel zzso for the production of zzso and a zzso protein scaffold to evolve a zzso activity by protein zzso
