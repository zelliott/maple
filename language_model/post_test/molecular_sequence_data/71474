The zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of the powerful zzso promoter in zzso zzso insect cells, is mainly found in an zzso zzso zzso It is zzso in an active form under the control of the zzso promoter, a somewhat weaker and earlier promoter, at the price of a lower zzso The apparent molecular masses of the two species zzso by the same zzso are 48 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relationship between the extent and type of zzso and the zzso targeting for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated precisely with zzso zzso of various zzso and a zzso zzso and tested with zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that the strong zzso promoter probably overwhelms the processing capacity of the zzso in zzso cells, so that only a zzso precursor is expressed in large zzso Only a minute amount of protein is zzso which has been processed by zzso zzso and bears zzso zzso The weaker zzso promoter allows zzso of a mature and active zzso zzso bearing complex zzso An important zzso zzso is also added zzso on this zzso In particular, zzso and zzso acid zzso were specifically detected in the zzso species, evidence of the induction of the corresponding zzso or of their zzso These results suggest that zzso cells should eventually be engineered with zzso and zzso in order to improve the production of demanding zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso so as to open the way to resolution of the three-dimensional structures of these zzso
