DNA zzso I from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso using the cloned zzso zzso from cells zzso DNA zzso I were prepared and incubated with zzso zzso zzso was used to trap the zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the DNA was zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso I was subjected to zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso From the molecular weights of the zzso labeled peptides and by comparison of the zzso acid sequences derived from the cloned zzso we were able to deduce that the active site zzso of zzso DNA zzso I is very near the zzso zzso at zzso acid 771 for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to change zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso I to a zzso The resulting zzso zzso I protein lost all DNA relaxation activity and rendered cells resistant to the zzso I zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of human zzso I has significant similarity to the two zzso zzso I zzso Based on this zzso we zzso that zzso zzso is the active site zzso of human zzso
