Changes in genes zzso zzso regulators can alter development and are important components of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso regulators of diverse and important biological zzso In plants, zzso genes regulate zzso fruit, zzso and root zzso Recent sequencing efforts in zzso have allowed a nearly complete sampling of the zzso gene family from a single plant, something that was lacking in previous zzso zzso To test the zzso parallel between the evolution of the zzso gene family and the evolution of plant form, a polarized gene zzso is zzso Here we suggest that a gene zzso ancestral to the divergence of plants and animals gave rise to two main lineages of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We locate the root of the zzso zzso gene family between these two zzso A novel zzso group of plant zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be more closely related to previously identified animal zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso Most other plant sequences form a clear zzso group with animal zzso zzso to form zzso zzso Only plant zzso members have a K domain that is downstream of the zzso domain in most plant members previously zzso This suggests that the K domain evolved after the zzso that gave rise to the two zzso Finally, a group of intermediate plant sequences could be the result of zzso zzso These analyses may guide the search for zzso sequences in zzso zzso and the zzso placement of new genes from other plant zzso
