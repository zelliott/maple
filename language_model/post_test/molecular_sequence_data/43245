zzso are the precursors of potent zzso peptides that have been identified in several zzso zzso Prior work has suggested that members of this gene family can participate in host defense through their zzso effects and activate zzso cells during wound zzso To permit further study of these proteins a reverse zzso chain reaction approach was used to identify potential mouse zzso A full-length zzso pair zzso clone was obtained zzso an zzso zzso domain zzso to other zzso and a unique zzso zzso This zzso named zzso for zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso 9 at a region of zzso zzso to which genes for zzso have been mapped in pig and zzso Northern zzso analysis detected a zzso transcript that was expressed in adult bone zzso and during zzso as early as zzso the earliest stage of blood zzso zzso zzso chain reaction also detected zzso expression in adult zzso zzso stomach, and zzso but not in brain, liver, heart, or skeletal zzso To evaluate further the expression and function of zzso a zzso corresponding to the predicted zzso region was zzso CD spectral analysis showed that zzso will form an zzso zzso similar to other zzso zzso zzso studies showed zzso to be a potent zzso against zzso bacteria by zzso growth of a variety of bacterial strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso the inner membrane of zzso coli directly at 1 zzso zzso against zzso revealed abundant expression in zzso precursors and zzso Thus, zzso represents the first zzso zzso found in cells of zzso lineage in the zzso These data suggest that inflammatory cells in the mouse can use a zzso mechanism for microbial killing and permit use of the mouse to study the role such peptides play in host defense and wound zzso
