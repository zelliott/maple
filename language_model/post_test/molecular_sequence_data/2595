The DNA sequence of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso multiple zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso was determined and compared with the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this information, a transfer zzso was constructed based on the zzso I zzso of zzso in which the zzso promoter was replaced by the zzso region extending zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso coding zzso The zzso coli zzso gene was also included downstream from the putative zzso zzso zzso of this transfer zzso with zzso zzso DNA produced stable zzso viruses expressing the zzso gene under the control of the zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso produced by these zzso in infected cells were zzso lower than the expression level obtained from viruses with the authentic zzso promoter in front of the zzso zzso The zzso promoter has thus been shown to function efficiently in the genetic environment of zzso The implications of this finding for the release of genetically manipulated zzso zzso and for the construction of zzso multiple expression zzso are zzso
