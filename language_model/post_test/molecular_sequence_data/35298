zzso zzso zzso zzso are the most common class of zzso sensing signal molecules zzso that have been reported to be essential for zzso of many relevant zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso New approach for controlling infections of such bacteria is through zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of the crude zzso from a zzso zzso zzso was zzso The crude zzso was found to have relatively high zzso stability and was stable in pH range 6 to zzso The crude zzso extract was found to have zzso activity of zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso activity was achieved within a range of zzso and pH zzso None of the metals used enhanced the activity neither did zzso inhibit zzso However, a concentration of 10 zzso zzso reduced the activity to zzso zzso activity and kinetic zzso were determined using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity using synthetic standard signals displayed broad spectrum of zzso The zzso was found to be zzso Isolation and complete zzso sequence of the respective zzso gene were done and submitted to the zzso database under zzso code zzso
