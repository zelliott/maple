zzso zzso zzso at zzso sites of protein chain release factors plays a pivotal role in the termination of zzso We report here the crystal structure of the zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in a zzso complex with the zzso product zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso a putative zzso binding domain at the N zzso consisting of a five zzso bundle and a zzso zzso domain at the C zzso that harbors the binding site for zzso The two zzso are linked by a zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso family revealed 11 zzso zzso functioning in zzso binding and zzso of zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso are structurally similar, despite the fact that they share very little sequence zzso When the two proteins are aligned zzso the zzso zzso domain is subject to approximately 10 degrees of hinge movement relative to the zzso zzso The apparent hinge mobility of the two zzso may reflect functional importance during the reaction zzso Comparative zzso analysis of the zzso gene and its frequent neighbor zzso zzso which encodes a major zzso provides evidence for several examples of lateral gene zzso
