The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso type zinc finger zzso has been zzso The zzso gene has a predicted zzso acid open reading frame, zzso a putative 61 zzso zinc finger zzso The zzso of the zzso coding region has a zzso zzso box zzso domain that consists of zzso box A and B, whereas the zzso contains a zzso type zzso zinc finger domain possessing nine zzso zinc finger motifs in tandem zzso with the highly zzso space region of the zzso Each zzso zinc finger motif has a typical consensus sequence of zzso A zzso zzso transcript specific for zzso was expressed at high levels in the zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso and zzso expressed in the zzso zzso small zzso colon zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although there was no zzso zzso zzso in zzso human peripheral T cells, it was first zzso zzso h after zzso by zzso plus zzso and reached a maximum in zzso zzso During the cell cycle progression of zzso T cells, the expression of zzso zzso appeared to be induced in zzso and reached a maximum in the S phase, but declined as the cells entered the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso which also resulted in growth arrest, zzso the expression of zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is a novel gene zzso a zzso type zzso zinc finger protein and is regulated at the zzso level depending on tissue type and the cell cycle status to support cell zzso
