zzso zzso contains zzso coli zzso DNA zzso Lon zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso zzso A zzso resistance cassette was used in the construction of zzso and deletion zzso in zzso the gene zzso zzso on zzso zzso The reconstructed plasmids were zzso and used to introduce zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso These zzso as expected, mapped in the zzso region of the zzso coli zzso by zzso zzso zzso linkage to zzso Southern zzso zzso of zzso fragments verified that zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso with no indication of gene zzso All the zzso strains had growth rates identical to that of zzso zzso coli, were resistant to zzso zzso and zzso and supported the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The only zzso zzso variation was a reduced zzso plaque size on the zzso zzso zzso however, the yield of zzso zzso in liquid zzso prepared from the zzso strains was indistinguishable from the yield for the wild zzso
