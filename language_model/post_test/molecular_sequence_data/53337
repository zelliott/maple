We have tested the hypothesis that zzso class I molecules are actively involved as zzso in the production of natural zzso class I zzso First, the structure of a class I zzso was analyzed for zzso with zzso sites of known zzso While several clusters of zzso acids in the restriction element resembled zzso active sites, structural discrepancies and the influence of nearby zzso suggest that these sites are unlikely to have zzso zzso Second, we have tested the presentation of viral zzso T cell zzso with affinity for the same restriction element zzso or zzso when targeted as tandem peptides into the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used to exclude zzso of the tandem peptides by zzso zzso zzso by signal zzso of the tandem peptides was zzso The zzso peptides in the tandem zzso were almost exclusively zzso suggesting that an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso positioned zzso This result is inconsistent with an zzso class zzso zzso following binding of longer peptides in the zzso of the restriction zzso Finally, we zzso show that an zzso in the zzso zzso is also involved in zzso presentation in cells with a functional zzso zzso
