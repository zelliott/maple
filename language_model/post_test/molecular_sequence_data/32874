zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most abundant protein in the zzso outer zzso The structure of zzso has been predicted to be a zzso zzso with an zzso at the N zzso It is a matter of debate as to whether this putative zzso plays a structural role as a component of the pore walls or a function in the pore zzso We have zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined its structure by CD and zzso zzso CD studies show that the zzso zzso exists in zzso zzso as an zzso zzso with no stable secondary zzso In zzso zzso zzso or zzso however, it assumes an zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso as deduced from zzso No ordered structure was observed in zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso were carried out in order to examine the membrane affinity of the zzso Upon interaction with the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited distinctive zzso suggesting that zzso play an important zzso zzso between the zzso and artificial zzso indicates that the zzso lies on the membrane zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso devoid of seven or 19 zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases the number of zzso cells with zzso zzso and this effect is progressively reduced in cells zzso with zzso lacking those seven or 19 zzso zzso The zzso targeting of the deletion zzso is zzso The overall picture emerging from our experiments is that the zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the proper function of this protein during zzso zzso
