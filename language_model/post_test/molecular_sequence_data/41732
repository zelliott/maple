zzso is a zzso zzso binding protein of zzso I zzso It is found in zzso complex I zzso zzso one of the zzso complexes produced by zzso zzso of zzso Two types of evidence are presented to indicate that assembly of zzso into zzso proceeds through a membrane zzso First, when zzso is briefly imported into zzso or isolated zzso we initially observe a zzso membrane form of zzso that is subsequently converted into zzso The conversion of the zzso form into zzso does not require zzso or zzso Second, zzso treatment of zzso containing zzso zzso indicates that there are at least two membrane forms of the mature zzso zzso The zzso form is completely resistant to zzso a second form of the protein is zzso by zzso into 12- and zzso zzso We interpret this to mean that the intermediate is a zzso form that becomes zzso resistant during zzso This notion is supported by the observation that zzso in zzso is largely zzso by zzso into 12- and zzso zzso whereas zzso in isolated zzso particles is zzso zzso In zzso we generated a zzso form of zzso zzso that was able to integrate into zzso zzso but was unable to assemble into zzso The membrane form of zzso like zzso was predominantly zzso by zzso into 12- and zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso protein is arrested at an intermediate stage in the assembly zzso of zzso Based on its mobility in zzso gels and its zzso to zzso zzso we suggest that the intermediate form is zzso We propose the following distinct stages in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is integrated into the zzso zzso zzso is rapidly bound to zzso forming zzso and zzso zzso assembles into the native zzso zzso
