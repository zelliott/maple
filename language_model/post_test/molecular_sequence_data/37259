Natural transformation in zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso system that acts through zzso and sensing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to control many zzso genes acting in DNA zzso processing, and zzso The period of competence induced by zzso lasts only 15 zzso zzso peak zzso The recently identified regulator zzso is required for the zzso expression of many zzso genes that share an unusual consensus sequence zzso at their promoter zzso To test the hypothesis that this regulator acts as a transient alternative zzso factor, zzso was zzso from an zzso coli zzso strain and core zzso zzso was zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso produced transcripts for the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso Western zzso using zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso revealed a transient presence of zzso for a period of 15 to 20 zzso after zzso treatment, while zzso zzso remained at a constant level and zzso remained between 60 and zzso of its normal zzso zzso reached a zzso ratio to zzso zzso of at least zzso We conclude that zzso is unstable and acts as a zzso zzso zzso
