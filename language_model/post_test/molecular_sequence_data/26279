zzso of pathogens zzso zzso and indicator bacteria zzso zzso was achieved by multiplex zzso zzso amplification of diagnostic gene sequences and by zzso to immobilized zzso capture zzso using a zzso or zzso zzso Complex zzso of primer zzso and staggered additions of zzso were required in order to achieve equal amplification of multiple zzso zzso zzso amplification of two different zzso zzso one specific for zzso zzso zzso and the other for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved by staggered zzso zzso zzso amplification using differing amounts of zzso specific for zzso and zzso genes permitted the detection of zzso bacteria and those associated with human zzso contamination, including the indicator bacterial species zzso coli and enteric pathogens zzso and zzso zzso of zzso amplified DNA, in which the zzso was incorporated during zzso amplification from zzso to immobilized zzso capture zzso permitted specific and sensitive detection of target gene zzso The sensitivity of zzso detection achieved by zzso amplification of target DNA was at a level equivalent to 1-2 bacterial cells, which is the same level of sensitivity obtained with radioactive zzso The simultaneous amplification of several genes and zzso to immobilized capture zzso with zzso detection is an effective, efficient and rapid detection method for various human bacterial zzso
