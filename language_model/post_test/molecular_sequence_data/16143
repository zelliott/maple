We have previously shown that transcript levels expressed from the zzso zzso gene zzso periodically during the zzso cell zzso However, it was not known whether periodic expression resulted from a regulatory mechanism acting at the level of zzso or a regulatory mechanism acting at the level of cell cycle zzso changes in the stability of the zzso zzso In this report we now show that the periodic expression of zzso transcript is primarily controlled at the level of its zzso by sequences which are upstream of its zzso initiation zzso We also localized the upstream sequences necessary for periodic zzso to a zzso region and show that this region encodes an zzso with the properties of a periodic upstream zzso zzso The regulatory region defined in this study apparently does not contain consensus sequences similar to those reported for the cell zzso HO zzso or for the zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso
