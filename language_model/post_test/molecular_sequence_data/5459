zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso is composed of a zzso zzso zzso and a regulatory zzso of 85 zzso or 55 zzso We have cloned a gene for a regulatory zzso from zzso zzso named zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein containing two zzso zzso with significant sequence zzso to those in zzso and zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso is missing the zzso domain and the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso The short zzso as well as the zzso of the zzso protein show no identity to the known zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it is a new member in the family of regulatory zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis indicate a widespread function of this gene during zzso and in the zzso
