zzso roles of the zzso region of zzso zzso family remain zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso receptors as a model system, we zzso the roles of the zzso region in the zzso zzso trafficking of zzso zzso and explored the critical factors that determine the functionality of the zzso zzso 

The zzso region of the zzso zzso was gradually shortened or switched with that of the zzso zzso or a zzso sequence zzso or potential zzso zzso sites were zzso zzso of these zzso on surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

Shortening the zzso region of the zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and impaired surface expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not affected but their association with a particular zzso zzso was zzso Replacement of critical zzso within the zzso region with the zzso zzso failed to restore surface expression but partially restored the altered zzso and zzso When the zzso regions were switched between zzso and zzso zzso cell surface expression pattern of each zzso was zzso zzso of potential zzso zzso sites inhibited surface expression but enhanced zzso of zzso zzso 

Shortening of zzso or zzso of zzso sites located within the zzso enhanced zzso zzso but impaired the surface expression of zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso in a zzso manner, controls the zzso zzso and integration into the plasma zzso which determine its zzso zzso zzso trafficking and zzso zzso
