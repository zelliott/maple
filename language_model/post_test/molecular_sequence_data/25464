The barley gene zzso zzso I of zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso region zzso included 1885 zzso of the zzso region, the entire coding region, an zzso of zzso zzso and 792 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be regulated at the level of zzso zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso in barley zzso The zzso for zzso II zzso accumulated zzso relative to the zzso for zzso I zzso in zzso zzso isolated from material including both the zzso and the zzso zzso The gene family zzso zzso zzso in barley was found to be comprised of two closely related zzso zzso I and II, as well as several related sequences that could be identified by Southern zzso zzso The zzso sequence for the zzso untranslated leader and the coding region for the signal zzso of the zzso II transcript were determined from a zzso produced by the zzso chain zzso The structure of the protein zzso by the zzso I gene is also zzso
