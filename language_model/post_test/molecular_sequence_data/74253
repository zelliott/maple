In zzso zzso and zzso signaling regulate the determination of many cell types, and yet how these common signals generate zzso zzso is not well zzso In the compound eye, zzso zzso is transcribed specifically in zzso zzso and cone zzso We show that the zzso of pros is activated by two zzso zzso zzso Glass and zzso zzso that bind to an zzso and promote its zzso Together with the zzso zzso factor zzso these factors work in a highly zzso manner, such that cells missing any one factor transcribe pros only zzso if at zzso However, the factors are not sufficient to activate the zzso because of an additional requirement for both zzso and zzso zzso The loss of zzso signaling produces a zzso and zzso effect, with some cells expressing zzso levels and others expressing no zzso pros at all; thus, the signaling loss does not produce a zzso reduced level of zzso activity in zzso This suggests a zzso zzso in which zzso signals influence the likelihood that the zzso is inactive or fully active in any given zzso The activity level, therefore, is dictated by the proper combination of highly cooperative zzso and zzso factors present in the zzso
