zzso zzso zzso protein of 30 zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein of 31 zzso are zzso plant proteins that we have identified, zzso and cloned from the medicinal plants zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso agents are capable of zzso infection of zzso type 1 zzso in T zzso and zzso as well as replication of the virus in zzso zzso They are not toxic to normal zzso cells because they are unable to enter healthy zzso zzso and zzso also possess an zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso and a zzso activity on zzso and viral zzso including zzso long terminal repeats zzso zzso are essential sites for integration of viral DNA into the host zzso by viral zzso We therefore investigated the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso We report that both of these zzso agents exhibit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed in all of the three specific reactions zzso by the zzso zzso 3' processing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the viral zzso strand transfer zzso and zzso (the reversal of strand zzso zzso was studied by using zzso zzso with sequences corresponding to the zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso In the presence of 20 zzso of viral zzso 50 zzso of target zzso and 4 zzso zzso total zzso was achieved at zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso with zzso values of about 1 zzso zzso of viral DNA into the host zzso is a vital step in the zzso cycle of zzso including the AIDS zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso suggests that impediment of viral DNA integration may play a key role in the zzso activity of these plant zzso
