zzso zzso zzso degrades steroids such as testosterone via zzso of the A ring, followed by zzso of the zzso In the DNA region upstream of the zzso zzso gene zzso two genes required during zzso acid degradation for the inversion of an zzso zzso group on zzso were zzso A zzso zzso converts 7 zzso zzso to 7 zzso and a zzso zzso converts the latter to 7 zzso zzso Both zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso The transformation of 7 zzso zzso to 7 zzso zzso is carried out far more effectively when both zzso and zzso are involved zzso These two zzso are zzso by two adjacent genes and are presumed to be expressed zzso zzso of the zzso group at zzso is indispensable for the subsequent effective zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition to the compounds already mentioned, 12 zzso and 12 zzso were identified as minor intermediate compounds in zzso acid degradation by zzso zzso zzso
