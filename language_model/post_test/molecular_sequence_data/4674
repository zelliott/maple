zzso zzso is a zzso fungus with a limited life zzso Life span is controlled by nuclear and zzso genetic zzso zzso we report the nature of four zzso in the nuclear gene zzso that lead to an altered zzso a zzso in the formation of female zzso and an increased life zzso Three sequence changes are located in the zzso upstream region of the zzso zzso One zzso is a G zzso A transition at the zzso zzso site of the single zzso of the zzso leading to a zzso zzso zzso This zzso affects the amplification of the first zzso of the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I gene zzso and the specific zzso DNA zzso that occur during zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the nuclear gene zzso is part of a molecular machinery involved in the control of zzso DNA zzso These DNA zzso accelerate but are not a prerequisite for the aging of zzso zzso zzso
