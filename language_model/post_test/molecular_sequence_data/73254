zzso recognized zzso zzso proteins such as zzso are zzso across the zzso zzso zzso in a signal recognition particle zzso zzso Recent studies revealed that there are two recognition steps for signal peptides during this zzso The first step is recognition by zzso which results in zzso arrest, and the second step is interaction between signal peptides and the zzso channel embedded in the zzso zzso To determine the roles of the zzso region of signal peptides in the recognition by zzso and the zzso zzso machinery, we constructed zzso proteins consisting of the mature region of zzso and signal peptides containing different numbers of zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso proteins was completely dependent on zzso and the efficiency increased as the number of zzso zzso increased up to 10 and then zzso Although the efficiency of zzso arrest also increased as the number of zzso zzso increased up to 10, it only slightly decreased as the number increased up to zzso Similar results were obtained when the zzso region was replaced by alternate zzso and zzso zzso except that the most efficient zzso occurred when the number was zzso Taken together, the present results suggests that the total zzso of the zzso region of signal peptides is a zzso for recognition by both zzso and the zzso zzso machinery, although the zzso of the two signal recognition steps are slightly different from each zzso
