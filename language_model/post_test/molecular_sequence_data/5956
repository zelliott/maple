zzso are zzso zzso involved in cell zzso and plaque formation in zzso zzso Three distinct zzso the products of different zzso have been found in bovine zzso We have reported previously that one of these, zzso is expressed only in zzso and lower zzso layers of zzso zzso Using zzso we have now obtained the complete zzso coding sequence of mature bovine zzso It has alternatively spliced zzso and zzso forms found in other zzso but is unique in having a 43 instead of a 46 base pair zzso We have zzso a zzso zzso zzso which is specific for the zzso zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso confirms that this zzso is found only in zzso zzso being strongly expressed in the zzso cell layers of these zzso The intensity of expression fades gradually in the zzso layers and disappears completely below the upper limit of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in cell zzso zzso
