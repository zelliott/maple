The aim of this study was to test the relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and host ethnicity at the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso DNA samples were isolated from 31 patients across zzso Ugandan ethnic zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso gene were used to construct a zzso zzso zzso 

A5 and B1 zzso predominated with no evidence of distinct ethnic or geographic zzso A new zzso zzso zzso was identified in a member of the zzso zzso tribe and a new zzso B zzso zzso among members of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso may yet be structured by host ethnicity if members of Ugandan groups have convoluted biological origins, even as they identify with single zzso An alternative possibility is that zzso zzso evolution may have preceded major diversification of sub-Saharan Africans into zzso as we know them today, with ethnic groups beginning their histories already hosting multiple zzso A third alternative is that horizontal transmission of multiple zzso zzso may have broken up vertical lineages of the virus passed down within Ugandan zzso
