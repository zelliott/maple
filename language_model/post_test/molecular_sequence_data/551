Outside the zzso regions, the zzso sex zzso are thought to have been genetically isolated for up to 350 million zzso However, in humans zzso zzso zzso occur in zzso zzso regions, causing zzso and zzso Gene conversion might accompany zzso zzso that resolve without zzso and persist in the zzso We zzso X and Y copies of a zzso hotspot adjacent to the zzso and zzso genes and found evidence of historical exchange between the zzso region of the human Y and the X in zzso zzso zzso tracts on both zzso The rate of zzso conversion zzso base per zzso is four to five orders of magnitude more rapid than the rate of zzso zzso zzso and given assumptions about the zzso history of the X zzso tract lengths have an overall average length of approximately 100 zzso zzso exchange outside the zzso regions could play a role in protecting the zzso copies of zzso genes from zzso
