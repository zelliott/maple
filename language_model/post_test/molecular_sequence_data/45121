Recently discovered type III zzso zzso exert their zzso and zzso activities through a unique zzso complex composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso To further study type III zzso we cloned and characterized mouse zzso zzso zzso We showed that, similar to their human zzso zzso and zzso signal through the zzso zzso complex, activate zzso zzso gene factor 3, and are capable of inducing zzso protection and zzso class I zzso expression in several cell types including zzso melanoma zzso We then used the zzso zzso melanoma model to investigate the potential zzso activities of zzso We developed zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated their zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso expression of zzso in melanoma cells did not affect their proliferation in zzso the growth of zzso cells, when injected zzso into mice, was either retarded or completely zzso We found that rejection of the modified tumor cells correlated with their level of zzso zzso We then developed zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and showed that their zzso was also highly impaired or completely abolished similar to zzso cells, suggesting that zzso engage host mechanisms to inhibit melanoma zzso These in zzso experiments show the zzso activities of zzso and suggest their strong therapeutic zzso
