The zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso interacts with two classes of zzso The regulatory zzso zzso types I and II, associate to form an inactive zzso complex that is activated in response to zzso The zzso is also inhibited by small zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso requires the synergistic zzso binding of zzso The stabilizing effect of zzso was zzso by using zzso gel zzso Both the type I zzso and the zzso complex in the presence of zzso show apparent zzso for zzso association that are below zzso zzso while in the absence of zzso the apparent zzso are 125 zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the two zzso In the absence of zzso both complexes also can be zzso readily and, zzso activated by zzso zzso Under zzso salt zzso zzso zzso would be substantial in the absence of the zzso binding of zzso In both complexes, the zzso activity of the free zzso is zzso The off rates for zzso also indicate that the type I zzso is more stable than the zzso zzso The off rate zzso for zzso from the zzso complex is 17 zzso while the off rate for the type I zzso is zzso zzso When the zzso complex is incubated with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso forming zzso In contrast, free zzso cannot compete for the zzso when it is part of a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
