zzso D zzso has emerged as an important zzso involved in signal zzso zzso trafficking, and membrane zzso This report describes the cloning and expression of a new zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and codes for an zzso acid protein of zzso Da with a zzso of zzso zzso shares a zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso but only a zzso identity with zzso A potential zzso zzso site is found in zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso active zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and its activity requires zzso Both zzso and zzso are most active at zzso zzso zzso whereas the optimal zzso activity requires zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso bound zzso in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This binding ability zzso with the degree of conservation of a basic zzso motif located near the putative zzso zzso The binding of zzso was zzso and could be competitively decreased by addition of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the activities of zzso and zzso but not zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is zzso by a zzso gene family and that direct zzso binding is required for the activities of zzso and zzso but not zzso The different structural and zzso properties suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are regulated differently and may mediate unique cellular zzso
