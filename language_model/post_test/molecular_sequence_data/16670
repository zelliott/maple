zzso of proteins across zzso is essential for the zzso of each cell and is achieved by zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso complex of the zzso space from zzso and identified a zzso protein associated with the zzso zzso zzso is an outer envelope protein exposing a soluble domain into the zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso and stimulates the zzso activity of zzso The zzso stability and the ability to stimulate zzso are dependent on a zzso bridge within the loop region of the zzso suggesting a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso and zzso Its zzso recruits the zzso of outer envelope membrane to the zzso space zzso and zzso its interaction to the zzso
