The rat zzso zzso gene is a model system to study zzso regulation by zzso zzso We analyzed zzso factor binding to the zzso zzso gene zzso unit zzso at zzso zzso using in zzso zzso studies with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso At this zzso zzso zzso triggers a disruption of the zzso zzso We show here that various regulatory pathways affect zzso factor binding to this zzso The binding differs in two closely related zzso zzso cell zzso In line zzso zzso induction promotes the recruitment of zzso nuclear factor 3 zzso presumably through the zzso zzso However, the footprint of the zzso zzso zzso is not visible, even though a regular but transient interaction of the zzso is necessary to maintain zzso zzso In contrast, in line zzso zzso binds to the zzso in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso showing that a zzso zzso zzso does not repress the binding of certain zzso factors in a uniform zzso In zzso cells, the footprint of the zzso is zzso but this requires the zzso of protein zzso zzso In addition, protein zzso A stimulation also improves the recruitment of zzso independently of zzso and enhances the zzso response zzso by this zzso in an zzso zzso In conclusion, the differences in the behavior of this regulatory sequence in the two cell lines show that various regulatory pathways are integrated at this zzso through zzso of interrelated events: zzso factor binding to DNA and zzso zzso
