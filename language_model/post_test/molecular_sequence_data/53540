An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso P zzso patent zzso has been isolated from farm soil situated underneath a zzso heap in northern zzso zzso zzso which stained negative in the Gram test, occurs as short rods which sometimes form zzso Its spores are zzso central to zzso and occur in swollen zzso It grows at temperatures up to 63 degrees C and in the pH range zzso When grown on zzso in optimal conditions, its doubling time was found to be 33 zzso CO2 was observed to have a zzso effect at the start of the zzso In addition to zzso the isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Growth is inhibited by zzso zzso The zzso content of strain zzso is zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso falls into the radiation of the zzso subdivision of the zzso zzso Its three closest zzso relatives are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with identity values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids are zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso the isolate is different enough for it to be considered as a member of a new zzso It is therefore proposed that this isolate represents a new zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the type strain of zzso zzso has been deposited in the Collection zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso as a patent zzso
