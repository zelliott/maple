It is possible to direct selections from zzso zzso displayed on zzso zzso towards unique zzso on protein zzso by competing with related zzso A zzso display repertoire of human single chain zzso zzso was panned three times against zzso zzso zzso The selection was dominated by one clone with a zzso of 10 zzso but yielded at least 17 others, all of which bound zzso but zzso with adult zzso zzso To direct selection towards zzso zzso the repertoire was zzso with zzso in solution before each zzso zzso zzso can form complexes with the soluble zzso and thereby be prevented from binding the immobilized zzso Four clones with preferential binding to zzso emerged under these zzso One of these zzso with a zzso of 6 zzso had exquisite specificity for zzso and could distinguish cells expressing zzso from those expressing zzso by zzso and flow zzso This zzso has an affinity that is zzso lower than the dominant zzso zzso and so only emerged under conditions of zzso zzso Thus, competitive zzso is a viable means for directing selections towards useful zzso It permits a more effective zzso of zzso display zzso and allows the emergence of lower affinity clones with useful zzso These clones may be useful in themselves or may serve as leads for in zzso affinity zzso
