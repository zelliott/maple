DNA samples from 60 unrelated Belgian zzso patients were subjected to zzso analysis of zzso 4 of the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility bands were detected in 2 patients and the underlying zzso were characterized by DNA sequence zzso Both zzso a zzso zzso at zzso 141 and a zzso deletion at zzso zzso produce premature stop zzso in the highly zzso zzso binding domain of the mature zzso zzso data indicated that zzso between short direct repeats during DNA replication is the most probable mechanism by which these zzso could have zzso Our observations are consistent with an zzso zzso mechanism of zzso
