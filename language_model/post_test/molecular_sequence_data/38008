The zzso binding protein II gene zzso zzso has been highly zzso among zzso zzso and zzso The promoter region of the zzso zzso II gene zzso zzso was investigated in this zzso zzso extension analysis demonstrated that there are multiple sites for starting zzso The promoter region of zzso II gene contains a zzso island but lacks a zzso box, suggesting that the zzso II zzso is transcribed by a zzso zzso Two zzso factor binding sites zzso the major zzso start site were confirmed by gel shift zzso The zzso level of the zzso II gene in zzso increases during zzso and zzso II protein accumulates densely in the zzso of zzso and round zzso
