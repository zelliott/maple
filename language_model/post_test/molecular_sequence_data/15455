zzso is expressed mainly on the surface of T helper cells, where it functions as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso class II zzso In this study we describe the cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso from Atlantic zzso zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein has four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was structurally similar to other zzso zzso previously described in fish and zzso Real time zzso analysis showed that the highest levels of zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso while lower expression was also seen in the zzso zzso anterior and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the relatively high expression of zzso zzso seen in zzso by real time zzso analysis, and showed that zzso expressing cells were zzso mainly in the zzso zzso Only moderate changes in the levels of zzso zzso expression were observed during the 48 h zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso
