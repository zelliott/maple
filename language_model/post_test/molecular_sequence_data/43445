zzso II alpha is a nuclear zzso involved in zzso segregation and other essential cellular zzso It is also the target of several clinically important zzso agents such as the zzso zzso zzso We have previously described a zzso lung cancer cell line, zzso that expresses reduced levels of two species of zzso II zzso zzso and a zzso active, predominantly zzso zzso II zzso protein that is 10 zzso smaller than the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cancer zzso 53, zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cancer zzso 54, zzso The smaller zzso zzso zzso zzso is missing zzso zzso of zzso coding and zzso sequence at its 3' end resulting in an zzso predicted to zzso a truncated zzso missing three previously zzso potential zzso zzso nuclear zzso signals zzso zzso zzso zzso & Cole, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso 55, zzso We have now determined the structure of the larger zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso and show that it is missing 684 zzso of zzso 3' coding and zzso sequence between zzso positions zzso and zzso This sequence is replaced by zzso zzso of new zzso containing an zzso stop zzso after 41 zzso The translation product of the zzso zzso zzso is predicted to contain 13 new zzso acids replacing the zzso 109 zzso of zzso zzso II zzso producing a truncated zzso of approximately 160 zzso zzso analyses using zzso against the unique zzso 13 and 34 zzso acids zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, confirmed that both zzso are zzso zzso zzso analysis and sequencing of the zzso region of the zzso gene in the zzso and zzso DNA revealed that a partial deletion has occurred in zzso and the novel sequence identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is derived from the adjacent 3' zzso as a consequence of zzso at a zzso zzso donor zzso These observations suggest a mechanism for the generation of the two zzso zzso II alpha zzso in zzso cells and provide the first reported example of a drug resistant cell line containing two different zzso forms of zzso II zzso
