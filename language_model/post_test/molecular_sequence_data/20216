zzso and potent zzso zzso are indispensable for the dissection of the intricate pathways leading to zzso We selected a designed zzso repeat protein zzso from a zzso library that zzso zzso in zzso with a zzso zzso constant and, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso with very high specificity for this particular zzso The crystal structure of this inhibitor zzso in complex with zzso reveals the molecular basis for the specificity and, together with kinetic zzso the zzso mechanism of zzso The structure also shows a zzso of the active site that can be exploited for the design of zzso zzso zzso is a specific inhibitor of an zzso zzso and has the potential to help identify the function of zzso in the complex biological zzso signaling zzso
