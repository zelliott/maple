The zzso gene from zzso zzso was randomly zzso by zzso zzso to obtain zzso zzso followed by screening for zzso zzso zzso Out of about 2,600 zzso four zzso clones were zzso Their zzso sequences showed that they had two or three zzso acid zzso Analysis of the zzso stabilization of these zzso zzso indicated that zzso to zzso and zzso to Pro zzso were essential for the increased stability of the zzso We expressed a zzso zzso zzso having only the zzso to zzso zzso and another zzso having only the zzso to Pro zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso them, and then confirmed that the temperature which causes a 50% decrease in the activity of the zzso zzso on treatment for 30 zzso was increased by zzso and 3 degrees C, respectively, compared to the zzso zzso However, the zzso stability of the zzso zzso zzso having both zzso was increased only by zzso degrees zzso These zzso zzso were stabilized through a decrease in zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso were decreased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso and zzso were also increased, especially at alkaline zzso Based on these results, the zzso structure and mechanism of stabilization of the zzso were zzso
