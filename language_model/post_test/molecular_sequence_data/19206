Control of surface expression of inwardly zzso zzso zzso channels is important for regulating membrane zzso zzso channels have been shown to interact directly with zzso proteins in the zzso density zzso These scaffold zzso such as zzso bind to zzso channels via a zzso motif zzso in the zzso tail zzso By utilizing a zzso solution zzso approach, we show that the previously unresolved structure of zzso tail zzso zzso is highly zzso Using in zzso binding zzso we determined that zzso the flexible tail of zzso preceding the zzso region zzso zzso does not significantly disrupt zzso zzso We also investigated which zzso acids in the zzso tail associated with zzso zzso by zzso zzso revealing that a stretch of 12 zzso zzso acids is involved in interaction with both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 11 zzso acids preceding the zzso tail, zzso completely zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso the molecular zzso formed between zzso zzso and zzso tail involve regions outside the previously identified binding motif zzso and may be important for additional zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso
