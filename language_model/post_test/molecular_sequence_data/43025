The zzso zzso promoter contains a series of enhancers that control the expression of different zzso stripes in the zzso zzso The stripe 3 zzso is located zzso zzso upstream of the stripe 2 zzso Here we demonstrate that these enhancers must be physically separated by a minimum distance for proper stripe zzso When they are directly coupled in either orientation, the enhancers generate abnormal patterns of expression in the early zzso For example, the levels of stripe 2 expression are zzso and there is a zzso expansion of the pattern when the stripe 3 zzso is positioned immediately upstream of the stripe 2 zzso Despite this spacing requirement, the order of the enhancers within the eve promoter can be reversed without affecting the normal expression zzso These results suggest that spacing maintains the autonomous activities of the stripe enhancers and that interactions between enhancers can generate novel patterns of gene zzso
