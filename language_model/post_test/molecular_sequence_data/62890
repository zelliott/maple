zzso and zzso zzso selectively invade zzso following binding to complex zzso Recent zzso experiments demonstrate that two zzso binding sites within the zzso zzso zzso originally identified in zzso studies to bind zzso or zzso acid, are required for productive binding to target zzso Here, we determine by mass zzso studies that the zzso of zzso zzso A and B bind only one zzso of zzso zzso zzso made in the presumed zzso binding site of zzso zzso A and B abolished the formation of these zzso complexes, and drastically diminished binding to zzso zzso and isolated zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso full-length zzso exhibit significantly reduced zzso thus identifying a single zzso binding site within the zzso half of the zzso of zzso zzso A and zzso These binding cavities are defined by the zzso zzso motif zzso The roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A and B in zzso binding differ from those in the analogous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings provide valuable information for the rational design of potent zzso zzso binding zzso
