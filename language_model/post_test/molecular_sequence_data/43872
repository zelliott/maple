zzso zzso zzso channel expressed in zzso zzso was shown to have a fast zzso current zzso The fraction of this component zzso of zzso is increased by zzso disruption induced by zzso or by zzso of the alpha zzso at zzso which zzso the interaction of the channel with zzso The relevant sites of interaction on the channel molecules have not been zzso Using a zzso zzso of zzso zzso to ensure zzso zzso interaction of the channel with the zzso we show that one relevant site is the end of the C zzso of zzso zzso of the last six zzso acids resulted in zzso channels with an extent of zzso up to zzso larger and its further enhancement by zzso being reduced zzso The zzso channels exhibited strong zzso which could not be markedly increased either by zzso or by the zzso zzso indicating that the interaction of the zzso channels with zzso was minimal to begin with, presumably because of extensive zzso zzso Since the zzso end of zzso was shown to participate in channel zzso via an interaction with members of the zzso family of zzso we propose that a similar interaction with an zzso protein takes place, contributing to channel connection to the zzso zzso This is the first report to assign a zzso role to such an zzso together with the state of zzso of the channel, it regulates the extent of zzso zzso by the beta zzso
