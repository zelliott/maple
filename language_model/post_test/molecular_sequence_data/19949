zzso methods by mass spectrum use the following two zzso database searching and de zzso zzso The zzso approach is zzso however, in cases wherein the corresponding sequences are not included in the databases, the exact identification is zzso On the other hand, in the case of de zzso sequencing, no preliminary information is zzso however, continuous zzso acid sequence zzso and the differentiation of these zzso are zzso It is, however, very difficult to obtain and differentiate the zzso of all zzso acids by using an actual zzso We propose a novel de zzso sequencing approach using not only zzso ratio but also zzso peak intensity and zzso acid zzso intensity ratio zzso 

Our method compensates for any zzso zzso acid peak intervals by zzso the zzso acid set and the probability of peak expression based on zzso acid zzso It provides more accurate identification of sequences than the existing methods, by which it is usually difficult to zzso
