zzso protein structure prediction remains a challenging task in protein zzso In the recent years, the importance of zzso structure prediction is increasing because of the growing number of protein structures solved by the structural zzso zzso To capitalize the significant efforts and investments paid on the structural zzso projects, it is urgent to establish effective ways to use the solved structures as templates by developing methods for exploiting remotely related proteins that cannot be simply identified by zzso In this work, we examine the effect of using zzso alignments in zzso protein structure zzso We showed that zzso alignments are often more accurate than the optimal one, and such accurate zzso alignments can occur even at a very low rank of the alignment zzso zzso alignments contain a significant number of correct zzso acid zzso zzso Moreover, zzso alignments can improve zzso models when used as input to zzso Finally, we use zzso alignments for handling a contact potential in a zzso way in a zzso program, zzso The zzso contacts strategy zzso the partly thawed approach, which only uses the optimal alignment in defining zzso zzso and also the zzso strategy, which uses the contact potential in zzso zzso The comparison with existing methods in the zzso test shows that zzso is very competitive and zzso existing zzso
