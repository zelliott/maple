The zzso zzso composed of the soluble zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and the zzso family member zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as a new zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso 20, zzso This zzso shows overlapping biological properties with zzso Although zzso contains a putative signal zzso and therefore should enter into the classical zzso pathway, the protein has been shown to be retained within zzso zzso cells, unless zzso with either zzso or zzso like factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that a fusion protein zzso zzso zzso coupled through a zzso zzso to zzso zzso is efficiently zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso shows enhanced activities in respect to the zzso native complex, on a number of cells expressing zzso and zzso on their zzso In addition, zzso is able to compete with zzso for cell zzso indicating that both zzso share binding zzso expressed by their zzso zzso Analysis of the downstream signaling events revealed the recruitment by zzso of the signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso fusion protein is therefore a powerful tool to study the biological role of the recently described zzso zzso
