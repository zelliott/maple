zzso zzso are fatty acid derivatives formed by zzso of zzso acid via the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso of inflammatory cells zzso is zzso to the nuclear envelope zzso where it converts zzso acid to the unstable zzso zzso zzso is further converted to zzso by zzso with zzso a reaction zzso by the integral membrane protein zzso zzso zzso which is localized on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We now report the mapping of regions of zzso that are important for its zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso fusion proteins of green fluorescent protein zzso as the zzso part and various truncated zzso of human zzso as zzso part were prepared and zzso into zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region 1 of zzso zzso acids zzso did not give distinct membrane localized zzso In contrast zzso region 2 zzso acids zzso gave a zzso pattern similar to that of full length zzso zzso region 3 zzso acids zzso directed zzso to a zzso indistinguishable from that of full length zzso A minimal directing zzso zzso acids zzso was identified by further zzso The involvement of the zzso regions in the zzso of zzso was investigated using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso analysis in living zzso zzso data showed that zzso regions 1 and 3 each allowed zzso to zzso These regions most likely form zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso is due to zzso interactions in the zzso
