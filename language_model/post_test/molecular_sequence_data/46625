A cluster of four zzso genes has previously been localized to zzso position zzso of the zzso zzso zzso One of these genes had been zzso and the presence of the other three genes was identified by zzso Here, we present the DNA sequence of the entire zzso region zzso these four zzso zzso In addition to the four previously zzso zzso we have identified a fifth zzso sequence located within this gene zzso This new gene shows a high degree of sequence divergence (more than zzso from the other four zzso although it retains all of the functional motifs that are characteristic of zzso zzso In order to trace the molecular evolution of this gene zzso we isolated and zzso the zzso zzso region from the closely related species zzso zzso A comparison of the DNA sequences between the two species provides strong evidence for the concerted evolution of some members of this gene zzso Two genes within the cluster are evolving in concert, while a third gene appears to be evolving zzso The remaining two genes show an intermediate pattern of zzso We propose a simple model, involving zzso looping and gene conversion, to explain the relatively complex patterns of molecular evolution within this gene zzso
