Despite their widespread occurrence in soils, the ecology of zzso and their response to environmental zzso due to human activities remain very poorly zzso This study was aimed at assessing changes in the diversity and abundance of zzso in zzso contaminated with zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso The analysis of zzso communities at two sites with long-term and short-term contamination revealed that TNT has a drastic impact on the relative abundance of zzso in soil bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso The disappearance of most zzso from these zzso was zzso with a shift in zzso community composition and a loss of diversity, although the extent of diversity erosion depended on the sampling zzso
