In insects, storage proteins or zzso accumulate apparently to serve as sources of zzso acids during metamorphosis and zzso Two storage zzso zzso obtained from a zzso library prepared from fourth zzso larvae of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The first zzso zzso contained zzso zzso with a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a protein with zzso zzso acid zzso The second zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso a protein with 750 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso shared 59% zzso sequence identity and zzso deduced zzso acid sequence zzso A zzso acid signal zzso and a molecular mass of zzso zzso were predicted for the zzso zzso whereas a zzso acid signal zzso and a mass of 88 zzso were predicted for zzso Both proteins contained zzso insect zzso storage protein signature sequence patterns and were zzso identical to other zzso zzso storage zzso zzso of zzso for both zzso storage proteins was determined using the quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Only very low levels were present in the second zzso but both zzso dramatically increased during the third zzso peaked in the fourth zzso decreased dramatically late in the same zzso and zzso zzso and were zzso during the adult zzso Males and females exhibited similar zzso expression levels for both storage proteins during the zzso and adult zzso The results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso a species that does not feed after the zzso stage, accumulates these two storage proteins as reserves during zzso development for subsequent use in the zzso and adult zzso
