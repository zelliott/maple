zzso variation in the gag zzso region in zzso B zzso has been associated with changes in viral replication capacity and zzso drug zzso We examined sequence variation in the zzso gag zzso region using plasma samples from 22 individuals with zzso B zzso infection zzso A, C, D, zzso and G, and circulating zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso An additional 105 gag sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory database were also zzso zzso length variation was observed in the zzso gag zzso zzso patterns of insertions and deletions were observed in different zzso and zzso and no two zzso or zzso had the same general zzso zzso zzso were more common in zzso C than other strains (3 of 14 in zzso C zzso 2 of 113 in other zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso were seen only in zzso zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether such zzso differences influence viral replication capacity, zzso drug zzso or other zzso properties of these zzso
