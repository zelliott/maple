zzso genes are zzso zzso resistance zzso Five zzso families have been described with several zzso (7 zzso of zzso 53 zzso of zzso 1 zzso of zzso 1 zzso of zzso and 6 zzso of zzso Their detection requires a zzso specific for each zzso family and further sequencing for zzso zzso 

zzso melt curve analysis zzso was coupled to multiplex and zzso real-time zzso zzso for detection and characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protocol was set using 27 reference strains zzso the most frequent zzso and was applied to 55 clinical zzso unknown for zzso zzso 

Out of the 27 reference strains tested, 21 zzso showed distinct profiles using zzso 6 zzso 12 zzso and 3 zzso For the zzso zzso showing similar profiles, we gathered them into four groups that were easily zzso For the zzso that we could not test, in zzso analysis showed that they would be identified using the zzso protocol zzso Among the clinical zzso 28 zzso zzso were detected and the zzso zzso was characterized as 8 zzso 4 zzso 5 zzso 3 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso and 1 zzso with zzso results with zzso zzso Two new zzso zzso were detected and distinguished using zzso They were further designated as zzso and zzso 

We developed an zzso zzso for characterizing the zzso zzso in clinical zzso This zzso method can be used to screen a large number of zzso This method allowed the detection of new zzso zzso
