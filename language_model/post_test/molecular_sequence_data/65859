The complete zzso sequence of a virus isolated from soybean zzso max zzso zzso in China, previously identified as a new strain of zzso necrosis virus A zzso based on its zzso zzso properties, and coat protein zzso sequence and named as zzso C, was determined and compared with that of zzso and other closely related zzso and zzso The viral zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and contains five open reading frames zzso zzso C showed zzso overall zzso sequence identity to zzso The zzso and putative zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso acid identity, respectively, to that of zzso The greatest difference between zzso C and zzso was in the 3' terminal zzso the zzso zzso region present in zzso was absent in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and small zzso regions of zzso confirmed zzso C as a new strain of zzso A full-length zzso clone of zzso C was constructed and used as template for zzso zzso based on the obtained zzso The results indicate that the in zzso viral zzso faithfully represented the biological activity of zzso zzso zzso
