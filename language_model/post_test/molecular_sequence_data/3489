The human zzso zzso zzso a G zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in vascular smooth muscle relaxation as well as the prevention of zzso zzso It has been zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso serve as molecular hinges or swivels and are necessary for proper binding and zzso By individually (as well as zzso mutating these zzso zzso to zzso the ability to form key structural and functional zzso was zzso zzso effects on both binding and zzso were zzso Two highly zzso zzso across zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the greatest effect on decreasing both binding and zzso when changed to zzso Along the zzso boundary of the highly zzso zzso III domain, a zzso zzso at position 89 zzso revealed normal binding affinity in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso 2 versus 7 zzso 3 zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was markedly affected, with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso Movement within zzso has been shown to be necessary for effective zzso zzso Both the zzso location (above the putative binding zzso along with an exclusive effect upon zzso suggest that this movement is facilitated by the presence of zzso and independent from the actions of zzso zzso This finding strongly supports a model in which zzso zzso serve as molecular hinges or zzso essential for zzso zzso binding to zzso
