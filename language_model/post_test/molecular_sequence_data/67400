The zzso regulation and cellular zzso of zzso a gene marker of zzso differentiation whose expression declines after zzso zzso was zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a zzso domain having eight zzso in a zzso zzso zzso expression in onion zzso cells, transformed with a zzso construction, indicated the protein is present in zzso lining the membrane of the zzso The zzso gene expression is under the control of classic promoter zzso regulatory elements such as zzso and zzso suggesting regulation by B3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis, by zzso transient transformation of zzso immature zzso with serial deletions of the promoter fused to zzso showed the presence of two negative regulatory zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso By selective deletion or zzso of zzso regulatory promoter elements we conclude that the promoter expression is attenuated by the zzso element as well as by the zzso and the zzso box together with the zzso
