Prior work in our laboratory established a connection between the zzso and zzso protein complexes at the tight junction of zzso zzso zzso zzso a stable small interfering zzso expression system, we have markedly reduced expression of the tight zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso The loss of zzso resulted in a corresponding loss of expression of zzso a known binding partner of zzso but had no effect on the expression of zzso However, the absence of zzso and zzso expression did result in the decreased association of zzso with members of the zzso protein zzso The consequences of the loss of zzso and zzso were exhibited by a delay in the polarization of zzso zzso after calcium switch, a decrease in the zzso electrical resistance, and by the inability of these cells to form zzso zzso when grown in a collagen gel zzso These defects in polarity determination may be the result of the lack of recruitment of zzso to the tight junction in zzso cells, as observed by zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in downstream signaling zzso
