The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein reveals an approximately repeating motif of 15 zzso A diagonal comparison zzso established that these repeats extended from zzso 43 to zzso 400 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of secondary structure combined with model building showed that each zzso segment contained two short zzso and two zzso one of which incorporated an extra zzso in a zzso of the zzso zzso The 44 strands together gave a long (210 zzso narrow, zzso zzso which could be zzso by zzso formation to give the zzso of the zzso The zzso could arise from a zzso of the zzso 180 zzso segment, predicted to be an 8-10 stranded zzso This model is consistent with the electron zzso of the zzso and it was supported by zzso of zzso and of electron zzso from zzso The latter gave a pair of wide angle zzso corresponding to a repeat of zzso A, oriented appropriately for a zzso zzso The relation of this structure to zzso structures is discussed and a folding zzso is zzso In its general features the structure resembles that proposed for the tail zzso of zzso zzso
