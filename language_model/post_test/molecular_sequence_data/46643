The very low density zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso E zzso that shares a common structural feature as well as some zzso specificity to zzso E with members of the low density zzso zzso gene zzso We have isolated and characterized the mouse zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene contains 19 zzso spanning approximately 50 zzso The zzso organization of the gene is completely zzso between mouse and zzso Since the zzso region of the mouse zzso gene contains two copies of a zzso regulatory zzso like sequence zzso we next studied regulation of the zzso zzso expression in heart, skeletal muscle and zzso tissue in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice fed normal zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was zzso zzso by feeding zzso diet in heart and skeletal muscle only in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso diet in zzso tissue in all animal models except double knockout zzso These results suggest that zzso may be functional and zzso plays a role in cholesterol zzso in heart and skeletal muscle when zzso is absent and that zzso E is required for this zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso expression was also zzso zzso zzso expression in heart displayed significant up and down regulation during zzso zzso level was detected on zzso day zzso However, the zzso zzso levels in skeletal muscle remained relatively constant except a slight dip on zzso day zzso In kidney and brain, zzso zzso also peaked on zzso day 3 but remained relatively constant zzso In liver, zzso zzso expression was very zzso it was barely zzso at day 19 of gestation and was decreased further zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso level showed an increase on zzso day 13, went down again during weaning and then continued to increase zzso This zzso pattern as well as dietary regulation in zzso tissue supports the notion that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso in this zzso Although the primary role of zzso in heart, muscle and zzso tissue is likely in zzso zzso zzso pattern of this zzso in other zzso suggests that zzso has functions that are unrelated to zzso zzso
