zzso zzso zzso can produce zzso zzso with industrial zzso We designed two zzso zzso to amplify zzso domain sequence of zzso II ( zzso zzso Full length of zzso was obtained by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso DNA sequencing revealed that zzso has an open reading frame of zzso which encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows that the predicted molecular mass is 53 zzso and the zzso consists of a zzso zzso binding domain zzso separated from a zzso domain by a zzso region rich in zzso zzso product consisting of the entire zzso II coding region without its signal sequences was cloned into the zzso secretive zzso zzso which was then transformed into zzso zzso zzso zzso efficient production of the zzso II was achieved in zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter, and the expressing level was zzso zzso by small-scale zzso The zzso zzso II was zzso by using ammonium zzso zzso zzso Fast flow zzso A molecular mass of the zzso zzso is 67 zzso determined by zzso and this is similar to the native zzso II zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited optimum zzso activity at pH zzso and 50 degrees C zzso It was zzso at 50 degrees C and retained 50% of its original activity after 30 zzso at 70 d degrees C zzso The high level of fully active zzso zzso II got from zzso zzso makes this expression system attractive for zzso and industrial zzso
