zzso hypothetical protein zzso zzso zzso initially thought to be a member of an zzso family, was selected for crystal structure determination since no structural or functional information was zzso The structure has been determined independently by zzso and MAD methods to zzso A zzso The MAD structure was determined largely through automated model zzso The protein folds as a TIM barrel beginning with a long zzso zzso in contrast to the classic zzso zzso zzso zzso structure, which begins with a zzso A zzso zzso zzso is zzso bound near the zzso end of the barrel, the usual active site in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso this zzso protein resembles the zzso domain of zzso zzso or zzso zzso both of which are zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein has been shown to have zzso zzso zzso Although selected as a member of a protein family having no obvious relationship to proteins of known structure, the protein fold turned out to be a well known and widely distributed zzso This points to the need for a more comprehensive base of structural information and better zzso tools before the goal of structure prediction from zzso sequences can be zzso In this case, similarity to a known structure allowed zzso to be made about the structure and function of a widely distributed protein zzso
