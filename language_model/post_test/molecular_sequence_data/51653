We describe the construction of a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso which allows the regulation of zzso zzso activity by zzso In the presence of estrogen, zzso readily transformed primary chicken zzso and bone zzso cells in zzso In both cell types, zzso transformation was critically dependent on the presence of zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or application of an zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a reversal of the transformed zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso protein binds to zzso B sites in an zzso manner, thereby showing that zzso DNA binding of zzso is critical for the zzso of its transforming zzso In transient zzso experiments, we failed to demonstrate a clear zzso or zzso function of the zzso zzso in zzso However, in zzso bone zzso cells, zzso and zzso induced elevated zzso levels of two cellular genes whose expression is zzso and high in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might exert part of its activity as an zzso of zzso zzso
