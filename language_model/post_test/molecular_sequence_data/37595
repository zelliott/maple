zzso zzso of zzso family zzso plays a crucial role in different human zzso In addition to the well known zzso zzso and zzso zzso a novel fusion protein resulting from a different zzso zzso has recently been zzso In this study, the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins were compared to the zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso zzso related zzso Using short peptides which zzso to the target zzso in known zzso proteins of zzso family zzso we found a higher zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Similar to zzso zzso was found in complexes with the adapter protein zzso In addition, zzso II and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso with numerous other zzso zzso proteins in zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso Ras in cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso a zzso implicated to zzso regulate zzso were also zzso activated by both zzso and zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso proteins have zzso zzso different from the normal zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso is capable to activate at least some pathways which are also zzso by zzso
