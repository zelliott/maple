We have identified a gene zzso an zzso zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows significant similarity to the zzso degrading zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso protein also functions in zzso zzso An zzso zzso was identical to the zzso strain in exponential growth rate, but demonstrated reduced zzso and zzso turnover in the stationary phase of zzso When transferred into a buffer solution, at a pH zzso for other zzso zzso an zzso activity was zzso in the zzso strain that was not present in the zzso The most dramatic zzso of the zzso occurred after extended time in stationary zzso After approximately zzso in stationary phase, both strains underwent an apparent replication event, after which the zzso strain died rapidly whereas the zzso zzso survived considerably zzso Even after both the zzso and zzso cells were dead, many of the zzso cells maintained intact zzso whereas the zzso cells were zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso related to zzso zzso and acts as an zzso in the stationary zzso
