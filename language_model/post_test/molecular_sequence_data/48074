zzso zzso was zzso and the molecular mass was determined to be approximately zzso zzso higher than the prediction based on the protein zzso suggesting extensive zzso zzso These modifications were identified and characterized by a combination of protein and zzso zzso zzso Three modifications were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso associated zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso chain attached to zzso was analyzed by both zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso after partial zzso ABC zzso zzso The analyses showed that the zzso chains were composed of 15 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso On average, every forth zzso was zzso and these zzso zzso appeared to be more common near the reducing zzso zzso exchange zzso at pH zzso 4 of intact zzso resulted in the isolation of four zzso shown to differ only in the amount of zzso Heavy chain 1 zzso and heavy chain 2 zzso are attached to the zzso by a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the order in which the two heavy chains are positioned on the zzso was zzso The results indicate that zzso is in close proximity to zzso and both are near the less zzso zzso end of the zzso Taken together, the data show the following organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (a + b + c zzso zzso zzso
