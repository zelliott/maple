The zzso of different classes of alcohol zzso zzso in the brain is of great interest because of their role in both ethanol and zzso acid zzso zzso data have been reported in the zzso By Northern zzso and zzso activity analyses only class III zzso has been detected in adult brain zzso while results from zzso in zzso zzso indicate class I as well as class IV zzso expression in different regions of the rat zzso Here we have studied the expression patterns of three zzso classes in adult zzso mouse and human zzso using radioactive zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was tested on liver and stomach control zzso as well as tissue from class IV zzso zzso zzso Only class III zzso zzso was found to be expressed in brain tissue of all three investigated zzso Particularly high expression levels were found in zzso of the red nucleus in human zzso while cortical zzso zzso and zzso cells of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed moderate expression zzso zzso cells of zzso were positive for class III zzso zzso in all species investigated, whereas zzso layer zzso were positive only in zzso The zzso zzso was highly positive for class III zzso while no specific signal for class I or class IV zzso was zzso Our results thus support the notion that the only zzso expressed in adult zzso rat and human brain is class III zzso
