zzso form a large zzso of molecular zzso that move along zzso zzso The functions of zzso in plant cells are thought to be related to various zzso cell division, movement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Class VIII and zzso zzso are represented in the zzso zzso zzso by 4 and 13 potential zzso zzso The roles of individual class zzso zzso and their cellular targets in zzso zzso are still zzso In this work we implemented a reverse genetic approach to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso a representative of class zzso zzso in zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene showed similar zzso impaired growth of root hair cells, twisted shape of stem zzso and irregular size, branch zzso and branch expansion of leaf zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that the average length of root hairs was reduced up to 50% in comparison with zzso root zzso suggesting an involvement of the class zzso zzso zzso in tip zzso On leaves, the proportion of zzso with short branches was zzso in zzso plants, and the zzso zzso possessed a mildly twisted zzso zzso we concluded that zzso zzso is involved also in the zzso of stalks and branches of zzso
