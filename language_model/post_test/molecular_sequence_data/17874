zzso is a member of the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso The present study deals with zzso gene expression in adult and embryonic zzso By zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso cells with different differentiation zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso Similar or slightly higher levels of the zzso were detected in the embryonic and zzso portions of zzso mouse zzso When zzso cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso for zzso days, the zzso level increased zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso dramatically dropped to almost background levels in zzso from 11 days zzso zzso Many zzso of adult mice expressed only low levels of zzso zzso but considerable amounts of the transcript were found in the zzso and also in the zzso of pregnant mice (4 days zzso and 12 days zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed large amounts of zzso zzso in the zzso from 7 to 9 days zzso The visceral zzso of zzso zzso and the brain, visceral zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were the sites where intense signals of zzso zzso were zzso
