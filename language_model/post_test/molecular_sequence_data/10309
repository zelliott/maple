During aging and cellular zzso zzso accumulate in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso have an essential role in DNA damage zzso Our purpose was to find out whether cellular zzso of zzso affects the protein components that recognize DNA damage and induce the repair zzso We compared zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso with each other and with zzso immortalized and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso significantly decreased the nuclear level of both zzso and zzso components of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso did not affect the level of the zzso component but slightly increased that of zzso Both zzso zzso and cellular zzso decreased the activity of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso increased the activity of zzso protein zzso The protein level of zzso zzso zzso was strongly decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso also slightly reduced the protein level of zzso zzso was not observed in zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso and to some extent cellular zzso zzso the recognition system of DNA damage involving zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso and hence could enhance the zzso of DNA damage during zzso
