zzso of the R zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso envelope protein zzso zzso tail zzso zzso We examined the role of the zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso membrane fusion and zzso The zzso truncated at zzso exhibits maximum zzso in zzso fusion zzso By comparison, full tail zzso zzso and the zzso truncated to zzso zzso zzso fusion at zzso The zzso truncated to zzso zzso or zzso are not zzso Progressive zzso tail zzso correlated with decreased zzso incorporation into zzso zzso of the domain zzso with an zzso zzso from zzso results in zzso zzso zzso that efficiently incorporated into zzso competent zzso However, substitution of the domain zzso with random or zzso sequences caused loss of the zzso zzso and zzso while retaining zzso Further, a secondary structure prediction analysis of 27 unrelated zzso zzso tails indicates a common zzso propensity for an zzso zzso domain at immediate proximity to the viral zzso These results support the suggestion that viral fusion is enhanced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The model of its action is zzso
