zzso zzso is a fundamental mechanism of zzso regulation, yet little is known about zzso mechanisms of zzso We report here the discovery of four zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso as well as conservation of this gene family from bacteria to zzso At least three zzso genes can function in zzso zzso zzso restores zzso zzso to a zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso are defective in zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso together contribute to proper cell cycle zzso radiation resistance, and zzso stability, establishing new connections between zzso and these fundamental cellular zzso
