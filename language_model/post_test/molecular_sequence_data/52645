A zzso zzso named zzso that encodes an zzso protein was isolated from zzso zzso The deduced zzso named zzso contains two zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso half, a putative zzso motif (a target of a WW zzso in the center, and zzso zzso zzso A binding zzso demonstrated that the zzso can bind to zzso zzso acids in zzso Analysis of zzso of the zzso activity of transgenic zzso zzso plants that have the zzso gene containing the upstream sequence of the zzso gene and zzso gene demonstrated that the zzso gene is expressed in zzso zzso such as the zzso shoot zzso and root tips, developing zzso such as floral buds and zzso of young flowers, zzso layers of immature zzso and junctions of zzso Considering the specificity of the zzso zzso may be required in the progress of cell zzso
