Fifty-five zzso toxin zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso strains isolated from humans between 1965 and 1999 in Germany and the Czech Republic were investigated for their zzso and zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were shown to possess the identical zzso zzso gene zzso We observed a striking recent shift of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso among the zzso zzso zzso While zzso was the exclusive zzso identified in our collection until 1994, zzso of the zzso obtained after 1997 possessed zzso either alone zzso or together with zzso zzso zzso profiling demonstrated a remarkable zzso with respect to zzso sizes and zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA with zzso specific to potential accessory zzso genes revealed considerable additional zzso in gene composition and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso differentiated 16 zzso among the 55 zzso zzso zzso Using these techniques we demonstrate the emergence of a new zzso zzso characterized by zzso pattern A and a unique combination of zzso markers including zzso and a single, approximately zzso zzso harboring the zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso The proportion of zzso zzso A strains among zzso zzso zzso rose from zzso in 1996 to more than 50% in zzso Four clusters of infections with the zzso zzso A were zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is diverse and that zzso zzso zzso can rapidly emerge during short zzso The extensive genetic diversity of zzso zzso provides a basis for molecular zzso of this important zzso zzso zzso
