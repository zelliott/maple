zzso zzso of zzso is an zzso zzso trait that affects approximately zzso of the Caucasian zzso These individuals zzso zzso carry deficient zzso gene zzso and have an impaired metabolism of severely commonly used zzso The opposite phenomenon also exists, and certain individuals metabolize the drugs very zzso resulting in zzso plasma zzso at normal zzso In the present study, we have investigated the molecular genetic basis for zzso metabolism of zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis of the zzso locus in two families with very rapid metabolism of zzso zzso ratio zzso for zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso gel zzso analyses showed that this gene had been amplified zzso in three members zzso and his two zzso of one of the families, and two copies were present among members of the other zzso The zzso gene had an open reading frame and carried two zzso causing zzso acid zzso one in zzso 6, yielding an zzso exchange and one in zzso 9 causing zzso The MR of subjects carrying one copy of the zzso gene did not significantly differ from that of those with the zzso zzso indicating that the structural zzso were not of importance of the zzso properties of the gene zzso zzso of the MR among subjects carrying zzso zzso zzso or deficient zzso revealed a relationship between the number of active genes and zzso The data show the principle of inherited amplification of an active zzso Furthermore, the finding of a specific zzso with two or more active zzso genes allows zzso for zzso drug zzso This zzso could be of zzso value for individualized and more efficient drug zzso
