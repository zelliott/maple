zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso virus isolated from throat zzso zzso blood, urine or zzso during zzso zzso between zzso in Korea were amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and compared by zzso sequencing of the small zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso gene were aligned with the published sequences of zzso virus isolated in different geographic zzso A comparison of the zzso gene of zzso viruses in Korea indicated zzso and zzso similarity at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso zzso analysis, using the zzso method, showed that Korean zzso virus strains formed a genetically distinct zzso group from previously reported zzso based on the zzso length zzso and 57 deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and possibly be designated as a new zzso zzso
