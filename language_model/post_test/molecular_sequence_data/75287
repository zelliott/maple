We have dissected the human zzso promoter to define sequence elements allowing response to zzso zzso of sequence upstream of the zzso element, either with Bal 31 zzso or by zzso zzso had little or no effect on the response of the promoter to zzso In general, the zzso level was reduced, indicating that these sites interact with factors important for transcription, but regulation zzso Although a zzso gene driven by just the zzso zzso zzso of upstream zzso could be zzso by zzso a similar construct containing the early zzso zzso element was zzso Analysis of several additional such constructions indicated that the specific sequence zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with the zzso zzso element in the context of the zzso zzso promoter resulted in loss of zzso zzso but maintenance of heat zzso Replacement of this element with sequences not related to any zzso element resulted in loss of activity and zzso Thus, the zzso zzso equivalent is functional in the context of the zzso promoter but cannot be induced by zzso We conclude that the target for zzso induction of the zzso promoter is zzso and that multiple functionally distinct zzso zzso and presumably zzso zzso factors, can be distinguished in zzso zzso
