The production of type 8 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is regulated in response to a variety of environmental zzso The zzso genes required for the zzso production in strain Becker are transcribed as a single large transcript by a primary promoter located within a zzso region upstream of the first gene of the zzso gene zzso In this study, we analyzed the primary zzso promoter region in zzso We determined the zzso initiation site of the primary transcript by primer extension and identified the potential promoter zzso We found several zzso and direct repeats upstream of the zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso showed that a zzso zzso repeat of one of the repeats was required for promoter zzso We showed that the distance but not the specific sequences between the zzso repeat and the promoter was critical to the promoter zzso However, zzso of a DNA sequence with two or four zzso turns in this intervening region had a slight effect on promoter zzso To demonstrate the biological significance of the zzso zzso zzso we constructed a strain with a zzso in the repeat in the zzso zzso Becker zzso and showed that the repeat affected zzso production mostly at the zzso zzso By gel mobility shift zzso we demonstrated that strain Becker produced at least one protein capable of specific binding to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the repeat serves as a positive regulatory protein binding zzso In addition, reporter gene fusion analysis showed that the zzso promoter activity was influenced by various growth media and affected most by zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso extract may exert its profound zzso effect on zzso gene expression through the zzso zzso repeat zzso
