zzso is one of two zzso proteins that are required for active partition of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso To probe the native domain structure of zzso we performed limited zzso zzso of full-length zzso as well as of several zzso and zzso deletion fragments of zzso The zzso 140 zzso acids of zzso form a very zzso zzso In contrast, the N zzso is more susceptible to zzso suggesting that it forms a less zzso folded domain or zzso Because native zzso is a zzso in solution, we analyzed the ability of zzso fragments to zzso using both the zzso zzso system and in zzso chemical zzso of zzso zzso These studies revealed that the zzso 59 zzso acids of zzso a region within the zzso domain, are sufficient for zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments also revealed the presence of a second zzso domain within the zzso half of zzso The zzso data also suggest that the C zzso is zzso to zzso through the zzso domain in zzso We propose that the two zzso zzso play distinct roles in partition complex zzso
