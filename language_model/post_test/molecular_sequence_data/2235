zzso zzso appears to represent a central member of a diverse family of proteins involved in cell signaling mechanisms including the protein zzso a low Mr zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso (based on limited sequence identity with the zzso zzso A membrane form of zzso zzso represents a new model for cell surface zzso although such a model was once envisioned for zzso zzso zzso In original models for zzso zzso hormone was thought to bind with either the zzso or with an unknown protein to enhance zzso zzso production zzso zzso zzso appears to fall into the first zzso zzso model where binding of a zzso to an zzso site on the zzso zzso a signal to an zzso zzso zzso The production of zzso zzso a second messenger, and of zzso are then zzso The protein zzso zzso family of receptors zzso and possibly another forthcoming family of cell surface receptors containing protein zzso zzso activity zzso contain a single zzso domain like zzso zzso Furthermore, the protein zzso zzso are activated by zzso binding to the zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso unlike these cell surface zzso results in the formation of a low molecular weight second zzso
