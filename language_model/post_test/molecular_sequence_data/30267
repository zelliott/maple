The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso junction in DNA (the Holliday zzso the zzso central intermediate of genetic zzso has been zzso using molecular mechanical computer zzso A version of the zzso program package was zzso that had been modified to include the influence of zzso and a global zzso zzso Starting from an extended zzso structure, the zzso was varied in order to zzso the energy, and we discuss three structures obtained by this zzso One structure is closely related to a zzso zzso in which there is no stacking interaction between the four double zzso zzso This structure is probably closely similar to that observed zzso in the absence of zzso The remaining two structures are based on zzso yet zzso zzso in which there is zzso zzso stacking of zzso zzso In these structures, the four DNA stems adopt the form of two zzso zzso in which base stacking is very similar to that found in standard zzso zzso The two stacked zzso so formed are not aligned parallel to each other, but zzso an angle of approximately 60 zzso The strands that exchange between one stacked zzso and the other are disposed about the smaller angle of the cross zzso 60 degrees rather than 120 zzso generating an approximately zzso alignment of DNA zzso This structure is precisely the stacked zzso proposed on the basis of experimental zzso The calculations indicate zzso from standard zzso zzso that are required to adopt the stacked zzso a widening of the minor groove at the zzso and zzso of the central zzso groups of the exchanging zzso An important feature of the stacked zzso is that it presents two structurally distinct zzso These may be zzso differently by zzso providing a zzso for the points of zzso by Holliday zzso
