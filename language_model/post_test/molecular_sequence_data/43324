The binding of zzso at the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two proteins of approximately 60 and 100 zzso The 60 zzso protein has been shown to be highly divergent among different zzso and to induce a zzso protective immune zzso In this study we have characterized the 100 zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso 7 and designated it as zzso The zzso gene was found to be located immediately downstream of the zzso zzso It was cloned and zzso and zzso raised against the isolated zzso protein zzso with a constant intensity, a 100 zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, and a zzso of approximately 103 zzso in zzso 1, 3, zzso and zzso In addition, comparative analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence showed more than zzso identity with the large zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli outer zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of pigs zzso with these zzso zzso coli zzso recognized functional zzso zzso protein whereas no such reaction was observed upon zzso with isolated zzso zzso zzso A preliminary animal experiment showed that zzso outer membrane preparations from zzso zzso coli can reduce significantly the mortality of an zzso infection with the zzso zzso
