The zzso gene is required for the development of the tail and other zzso features in the zzso zzso zzso To determine the structure of the zzso zzso we isolated and zzso zzso clones from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene contains 9 zzso and encodes both major and minor zzso zzso which differ in the length of their zzso untranslated zzso The coding region of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso is embedded within the first zzso zzso The organization of the zzso and zzso zzso units was determined by comparing zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene locus has an unusual organization in which a zzso first zzso is alternatively spliced at the zzso end of two different zzso The zzso and zzso genes are expressed zzso during zzso and zzso but not during zzso in which zzso zzso accumulates independently of zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso transcripts accumulate in the embryonic zzso responsible for generating zzso features, including the zzso neural tube and zzso are zzso during zzso in the zzso species zzso zzso and are zzso in zzso zzso X zzso zzso hybrids, which restore these zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso expression is required for development of the same suite of zzso features as zzso The results show that the zzso gene complex has a role in the development of zzso features in zzso zzso zzso
