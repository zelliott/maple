Biological properties of zzso laboratory strains and zzso were studies and compared with research results of the zzso gene zzso obtained from their zzso DNA and zzso as well as from zzso and zzso DNA isolated immediately from the blood of patients at early zzso zzso The zzso pattern as well as the results of determination of zzso sequences showed that the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso laboratory strains of zzso zzso and zzso obtained from patients at late infection stages had a zzso inner zzso The phenomenon can be regarded is proof of that zzso gene structure, if zzso causes an enhanced zzso of and an intensified zzso of the virus zzso to laboratory zzso observed at late zzso zzso which zzso at least in a number of cases, the infection zzso
