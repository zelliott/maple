To determine the frequency of zzso class II zzso in Caucasian central European patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso class I, zzso and zzso zzso were identified in 41 patients with zzso and the zzso were compared with those in 204 healthy, unrelated control zzso zzso typing was performed using the standard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso patients and 57 controls was performed by zzso zzso probing after amplification of zzso DNA by zzso chain zzso 

A significant increase in zzso zzso frequency was found in the patients zzso as compared with that in healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients and controls revealed no predominance of any zzso zzso 

There are important clinical similarities and zzso between zzso and zzso arthritis zzso In zzso the association with zzso has been well zzso Our findings show that although there is a zzso association with zzso the situation is sufficiently distinct from that of zzso to imply considerable differences in zzso of the two zzso
