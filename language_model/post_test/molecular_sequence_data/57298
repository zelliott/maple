We have evaluated zzso usage bias in zzso zzso genes and have obtained the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene repeat zzso This repeat contains genes for all five zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and differs from the previously reported one by a second zzso zzso These zzso zzso repeats have been aligned to each other and to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat types from zzso zzso In each species, base composition at synonymous sites is similar to the average zzso composition and approaches that in the small zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso of synonymous changes at synonymous sites after the species zzso is quite zzso Both of these features are consistent with the relatively low zzso usage bias observed in these genes when compared with other zzso zzso Thus, the zzso that abundantly expressed genes in zzso have high zzso bias and low rates of silent substitution does not hold for the zzso zzso
