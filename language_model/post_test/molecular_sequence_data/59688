In order to identify genes belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are absent from zzso coli zzso a zzso gene bank consisting of zzso independent clones was screened for zzso regulated promoters using the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso generated from zzso positive plasmids were then used for zzso with zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using these techniques we identified an iron regulated locus present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso Further cloning and zzso sequence analysis identified two open reading zzso termed zzso organized in a typical zzso zzso The genes zzso were located at 4 and 57 zzso on the physical maps of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This region of the zzso zzso zzso contains a large DNA loop which is absent from the corresponding area of the zzso coli zzso Finally, we developed a new method for generation of single copy zzso zzso A suicide zzso was constructed, which allows for the generation of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso By integration of this construct at the zzso locus we could establish iron responsive expression of zzso
