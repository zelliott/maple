zzso corresponding to two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso was isolated from tomato fruit to investigate their role in fruit zzso Southern analysis revealed that zzso zzso genes form a zzso family, whereas there is only one zzso zzso gene in the tomato zzso Although zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in leaves and mature fruit, the highest levels of both zzso and zzso zzso were observed in fruit at 2-4 days after zzso The expression pattern of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso and the highest levels of zzso zzso were also observed in fruit at 2-4 days after zzso thus suggesting that zzso plays a role in early fruit zzso Because zzso and zzso zzso was more abundant than zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized in zzso and their zzso and in vascular tissue at an early stage of fruit zzso Tomato zzso lines in which the expression of zzso zzso genes was zzso using the zzso promoter zzso exhibited fruit growth zzso at an early stage of zzso Although the major function of zzso in fruit has been believed to be the zzso of materials such as zzso and organic acids in the zzso during cell expansion and zzso these results show that specific zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso has a novel role in the cell division zzso
