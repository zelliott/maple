Three zzso DNA fragments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso They contain sequences recognized as zzso signals by the packaging apparatus of zzso One of these fragments zzso to the zzso DNA zzso carrying gene 3 which comprises the zzso signal of zzso zzso The product of gene 3, zzso is involved in the recognition of zzso and the packaging zzso Gene 3 of zzso and most of the adjacent gene 2 have been zzso The zzso analogous segments of the other two zzso fragments have been narrowed down by zzso and by zzso of the resulting hybrid plasmids under zzso zzso
