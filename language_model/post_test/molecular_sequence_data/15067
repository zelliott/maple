The ability to sense and respond to DNA damage is critical to maintenance of zzso stability and the prevention of zzso In this study, we employed a genetic screen to identify a zzso zzso (new component of the zzso A zzso that is required for resistance to zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso to sites of DNA damage and is required for zzso checkpoint zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is a component of the zzso A complex, which also contains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is required to maintain zzso and zzso abundance and for the recruitment of zzso to sites of DNA zzso In depth zzso analysis revealed that the zzso A complex bears striking similarities to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that four members of the zzso complex possess a zzso zzso zzso thus forming a complex that might facilitate the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso These findings provide a new perspective from which to view the zzso A zzso
