A zzso zzso a zzso protein was cloned from flowers of zzso wild tomato zzso zzso The corresponding gene was mapped to the S zzso which is responsible for zzso The zzso sequence was determined for this zzso and compared to other zzso sequences in the zzso The S zzso was used to probe DNA from 92 plants zzso 10 natural populations of zzso zzso zzso was conducted under moderate and zzso zzso in order to detect zzso zzso Few zzso were zzso even under zzso conditions, zzso the great sequence diversity at this zzso Those zzso that were detected are highly zzso zzso could not be detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, zzso to an individual of zzso zzso zzso revealed a closely related sequence that maps to the S locus in this reproductively isolated zzso This supports the finding that S locus zzso predates zzso The extraordinarily high degree of sequence diversity present in the zzso zzso system is discussed in the context of other highly divergent systems representing several zzso
