zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso can specifically zzso expression of target genes via zzso interference zzso zzso To date, the length of synthetic zzso duplex has been strictly maintained less than 30 zzso because an early study suggested that zzso zzso zzso longer than 30 zzso could not trigger specific gene zzso due to the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the current belief, here we show that synthetic zzso as long as 38 zzso can result in specific target gene zzso without zzso zzso zzso Using this longer duplex structure, we have generated zzso which can simultaneously zzso expression of two target genes zzso as zzso zzso or zzso Our results thus demonstrate the structural flexibility of gene zzso zzso and provide a starting point to construct zzso zzso zzso The zzso could be zzso to develop a novel therapeutic gene zzso strategy against diseases with multiple gene zzso such as viral infection and zzso
