zzso is the terminal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in all zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso iron into zzso IX, yielding zzso In zzso cells, zzso is a zzso inner zzso protein with the active site facing the zzso zzso values of zzso activity in all zzso are a characteristic of patients with zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been recently found to be associated with certain cases of zzso zzso During the past four years, there have been considerable advances in different aspects related to structure and function of zzso zzso and zzso clones for bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and human zzso have been isolated and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso strains deficient in this zzso and expression in zzso coli and in zzso insect cells of different zzso zzso have been zzso A recently identified zzso cluster appears to be a structural feature shared among zzso zzso Finally, functional studies of zzso zzso zzso in which key zzso acids were replaced with zzso identified in some cases of zzso will be summarized in the context of protein zzso
