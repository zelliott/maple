The zzso zzso consisting of the zzso core and zzso regulatory complexes, regulates zzso protein concentration through zzso degradation of targeted zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory complex as well as zzso modifications of the zzso zzso can effectively regulate the activity of the zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso affects the cell cycle, zzso and other cellular processes related to zzso Recent data show an additional zzso role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the human zzso of mouse zzso is a zzso zzso regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso Previous studies have identified zzso zzso In our study, we identify a modified zzso zzso zzso with distinct zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found in 6 normal, but not 4 transformed, breast zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso protein can be induced in zzso by addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and unmodified zzso have similar mass, but different zzso points, consistent with zzso In normal cells, unmodified zzso associates with the zzso zzso while modified zzso does zzso Whereas transformed cell line zzso contain neither zzso zzso zzso is predominantly zzso in normal cells, with the unmodified zzso present in both the zzso and zzso Together with the role of zzso zzso in zzso regulation, zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and differential zzso modification and nuclear zzso these data suggest a differential nuclear function of modified and unmodified zzso in zzso
