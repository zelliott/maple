We have shown in a previous study that zzso and zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso following short-term zzso exposure are zzso by temporally and zzso distinct zzso In the present study, we have used zzso zzso to remove potential zzso sites in the third zzso loop and zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso to study these zzso zzso zzso receptors were zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso cells, and kinetic parameters were zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso tail demonstrated that the single substitution of zzso abolished zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the adjacent zzso acid zzso also abolished zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso These data suggest that zzso in conjunction with zzso may comprise a motif necessary for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not affected with zzso of either the zzso or the zzso zzso However, receptors with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso tail zzso zzso and zzso failed to zzso in response to zzso zzso but were able to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are regulated by separate and distinct zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso tail of the human zzso zzso zzso
