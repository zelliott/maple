The G protein coupled receptors zzso comprise a large zzso of genes zzso numerous receptors which all show common structural features, zzso seven putative membrane spanning zzso Their biological functions are extremely diverse, ranging from vision and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso couple via multiple G proteins to a growing number of recognized second zzso pathway, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This review summarizes our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which the zzso activate second zzso systems, and it addresses their regulation and zzso
