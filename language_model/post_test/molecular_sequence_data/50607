zzso virus zzso zzso extensive zzso in infected rabbits and is associated with high levels of zzso The virus encodes multiple gene products designed to circumvent the cellular immune response to the viral zzso zzso analysis has shown that the zzso open reading frame zzso is an important zzso factor which zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso protein in viral zzso we zzso the zzso zzso zzso and showed that the sequence has motifs consistent with a zzso class III zzso zzso possessing a single zzso zzso near the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain that has six zzso zzso plus two consensus zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is expressed as an early zzso and surface zzso studies with zzso zzso reveal that zzso protein is transported to the infected cell zzso zzso analysis of an attenuated viral zzso zzso zzso indicates that an zzso zzso protein with an altered zzso is zzso at about zzso of wild type zzso however, it is not zzso on the cell surface, suggesting that proper zzso function requires zzso at the infected cell zzso We propose that zzso is a zzso factor whose function is to recognize an zzso zzso essential for the cellular inflammatory zzso
