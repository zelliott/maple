Human zzso virus zzso type 1, isolated from diverse sources, exhibits zzso zzso The mechanisms by which the zzso diversity takes place in individuals exposed to multiple virus zzso is yet to be zzso zzso variation, in general, might result from zzso events such as point zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso In an attempt to evaluate the process of genetic diversity, we designed experiments to analyze zzso between zzso zzso by using DNA zzso in cell zzso Here we report the successful zzso between truncated zzso zzso zzso with an overlap zzso of 53 base pairs that leads to the formation of viable hybrid zzso zzso was also seen between zzso DNA introduced into cells and zzso zzso sequences resident in the zzso These results indicate that zzso among various zzso zzso may play a significant role in the generation of genetic diversity of zzso Further, the method used here enables the construction of hybrid zzso zzso to identify the viral zzso responsible for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
