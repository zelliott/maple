Some specific zzso factors are essential for memory consolidation across zzso However, it is still unclear whether only the zzso of zzso expressed forms of these zzso zzso factors is involved in memory consolidation or their de zzso synthesis also occurs after zzso This question has remained unanswered partly because of the lack of an efficient method for the determination of copy numbers of particular zzso in single zzso which allows the detection of new zzso at the cellular zzso Here we applied a newly developed protocol of zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso to single zzso playing an important role in zzso zzso Specifically, we examined the changes in the zzso and protein expression levels of a highly zzso zzso factor, zzso binding protein zzso in the paired B2 zzso of the pond snail zzso zzso These zzso zzso are involved in the motor control of feeding behavior, with a potentially important role in zzso taste zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant decrease in zzso zzso copy numbers in the B2 zzso during memory consolidation after zzso zzso By contrast, zzso focusing and zzso of extracts of the zzso zzso showed that translation and zzso levels of zzso significantly increased during memory zzso The zzso zzso in the B2 zzso which are the major zzso component in the zzso zzso also significantly increased during memory consolidation, suggesting that the main source of increase in the level of protein in the zzso zzso are the B2 zzso Thus, early memory consolidation after zzso learning in zzso involves both the rapid synthesis and zzso of zzso as well as the rapid breakdown of zzso zzso in the neural network controlling zzso suggesting that all of these processes play a role in the function of zzso in memory zzso
