A novel family of zzso channel proteins has recently been discovered including two bovine zzso zzso one zzso zzso and two human zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso and molecular characterization of a truncated human zzso tentatively named zzso It was cloned from a human zzso zzso library and is expressed in numerous zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as determined by reverse zzso chain zzso Unlike all previously known zzso family members which consistently zzso an approximately zzso zzso protein that is zzso to form a zzso of two proteins of approximately 90 and 35 zzso the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso domain of its zzso Moreover, when expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso or Chinese zzso zzso cells, this zzso zzso is zzso into the culture zzso These observations suggest that zzso is a structurally divergent member of the zzso family of proteins and that it does not act as a channel protein but has zzso yet unidentified zzso
