zzso levels of plasma homocysteine is a risk factor in both birth defects and vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso dependent zzso which zzso zzso of homocysteine to zzso zzso zzso activity is expected to lead to increased levels of plasma zzso In addition, defects in this gene may zzso the zzso observed in a number of human tumor cell zzso We describe here the isolation and characterization of the human zzso zzso It contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 140 zzso The zzso acid sequence of the human zzso is zzso identical with that of the zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso identical with the predicted zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso sequences derived from zzso zzso zzso have substantial similarity to the human zzso Northern analysis indicates that the zzso zzso is present in a wide variety of zzso We have mapped the human gene to zzso location zzso a region found zzso in individuals with deletion zzso zzso The isolation of the zzso zzso will now allow the direct determination of whether zzso in this gene contribute to zzso neural tube zzso cardiovascular diseases, and birth zzso
