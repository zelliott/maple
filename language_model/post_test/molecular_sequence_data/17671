The expression site for the zzso surface zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso contains several genes of unknown function zzso for expression zzso zzso Among these, zzso 4 shows zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the region zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene belongs to a family of related zzso and zzso to the zzso DNA of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso 4 is transcribed only in zzso forms by a zzso zzso resistant to zzso at least three other members of this family are transcribed in both zzso and zzso forms, by a zzso zzso sensitive to the zzso These genes zzso different putative zzso proteins showing high sequence conservation in the region corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
