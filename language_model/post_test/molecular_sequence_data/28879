zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso allowed discrimination among strains causing the A, B, and C types of citrus bacterial zzso zzso and zzso of the relationship of these organisms with other species and zzso in the same zzso zzso of zzso based on sequence differences in the internally transcribed zzso and on a sequence from the zzso gene zzso involved in zzso were designed for specific identification of zzso causing zzso zzso The two sets were validated with a collection of zzso strains associated with citrus zzso The primer set based on zzso sequences had a high level of specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the set based on the zzso gene was universal for all types of zzso zzso Moreover, the relationships among worldwide zzso strains causing zzso were analyzed by amplification of repetitive sequences zzso repetitive zzso consensus and zzso zzso Under specific conditions, zzso of these zzso strains could be zzso and zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso of strains were associated with certain geographic areas of the world, and on this basis the origin of type A strains introduced into Florida could be zzso
