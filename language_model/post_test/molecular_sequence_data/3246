We previously reported on the isolation of a new rat zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso We now report the isolation of the full-length zzso and zzso clones containing the human zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to the cloned zzso human ABC zzso and contains the typical ABC signature, Walker A and B zzso We found that zzso is expressed at low levels in normal human zzso We found that zzso was zzso in human zzso zzso compared to paired surrounding zzso zzso We found that there was no difference in zzso gene copy between human liver cancer and its paired zzso zzso Because zzso was zzso in human zzso compared to zzso tissue in the absence of gene amplification, zzso regulation may play an important role in its zzso zzso we isolated a 14 zzso zzso DNA clone containing the zzso promoter and zzso zzso The zzso region contains a zzso island, lacks an appropriately positioned zzso element and contains a number of putative zzso factor binding zzso Two zzso start sites were identified by zzso zzso mapping at zzso and zzso zzso from the start zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso reporter gene resulted in a zzso increase in zzso activity compared to the empty zzso control whereas zzso zzso in the reverse orientation resulted in no zzso We observed a significant decrease in zzso activity with the promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso which indicates that an zzso functional promoter is contained within our previously predicted promoter region of zzso zzso to zzso zzso as deletion of this 250 zzso sequence resulted in a loss of promoter zzso
