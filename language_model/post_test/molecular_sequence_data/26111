zzso snails have a more complex array of zzso peptides than other zzso and zzso has a more complex array than most other zzso Since a full zzso of the zzso peptides is necessary for an understanding of zzso we sought to identify the members of two families of such peptides - the small zzso peptides zzso and the zzso peptides zzso - from zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of zzso from zzso both by their zzso times and by their molecular weights as determined by fast atom zzso mass zzso zzso These two criteria, used in zzso facilitated our identification of several known zzso zzso identical to zzso of zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these zzso only zzso and zzso have previously been reported from zzso We also discovered an additional SCP and two novel zzso and zzso zzso The SCP is zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso When these nine peptides were tested on isolated zzso zzso the zzso were the most potent zzso the zzso zzso were next, and the zzso had the least zzso
