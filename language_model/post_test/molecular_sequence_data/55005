zzso the zzso counterpart of adrenaline and zzso plays a key role in regulation of many zzso and behavioral processes in zzso It zzso these functions through binding to specific zzso zzso which are typical zzso zzso coupled zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso was cloned from the nerve zzso of the rice stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares high sequence similarity to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We generated an zzso cell line that zzso expresses zzso in order to examine the functional and pharmacological properties of this zzso zzso of zzso by zzso increased the production of zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso with a maximum response at 100 zzso zzso zzso also activated the zzso but with much less potency than zzso zzso and zzso had marginal effects on zzso zzso Using a series of known zzso and zzso for zzso zzso we observed a rather unique pharmacological profile for zzso through zzso of zzso The rank order of potency of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso The activated effect of zzso is abolished by zzso with zzso zzso or zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso impaired the motor ability of individual rice stem zzso The results of the present study are important for a better functional understanding of this zzso as well as for practical applications in the development of environmentally sustainable zzso
