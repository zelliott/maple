A random zzso zzso library was used to screen a pool of zzso zzso obtained from zzso arthritis zzso zzso After three rounds of zzso random individual zzso were selected by their capacity to react with individual zzso from zzso zzso By sequencing the zzso corresponding to the peptides displayed on the surface of the zzso we found that zzso displaying particular peptides were overrepresented in the selected zzso The peptides displayed by these zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The percentage of zzso positive for zzso was higher in zzso patients as compared to the normal adults zzso zzso zzso and the reacting zzso was mainly of zzso zzso The specificity of binding to the zzso displaying zzso was confirmed by competition experiments using both isolated zzso and a synthetic zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso displaying only zzso had no significant zzso with the zzso indicating that the zzso acids zzso of zzso are the vital for the zzso Taken together this study demonstrates that it is possible to select specific zzso from a random zzso library using zzso from zzso zzso In addition, this approach could be useful for identifying zzso zzso that might be part of zzso agents in zzso zzso
