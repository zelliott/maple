In zzso cells the expression of zzso zzso genes is coupled to the S phase of the cell zzso However, we have found a number of novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species in avian zzso round zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are transcribed from a subset of the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Two zzso derived from the zzso zzso transcripts were isolated and zzso The structures of these zzso reveal that the zzso zzso are identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells, except for the addition of zzso at the 3' zzso The site of zzso addition in the zzso zzso is located 26 to 28 zzso 3' of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the hairpin structures and zzso elements required for the zzso small nuclear zzso zzso reaction that generates the 3' ends of zzso zzso zzso are not zzso in zzso and are retained in the zzso zzso zzso
