zzso a small zzso protein zzso by the barley pathogen zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of defense responses in barley zzso carrying the resistance zzso zzso zzso employing spores from a virulent zzso race together with the zzso protein converted the zzso of the interaction from compatible to incompatible only on zzso zzso In addition, transformation of a virulent zzso race with the zzso gene yielded zzso zzso This demonstrated that the protein is the product of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to contain a single copy of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso clones revealed that the gene consists of two zzso and one zzso The derived zzso acid sequence comprised a zzso signal zzso of 22 zzso acids and a zzso mature protein of 60 zzso zzso All zzso races that were zzso on barley zzso of the zzso resistance zzso carry and express the zzso gene and zzso an zzso zzso zzso In contrast, races lacking this gene were zzso In addition, single zzso exchanges were detected in the coding region of the zzso zzso in one virulent zzso race and in a race whose interaction with barley is not controlled by the zzso zzso The resulting exchanges of single zzso acids render the gene products zzso Thus, the zzso interaction provides the first example of a zzso zzso to the zzso hypothesis in which a plant with a particular resistance gene recognizes a pathogen by a zzso factor, zzso one of its offensive zzso On the zzso side, in turn, recognition by the host plant is eluded by either deletion of the zzso gene or zzso of the primary structure of the gene zzso
