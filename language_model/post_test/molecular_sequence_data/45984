zzso zzso receptors zzso are a class of zzso receptors that possess a seven zzso region involved in the zzso of zzso synaptic transmission in the nervous zzso zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso possesses two zzso zzso zzso and zzso We screened the zzso zzso data base using the zzso binding domain of rat zzso as zzso and identified a new zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso involved in the binding of the zzso and zzso groups of zzso were well zzso in zzso but the zzso interacting with the zzso group of zzso were zzso The zzso analysis suggests that zzso zzso after the zzso zzso receptors split but before zzso family zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells and throughout zzso development, but the level of the expression was relatively high until 4 h after zzso zzso was localized to the plasma membrane of zzso grown zzso cells expressed as a green fluorescent protein fusion zzso zzso cells grew faster at high cell density and reached higher zzso than zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited delayed zzso formation upon zzso and impaired zzso toward zzso Although expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were rapidly induced and peaked at 2-4 h in zzso cells, zzso cells displayed sustained and peaked at 8 h of the expressions of these zzso Our findings suggest the involvement of zzso in the early development of zzso zzso
