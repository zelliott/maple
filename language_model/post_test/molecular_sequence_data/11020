The zzso zzso family is composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is classified into two zzso class I and II, based on zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso are essential light detectors for the early development of zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso is similar to those of the zzso although the zzso does not show the activity of zzso To investigate the functional divergence of the family, the zzso acid sequences of the proteins were zzso The alignment suggested that the recognition mechanisms of the zzso and the zzso of class I zzso zzso zzso I zzso are different from those of class II zzso zzso zzso II zzso We reconstructed the zzso trees based on the alignment by the NJ method and the zzso zzso The zzso analysis suggested that the ancestral gene of the family had zzso zzso zzso and that the gene zzso of the ancestral proteins had occurred at least eight times before the divergence between zzso and zzso
