The brown zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the major insect zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso The host resistance exhibits profound effects on growth, development and propagation of zzso zzso To investigate the molecular response of zzso zzso to host resistance, a zzso zzso length zzso zzso technique was employed to identify the zzso expressed genes in the zzso feeding on three rice zzso Of the zzso zzso bands zzso 54 were zzso and seven zzso zzso in zzso zzso when the zzso sources were changed from susceptible rice plants to resistant zzso zzso analysis of the differential zzso fragments showed that the genes involved in zzso stress response, gene expression regulation, zzso and metabolism were regulated by host zzso Four of the zzso fragments corresponding to genes zzso for a putative B zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were further characterized in zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that the expression of the four genes was enhanced in zzso zzso feeding on resistant rice zzso The roles of these genes in the defensive response of zzso zzso to host plant resistance were zzso
