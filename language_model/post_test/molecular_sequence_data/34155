zzso zzso zzso zzso influenza viruses zzso are a major cause of respiratory disease in zzso worldwide, causing considerable morbidity and zzso Continuous surveillance of circulating zzso strains is imperative for effective control and prediction of new emerging strains with zzso transmission zzso The current study characterized zzso zzso from commercial zzso population in USA zzso Nine zzso were completely zzso and the molecular evolution of all gene segments was zzso zzso analysis of the nine zzso viruses indicated that these strains belonged to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso grouping with zzso viruses of turkey origin, while forming a separate zzso from those of human and avian origin zzso Ten zzso acid changes were observed at the major zzso sites of zzso region compared to the zzso reference strain, with differences in zzso zzso All the nine strains were zzso related to the zzso turkey strain than the zzso reference zzso The results of this study suggest that contemporary zzso zzso strains circulating in North America share the same genetic zzso thus maintaining the gene pool without any further event of genetic zzso unlike zzso pandemic strain zzso These findings strongly support the need for continuous surveillance and monitoring of genetic changes in zzso to identify evolving strains that might pose a threat to human or animal zzso
