The interaction of zzso receptors and G proteins after chronic zzso treatment was investigated in zzso Male zzso rats zzso zzso were rendered tolerant to zzso by zzso injections of increasing doses of zzso twice daily for 4 or 6 zzso During this period, there was a zzso increase in the zzso values for zzso to inhibit the zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso from these animals revealed that the ability of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso to decrease zzso zzso binding zzso zzso the ratio zzso decreased significantly from the control value of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso after 6 days of zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to stimulate low zzso zzso activity was also zzso The zzso significantly increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control group to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 4 days of zzso treatment and was further increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after 6 days of zzso zzso The zzso stimulation by zzso decreased significantly from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso after 6 days of zzso zzso These results indicate that the interaction between zzso receptors and G proteins had been altered after chronic zzso zzso
