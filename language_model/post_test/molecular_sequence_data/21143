zzso belongs to a family of proteins implicated in childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso X E zzso mental zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is involved in zzso zzso Although zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms have not been clearly zzso zzso that interact with zzso may also play important roles in zzso zzso and are potential targets for novel zzso Using a functional zzso approach involving tandem zzso and zzso we identified 51 zzso proteins of various Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso participate in zzso regulatory mechanisms, including the zzso complex in zzso zzso In the present paper we report one of the first extensive zzso studies aimed at zzso zzso protein zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso which suggests that zzso function depends on zzso zzso We also mapped the zzso site with zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a direct zzso crucial for the function and regulation of the zzso The findings of the present study significantly expand the number of putative members of the zzso complex formed by zzso which is instrumental in promoting the zzso of specific genes in human zzso
