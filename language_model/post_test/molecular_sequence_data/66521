zzso zzso zzso is an orphan nuclear zzso involved in gene regulation of various zzso processes and zzso zzso We identified a new member of zzso gene in zzso zzso termed zzso The zzso gene has a complex structure with 15 zzso interrupted by 14 zzso It encodes an unusually long zzso protein of zzso zzso acids containing all the modular zzso found in nuclear zzso The zzso domain zzso of zzso is zzso and most similar to those of human and mouse zzso zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso is less zzso than the zzso it shares more diverse identity scores in different regions ranging from zzso to zzso in region II and zzso to zzso in region zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence is present in the zzso zzso This protein also contains a long hinge region zzso zzso and an F region zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of a zzso extract identified two zzso one with a size zzso zzso predicted by the zzso zzso sequence and a smaller component of 120 zzso zzso is expressed throughout the zzso life cycle with the highest expression in the egg zzso zzso zzso is widely distributed in adult worms but does not appear in zzso cells of female zzso zzso zzso to a variety of zzso but is most abundant in the zzso of the male and the zzso of female zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a role in regulating zzso development and sexual differentiation similar to other zzso family zzso
