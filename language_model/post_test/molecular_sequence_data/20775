The strongly zzso Double Digest Problem zzso for physical mapping of DNA, is now used for efficient zzso zzso zzso are inefficient in tackling large zzso produce only one solution while an instance may have multiple distinct zzso In this paper, we employ the notion of zzso among the distinct solutions to obtain almost all of zzso Our method comprises two zzso finding a representative from each zzso class using an elitist zzso Algorithm zzso for each representative generating the entire class zzso Experimental results tally for known zzso zzso reduction in search space provides notable zzso
