The gene for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized by isolation of clones covering the entire coding zzso zzso analysis reveals that the gene is divided into 30 zzso The first three zzso zzso the signal zzso the zzso zzso domain, and the zzso type II zzso while the final zzso encodes the zzso anchor and the zzso zzso The intervening 26 zzso zzso the eight zzso zzso and intervening zzso zzso However, no simple correlation between zzso boundaries and functional zzso zzso is zzso The pattern of zzso positions as well as comparison of the sequences of the zzso zzso suggests that the zzso of these zzso was an zzso ancient zzso
