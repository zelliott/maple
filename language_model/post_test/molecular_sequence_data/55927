Prior methods for the chemical synthesis of zzso peptides involved the incorporation of fully protected zzso acids into the zzso chain or zzso of free zzso side chains after zzso assembly is zzso The present work describes a novel and general methodology for the zzso synthesis of zzso featuring direct incorporation of N zzso zzso side zzso This technique zzso the formation of zzso byproducts containing zzso zzso a previously zzso side reaction from literature zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso binding protein were zzso by the zzso preferred zzso These peptides were zzso and characterized by zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zone zzso zzso zzso acid analysis zzso fast atom zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The synthetic peptides were tested as zzso for two distinct protein zzso zzso rat brain protein zzso zzso zzso and human acid zzso zzso specificity was measured at pH zzso and 37 degrees C, using a zzso zzso for released zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both the rat brain zzso and the human zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso but with different rates and zzso The rat brain zzso displayed classical zzso zzso with zzso of 68 zzso 9 zzso and 42 zzso 11 zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determined for zzso peptides of lengths 4 and 10 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
