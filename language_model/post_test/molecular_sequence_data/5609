zzso is a major zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of river zzso in humans, and the protein is zzso into the tissue occupied by the zzso DNA zzso zzso was isolated, and the protein was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso show that the protein contains a high affinity binding site for retinol, fluorescent fatty acids zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso zzso and, by competition, zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso The zzso zzso of zzso fatty acids is significantly zzso upon binding in comparison to similarly sized zzso zzso zzso and fatty zzso zzso Secondary structure prediction zzso indicate that a zzso zzso in zzso possibly in a coiled zzso zzso with no evidence of beta structures, and this was confirmed by circular zzso The protein is highly stable in solution, requiring temperatures in excess of 90 degrees C or high zzso zzso for zzso zzso therefore represents a novel class of small zzso zzso which appears to be confined to zzso The zzso binding activity of zzso could possibly contribute to the eye defects associated with zzso and, because there is no counterpart in zzso represents a strategic target for zzso
