zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing broad specificity zzso zzso Its previous structural determination in complex with zzso revealed probable bases for its efficient zzso of both large, zzso and smaller, zzso zzso Here we report two further structures of zzso complexes, to higher resolution of zzso which yield a better and thorough understanding of its zzso zzso The environment of the zzso zzso in the zzso site of the first complex strongly suggests an zzso zzso function for zzso It also reveals how the zzso tail ordering is linked to zzso zzso on zzso binding by a different mechanism to that seen in zzso coli zzso zzso The second complex structure with an unusual doubly zzso bound zzso shows how zzso modification of the zzso zzso is accompanied by small structural changes, presumably to zzso zzso When compared with structures of related proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso an additional zzso zzso zzso is observed in zzso zzso constraints lead to the corresponding zzso being zzso as zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A number of sequence zzso errors in databases are highlighted by this zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso related to a group of zzso primarily present in zzso zzso Even within this group zzso specificity is clearly variable highlighting the difficulties of zzso functional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
