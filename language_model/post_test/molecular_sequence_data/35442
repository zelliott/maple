A previously unknown zzso has been identified in a laboratory colony of the brown zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was first identified in zzso sequences obtained from zzso sequencing zzso of the brown zzso The complete viral zzso was zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso excluding the 3' zzso tail, and contained a single large open reading frame zzso coat proteins in the zzso region and zzso in the 3' zzso zzso motifs for coat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified in the deduced zzso zzso and the estimated molecular mass of the large zzso was zzso zzso detection of the viral zzso indicated that viral shedding occurred through the zzso of insects in the infected zzso To test transmission, the collected zzso were used to feed insects in a zzso zzso After 7 days, the expected zzso zzso was detected in the insects, indicating that the virus can be transmitted zzso This is the first zzso identified in zzso thus, we propose the name of the virus as zzso zzso zzso zzso
