The zzso zzso zzso zzso scaffold of the human zzso zzso zzso complex zzso contains the zzso domain zzso the zzso domain zzso and the inner core domain that are linked to carry out zzso functions in zzso channeling and zzso In this study, we employed zzso techniques to determine the structure of zzso and dynamics of several truncated zzso from the zzso component of the human zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The solution structure of zzso consists of two nearly parallel zzso separated by a long loop, similar to the structures of the zzso isolated from other species, but it lacks the short zzso zzso The zzso results show that the structures of zzso and zzso in isolated forms are not altered by the presence of the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso region is not entirely exposed to zzso where zzso zzso associated with approximately 50% of the zzso are zzso However, the zzso of these two zzso in zzso significantly zzso the overall zzso correlation times of zzso and zzso changing from zzso zzso and zzso zzso in isolated forms to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the linked zzso zzso We conclude that the presence of the zzso zzso restricts the zzso freedom of the zzso more significantly than zzso and that the zzso region likely exists as a soft rod rather than a flexible string in zzso
