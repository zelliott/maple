Natural populations of the marine zzso zzso exist as two main zzso inhabiting different layers of the ocean's zzso zzso These so-called high zzso zzso and low light zzso adapted zzso are both zzso and genetically zzso zzso strains can be separated into two major zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso strains are more zzso Here, we used several molecular techniques to study the genetic diversity of natural zzso populations during the zzso cruise in the Mediterranean Sea in the summer of zzso Using a dot zzso zzso technique, we found that zzso was the dominant zzso group and was confined to the upper mixed zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were only found below the zzso zzso a restriction zzso length zzso analysis of zzso zzso genes zzso the major zzso proteins of zzso suggested that there were at least four genetically different zzso occupying distinct but overlapping light niches in the zzso zzso At comparable zzso similar zzso patterns were observed throughout the sampled area, suggesting a horizontal homogenization of zzso Nevertheless, environmental zzso gene sequences retrieved from different depths at two stations proved all different at the zzso level, suggesting a large genetic zzso within those zzso
