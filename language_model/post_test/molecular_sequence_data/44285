We have recently demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with high affinity and zzso with zzso and we zzso that this interaction mediates zzso of G zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Penn, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso In this study, we localized the zzso binding domain of zzso using a variety of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso half of zzso is required for zzso zzso Assessment of the zzso binding properties of various zzso zzso fusion proteins indicated that the zzso zzso binding domain is contained within zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso further localized this domain to zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated the critical importance of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These results are complementary to the observation that zzso and basic zzso in zzso are critical for its interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lastly, an zzso zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to Ala was significantly defective in its ability to promote zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso Taken together, these results zzso a discrete region of zzso in high affinity binding to zzso an interaction critical for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
