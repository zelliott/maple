zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that zzso gene expression by binding to target zzso for zzso or zzso repression, and play important regulatory roles in zzso zzso Despite increasing genes have been predicted to be zzso targets by zzso analysis during kidney development, few of them have been verified by zzso The objective of our study is to identify the zzso targeting zzso a critical zzso factor that maintains the zzso zzso pool via zzso zzso during zzso zzso We initially analyzed the zzso of zzso and found 37 binding sites targeted by 50 putative zzso in the zzso of zzso Among the 50 zzso zzso is the zzso predicted by the three used zzso In our study, the results of zzso reporter zzso zzso and Western zzso demonstrated that zzso directly targeted on the zzso of zzso and zzso the expression of zzso at zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, zzso proliferation zzso along with the zzso rescue strategy showed that zzso suppresses the proliferation of zzso zzso by targeting zzso in zzso In our research, we concluded that by targeting the zzso factor gene zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso cells in zzso and might play an important role in the formation of zzso
