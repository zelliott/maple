We examined the cellular zzso of nine different zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso disease zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was made, but little or no protein was detected in one class of zzso In another class of zzso zzso protein was zzso in the zzso and at the cell surface, where it appeared as plaques and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a third class of zzso was restricted to the zzso where it often zzso with the zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso zzso have a zzso effect on the trafficking of zzso zzso resulting in a potentially toxic zzso zzso of zzso in these zzso These results and evidence of zzso zzso of other zzso zzso proteins suggest that diseases affecting zzso cells may share a common zzso
