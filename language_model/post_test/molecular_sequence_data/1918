To unravel the mechanisms that regulate the human zzso gene zzso in this study, we have used zzso zzso cells, human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell models for in zzso and in zzso zzso By transient zzso zzso within the promoter region zzso to zzso from zzso relative to the zzso initiation zzso we have initially identified several functional motifs including an zzso and 2 zzso zzso from gel mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso confirmed further that zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to these zzso and zzso in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso whereas only high levels of zzso is observed to bind the promoter in zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that the zzso ratio is instrumental to controlling zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso The functions of zzso and zzso proteins prompted us to investigate the possible involvement of DNA zzso in regulating this zzso zzso with this idea, we found a putative zzso island zzso to 262 from zzso that zzso with the human zzso gene zzso By zzso zzso all the zzso zzso zzso of them) within the zzso island in zzso cells are zzso whereas all these sites are zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The expressions of zzso in zzso and zzso cells were subsequently found to be significantly activated by a zzso agent, zzso zzso Taken together, our data indicate that the human zzso gene is controlled by the in zzso zzso ratio and the zzso status of the zzso
