Previous studies have suggested that the presence of sea ice is an important factor in zzso migration and determining the degree of genetic isolation among contemporary arctic fox zzso Because the extent of sea ice is dependent upon global temperatures, periods of significant cooling would have had a major impact on fox population connectivity and genetic zzso We tested this hypothesis by zzso and sequencing zzso control region sequences from 17 arctic zzso excavated from two zzso to zzso zzso archaeological sites in northeast Iceland, both of which zzso the Little Ice Age zzso zzso to zzso zzso Despite the fact that five zzso have been observed in modern zzso zzso a single zzso was shared among all of the ancient zzso zzso from simulations within an approximate zzso zzso framework suggest that the rapid increase in zzso arctic fox zzso diversity can only be explained by zzso fox immigration facilitated by the Little Ice zzso
