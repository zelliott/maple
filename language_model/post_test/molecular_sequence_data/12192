zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso on the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate its binding to specific zzso proteins in zzso zzso Using a pharmacological and genetic approach, we show that the amount of zzso zzso associated with zzso proteins zzso zzso with the amount of zzso zzso zzso products present in the zzso An explanation for this observation is provided by our finding that zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly and selectively to the zzso zzso of the 85 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and thereby blocks binding to zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso also specifically bound zzso zzso and the binding was zzso by a zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that production of zzso zzso at the membrane zzso the binding of zzso zzso to zzso This zzso may also recruit other zzso proteins to the membrane to initiate downstream zzso
