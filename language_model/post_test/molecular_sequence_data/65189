zzso is a central signal zzso in the zzso pathway, and a unique zzso zzso By screening a zzso library, we have isolated a zzso clone zzso that encodes the rice zzso zzso The full-length zzso clone was obtained by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso shares significant zzso acid sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso similarity and zzso zzso Both the numbers and positions of zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso coding regions are also zzso To address whether this structural similarity is indicative of functional conservation of the corresponding zzso we also generated transgenic lines expressing the zzso construct of zzso Those plants were stunted and shoot zzso was severely zzso Their zzso were similar to that found with zzso rice zzso that were treated with zzso an zzso signal zzso In the zzso zzso plants, the expression levels of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were decreased compared with the wild zzso These results suggest that zzso is a positive component of the zzso zzso in rice, just as zzso is in zzso Our zzso transgenic plants produced approximately zzso times more zzso than the zzso zzso zzso analysis of rice zzso and zzso genes showed that the transcript levels of zzso and zzso were elevated in the transgenic zzso
