Several zzso of zzso with zzso constraints in their zzso zzso have been modeled to determine energetically feasible zzso zzso of low-energy backbone structures of these peptides suggested unique zzso of the central zzso zzso characteristic for specific interactions of zzso with each of the five distinct zzso of zzso receptors zzso The zzso obtained were in good agreement with experimental data obtained earlier by zzso zzso and/or X-ray zzso The results help zzso experimental observations on the specificity of binding of various zzso zzso with different zzso of the zzso They also serve as templates for the design of zzso constrained zzso scaffolds that effectively and selectively interact with different zzso of zzso Such scaffolds can be convenient carriers of zzso and zzso labels in specific agents for imaging tumors expressing different zzso zzso
