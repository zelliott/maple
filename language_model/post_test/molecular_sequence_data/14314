A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from sewage sludge in a wastewater treating system of zzso zzso produced by zzso Group zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolate is a zzso and zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso and was identified as a strain of zzso using zzso zzso combined with analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso could degrade zzso through zzso When fed with nutrients such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could degrade zzso of TAP in the medium zzso zzso within 5 zzso The optimal pH and temperature for the degradation were zzso and zzso zzso An zzso distribution experiment showed that the zzso responsible for TAP degradation appeared to be zzso
