zzso zzso zzso is a highly regulated activity essential for DNA synthesis and zzso The activity and message levels of the zzso are elevated in cells treated with the tumor promoter zzso and this appears to be zzso through specific zzso elements in the zzso region of the zzso and zzso zzso that interact with zzso and zzso binding proteins called zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells with increased zzso and zzso message levels were observed to have increased zzso and zzso message zzso This was accompanied by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso region zzso zzso as judged by band shift and zzso zzso zzso in which zzso and zzso binding was markedly zzso This first description of zzso zzso cells altered in message stability regulatory zzso indicates another mechanism for acquiring resistance to an zzso zzso Furthermore, the present study strongly supports the concept that zzso and zzso are important general regulators of zzso zzso message stability and act as message zzso zzso
