A zzso zzso zzso zzso that plays an important role in the zzso zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by column zzso from an ammonium zzso zzso of zzso extract prepared from rat zzso It was zzso with marked delay from zzso B and H in a zzso zzso column by its specific interaction with the zzso and then effectively separated from zzso B and H and other zzso It was zzso with zzso M zzso after washing with zzso M zzso in a zzso column, indicating that it showed the same zzso behavior as zzso L from the zzso zzso It had activity to zzso zzso a synthetic zzso for zzso zzso including zzso B and zzso The zzso sequences of the final preparation of zzso zzso were identical with those of rat zzso zzso zzso and degradation of zzso by the final preparation were observed and effectively inhibited by a low level of zzso alpha as well as a general zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso From these results, it is concluded that zzso L plays a critical role in the zzso degradation of native zzso
