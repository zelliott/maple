zzso blood spots collected on filter paper are considered potential clinical specimens for zzso surveillance because of their ease of collection, storage, and zzso The usefulness of these samples for surveillance of zzso was evaluated in a field zzso Blood spots were collected by zzso from zzso clinically diagnosed zzso patients in suburban zzso mostly within a week after onset of the zzso zzso were collected between October, 2000 and April, 2003, and stored at 4 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in 200 zzso of the samples using an zzso zzso capture zzso For 201 samples zzso and zzso measurement was repeated 1 year after initial testing with essentially the same results, showing the stability of zzso in the filter paper under these zzso In a limited number of samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also tested with a commercial indirect zzso zzso Although the results of the two zzso correlated well, the zzso zzso capture zzso proved slightly more zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were obtained from 16 of 57 zzso samples zzso zzso of the 3' 456 zzso of the zzso gene showed the continued endemic circulation of zzso B3 viruses identified previously in this zzso Although problems related to limited sample quantities were encountered, the present study confirms the usefulness of dried blood spots for zzso zzso The results also demonstrate that zzso continues to be endemic in the zzso
