The complete zzso sequences of two copies of a putative zzso sequence zzso from zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso is zzso base pairs long, contains a long open reading frame which could code for a protein of 317 zzso zzso and has imperfect terminal zzso repeats of 6 base pairs zzso by the terminal sequencing of zzso copies of zzso but does not cause a target site zzso There are at least 6 copies of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso A search of the zzso data base revealed that the putative 317 zzso acid protein had significant zzso with open reading frames in the zzso elements zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
