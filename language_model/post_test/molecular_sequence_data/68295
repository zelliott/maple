The zzso box is a zzso regulatory motif which is found upstream of plant genes zzso cab and zzso whose zzso is regulated by light and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to resolve two different groups of I box binding factors zzso in tomato nuclear zzso Active components of the first group zzso recognize the zzso box of the zzso zzso zzso one factor within this group, zzso also recognizes the adjacent G box, which has been shown previously to bind a different class of plant zzso factors, the G box binding factors zzso To the limit of experimental resolution, zzso and zzso compete for the same zzso on the G zzso Nevertheless, these two activities are zzso and zzso zzso The relative abundance of zzso shows a vast decrease in zzso zzso zzso in the second group zzso recognize the zzso box of the zzso promoter, which is regulated both by light and the zzso zzso one factor within this group, zzso also binds the zzso box of a second promoter showing similar regulation, the cab zzso The zzso binding sites on the cab and zzso promoters show extensive zzso to a zzso zzso promoter element from zzso The abundance of zzso is zzso regulated and shows a dramatic induction around the onset of the light zzso Transfer of the plants in continuous darkness demonstrates that this induction is under the control of a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
