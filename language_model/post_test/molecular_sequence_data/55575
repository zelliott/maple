Both of the independently isolated zzso plasmids zzso and zzso contain multiple regions zzso to the zzso regulatory gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The three zzso on zzso vary in the extent of their zzso to zzso zzso is zzso identical to zzso and is located relative to the single copy of zzso in exactly the same way as zzso and zzso on zzso The DNA sequence of zzso is zzso identical to the zzso sequence within the coding region but the zzso DNA upstream is not zzso There is a zzso change at the end of the coding region which causes the C zzso of zzso to be extended by an additional 10 zzso acids relative to zzso zzso is anomalous and appears to zzso a truncated zzso lacking the first 525 bases found in the other zzso zzso Evidence is presented to show that both zzso and zzso act as regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carries two zzso of zzso zzso is functional and is a hybrid zzso its zzso end and the upstream sequences are highly zzso to both zzso and zzso whereas its 3' end is identical to zzso The sequence of zzso is identical to that of the anomalous truncated zzso zzso of the organization and the restriction maps of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso together with the zzso sequences presented here, indicates that the zzso DNA on zzso has derived from a zzso on which the zzso genes are organized similarly to zzso and that a genetic zzso has taken place involving a zzso zzso internal to two of its zzso zzso
