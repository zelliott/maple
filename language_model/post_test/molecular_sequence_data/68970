The zzso properties of zzso A zzso zzso partially zzso from the zzso of seven cases of human zzso cell zzso were studied individually and compared with those of normal zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso value of the zzso toward a synthetic zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso the optimal pH of the zzso ranged from pH zzso to zzso and the zzso showed fairly stable for metal zzso These zzso characteristics were similar to those of the normal zzso On the contrary, the zzso structures of the zzso from the zzso zzso studied by zzso affinity zzso were statistically different from those of the normal zzso zzso both complex type of zzso as well as hybrid type zzso without zzso linkage to the zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased in the zzso from the zzso zzso while high zzso type zzso and hybrid type zzso with zzso linkage to the zzso zzso were significantly decreased in the zzso zzso compared to the normal zzso These results indicate that the processing of zzso of the zzso has possibly changed in the zzso zzso
