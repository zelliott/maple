zzso factor 4 zzso or zzso is an inhibitor of the cell zzso The gene zzso zzso is localized on zzso zzso previously shown to exhibit zzso loss in zzso cancer zzso In this study, we show that the mean level of zzso zzso in a panel of 30 zzso was zzso that of paired normal zzso zzso Similarly, the levels of zzso zzso and protein in a panel of six established zzso cell lines were significantly lower than those of an zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Using highly zzso DNA markers that flank the zzso zzso we found evidence for loss of zzso zzso in two of eight surgically zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was observed in five of six zzso cell lines with one additional cell line exhibiting zzso deletion in the zzso zzso We also found that the zzso region of zzso was zzso in a subset of zzso zzso specimens and cell zzso Lastly, the zzso frame of zzso in two of three zzso cell lines examined contained several point zzso that resulted in a diminished ability to activate the zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is a potential tumor zzso gene in zzso
