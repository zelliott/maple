zzso by the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso is dependent on an zzso zzso sequence that contains a zzso of the zzso zzso An ordered series of zzso complexes can be assembled on this zzso requiring the interactions of zzso alpha zzso and two additional cellular factors zzso and zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso whereas alpha zzso also a zzso zzso zzso recognizes sequences within the zzso zzso zzso The partially zzso C1 factor interacts directly with alpha zzso in the absence of DNA and is required to form a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso domain of zzso is a zzso sequence recognition structure, as both the zzso box and the zzso zzso box contribute directly to the recognition of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso box alone is sufficient to direct the cooperative binding of alpha zzso and to assemble the zzso zzso factor zzso
