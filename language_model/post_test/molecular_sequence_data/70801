Fold assignments for proteins from the zzso coli zzso are carried out using zzso a zzso alignment algorithm, recently tested on fold recognition benchmarks and on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the newest generation of the de facto standard in zzso search zzso The fold assignments are followed by automated modeling and the resulting three-dimensional models are analyzed for possible function zzso Close to zzso of the proteins zzso in the zzso coli zzso can be recognized as zzso to a protein family with known zzso Most of these zzso zzso of the entire zzso can be recognized both by zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the latter recognizes an additional 260 zzso Previous estimates suggested that only zzso of zzso coli proteins can be characterized this zzso This dramatic increase in the number of recognized zzso between zzso coli proteins and structurally characterized protein families is partly due to the rapid increase of the database of known protein structures, but mostly it is due to the significant improvement in prediction zzso Knowing protein structure adds a new dimension to our understanding of its function and the predictions presented here can be used to predict function for zzso zzso Several examples, analyzed in more detail in this paper, include the zzso protein protecting DNA from zzso damage zzso to be zzso to zzso with iron zzso acting as a reducing zzso and the zzso family of zzso which provides resistance to various zzso agents zzso to be zzso to zzso zzso
