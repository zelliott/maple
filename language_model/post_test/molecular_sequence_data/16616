zzso studies incorporating multiple zzso and multiple zzso are becoming increasingly zzso zzso with this trend in genetic zzso zzso likelihood techniques including zzso zzso methods continue to gain zzso Few studies, however, have examined model fit and sensitivity to such potentially zzso data partitions within combined data analyses using empirical zzso Here we investigate the relative model fit and sensitivity of zzso zzso methods when alternative zzso partitions of zzso rate variation (with and without zzso zzso are zzso Our primary goal in choosing a zzso model was to employ the simplest model that was a good fit to the data while zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Thus, we were not interested in complex models that did not practically affect our interpretation of the zzso under zzso We applied these alternative models to a zzso data set including one zzso nuclear gene zzso one zzso zzso gene zzso and two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso for the diverse yet poorly known zzso family zzso Our results suggest that the zzso model zzso zzso rate variation separately among the zzso zzso and zzso + zzso gene zzso We found this model yielded identical zzso to those from analyses based on the zzso model, but significantly changed zzso probability estimates of zzso zzso This zzso model also produced more precise (less zzso estimates of zzso probabilities across generations of long zzso runs, compared to runs employing a zzso model estimated for the combined zzso We use this three-way gamma zzso in zzso analyses to reconstruct a robust zzso hypothesis for the relationships of zzso within the zzso family zzso We then zzso the zzso zzso arrangement of the zzso Based on our findings, we discuss the utility of nontraditional parameters for modeling zzso rate variation and the implications and future directions for complex model building and zzso
