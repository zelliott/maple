Discovery of sexual development in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as detection of a novel class of zzso zzso precursors in this fungus indicates promising insights into its physiology and zzso Here we investigated the role of the two zzso receptors zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We found that these zzso receptors show an unexpectedly high genetic zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso female fertility in their zzso mating types zzso or zzso zzso and mediate induction of zzso body zzso One compatible zzso zzso zzso pair zzso or zzso in mating partners was sufficient for sexual zzso Additionally, zzso receptors were essential for zzso development, hence indicating their involvement in zzso zzso Neither zzso precursor genes nor zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso were transcribed in a strictly mating type dependent manner, but showed enhanced expression levels in the zzso mating zzso In the presence of a mating partner under conditions favoring sexual development, transcript levels of zzso precursors were significantly increased, while those of zzso zzso genes do not show this zzso In the female sterile zzso zzso strain zzso zzso responses of zzso precursor and zzso zzso genes to a mating partner were clearly altered compared to the female fertile zzso strain zzso zzso a delayed and inappropriate response to the mating partner may be one aspect causing female zzso in zzso
