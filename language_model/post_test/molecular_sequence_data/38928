Cell surface zzso zzso is commonly regarded as a zzso zzso zzso factor required for survival and development of these zzso in zzso In this study, the zzso zzso gene zzso was deleted in zzso zzso by targeted gene zzso The resulting zzso are deficient in zzso synthesis but still display on their surface and zzso zzso zzso most likely in the form of zzso whose expression appears to be zzso zzso zzso zzso show no significant differences to zzso zzso with respect to attachment to, zzso into and zzso inside zzso Moreover, in zzso and zzso mice, zzso zzso clones are at least as virulent as the parental zzso strain and lead to lethal zzso zzso The results demonstrate that at least zzso zzso does not require zzso for experimental infections of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore not a zzso factor in the zzso zzso
