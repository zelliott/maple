zzso functions as a zzso transient zzso potential zzso channel in kidney zzso cells and when zzso results in human zzso dominant zzso kidney zzso For further exploration of the in zzso functions of zzso this study examined its expression and function during zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and its presence in the zzso kidney could be confirmed by reverse zzso on isolated zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed protein expression in zzso kidney zzso cell zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was segment zzso in the zzso zzso segment, zzso was localized to zzso cell zzso whereas in the zzso zzso segment, zzso was concentrated in zzso zzso zzso zzso also was expressed in muscle cells and in a variety of sensory cells that are associated with zzso including cells of the ear, the lateral line organ, and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression resulted in zzso kidney zzso body axis zzso organ zzso zzso and zzso that could be rescued by expression of a human zzso zzso zzso deletions in the first zzso loop and zzso zzso zzso cluster sorting zzso zzso binding sites in the zzso tail caused zzso zzso to the zzso cell zzso Unlike zzso zzso transport protein zzso zzso zzso formation was not associated with zzso defects and instead correlated with reduced kidney fluid zzso expansion of zzso duct zzso cell zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
