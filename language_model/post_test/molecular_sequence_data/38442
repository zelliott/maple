The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is comprised of 308 zzso acids and shows 65 and 38% zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso and Homo zzso zzso The protein contains three zzso clusters common to zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso retrieval signal as do the proteins from zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso conditional lethal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was isolated and expressed in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicated an zzso acid substitution within the region of the protein zzso by the zzso clusters involved in iron zzso zzso indicate that zzso conditional lethal zzso of target genes have potential use in the rescue of zzso zzso in genes that are essential for zzso
