zzso (Al) and zzso zzso zzso are essential traits for plants to adapt to acid soil zzso In zzso zzso zzso these zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso factor, zzso TO zzso zzso zzso which regulates the zzso of multiple genes critical for tolerance to both zzso Here, the functions of zzso proteins zzso zzso in other plant species were characterized by reverse zzso analyses and in zzso zzso zzso zzso interference of a gene for zzso zzso Al and zzso zzso of tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso roots released zzso in response to Al, zzso with the zzso zzso of an zzso of an Al tolerance gene zzso a zzso zzso and toxic compound zzso zzso The zzso interference repression of zzso blocked this process and also zzso the zzso of another zzso gene for Al zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso regulates Al tolerance in tobacco through the zzso regulation of these zzso The in zzso zzso zzso revealed that other plant species, including woody plants, a zzso and a moss zzso zzso possess functional zzso proteins that can activate several zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso out the gene zzso the zzso protein decreased the Al tolerance of zzso zzso Together, our results strongly suggest that zzso regulation by zzso proteins is zzso zzso among land plants and that it zzso the ability to survive in acid zzso through the zzso regulation of zzso and zzso zzso
