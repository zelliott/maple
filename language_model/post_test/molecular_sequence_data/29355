The main objective of the present study was to assess the specificity and sensitivity of a modified zzso using short synthetic peptides of the zzso region of zzso zzso which is the main target for zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso employing a panel of synthetic peptides of zzso zzso and using zzso washes to detect high zzso zzso zzso were compared with those obtained by the zzso mobility zzso and DNA zzso The zzso correctly typed zzso of zzso B zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso of zzso E samples zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso and zzso of zzso C specimens zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso In contrast, only 50% of zzso A zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso of zzso D zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso and zzso of zzso F samples zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso were correctly zzso This approach was also able to discriminate in a few samples zzso from patients infected with B zzso circulating in Brazil and Thailand that reacted zzso The zzso described in this study are relatively rapid and simple to perform compared to molecular approaches and can be used to screen large numbers of serum or plasma zzso Moreover, the zzso in zzso zzso may overestimate zzso diversity and a zzso into zzso based on zzso zzso diversity or another principal zzso domain, may be more helpful for vaccine development and identification of zzso
