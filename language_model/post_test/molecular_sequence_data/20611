Work on zzso zzso to zzso zzso tobacco black root rot has focused on zzso zzso to zzso The role of zzso zzso populations has been zzso and whether they differ in black root zzso versus zzso zzso is zzso To assess this possibility, tobacco was grown in a zzso and a conducive soil of similar zzso properties, and zzso community composition was compared using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains zzso zzso and targets 19 bacterial zzso Among them, 398 zzso were designed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso known to include strains relevant for plant protection or plant growth zzso zzso zzso as well as principal component analysis of zzso data zzso clearly between black root zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso had no impact on zzso community zzso In addition to fluorescent zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are known to comprise strains with zzso properties, were more prevalent in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and others were more prevalent in the conducive zzso For selected zzso zzso results were largely zzso by quantitative zzso and zzso In conclusion, this work identified novel bacterial zzso that could serve as indicators of disease zzso in zzso zzso and it extends the range of bacterial zzso hypothesized to participate in black root rot zzso
