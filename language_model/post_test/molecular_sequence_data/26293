Genes or zzso zzso sugar transport proteins have recently been isolated from a variety of zzso and zzso zzso By sequencing the cloned DNA, the zzso acid sequences of the transport proteins have been predicted and found to comprise a zzso family extending from zzso through zzso algae and zzso to zzso including zzso mouse and zzso By aligning all the sequences and comparing them with those of membrane transport proteins for other zzso we can deduce which features of the primary sequences are critical for maintenance of structure and zzso Furthermore, the conservation of extended zzso and zzso regions enables the construction of a consensus model of their arrangement in the zzso zzso sequence motifs are identified and their occurrence in otherwise apparently unrelated bacterial transport proteins for zzso and zzso are zzso
