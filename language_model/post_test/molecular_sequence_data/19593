zzso is the most abundant zzso 3' zzso zzso DNA zzso It has been described to form part of the zzso complex and is responsible for the zzso syndrome in zzso Here we show that the zzso activity is correlated to the binding preferences toward certain DNA zzso In particular, we have found three motifs that are selected, zzso zzso and zzso To zzso how the discrimination occurs, we determined the crystal structures of two zzso zzso complexes, with a zzso product of the zzso reaction, and with a zzso DNA zzso Using zzso zzso we observed zzso both in nuclear and zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso in the nucleus requires the loss of a zzso segment, which we named zzso repeat zzso Furthermore, we detected the presence of a zzso zzso region on the surface of zzso This observation points to interactions with zzso zzso The potential interacting motif zzso does not contain aromatic zzso and thus resembles other sequences that select zzso and/or Group 2 WW zzso By means of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso experiments, we show that, indeed, a zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso sequence zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso studies confirmed this interaction with the full-length zzso zzso thereby suggesting that zzso zzso in more functional complexes than previously zzso
