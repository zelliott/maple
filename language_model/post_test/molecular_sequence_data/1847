zzso is a zzso acid protein zzso by zzso virus zzso that zzso to the pore module of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be a model for studying the protein design of zzso channel zzso We analyzed the molecular diversity generated by approximately 1 billion years of evolution on zzso genes isolated from 40 additional zzso zzso Because the channel is apparently required for virus zzso the zzso zzso are all functional and contain multiple and dispersed zzso that represent a repertoire of allowed sets of zzso acid zzso (from 4 to 12 zzso zzso zzso between zzso acid zzso and the new properties displayed by these channels guided zzso zzso that revealed synergistic zzso acid interactions within the protein as well as previously unknown interactions between distant channel zzso The effects of these multiple changes were not predictable from a zzso structural knowledge of the channel zzso
