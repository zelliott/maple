All zzso zzso so far studied at the primary sequence level appear to have evolved from a common ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate regions likely to be essential for zzso activity, zzso and zzso zzso There is a very highly zzso sequence over 100 zzso zzso in length within the zzso region upstream of the zzso zzso zzso genes in several different strains of zzso zzso indicating that a sequence of this length is needed to direct and regulate the expression of these zzso
