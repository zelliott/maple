zzso design and engineering of zzso peptides remains a largely unsatisfied zzso We have hypothesized that this is due, in part, to the fact that some membrane activities, such as zzso are not dependent on specific zzso acid sequences or specific three-dimensional zzso zzso Instead they depend on zzso activity: the ability of a zzso to partition into the zzso interface and to alter the packing and organization of zzso Here we test that idea by taking a zzso approach to zzso engineering and design of zzso zzso A zzso rational zzso zzso library, containing peptides of zzso zzso acids in zzso was screened for soluble members that zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso screen was used to identify 10 unique peptides that had potent zzso activity but were also water zzso These rare and uniquely active peptides do not share any particular sequence zzso zzso zzso or net charge, but instead they share common compositional features, secondary structure, and core zzso We show that they function by a common mechanism that depends mostly on zzso activity and leads to transient pore zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso libraries coupled with zzso zzso screens can lead to the discovery of diverse, zzso and highly potent zzso zzso
