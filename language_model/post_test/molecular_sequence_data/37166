zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the type species of the zzso zzso zzso family), has two highly unusual traits shared by several zzso zzso First, the zzso virus zzso that establishes primary infection in the zzso following its zzso by host larvae contains multiple zzso all of which enter the same zzso zzso Second, zzso the envelope fusion protein of the zzso virus zzso that spreads infection beyond the zzso is zzso both early and late during zzso We tested the hypothesis that, together, these two traits enable parental zzso zzso to bud from infected zzso cells, essentially as zzso to establish secondary infections prior to completion of viral replication within the zzso This zzso strategy would enable the virus to counter the zzso principal defense, zzso of infected zzso cells, by accelerating the onset of systemic zzso To test this hypothesis, we created an zzso zzso zzso that can express zzso only during the late phase of infection zzso with the other structural zzso We then compared the zzso of this virus to that of a control zzso virus that expresses zzso in a zzso zzso We found that when administered orally, the control virus was far more virulent and established secondary infection earlier than zzso but when administered zzso zzso and zzso of the two zzso were zzso Our results demonstrate that early zzso expression is a key component of a unique and highly zzso zzso infection zzso
