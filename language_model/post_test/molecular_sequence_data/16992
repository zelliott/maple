In this work we report the isolation, zzso and characterization of a new zzso from latex of zzso zzso zzso Crude extract zzso was obtained by gathering latex on zzso M zzso buffer with zzso and zzso with subsequent zzso zzso zzso were made on zzso or zzso as zzso zzso activity was completely inhibited by zzso zzso at different temperatures, optimum pH and zzso strength were evaluated by measuring the residual zzso activity at different times after the zzso zzso showed the highest zzso activity at pH zzso in the presence of 12 zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso exchange zzso zzso Two active zzso homogeneous by zzso were zzso The major zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a molecular mass of zzso zzso by mass zzso and a zzso higher than zzso The zzso sequence showed a high similarity with those of other plant zzso zzso When zzso on zzso zzso the zzso showed higher preference for the zzso zzso zzso of kinetic zzso zzso and zzso were performed with zzso
