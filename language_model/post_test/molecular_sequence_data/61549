The objective of this study was to evaluate the low weight zzso zzso protein profile of bovine seminal plasma using two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso and to determine if any of these proteins was associated with zzso zzso zzso plasma was collected from 16 bulls of high or low zzso zzso Twelve protein spots were identified from the zzso gel zzso six of these were present in all zzso Of the 12 proteins found, three spots, present in all samples, 3 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso had zzso variation among bulls, regardless of their zzso zzso Four proteins were more abundant zzso in seminal plasma samples collected from bulls with high zzso zzso than in samples of bulls with low zzso zzso the spots 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, spot 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso was more abundant zzso on seminal plasma samples from bulls with low zzso zzso The zzso sequence of protein 7 was identical to the zzso seminal fluid protein zzso zzso 23 (after zzso zzso had structural similarity to bovine zzso We concluded that there were differences in the seminal plasma protein profile from bulls with low and high zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins 3 and 11 may be used as zzso zzso zzso and protein 25 was related to low zzso zzso
