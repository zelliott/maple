A region of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso that is frequently found to be altered after serial passage of the virus in cell culture was zzso zzso analysis of this region of the zzso in zzso and zzso viruses revealed that some of the zzso affected a 675 zzso open reading frame, designated zzso The zzso gene was disrupted both by deletion and by zzso of sequences that resembled zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso showed that it was expressed very early after zzso zzso transcripts could be detected after the 1 h viral zzso period upon infection of cultured zzso zzso zzso These transcripts were mapped by zzso protection zzso A zzso virus was constructed in which zzso was disrupted by zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso This virus was viable in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and analysis of the zzso of protein synthesis revealed no differences between zzso and zzso zzso The disruption of zzso also did not interfere with the ability of the virus to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
