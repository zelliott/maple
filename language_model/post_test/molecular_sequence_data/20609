zzso were earlier found to be zzso more abundant than zzso in deep zzso groundwater at the zzso Hard Rock Laboratory zzso Using a most probable number zzso method, zzso zzso cells of zzso bacteria per zzso were found in groundwater from seven zzso at the zzso zzso The content of zzso zzso infecting the indigenous zzso zzso zzso in zzso groundwater was zzso using the zzso technique for zzso In four of 10 zzso zzso zzso per zzso were found at depths of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were made from five zzso Using transmission electron zzso these were characterized and found to be in the zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso were further zzso regarding host range and were found not to zzso five other species of zzso or 10 zzso zzso with up to zzso zzso zzso gene sequence identity to zzso zzso To further zzso zzso zzso using a direct count method, growth of the zzso and their host was followed in batch cultures, and the viral burst size was calculated to be approximately 170 zzso per zzso event, after a zzso period of approximately 70 zzso When surviving cells from infected zzso zzso batch cultures were zzso into new cultures and zzso immunity to the zzso was zzso The zzso system found implies that viruses are important for microbial zzso diversity and activity, and for microbial numbers in deep subsurface zzso
