The zzso and spatial expression of the zzso gene of zzso zzso which encodes a type IV zzso zzso was zzso A reporter gene fusion to the zzso opening reading frame revealed that this gene is not transcribed during zzso growth but is transcribed during the last steps of the zzso process and is localized to the developing zzso zzso In agreement with these results, zzso zzso were mainly detected by both Northern zzso and reverse zzso during the last steps of zzso The expression pattern of the zzso fusion suggested that zzso may be an additional member of the zzso zzso A primer extension product mapped the zzso start site of zzso 54 to 55 zzso upstream of translation start zzso of zzso Such an extension product was obtained from zzso samples of zzso cells but not from those of zzso growing zzso zzso of the zzso sequence lying upstream of the in zzso zzso zzso start site revealed the presence of a sequence with good zzso to promoters preceding genes of the zzso zzso Although zzso expression was temporally zzso neither zzso damage (after either treatment with zzso or hydrogen zzso nor zzso C treatment induced the zzso of this zzso
