In this study, we have investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and T cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in two way mixed zzso cultures zzso enhanced by zzso A zzso to assess whether this is a useful zzso method for severe zzso disease zzso and graft failure in zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso zzso zzso Our present study revealed increased zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso using this zzso in patients with delayed zzso followed by graft failure and patients who developed grade III acute zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso medium were also observed in these zzso zzso T cell surface zzso gene expression in our modified zzso zzso zzso gene expression was not altered so much in zzso zzso patients, however, zzso and zzso gene expression were elevated in patients with graft failure and severe acute zzso The elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and T cell surface molecules zzso and zzso zzso in our modified zzso in patients who developed severe lethal zzso complications may suggest an important role for these molecules in inducing a strong zzso zzso the detection of increased gene expression of those zzso in our modified zzso system, appeared to be useful for predicting zzso complications in zzso zzso zzso In addition, this modified zzso zzso may also be useful for the selection of the most compatible related and unrelated zzso
