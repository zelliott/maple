The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly impacts on human zzso and does so through interaction with class II G zzso receptors named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso The molecular nature of zzso binding to receptors remains zzso In this work, we have zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso by the following zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso in positions 6, 22, and 24 of zzso were used to zzso the zzso After zzso zzso and zzso sequencing of labeled zzso fragments, it was shown that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are in contact with zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso was determined by zzso showing a central alpha zzso a zzso zzso zzso segment and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of the zzso of zzso was constructed by using the zzso structure of the zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso as a zzso As expected, the fold is identified as a short consensus repeat with two zzso beta sheets and is stabilized by three zzso zzso zzso Taking into account the constraints provided by zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso nicely lies in the zzso zzso part, but the N zzso region of zzso is free for interacting with the zzso zzso zzso The data provide a structural rationale to the proposed zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso and more generally of class II G zzso zzso
