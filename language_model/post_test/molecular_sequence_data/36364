zzso of a zzso DNA zzso by complementary zzso zzso to zzso A5 has been zzso The zzso efficiently cleave the DNA at the zzso sequences near the zzso binding zzso The temperature dependence of the reaction and the composition of the degradation products indicate that the zzso zzso attacks the available zzso DNA regions within the zzso duplex and in the hairpin DNA region in the vicinity of the carrier zzso binding zzso
