Small cell lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso releasing zzso zzso The zzso growth cycle of zzso in zzso can be disrupted by zzso zzso zzso such as zzso Here several zzso zzso were zzso zzso and incubated with intact zzso cells at 37 degrees C in zzso medium in a zzso fashion zzso minutes) to determine zzso zzso The zzso stability of the compounds was determined by subsequent zzso zzso The zzso zzso ranged from 154 minutes to zzso minutes for the six zzso zzso zzso was found to be very stable to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also inhibited zzso zzso formation in zzso in a zzso zzso When zzso was incubated with zzso cells, it inhibited zzso binding with an zzso value of 30 zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso such as zzso may be useful for the treatment of zzso
