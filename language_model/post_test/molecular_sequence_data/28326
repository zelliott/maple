During the development of a zzso from a zzso after cell mating in zzso all the genes zzso zzso are excised from zzso zzso as individual small DNA zzso zzso are added to the ends of each zzso zzso and each is zzso mostly by approximately zzso to yield a zzso active zzso As a part of the study of the zzso of genes from zzso we have cloned six fragments of zzso DNA from zzso nova, each containing a full copy of an zzso zzso for comparison with the structure of the zzso DNA zzso in the zzso All six zzso zzso clones had the same overall organization as judged by restriction zzso Two zzso zzso clones were zzso These differ from one another at a few zzso positions but both prescribe precisely the same zzso zzso Both zzso zzso genes contain nine zzso separated by eight zzso zzso The zzso gene contains these nine zzso without zzso zzso zzso the order 1 through 9 to the nine zzso zzso the order in the zzso is zzso In the zzso zzso zzso all nine zzso possess terminal repeat zzso These repeat sequences provide precise directions for zzso and joining of the nine zzso to yield the zzso order in the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso DNA of the related species, zzso zzso shows that the zzso gene has an zzso arrangement in this species zzso
