zzso and related peptides are key hormones for the regulation of growth and zzso Here we describe a novel high affinity zzso zzso protein zzso zzso from cells of the insect zzso zzso This zzso is composed of two zzso C2 zzso has a molecular mass of 27 zzso binds human insulin with an affinity of 70 pm, and zzso insulin signaling through the insulin zzso The binding protein also binds zzso growth factors I and II, zzso zzso and an insulin analog lacking the last 8 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso whereas an insulin analog with a zzso zzso bound with only zzso of the affinity of human zzso This binding profile suggests that zzso recognizes a region that is highly zzso in the insulin zzso but distinct from the classical insulin zzso binding zzso The closest zzso of the zzso zzso binding protein is the essential gene product zzso found in zzso where it is implicated in neural and zzso development zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso protein also binds insulin and related zzso offering a possible functional explanation to the zzso zzso zzso
