zzso zzso is a hormone which has been shown to exhibit a range of potentially beneficial actions for zzso of zzso However, exploitation of zzso therapies has been severely restricted due to degradation by the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the zzso zzso and zzso actions of chemically zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were incubated with zzso to assess zzso stability and pancreatic zzso to evaluate insulin zzso zzso production was assessed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso insulin zzso food intake and zzso were examined in obese diabetic zzso zzso zzso displayed enhanced zzso resistance compared to zzso and zzso All peptides demonstrated similar in zzso zzso and zzso actions, which was associated with dual action at zzso and zzso zzso Acute administration of zzso and zzso reduced plasma zzso and food zzso whilst plasma insulin levels were zzso zzso administration of zzso for 14 days to zzso mice decreased food zzso zzso plasma zzso and increased plasma zzso Furthermore, daily zzso improved zzso zzso increased zzso insulin zzso pancreatic insulin content, zzso and decreased both zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to improve zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso and markers of fat metabolism suggests significant promise for zzso therapies for zzso
