The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit striking binding zzso for immobilized zzso over other components of the zzso zzso such as collagen and zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso binding by the zzso and conversely, zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso binding pocket of the zzso is involved in the binding of zzso The addition of zzso but not zzso or collagen to zzso zzso zzso significantly reduces zzso liver zzso formation in severe combined zzso mice, further supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso zzso The specific interaction of zzso zzso with zzso may be exploited in designing new zzso of these zzso
