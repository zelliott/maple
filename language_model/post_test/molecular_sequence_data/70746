T cell receptors zzso and major zzso complex zzso molecules are integral membrane proteins that have central roles in zzso immune zzso zzso soluble zzso of these molecules would be useful for analyzing and possibly modulating zzso immune zzso However, due to the intrinsic zzso and inherent zzso problems, it has been difficult to produce soluble zzso zzso of zzso and class II zzso zzso This report describes a general approach which zzso this intrinsic zzso by constructing soluble zzso zzso using zzso as a molecular zzso The zzso nature of the complexes increases the zzso of the zzso molecules for zzso zzso The zzso of this approach was studied by making soluble zzso zzso of two different classes of zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a class II zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso retained the specificity of the native zzso zzso while displaying increased zzso for zzso zzso zzso resulting in a zzso probe capable of detecting interactions that zzso have only been detected using surface zzso zzso zzso was also used in zzso studies to show zzso zzso of zzso zzso complexes after zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to both stain and activate an zzso T cell zzso Construction and expression of these two diverse zzso demonstrate the zzso of this zzso Furthermore, the increased zzso of these soluble zzso proteins makes these zzso molecules potentially useful in clinical settings for probing and modulating in zzso cellular zzso
