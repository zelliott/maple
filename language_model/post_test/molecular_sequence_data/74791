zzso in sequences and zzso structures of zzso proteins provide vital clues to identify clinically relevant zzso E zzso zzso However, experimental zzso structures are available in the zzso Data Bank for only zzso zzso of all zzso zzso in the zzso Database of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, an automated procedure was used to prepare zzso of all zzso where there was no zzso determined zzso structure or high identity zzso to another protein of known zzso zzso After a final selection by quality criteria, 433 reliable zzso models were retained and are available from our zzso zzso The new zzso models extensively enhance our knowledge of zzso zzso As an example of their use, zzso derived zzso zzso zzso were mapped on 3 zzso determined structures and 13 of our zzso of zzso zzso Large portions of these continuous sequences are not entirely on the surface and therefore cannot interact with zzso or other zzso Only the surface exposed zzso are constituents of zzso zzso zzso which are not in all cases continuous in zzso The surface exposed parts of the experimental determined continuous zzso zzso showed a distinct statistical distribution as compared to their presence in typical zzso zzso The zzso acids Ala, zzso zzso zzso and particularly zzso have a high propensity to occur in zzso binding zzso The zzso will facilitate further analysis of the common properties of zzso binding sites of zzso zzso
