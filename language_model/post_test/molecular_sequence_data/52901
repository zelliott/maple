Due to their widespread distribution and zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso are especially worrisome zzso for shellfish zzso In the present paper, we investigate the organization and the structural features of the nuclear zzso genes of zzso zzso as well as the use of DNA sequence information from this region for zzso zzso This information has been useful, further, for the development of a diagnostic test based on the amplification by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso DNA sequence in this species, and, after its zzso we have determined that it zzso to the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and the zzso zzso By comparing the complete sequence of the zzso zzso gene and a partial sequence of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso with the sequences of those genes in other zzso we have found additional support for the hypothesis that zzso is more closely related to species of zzso than to species of zzso The zzso zzso sequence between the zzso and the zzso zzso genes was used to design a pair of zzso to be used as a zzso diagnostic zzso
