zzso elements found in zzso regions zzso are regulatory signals determining zzso stability and zzso zzso By binding a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso we previously identified zzso as a promoter of zzso zzso zzso We now identify the zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso sequence as a cellular zzso target through which zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso association of either zzso or zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso affected zzso association with the other zzso zzso studies show that zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso suppresses while zzso encourages cellular zzso and invasion of breast cancer zzso In zzso we identified a competition for binding the zzso zzso through which zzso and zzso exert opposing effects on zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in suppression of breast cancer zzso
