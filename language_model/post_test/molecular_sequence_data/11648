We have zzso to zzso a zzso from a zzso zzso crude zzso zzso The zzso is present in two forms, either as a 32 zzso zzso or as a zzso containing the 32 zzso zzso in association with a 56 zzso zzso Native molecular weight zzso indicate that these forms are a zzso and possibly an alpha 2 beta 2 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso forms of the zzso are similar in their zzso zzso Both digest zzso DNA about twice as efficiently as zzso zzso They introduce zzso breaks into a zzso zzso but do not efficiently make zzso zzso They degrade a zzso zzso more efficiently than a zzso zzso Both zzso degrade a zzso zzso zzso to zzso with the zzso zzso ultimately being released as a zzso One difference between the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso demonstrated by a band shift zzso is that the zzso form binds tightly to zzso DNA, possibly zzso zzso
