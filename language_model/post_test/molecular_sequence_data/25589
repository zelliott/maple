Point zzso in factor IX genes of four unrelated Chinese patients with zzso B have been identified by direct sequencing of amplified zzso DNA zzso These four zzso occur in zzso 8 of the factor IX zzso A C to T transition at zzso zzso changes zzso 248 from zzso zzso to a new Stop zzso zzso described in a previous family as factor zzso zzso P M et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso A G to A transition at zzso zzso changes zzso 310 from zzso zzso to a nonsense or Stop zzso zzso factor zzso A G to A transition at zzso zzso changes zzso zzso which is for zzso zzso in normal factor IX, to one for zzso zzso in the zzso previously described as factor zzso zzso T C et zzso zzso J zzso 7: zzso in a patient with moderately severe zzso zzso The fourth patient has a novel C to A zzso at zzso zzso which zzso to replacement of zzso 390 which is for Ala zzso in normal factor IX, to one for zzso zzso in a patient with moderately severe zzso B zzso zzso DNA sequences of amplified fragments from mothers of three showed both their son's zzso and a normal zzso at the appropriate position, indicating that they are zzso The fourth patient's zzso zzso mother, whose DNA was not zzso was most probably a carrier because of her low plasma factor IX zzso
