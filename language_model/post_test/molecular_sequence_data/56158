We have compared the zzso properties of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with those in zzso coli by transforming each of these species with the same zzso shuttle zzso carrying either the zzso or the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso at a unique zzso The zzso properties investigated were the frequency of zzso bypass of the zzso the error rate of zzso and the zzso zzso In zzso zzso coli, the zzso zzso was zzso in approximately zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the bypass products had targeted zzso In zzso zzso however, bypass occurred in about zzso of these zzso and the bypass was at least zzso more accurate zzso zzso targeted zzso Each of these zzso zzso was a single unique event, and none were like those in zzso coli, suggesting that in fact the difference in error rate is much zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurred in about zzso of the zzso molecules in both species, but with this zzso the error rate was higher in zzso zzso (21 to zzso targeted zzso than in zzso coli zzso However, the zzso of zzso induced by the latter zzso were virtually identical in the two zzso We conclude that bypass and error zzso are determined both by the structure of the zzso template and by the particular replication proteins concerned but that the types of zzso induced depend predominantly on the structure of the zzso Unlike zzso coli, bypass in zzso zzso did not require zzso zzso
