We report that two zzso of zzso receptors zzso and zzso are zzso expressed with dramatically different efficiencies and that this difference is due to a zzso zzso segment in the zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso region plus zzso zzso zzso coding region plus zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was driven by the zzso zzso virus promoter element, and the zzso gene segment was upstream of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso but only zzso of the zzso cell lines expressed zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso protein zzso zzso Similar results were obtained following zzso of zzso cells with the two zzso zzso The role of the zzso of the zzso in zzso processing was determined by generating new zzso in which the zzso was progressively truncated from zzso to zzso zzso zzso or 74 zzso 3' to the stop zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in the expression of zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso 74, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso in the zzso expressing the zzso protein was not greater than that in zzso zzso and the differences in protein expression did not reflect altered zzso stability in the truncated zzso The zzso zzso with the longer zzso underwent zzso initiation as it was found in the zzso zzso indicating that the lack of zzso protein was due to impaired zzso zzso or zzso These data suggest that zzso efficiency is a key mechanism for regulating zzso expression and associated signaling zzso
