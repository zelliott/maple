Mobile genetic elements are ubiquitous throughout the zzso zzso We have zzso a highly unusual full-length zzso from the zzso fish, zzso zzso This element, which we have named zzso is similar in structure and sequence to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and consists of a single long open reading frame containing a reverse zzso domain flanked by identical direct long terminal repeat zzso zzso These zzso show an organization similar to the terminal repeats already described in the zzso zzso of zzso but are structurally and functionally distinct from the zzso carried by zzso In view of their zzso we refer to these repeats as zzso zzso Whereas the element contains a reverse zzso no other zzso or motifs commonly associated with zzso are zzso In the full-length zzso element, the zzso direct zzso is preceded by an zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso many showing various degrees of zzso are described from the zzso zzso and from that of the freshwater zzso zzso zzso Many of these additional elements are also preceded by zzso zzso zzso zzso elements are also described from the zzso of several other zzso The zzso lineage is apparently a zzso group within the zzso and therefore represents an zzso important class of zzso
