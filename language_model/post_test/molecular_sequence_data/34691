To determine the T zzso clones that correlate with the zzso of idiopathic zzso zzso zzso by investigating zzso determining region zzso zzso of T cell receptors zzso beta chain variable region zzso 

Twenty-five patients with idiopathic zzso zzso (including 15 patients with acute zzso and 10 patients with chronic zzso zzso normal peoples and 20 normal zzso zzso blood samples were zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify 24 zzso genes of the zzso zzso from the peripheral blood zzso zzso of the zzso patients and normal controls, the implications underwent zzso on zzso zzso sequencing zzso establishing a map of zzso zzso zzso gene expressing zzso The bands that widened or disappeared of the zzso zzso gene repertoire on the zzso gel were used to analyze the variety of T cell clones in the cases of zzso Comparing the sequences of zzso zzso zzso gene repertoire in normal and abnormal T cell clones made it possible to understand the relationship between zzso zzso gene and zzso 

zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso size distribution was similar to that of the normal controls and zzso could be observed in 15 cases with an average value of zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size distribution in zzso had little difference compared with that in the healthy controls zzso zzso zzso There was no common expanded T cell clones in zzso while abnormal zzso zzso zzso distribution could be observed significantly different between the zzso patients and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso with zzso at an average value of 7 zzso 3 per person in 10 zzso Common zzso T cell expansions could be observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In 10 zzso patients, sequence could be read from 18 out of 20 dense and strong T cell clone bands on the map of zzso zzso zzso which suggested that a dominant zzso T cell expanded in zzso zzso Different patients shared a common or similar zzso zzso by the zzso zzso gene of the expanded T cell zzso The same zzso was found in zzso expanded zzso 17 T cell zzso with only 2 zzso acids different in framework four zzso Two T cell clones had almost the same sequence of zzso of zzso except for only four zzso differences in their full zzso The full zzso gene sequences remained the same in 2 T cell clones for zzso and in other 2 T cell clones for zzso in zzso zzso It showed that an expanded T cell clones with common function existed and could recognize common zzso in the body of patients with zzso In analyzing the common motif in zzso of different zzso three common motifs were zzso zzso zzso and N zzso zzso which were separately used in different zzso of 18 expanded T cell zzso Among these zzso zzso of 3 T cell clones had common zzso zzso of 4 T cell clones had common N zzso zzso and zzso of 7 T cell clones had common zzso 

zzso has no significant T cell clones expanded, while zzso usually demonstrates some expanded abnormal zzso which may correlate with the zzso of zzso zzso patients share 3 common motifs for zzso zzso which is possibly related to zzso of the similar zzso
