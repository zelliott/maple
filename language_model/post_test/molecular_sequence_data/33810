zzso zzso is the zzso agent of rice blast disease, a devastating problem zzso This fungus has caused breakdown of resistance zzso by newly developed commercial zzso To address how the rice blast fungus adapts itself to new resistance genes so quickly, we examined zzso locations of zzso a zzso gene family corresponding to the zzso resistance zzso in various zzso of zzso zzso (including wheat and zzso zzso and its related zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso is highly variable in its zzso location, occurring in zzso 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and zzso zzso particularly in zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso most of the zzso zzso could elicit zzso resistance, even those from zzso zzso zzso was flanked by a zzso which presumably contributed to its multiple zzso across the zzso On the other hand, family member zzso which lacks zzso activity, was zzso located on zzso 7 in a vast majority of zzso These results suggest that the diversification in zzso location of zzso in the rice zzso is a consequence of recognition by zzso in zzso We propose a model that the multiple zzso of zzso may be associated with its frequent loss and recovery zzso by its transfer among individuals in asexual zzso This model implies that the high mobility of zzso is a key mechanism accounting for the rapid adaptation toward zzso Dynamic adaptation of some zzso plant pathogens may be achieved by deletion and recovery of zzso genes using a population as a unit of zzso
