A zzso reaction has been developed for the partial zzso of sodium zzso a zzso zzso in medicine, pharmacy, basic sciences and zzso An zzso solution of sodium zzso was zzso zzso to approximately zzso of its average molecular weight using ultraviolet light in the presence of titanium dioxide catalyst at pH 7 over a period of zzso The products were separated giving four zzso all having an average molecular weight that was smaller than that of the starting zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and determination of the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso were accomplished using zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso ratio was compared to that obtained for zzso zzso produced by acid zzso The M and G content, of each zzso zzso was also assigned with regards to their occurrence in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso This new zzso method might also be zzso in the preparation of zzso zzso for use in the food and pharmaceutical zzso
