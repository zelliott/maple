The commercially valuable transgenic zzso lines carrying the coat protein zzso gene of zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus resistance have been developed in Hawaii and Taiwan in the past zzso zzso and sensitive protocols for zzso and zzso zzso are essential for zzso of these lines to fulfill regulatory requirement in zzso and some Asian zzso Here, based on zzso chain reaction zzso approaches, we demonstrated different detection protocols for characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso products were amplified using different specific primer pairs targeting the sequences of the promoter, the zzso the selection marker, and the zzso and the region across the promoter and zzso Moreover, after cloning and sequencing the DNA fragments amplified by zzso zzso the junctions between plant zzso DNA and the zzso insert were zzso The zzso method targeting the zzso sequences and the zzso was developed for identification of a specific transgenic zzso The zzso patterns using zzso designed from the left or the right zzso DNA sequence of the zzso insert in three selected transgenic zzso lines were specific and zzso Our results also verified that zzso zzso zzso is integrated into transgenic zzso zzso in different zzso The copy number of inserted zzso was further confirmed by real-time zzso The zzso molecular markers developed in this investigation are crucial for regulatory requirement in some countries and intellectual zzso Also, these markers are helpful for prompt screening of a zzso progeny in the breeding zzso
