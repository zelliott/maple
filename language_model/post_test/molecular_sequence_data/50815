A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso into zzso coli zzso alpha by using a zzso zzso zzso After screening of a gene library with the zzso probe designed on the basis of a partial zzso acid sequence of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that had a zzso zzso insert carrying the zzso gene was zzso The gene product zzso zzso of zzso was expressed by using a zzso promoter in zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso reacted with zzso to zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso indicated that the zzso zzso contained another gene which was zzso to zzso A zzso harboring this gene zzso was also isolated from the gene library, the gene product of zzso exhibited zzso activity but ten times lower than that of zzso
