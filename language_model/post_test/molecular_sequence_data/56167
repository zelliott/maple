The genes coding for zzso zzso and sensory zzso I of a zzso isolate from the Red Sea called zzso zzso strain zzso have been cloned and zzso The deduced protein sequences were aligned to the previously known zzso retinal zzso The addition of these new sequences lowered the number of zzso zzso to only 23 zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso Data base searches with two highly zzso peptides as well as with an alignment profile yielded no significant similarity to any other zzso so the zzso retinal proteins should be regarded as a distinct protein zzso The protein alignment was used to make predictions about the structure of the retinal proteins as well as about the zzso acids in contact with retinal zzso These results were in excellent agreement with the structural model of zzso of zzso zzso as well as with zzso studies, indicating that zzso structure predictions based on the sequences of a membrane protein family can be quite zzso zzso zzso and sensory zzso I have zzso structures similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso acids do not take part in reactions specific for one group of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso but have a crucial role in determining the zzso and reactions of the zzso and zzso the general mode of action zzso zzso and protein zzso is the same for all zzso retinal zzso zzso pumps as well as zzso
