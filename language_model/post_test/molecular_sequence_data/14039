To facilitate the differential identification of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso genes of 17 zzso were zzso and screened for the existence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso strains and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso while that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed only zzso similarity to the zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso sequences were found in regions located around zzso positions zzso 800 and zzso Several sets of zzso derived from these characteristic regions were investigated as to their specificity in zzso zzso Most sets allowed selective amplification of the zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso in the zzso zzso permitted all strains to be zzso
