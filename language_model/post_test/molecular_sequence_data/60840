zzso cells possess a form of zzso called the cell wall that protects the zzso from zzso pressure and environmental zzso zzso of the various building blocks that make up the cell wall occurs in the zzso and thus microbial cells face specific zzso and zzso problems related to the zzso zzso and assembly of building blocks into the final wall structure at an zzso zzso Cell walls must also be metabolically and structurally zzso in order to allow for processes such as repair, zzso DNA exchange, and cell zzso In some cases, bacteria and zzso use similar mechanisms, to accomplish synthesis and zzso while in other cases each used divergent strategies to accomplish specific zzso This review will zzso recent advances in our understanding of zzso and bacterial cell wall synthesis and zzso We will compare specific pathways used by both zzso and bacteria, paying particular attention to identifying those areas where what is known in one system may point to approaches to solving unanswered questions in the zzso The structure, chemical properties, and mechanism of action of select natural and synthetic products which inhibit synthesis or assembly of cells walls will be discussed in terms of similarities in the structures, and/or steps in the synthetic process zzso In addition, new targets in the pathways will be presented along with recent approaches to the discovery and design of novel zzso
