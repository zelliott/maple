We propose that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is composed of three functionally linked zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso gene products are most closely related to their zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence places zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso translated sequence is most similar to zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso A single promoter region, with zzso to the zzso coli consensus promoter sequences recognized by the zzso and zzso zzso factors, precedes the zzso zzso This promoter is zzso zzso The zzso zzso level increased more than 30 times upon 10 zzso of heat shock (from 70 degrees C to 85 degrees zzso A strong zzso terminating sequence was found between the zzso and zzso zzso The individual genes were cloned into zzso expression zzso and the zzso proteins were zzso at high levels in zzso coli and zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was shown to have a weak zzso activity, with an optimum at 90 degrees zzso The zzso was zzso by the presence of zzso and zzso Another open reading frame, coding for zzso zzso zzso was found downstream of the zzso zzso
