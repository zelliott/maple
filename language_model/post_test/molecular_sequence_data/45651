A zzso approach was conducted to assess the geographic structure and genetic variation in populations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the most harmful insect zzso of cotton in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences were analyzed to test a former hypothesis on the origin of the zzso zzso in Argentina, Brazil and zzso using samples from Mexico and USA as putative source zzso The analysis of zzso suggests that populations from South American cotton fields and nearby disturbed areas form a zzso with a central zzso zzso called A, which is the most common and widespread in USA and South zzso The population from Texas has the A zzso as the most frequent and gathers in the same group as the South American populations associated with zzso The sample from zzso zzso shows high values of zzso zzso shares no zzso in common with the South American samples, and forms a zzso separated by several zzso zzso The sample from zzso National Park zzso Province, zzso has similar zzso with highly divergent zzso forming a zzso closer to the samples from cotton fields, than to the Mexican zzso We propose that in South America there are: populations with characteristics of recent zzso which would be remnants of zzso that occurred after single or multiple colonization events, probably from the United States, and ancient populations associated with native forests, partially isolated by events of historical zzso
