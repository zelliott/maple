A comprehensive zzso study based on the zzso zzso protein of all known African zzso virus zzso zzso is zzso The study includes 64 new H gene sequences from zzso Nigeria and South Africa as well as viruses from zzso and The zzso for which only incomplete sequencing data were available and that have previously not been zzso The results provide further support to the tentative assignment of the Nigerian and zzso viruses to a new zzso B3 within zzso zzso A distinct geographic distribution pattern emerged with zzso B viruses circulating exclusively in African countries north of the zzso All zzso strains from southern Africa grouped in zzso A and D with the majority of viruses belonging to zzso zzso The viruses considerably differed by their sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso zzso but three selected zzso were sufficient to distinguish between African zzso representing four different zzso
