Human zzso cells zzso grown in the presence of zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso become resistant to the drug thanks to an altered zzso zzso In this paper we show that zzso zzso zzso is significantly reduced in drug-resistant zzso cells zzso although the zzso zzso promoter is zzso zzso of zzso zzso insertions and zzso was found in the coding region of zzso zzso zzso Several identified zzso result in truncated forms of the zzso or in the introduction of stop zzso in one case a complete lack of zzso 4 was zzso Thus, the zzso zzso gene accumulates zzso at a very high rate, as already reported for other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the design of new zzso or zzso drugs of the zzso family should take into account the potential development of cell resistance as a critical factor in drug zzso
