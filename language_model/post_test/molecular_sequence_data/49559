zzso zzso and X-ray zzso have provided important insight into structural features of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, significant problems such as the zzso specificity of zzso and the different zzso of zzso to feedback zzso by zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso remain zzso Based on the crystal structures zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Data zzso we have used molecular zzso to model the binding of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso acid zzso were placed in positions common to both zzso The productive position of zzso in zzso was stabilized by a hydrogen bond with zzso Despite favorable energy scores, zzso in a position trans to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso interferes with the access of the essential zzso zzso to the zzso center, thereby blocking the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were directly coordinated to the active site iron via the zzso zzso of their zzso zzso Two alternative zzso rotated 180 degrees around an imaginary zzso zzso were found for zzso and zzso in zzso and for zzso in zzso zzso forces play a key role in hindering the zzso binding of the immediate reaction product zzso to zzso thereby saving the zzso from direct feedback zzso
