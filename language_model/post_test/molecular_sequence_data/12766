zzso virus zzso a widespread human zzso establishes a zzso carrier state after primary zzso It is known that zzso zzso mainly B zzso and oral zzso in zzso However, other potential sites of zzso zzso and/or zzso infection in human body have not been fully zzso To investigate this, systemic zzso zzso from 18 zzso individuals without apparent zzso diseases were examined for zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso by using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA was frequently detected in oral zzso zzso zzso stomach, zzso zzso and zzso less frequently in zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso bone zzso and small zzso In contrast, liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso heart muscle and urinary zzso contained no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso membrane protein zzso 2A gene was expressed in all zzso zzso of the three cases zzso with zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso 1 transcripts in the zzso zzso and the zzso transcript in the stomach of one zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not detected in any of the tissue zzso The immediate early zzso zzso open reading frame zzso 1 zzso zzso a key gene for zzso zzso cycle, was also expressed in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso nor the zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso resides in the upper gastrointestinal tract and zzso zzso where the cells harbor functionally active viral zzso Moreover, the selective expression of the viral zzso infection genes may provide advantages for zzso persistence in the setting of a host immune zzso In addition, the localized detection of zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso are another possible site of zzso replication in the zzso virus carrier state in zzso
