The zzso zzso which contains seven zinc finger zzso exerts its effect on gene expression by binding to specific targets in small nuclear zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso In this work, binding site selection allowed us to identify the zzso pair zzso sequence as the high affinity consensus binding site for zzso It shows a high sequence divergence with zzso elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso By using a combination of approaches, we analyzed the interaction of zzso and truncated zzso zinc finger zzso with the consensus, zzso zzso and human zzso zzso Two main conclusions emerged from our zzso First, the data clearly indicate that zinc finger 7 does not establish zzso contacts in zzso zzso The second conclusion concerns zinc finger 1, which is required for the binding to the zzso zzso site but is zzso in the case of the human zzso zzso Taking into account the sequence differences in the two sites, these findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zinc finger 1 in a rather flexible manner, illustrating how a protein can interact with zzso containing targets of different zzso
