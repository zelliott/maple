zzso zzso gene expression is activated through zzso elements recognized by zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso The specificity of zzso DNA binding is determined by several zzso adjacent to a core zzso zzso zzso a recognition site for zzso factors of the zzso zzso Earlier work proposed that zzso forms a zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso to activate zzso through zzso zzso However, there was no direct evidence that zzso serves this function in zzso in fact, mice lacking zzso have no zzso Here we describe a novel zzso clone that encodes the human zzso of chicken zzso Human zzso zzso with zzso zzso and binds DNA with specificity identical to that of zzso zzso DNA binding zzso A zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is fully functional in supporting expression of zzso and zzso and in promoting zzso differentiation in zzso a zzso mouse zzso cell zzso These results indicate that human zzso can serve as a functional partner for zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso
