A binding site selection from a zzso island library for the zzso leukemia zinc finger protein zzso identified two high affinity zzso binding zzso These sequences also bound zzso a fusion protein formed in zzso zzso zzso associated with acute zzso zzso zzso bound DNA as a slowly zzso complex with an estimated zzso zzso of 600 zzso whose formation was dependent on the zzso domain of zzso The zzso complex was unable to form in the presence of zzso zzso A zzso interaction was further demonstrated by zzso and a zzso pull-down zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex was abolished with the addition of a zzso These studies suggest that the activity of zzso a regulator of the cell cycle, may be modulated by cell cycle zzso zzso did not complex with zzso this potentially contributing to its zzso zzso properties and potential role in zzso
