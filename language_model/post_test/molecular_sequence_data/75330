zzso clones coding for the plasma zzso inhibitor alpha zzso III were isolated from an acute phase rat liver zzso The zzso could be divided into four groups with characteristic zzso restriction zzso zzso The identity of the zzso clone zzso was established by comparison with the published zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso It codes for a zzso acid precursor zzso with a zzso signal zzso The mature protein shares zzso overall sequence identity with rat alpha zzso and contains a typical internal zzso zzso Twenty-two of its zzso zzso zzso are zzso with alpha zzso zzso similar zzso zzso However, the zzso alpha zzso III sequence differed significantly from the rat and human alpha zzso sequences in its bait region suggesting alpha zzso III possesses zzso zzso zzso different from those of alpha zzso The zzso alpha zzso III clone zzso from a second zzso group also differed from the zzso in the bait region coding zzso although both specify similar signal peptides and zzso zzso The observation of zzso zzso classes suggests that acute phase rat zzso produce a zzso mixture of alpha zzso III zzso zzso Evidence was obtained for the presence of at least four different alpha zzso zzso genes in the rat zzso During the first 24 h of an acute phase response the abundance of zzso alpha zzso III zzso was decreased zzso This decrease was of the same order of magnitude as the reported reduction of the corresponding plasma protein zzso suggesting that in the early phase of the acute inflammatory response the plasma concentration of this protein is mainly controlled through the abundance of its zzso zzso
