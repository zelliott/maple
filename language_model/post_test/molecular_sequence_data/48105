zzso are known to activate zzso protein zzso which are essential for cell cycle progression in zzso We isolated full-length zzso zzso rice zzso zzso named zzso zzso 1 and zzso which are related to A- and zzso zzso respectively, from zzso To characterize the function of these zzso zzso as well as that of another zzso zzso zzso each zzso was introduced into zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which is deficient in zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso indicating that these zzso zzso are functional in zzso zzso When the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso strain, the cells lost the ability to grow, whereas the expression of either zzso 1 or zzso did not inhibit zzso In zzso zzso of these zzso zzso genes with rice root zzso and zzso of zzso with a zzso dye revealed that zzso is expressed from the zzso phase to the early M phase, while transcripts of zzso and zzso accumulated until the end of zzso Our results indicate that these zzso zzso may be involved in the control of zzso in combination with a zzso zzso
