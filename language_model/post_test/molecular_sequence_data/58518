zzso zzso zzso for gene therapy are made replication defective by deletion of E1 region zzso For isolation, zzso and large-scale production of such zzso E1 functions are supplied in trans from a stable cell zzso Virtually all Ad zzso used for clinical studies are produced in the zzso cell, a human embryonic kidney cell line expressing E1 functions from an integrated segment of the left end of the Ad type 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have regained E1 sequences have been observed within populations of Ad zzso grown on zzso zzso These zzso zzso presumably result from zzso between zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso We have developed zzso zzso and have characterized at the molecular level examples of zzso zzso All such zzso analyzed are zzso zzso in which the zzso cell zzso E1 sequences have become incorporated into the viral zzso by legitimate zzso zzso A map of zzso sequences within the zzso cell zzso developed in parallel is consistent with the proposed zzso zzso To provide a convenient zzso production system that zzso the generation of zzso zzso we have modified the zzso zzso backbone by deleting or rearranging the protein IX coding region normally present downstream from the E1 region such that the frequency of zzso between zzso and zzso cell zzso sequences is greatly zzso Twelve serial passages of an zzso zzso lacking the protein IX gene were carried out without generating zzso zzso In the course of producing and testing more than 30 large-scale preparations of zzso lacking the protein IX gene or having a rearranged protein IX zzso only three examples of zzso zzso were zzso Use of these zzso modifications allows use of conventional zzso cells for production of large-scale preparations of zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso
