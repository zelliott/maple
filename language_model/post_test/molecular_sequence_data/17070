We have identified a novel family of five 3' zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso arranged in a zzso orientation with respect to the zzso zzso H zzso gene zzso They share the same zzso 2 sequence but possess different zzso 1 zzso Two of these spliced transcripts zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso N zzso entirely within zzso zzso Two other transcripts designated zzso zzso a previously described zzso zzso zzso that shares its first 20 zzso acids with zzso but which has another 64 zzso acids zzso within zzso zzso The fifth transcript, designated zzso has an zzso zzso 1 near the zzso zzso region zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso type II zzso expressed at the cell zzso Their shared zzso 2 coding sequences likely represent the highly zzso region of an as yet unidentified zzso zzso zzso
