zzso A and zzso B are two zzso zzso mainly found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso whose flowers are traditionally used in several Mediterranean countries in the manufacture of zzso zzso We have been characterizing zzso at the zzso structural and molecular zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso The genes for zzso A and zzso B, as well as those for two new zzso zzso zzso designated zzso C and zzso D, were zzso and their expression in zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso Together with zzso a partial clone of the zzso B gene was isolated, revealing that zzso and zzso genes coexist in the zzso of the same zzso As a first approach to understanding what dictates the zzso pattern of zzso zzso the respective gene zzso regulatory sequences were fused with the reporter zzso and introduced into zzso zzso A subsequent deletion analysis of the promoter region of the zzso A gene allowed the identification of a region of approximately 500 zzso essential for gene expression in transgenic zzso Additionally, the relevance of the leader zzso of the zzso A and B genes for gene expression was zzso Our data showed that the leader zzso is essential for zzso B gene expression in zzso zzso In zzso analysis revealed the presence of potential regulatory motifs that lay within the aforementioned regions and therefore might be important in the regulation of zzso zzso
