The hypothesis that selection on the zzso gene is efficient in tuning vision to the ambient light environment of an zzso was assessed in 49 populations of 12 zzso zzso species, inhabiting arctic marine waters, coastal zzso zzso freshwater lakes zzso zzso and the deep Caspian zzso zzso sequence variation was found within and among zzso but its patterns did not match expectations based on light zzso spectral sensitivity of the visual zzso measured by zzso or the history of species and zzso The main split in the zzso gene tree was between lineages I and II, differing in six zzso zzso zzso I was present in marine and Caspian Sea species and in the North American freshwater zzso zzso whereas lineage II was found in the European and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both lineages were present in some populations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the visual zzso in nine populations of the latter three species showed a zzso between lake zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso populations zzso zzso zzso zzso Judged by the shape of zzso this difference was not because of different zzso zzso zzso zzso but neither did it coincide with the split in the zzso tree zzso zzso species identity or current light zzso In all, zzso evolution of the zzso gene in zzso could not be demonstrated, but its sequence variation did not conform to a neutral expectation either, suggesting evolutionary constraints and/or unidentified mechanisms of spectral zzso
