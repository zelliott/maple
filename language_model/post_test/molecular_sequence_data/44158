We report the cloning of two novel rat regulators of zzso signaling zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso of zzso and 544 zzso zzso zzso We have also identified the human zzso of zzso by alignment of zzso sequences in the database which map the human zzso gene to zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified human zzso with high zzso to zzso which map to human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is expressed at high levels in brain, zzso and zzso whereas zzso is expressed at high levels in brain and lung and lower levels in zzso heart, and zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso and zzso zzso indicates that they are closely related and possess regions of zzso outside of the zzso zzso zzso We have also identified zzso regions in zzso which are similar to protein zzso found in mouse zzso and zzso proteins suggesting possible interactions with zzso zzso
