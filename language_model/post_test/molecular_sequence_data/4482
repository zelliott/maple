There is great disparity in the literature as to the presence and relevance of zzso in heart tissue from patients with zzso zzso zzso Published estimates of zzso positive tissue in zzso range from 0 to zzso Very little sequence information is so far available on those samples which are zzso 

zzso of fresh biopsy material from patients previously tested, plus 13 new cases of zzso and sequencing the products would yield information on the zzso of the technique and on the type of virus being zzso 

zzso from biopsy or zzso tissue was tested for the presence of zzso using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso sequences of all positive zzso products were determined by direct zzso 

Positive zzso signals were found in zzso of samples from patients with zzso and in zzso of control zzso Two zzso and 12 control samples gave the same zzso zzso which was different from the zzso used as a positive zzso The other 4 zzso samples all produced multiple bands on zzso 

The results do not support a major role for zzso in zzso There is need for some caution, however, as a review of the literature shows that studies using single zzso such as this one, produce consistently lower estimates for zzso than do those wherein multiple zzso are zzso
