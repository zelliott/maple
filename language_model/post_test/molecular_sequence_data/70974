Certain class II zzso complexes are resistant to zzso zzso This property, which has been used as an in zzso as well as an in zzso zzso binding zzso is not understood at the molecular zzso Here we have investigated the zzso basis of zzso stability of zzso complexes by using a zzso zzso and zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso along with previously published results establish that the zzso complexes are formed only when the zzso pocket 1 zzso is occupied by a bulky aromatic zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further explore whether the zzso sensitivity is primarily due to the exposed zzso regions, we zzso zzso beta zzso at the bottom of zzso to zzso presumably reducing the depth of the pocket and the exposure of zzso zzso and increasing the contacts between zzso In direct contrast to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exists as an zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, the presence of a smaller zzso zzso such as zzso as zzso anchor with no contribution from any other anchor is sufficient to enhance the zzso stability of the zzso complexes, demonstrating that the basis of zzso resistance may be localized to zzso zzso The good correlation between zzso sensitivity and the exposure of zzso zzso provides a zzso rationale for the use of this zzso to investigate the maturation of class II molecules and the longevity of the zzso
