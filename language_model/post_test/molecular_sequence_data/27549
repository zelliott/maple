To provide a framework for studies to understand the contribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso to salt tolerance in zzso zzso we zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a putative zzso locus zzso and compared the sequence to the zzso zzso region of the zzso of its zzso relative, zzso zzso Overall, the two sequences were zzso but three major zzso regions in zzso zzso were found to contain five Long Terminal Repeat zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso sequences that contribute to the zzso size variation in this region of the zzso zzso genes were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso including the putative zzso zzso zzso shares gene structure and sequence with zzso zzso zzso including 11 predicted zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso however, different patterns of zzso zzso zzso were found within a zzso region upstream of zzso in the two zzso
