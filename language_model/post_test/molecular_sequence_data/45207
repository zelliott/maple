zzso to DNA and zzso are expressed in systemic zzso diseases, whereas B cells producing such zzso are zzso deleted, or zzso in healthy zzso Why zzso individuals fail to regulate is not well zzso In this study, we investigate the sources of zzso B cells in zzso transgenic zzso zzso These mice are particularly susceptible to lupus because they carry a zzso zzso zzso that codes for an zzso H zzso Over zzso of the B cells are eliminated in the bone zzso of these mice, and the few surviving B cells are associated with one of two zzso editors, zzso and zzso Thus, it appears that negative selection by deletion and editing are intact in zzso zzso However, a population of zzso B cells in the zzso zzso mice produces zzso zzso zzso and these mice have severe zzso organ zzso These zzso zzso are not associated with editors but instead use a unique zzso zzso zzso The zzso combination has a relatively high affinity for zzso and an zzso zzso pattern characteristic of zzso zzso this zzso gene may zzso a selective advantage to zzso zzso in diseased zzso
