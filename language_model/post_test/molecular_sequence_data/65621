zzso zzso is a unique zzso zzso zzso that remains the leading cause of sexually transmitted bacterial diseases and preventable zzso zzso zzso zzso infections are referred to as zzso and predominate in developing zzso Since 2001, the World Health Organization has promoted control strategies including zzso improved zzso and environmental measures with limited zzso zzso a vaccine is urgently zzso zzso to vaccine design is an understanding of the interactions of the pathogen and host immune zzso Various animal models of zzso show that zzso zzso zzso strains and other species of the family zzso produce severe zzso inflammation and zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we do not know the extent of organisms that may be involved in human zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso heat shock protein 60 zzso has been implicated in inflammation and zzso zzso but the role of other zzso zzso in disease zzso has not been zzso In this study, we set out to identify whether other zzso species are present in zzso and determine their association with severity of clinical disease and with zzso and systemic immune responses to zzso zzso zzso to further investigate the zzso of this blinding zzso 

We randomly selected nine of 49 households in a zzso region of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso quantitative zzso was used to detect zzso DNA and zzso (from zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, from zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for tears and zzso Surprisingly, all three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected in eight zzso study zzso one household had no members infected with zzso zzso Of 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso infected individuals, 28 zzso had infection with zzso zzso or zzso pneumoniae, or zzso single and dual infections with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly associated with severe zzso inflammation zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as were single infections with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Of the 80 infected individuals, 75 zzso were also positive for zzso zzso by zzso for the same zzso identified by zzso zzso with tear zzso zzso to zzso zzso were eight times more likely than individuals without tear zzso to be infected zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso times more likely to have severe inflammation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso times more likely to have zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso while individuals with serum zzso zzso were zzso times more likely to be infected zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

We provide substantial evidence for the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso pneumoniae, in addition to zzso zzso in zzso The distribution of zzso species by household and age suggests that these infections are widespread and not just sporadic zzso zzso with multiple species may explain the failure to detect zzso among active zzso cases, when only zzso zzso is zzso for, and the failure of clinically active cases to resolve their disease following what would be considered effective zzso zzso zzso The evidence for viable zzso organisms of all three species in single and zzso the significant association of these infections with severe zzso and the significant association of tear and serum zzso responses to zzso zzso with inflammation and zzso support the role of all three species in disease zzso Thus, while our findings should be confirmed in other zzso countries, our data suggest that a zzso of treatment regimens and vaccine design may be zzso zzso the full impact of zzso species on the zzso zzso and disease outcome of zzso presents a new challenge for zzso zzso
