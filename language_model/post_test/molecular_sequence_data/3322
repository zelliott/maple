zzso and coat protein sequence studies were conducted to identify an zzso associated with necrosis disease on sunflower in zzso In zzso zzso sunflower zzso reacted strongly only with zzso to zzso streak virus zzso The coat protein gene of sunflower zzso was cloned and zzso The sequence analyses also showed that the zzso gene was most closely related to zzso the member of zzso I of zzso The sunflower zzso zzso shared zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and sequence identity, it is proposed that the sunflower zzso from India should be considered a strain of zzso belonging to zzso I and designated as zzso This is the first report of the molecular characterization of zzso on sunflower from the Indian zzso
