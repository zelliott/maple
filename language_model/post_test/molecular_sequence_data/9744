T cell zzso signaling results both in T cell proliferation and zzso A key zzso at the intersection of these downstream pathways is zzso zzso zzso zzso In a previous report, we showed that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motif of the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peter, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso can recruit the zzso zzso zzso in a T cell zzso zzso In zzso studies with zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso of zzso zzso or zzso by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso zzso with increased binding of zzso zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso zzso activity to zzso or zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in various combinations, show that both zzso and zzso within the zzso are required for efficient binding of zzso zzso zzso Thus, replacement of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso significantly reduces binding of zzso zzso zzso whereas it does not affect binding of zzso Further in zzso experiments suggest that a direct binding of the tandem zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the two zzso zzso in a single zzso may zzso The data also support a model in which a single zzso zzso can recruit distinct zzso molecules by means of zzso differential zzso zzso
