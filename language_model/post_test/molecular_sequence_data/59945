The zzso proteins zzso of zzso play a key role during the zzso replication zzso zzso contain one or two highly zzso zzso characterized by a zzso sequence which binds zinc with a high zzso The reasons of the high conservation of zinc fingers of zzso type in zzso were investigated by a structural study of zzso in which the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso form was unable to bind zinc zzso whereas in zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso the zinc was tightly zzso The zzso zzso exists in two zzso zzso E and D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from the zinc coordination of zzso by either its zzso or its zzso zzso As compared to the native zzso zinc finger, the zzso zzso His zzso zzso structural changes in the finger due to a modification in the coordination state of zzso bound to zinc by zzso in the zzso finger by zzso in both zzso of the zzso Introduction of these single zzso within the zzso zzso zinc finger in the zzso zzso was very recently shown to result in a loss of viral zzso This supports the hypothesis that structural changes of the zinc finger domain of zzso inhibit the recognition of one or several targets critically involved in the virus life zzso
