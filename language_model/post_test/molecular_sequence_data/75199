zzso of the zzso protein zzso C has been shown to increase during differentiation of the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso by zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and Glazer, zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso 45, zzso zzso zzso were prepared that specifically recognize the zzso zzso and gamma zzso of protein zzso C in rat brain zzso and zzso cell zzso The three zzso do not share a common tissue distribution zzso The gamma zzso is abundant in brain but a relatively minor component in zzso zzso the opposite is true for the alpha zzso All three zzso increase at least zzso in abundance in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso The increase in abundance of the alpha and beta zzso reaches 7- and zzso respectively, by 96 h without further increase in the abundance of the gamma zzso Similarly, all three zzso increase at least zzso in abundance after 48 h and zzso after 96 h with 1 zzso zzso zzso No further increase in the abundance of any of the zzso is seen between 96 and 144 h of incubation with zzso zzso The increase in protein zzso C activity is not limited to the zzso forms of the zzso a parallel increase in zzso protein zzso C is also observed during zzso zzso zzso of total protein zzso C activity is zzso in both control and zzso zzso These studies provide the first zzso evidence that all three protein zzso C zzso increase during zzso cell zzso and they suggest that the increase in the zzso levels may be zzso zzso
