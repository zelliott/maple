Major zzso complex zzso class I molecules present short peptides generated by zzso protein degradation to zzso T zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso known as zzso have been implicated in the generation of these zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso within the zzso gene cluster in a region associated with zzso zzso The incorporation of these zzso zzso into zzso may alter their activity so as to zzso the generation of peptides able to bind to zzso class I zzso It has been difficult, however, to demonstrate a specific requirement for zzso or zzso in the presentation of zzso zzso to zzso 

We describe a zzso lymphoma, termed zzso that displays a novel selective zzso in zzso class zzso presentation of influenza virus zzso Of the zzso genes implicated in the class I pathway, only zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells simultaneously restores zzso expression and zzso presentation to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in these zzso cells selectively zzso zzso recognition and the induction of surface class I zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, which zzso express zzso and have no presentation zzso blocks the presentation of the same influenza virus zzso that zzso cells are defective in zzso 

Our results show that the zzso zzso zzso can directly influence both zzso class zzso zzso presentation and class I surface zzso
