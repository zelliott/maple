The zzso zzso encodes a nuclear zzso protein that carries a novel zzso domain, zzso and functions as a zzso and zzso active zzso zzso The zzso zzso allows zzso 2 zzso T cells to escape zzso arrest induced by zzso withdrawal in culture and collaborates with zzso and zzso for the induction of zzso zzso in zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso also zzso cell death induced by zzso of zzso zzso lines in zzso zzso Similarly, induction of zzso in primary zzso from mice carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death induced by zzso in zzso The protein and zzso levels of the zzso regulator zzso are zzso by zzso in both immortalized zzso lines and primary transgenic zzso The repression is direct and depends on several zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso also zzso zzso another zzso member of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso may inhibit zzso by means of its repression of multiple zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso provide a potential explanation for its strong collaboration with zzso during zzso
