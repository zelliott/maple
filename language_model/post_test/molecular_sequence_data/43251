In zzso cells signal sequences of zzso and membrane proteins are zzso by the signal zzso complex during their transport into the zzso of the zzso zzso The signal zzso complex in zzso consists of four zzso To date, three of these zzso have been functionally zzso One of them, the zzso is essential for viability of zzso zzso It shows significant zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso as well as to bacterial leader zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be zzso to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and are not essential for protein zzso or signal zzso zzso We have zzso and analyzed the fourth zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso The protein is essential for viability of zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of precursors of zzso proteins in zzso and to the loss of the signal zzso activity in zzso zzso in contrast to the bacterial leader zzso zzso signal zzso requires a second zzso for its zzso
