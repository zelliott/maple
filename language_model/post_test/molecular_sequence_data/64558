Human zzso is a zzso zzso zzso hypothesized to regulate lung zzso sodium zzso It belongs to a unique family of genes on zzso zzso Here we describe zzso zzso promoter analysis, and expression of zzso mouse zzso The zzso mouse zzso gene zzso has a zzso organization identical to human zzso zzso spans two signal zzso localized to zzso zzso Multiple zzso transcripts arise from two consensus zzso elements of a zzso promoter and an alternatively zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso zzso establishes that the zzso elements and a zzso domain comprise the core promoter and identifies zzso zzso regions with strong zzso and zzso zzso The 3' untranslated region zzso the 3' untranslated region of the zzso gene oriented zzso at this zzso zzso is highly transcribed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is zzso zzso Using selective zzso and zzso to mouse zzso we localized its expression to lung airway zzso and zzso type II cells and kidney cortical zzso zzso Mouse zzso highly resembles its human zzso in gene organization and tissue zzso including strong expression in pulmonary zzso suggesting that mice will be useful for probing zzso functions in zzso
