zzso peptides composed of alternating polar and zzso zzso have a strong tendency to zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from peptides of general zzso sequence in which X is zzso and Z is zzso adopt a putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso allows burial of the zzso X side chain groups in the core of the zzso and leaves the polar Z side chains exposed to zzso This architectural arrangement provides zzso that maintain high zzso in water and has facilitated the recent exploitation of zzso zzso zzso zzso as functional zzso This article is a critical review of the development and application of zzso zzso peptides with a focus on the fundamental insight these types of peptides provide into zzso zzso zzso
