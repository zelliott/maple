Of 59 clinical zzso of zzso zzso from a teaching hospital in zzso China, 18 zzso were shown to be resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso repetitive consensus zzso revealed that these zzso comprised 7 distinct zzso The presence of plasmids in the 18 clinical zzso was revealed by zzso transfer of plasmids from zzso zzso to zzso coli with the further isolation of the plasmids in the zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso focusing indicated that the plasmids zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso including genes for zzso (13 zzso zzso (12 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso and zzso (1 zzso The widespread presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso isolated from the southwest of China was likely due to the dissemination of resistance plasmids with the zzso zzso of zzso
