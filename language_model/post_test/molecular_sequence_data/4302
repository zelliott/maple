The zzso gene is required for the zzso of zzso and zzso as iron sources by zzso zzso The product of zzso has zzso to zzso zzso zzso which are involved in the degradation of zzso and the release of zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso regulation, a zzso zzso gene present on the zzso zzso zzso was placed under zzso control of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso optimal expression from the zzso promoter was obtained only in the presence of zzso or zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso medium containing zzso was zzso five- to zzso from that seen under zzso conditions in the presence of zzso zzso from the zzso promoter in the absence of zzso or zzso was fully zzso in zzso medium and was expressed at very low levels in zzso zzso zzso studies with tile zzso fusion construct in zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso provided further evidence that zzso of the zzso promoter is zzso by zzso and iron and activated by zzso In zzso coli, the zzso promoter was expressed at very low levels under all conditions zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso experiments indicated that zzso binds in a zzso manner to a sequence that zzso the putative zzso zzso Total cellular zzso isolated from zzso zzso was used to identify the zzso start site for the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso was zzso and that zzso was zzso zzso
