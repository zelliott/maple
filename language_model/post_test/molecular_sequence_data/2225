zzso zzso zzso the removal of an N zzso zzso acid zzso from an N zzso zzso Two overlapping zzso zzso zzso based on the sequence of a zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso rat zzso zzso were zzso and used to screen a rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was cloned and zzso This clone contained zzso base pairs of rat zzso zzso sequence but lacked a zzso initiation zzso Using a zzso pair probe derived from near the zzso of this almost full-length zzso to zzso the library, full-length clones were isolated, which contained an zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of which were confirmed by protein sequence data from 19 zzso or zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso is zzso blocked zzso zzso and Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and based on the zzso protein sequence deduced from the DNA sequence and the sequence of the most zzso zzso zzso it is likely that the zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso since such zzso are frequently juxtaposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso von zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 152, zzso The zzso zzso analysis revealed a single message of zzso zzso in various rat zzso zzso Although this zzso is known to be inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no strong similarity in protein sequence has been found with other zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso zzso may be a unique zzso zzso
