Marine bacteria residing on local red, green, and brown zzso were screened for zzso zzso zzso Of the 90 bacterial species isolated from 32 zzso only one, a zzso zzso was found to display such zzso It was isolated from a zzso zzso a brown kelp known to contain significant amounts of the storage zzso zzso zzso with some zzso zzso Four zzso steps were zzso to purify the zzso zzso zzso zzso provided zzso sequences for primer design and subsequent gene zzso The zzso gene coded for 840 zzso acids and was located just 50 zzso downstream from a putative zzso zzso zzso suggesting possible zzso of these zzso zzso comparisons revealed zzso to be clustered within a group of bacterial zzso with high similarity to a group of zzso zzso zzso plant zzso of which the barley zzso zzso is the best zzso The major difference between the bacterial and plant proteins is an extra zzso to zzso extension at the C zzso of the zzso This additional sequence does not correlate with any known functional domain, but zzso was not active against zzso when this region was zzso zzso of zzso zzso allowed zzso specificity studies to be zzso The zzso was found to possess similar levels of zzso activity against both zzso linkages and zzso zzso and so zzso is designated an zzso the first such bacterial zzso to be zzso This broader specificity could allow the zzso to assist in digesting both cell wall cellulose and zzso zzso
