zzso is a real-time DNA sequencing zzso It is based on the transformation of zzso released during DNA zzso by DNA zzso into measurable zzso During DNA zzso a single zzso zzso is released following incorporation of a single zzso In the zzso reaction, released zzso are then rapidly converted by zzso to zzso zzso which in turn is zzso by zzso to produce zzso Within standardized conditions, this reaction is accomplished in a few milliseconds and the light produced can be registered with a zzso zzso zzso it becomes possible to zzso measure the zzso zzso This approach has been automated in different platforms and can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing, loss of zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the entire process, focusing our attention on zzso zzso and giving examples of some other zzso
