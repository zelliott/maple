The zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso filter feeders that attach to various zzso including rocks, zzso zzso and zzso An intriguing question is how different zzso types have affected the diversification of zzso zzso To zzso the evolutionary zzso of zzso we conducted a zzso analysis of 49 individuals belonging to 18 zzso and 5 zzso species using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results supported the zzso of zzso zzso and recovered three major zzso within zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zebra and the zzso This result contradicts the current zzso of the zzso families, zzso zzso and zzso and suggests that hinge zzso which has long been used as a diagnostic character, does not reflect zzso zzso The zzso of most zzso however, was zzso zzso zzso types on the zzso tree indicated that the ancestors of zzso zzso were zzso on rocks, and that zzso life on zzso zzso had a single zzso Although we could not ascertain whether zzso life in sponges evolved once or twice, our results suggest that colonization of zzso zzso resulted in diversification and zzso and ecological adaptation to zzso zzso We estimated that the zzso zzso has diversified since the late zzso in response to zzso zzso These results emphasize the importance of zzso shifts in zzso and diversification of zzso zzso
