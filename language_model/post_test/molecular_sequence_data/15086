Human zzso virus type 1 zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso results from zzso in the viral zzso zzso that reduce zzso binding but also decrease viral zzso capacity zzso Additional zzso zzso for the zzso loss subsequently accumulate within zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined the respective contribution of zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso resistance and zzso and their zzso using a panel of zzso molecular clones carrying different sequences from six patients who had failed multiple lines of zzso zzso in zzso strongly and directly contributed to zzso resistance besides zzso for fitness zzso This effect was essentially carried by the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso with little or no contribution from MA, CA, and zzso The effect of zzso on resistance depended on the presence of zzso site zzso zzso or zzso in zzso and correlated with processing of the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, reverting the zzso or zzso zzso in these highly evolved sequences had little effect on zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso can be zzso selected as zzso and as direct zzso resistance zzso with zzso at the zzso site behaving as a zzso step in zzso zzso Further zzso zzso render viral zzso independent of the zzso or zzso zzso while their effect on resistance zzso
