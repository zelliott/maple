zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain Rd, a zzso type d strain, has been achieved by using zzso zzso techniques and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and core zzso zzso It was found that this zzso expresses zzso populations of zzso of which the zzso zzso zzso are subject to phase zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed a series of related structures differing in the number of zzso zzso linked to a zzso zzso element, zzso zzso zzso and the degree of zzso The structures of the major zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso and one zzso four zzso zzso and two zzso and five zzso zzso two Gal and one zzso zzso were zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and were determined in zzso In the major zzso zzso a zzso unit, zzso is attached at the zzso position of the terminal zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso while in the zzso zzso this zzso is zzso by the addition of a terminal zzso zzso giving the P zzso zzso zzso The fully extended zzso zzso zzso has the following zzso zzso zzso The structural data provide the first definitive evidence demonstrating the expression of a zzso zzso zzso the P zzso in zzso of zzso zzso It is noteworthy that the molecular environment in which zzso units are found differs from that observed in an zzso derived zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
