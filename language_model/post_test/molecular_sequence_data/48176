zzso zzso is well equipped for zzso piracy, encompassing the zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we report on the molecular and functional characterization of the zzso zzso gene cluster zzso to the zzso coli zzso transport genes zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso analysis identified zzso of 30 and 35 zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso within the zzso gene led to expression of a truncated zzso of 40 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso were shown to complement corresponding zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso genes abrogates zzso growth of zzso zzso on zzso zzso In contrast to zzso coli, the zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso consists solely of genes required for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and not of zzso synthesis genes such as zzso By Southern zzso zzso and zzso sequences could be detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and II but not in zzso IV zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso According to sequence alignment data and the coherent structure of the zzso zzso gene zzso we suggest early genetic divergence of zzso zzso zzso among species of the family zzso
