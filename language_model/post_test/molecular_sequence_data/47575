Recent studies have indicated that pregnancy can affect cellular activity in zzso zzso such as cartilage, ligaments, and zzso However, the impact of pregnancy on cellular activity in the zzso a critical component in joint function, has not been zzso zzso purpose of this study was to evaluate zzso levels for several relevant molecules in both zzso and lateral zzso from the knees of first-time pregnant immature rabbits zzso zzso pregnant mature rabbits zzso and zzso rabbits zzso immature and mature zzso by the sensitive molecular technique of zzso reverse zzso chain zzso Total zzso yields from the zzso zzso of zzso rabbits were reduced to zzso of zzso control values; however, yields from zzso and lateral zzso from zzso animals or the lateral zzso of zzso animals were not significantly zzso DNA yields were not affected by zzso Type I collagen zzso levels were significantly depressed in both zzso only in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated in both zzso only in zzso zzso None of the transcripts for the other zzso molecules assessed were influenced by zzso zzso zzso levels were unaffected by pregnancy, but zzso zzso levels were significantly decreased in the zzso zzso of zzso rabbits and in the lateral zzso of zzso zzso Complex changes in the pattern of zzso expression were observed for growth factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression was not altered during zzso zzso for zzso were 61 and 50% of control values in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso animals, respectively, while zzso zzso levels were 150 and zzso of control values in the lateral zzso from zzso and zzso animals, zzso Such results indicate that zzso changes in the pattern of zzso expression are zzso zzso Furthermore, the results support the hypothesis that different zzso zzso of the knee respond to pregnancy in a unique zzso
