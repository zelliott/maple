zzso zzso exists as two zzso zzso which is zzso expressed in most cell zzso and zzso which is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso in a variety of cell zzso Although previous studies have implicated two DNA binding zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso and zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso their effects in zzso and in zzso are not zzso Using real-time zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso and lungs of mice challenged in zzso and in zzso zzso with zzso in zzso was investigated in zzso and in zzso and zzso knockout zzso In response to 35 zzso zzso zzso but not zzso mice, exhibited much poorer induction of zzso gene expression in both the zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso levels were also poorly induced in zzso zzso while zzso deficient zzso exhibited higher levels than in normal zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed to activate and repress expression of the zzso promoter, respectively, in a transient zzso system and the role of specific DNA binding sites confirmed by zzso zzso zzso these data provide evidence for an important role for zzso in zzso and in zzso and for zzso in zzso in the regulation of zzso expression by zzso
