The Pacific oyster zzso zzso belongs to one of the most zzso but zzso poorly explored zzso the zzso Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster zzso using short reads and a zzso strategy, along with zzso of development and stress response and the zzso of the zzso The oyster zzso is highly zzso and rich in repetitive zzso with some zzso elements still actively shaping zzso zzso studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental zzso The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and zzso of zzso is probably central to the zzso adaptation to zzso life in the highly stressful zzso zzso Our analyses also show that shell formation in zzso is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their zzso The oyster zzso sequence fills a void in our understanding of the zzso
