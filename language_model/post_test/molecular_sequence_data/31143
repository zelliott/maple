Syrian zzso zzso cells are derived from smooth muscle of the zzso zzso zzso cell growth is increased by the addition of testosterone zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso or basic zzso growth factor zzso also known as zzso binding growth factor I and II zzso and zzso can replace T in the stimulation of growth in these zzso This phenomenon is correlated with zzso ability to elevate zzso zzso The increase zzso levels of zzso zzso were documented by northern blots and by in zzso zzso Using a 520 zzso human zzso zzso probe, a zzso clone with a 38 zzso DNA insert was isolated from a zzso zzso By restriction zzso analysis and southern zzso it was determined that there are three coding zzso DNA sequence analysis showed all of the coding region and 3' zzso sequences were on this zzso A zzso zzso zzso not in the 38 zzso insert is zzso based on the zzso sequences and zzso sequences of zzso from zzso zzso cells and several other zzso The zzso for zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library and zzso zzso of the coding region of zzso from four species shows a greater than zzso conservation of zzso acid zzso
