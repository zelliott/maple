We describe a simple, reliable technique for zzso zzso based on direct DNA sequencing of zzso amplified fragments from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso can be divided into two subsets, with one subset demonstrating a 3 base deletion in zzso 2 relative to the zzso zzso zzso individuals who possess one zzso from each zzso can be difficult using a direct sequencing approach, since the two overlapping DNA sequences move out of phase by 3 zzso once the point of deletion is zzso The complete sequence is obtained by performing two separate sequencing reactions with fluorescent dye zzso coming from either end of the zzso This allows all zzso positions in zzso 2 to be zzso zzso
