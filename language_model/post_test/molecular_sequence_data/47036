zzso zzso their zzso as a zzso of zzso zzso molecules zzso linked close to their zzso zzso The zzso initiation site zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso is a hairpin structure that contains in the loop a zzso zzso sequence flanked by two zzso and one 3' zzso The zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso are crucial for zzso of zzso zzso which is zzso by formation of a zzso complex between the zzso of each zzso Here, we used chemical modification zzso zzso zzso and three-dimensional modeling to compare zzso of zzso A and B zzso zzso The zzso loop sequences of these zzso are zzso and zzso zzso In both zzso zzso of most but not all zzso groups in the loop and zzso of the zzso position of the G zzso in the zzso sequence inhibited zzso These results demonstrate that small zzso of the loop structure are zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso position of the first and last As in the loop were neutral or enhanced zzso a result consistent with these zzso forming a zzso sheared base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso simulation revealed an unexpected difference in the zzso mechanism of these zzso Unlike zzso B, zzso A requires binding of a zzso zzso in the loop to promote zzso zzso This difference should be taken into consideration in the design of zzso molecules aimed at zzso zzso zzso
