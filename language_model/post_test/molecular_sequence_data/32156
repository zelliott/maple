Dynamic interchange between DNA zzso including zzso states, can be of importance to biological zzso In this study, we use a combination of zzso and zzso techniques to detect and characterize zzso zzso zzso states in strand exchange and strand displacement reactions for zzso loop DNA zzso here referred to as zzso We show that such zzso zzso zzso loop states can zzso coexist below 50 degrees C, while rearranging zzso at elevated temperatures to zzso more stable zzso Such dynamic interchange between zzso and globally stable DNA zzso states can be of importance in biological regulatory zzso
