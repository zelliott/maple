The zzso locus of zzso zzso mediates zzso stabilization by killing of zzso zzso The locus specifies two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso killing zzso by zzso is governed by a complicated control mechanism that involves both zzso zzso of translation by zzso and zzso of zzso translation by zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso translation of a reading frame zzso that zzso with zzso and translation of zzso is coupled to translation of zzso In the inactive full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso element at the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso element located at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso to 3' pairing locks the zzso in an zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso target regions are zzso Here we show that the 3' processing leads to major structural zzso in the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso explains zzso of translation and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso target zzso that presents the target zzso in a zzso zzso The stem of the target hairpin contains zzso and zzso in a paired zzso Using zzso analysis, we show that this pairing keeps zzso in an accessible zzso Furthermore, a zzso analysis shows that an internal loop in the target stem is prerequisite for efficient translation and zzso zzso zzso
