An insect zzso zzso zzso occurs in the poison zzso apparatus of female zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the Caribbean fruit fly, zzso zzso and other zzso fruit zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in diameter, has a zzso appearance and a zzso double stranded DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA restriction zzso profiles differed from those reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the only two zzso whose zzso have been zzso and from those reported for zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso search and zzso alignment of the zzso acids deduced from the zzso zzso of a zzso DNA zzso cloned from an zzso zzso library revealed zzso zzso with the putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Of the deduced zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso are zzso among the four zzso zzso zzso occur in at least one zzso zzso in at least one zzso zzso in at least one zzso and one zzso and zzso occur only in zzso Although the zzso zzso represents a portion of the zzso it contains zzso that zzso the zzso consensus sequence of known zzso zzso zzso Western blots using a mouse zzso zzso serum recognized six major protein bands in combined zzso of zzso zzso at least one band in zzso of male and female zzso and at least two bands in host zzso that contained zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA probe recognized DNA in zzso of male and female zzso These results confirm that zzso is a true zzso and probably a member of the Group C zzso Unlike other zzso zzso does not express the zzso zzso Since it also replicates in both the zzso and fly, members of two different insect zzso zzso may represent a new zzso Group, or a zzso of the Group C zzso
