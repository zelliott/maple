The zzso of zzso interactions has been widely accepted as a tool for drug discovery and development zzso However, this powerful technique is unappreciated in zzso and zzso studies, where it could be extremely useful for understanding the mechanisms of action of various compounds in cases when experimental data are controversial due to complexity of the investigated zzso In this study, based on the zzso data suggesting involvement of zzso zzso carrier in zzso and zzso transport to zzso zzso molecular zzso is applied to zzso the possible interactions between the zzso carrier and its putative zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso channel zzso could bind to the specific location zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the cavity of the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the predicted binding site suggests that zzso channel zzso could interfere with both the zzso zzso and possible zzso flux through the zzso carrier, and supports the hypothesis that the zzso carrier is a target of zzso channel zzso
