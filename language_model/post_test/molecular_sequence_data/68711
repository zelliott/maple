The zzso zzso zzso contains an upstream zzso (the 216 zzso zzso which is spliced only zzso both in zzso and in zzso We have chosen the zzso transcript as a model to zzso in zzso the role of downstream zzso involved in the alternative zzso of this retained zzso By using a series of zzso containing specific zzso zzso and/or zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso site, positioned 259 zzso downstream of the 216 zzso zzso is the main zzso which activates the zzso of this zzso Our results establish the importance of a downstream zzso zzso site for the zzso of the 3' zzso site, which is known to be zzso within this retained zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso site, although positioned at an ideal distance zzso zzso from the upstream zzso does not exhibit such a zzso zzso In contrast, its improvement to a consensus sequence may even result in a slight negative zzso effect in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso site, which is the first observation of such a zzso We have shown that this unexpected zzso is due, at least partly, to the unusual characteristics of the zzso upstream zzso which requires a hairpin structure between the branch sites and the 3' zzso site to reduce the operational distance between these two zzso zzso mechanisms involved in the contrasted zzso effects of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites are zzso
