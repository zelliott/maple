zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been expressed in an zzso coli zzso zzso membrane preparations yielded zzso zzso of zzso of zzso The metabolism of a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed the same zzso zzso profiles previously observed with a zzso cell expression zzso Several of the zzso exhibited an increased rate of zzso zzso possibly as the result of an enlarged zzso binding pocket and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso exhibited activities ranging from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso showed markedly suppressed zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities ranged from zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso was abolished in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso Studies of zzso zzso binding and metabolism by the zzso zzso showed that its resistance to zzso is largely attributable to an inability to zzso the zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli provides an excellent opportunity to study zzso relationships by zzso zzso
