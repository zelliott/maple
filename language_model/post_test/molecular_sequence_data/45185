The triggering zzso expressed on zzso cell type 1 zzso is a cell surface zzso that has been identified on both human and zzso zzso zzso and mature zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of microbial components zzso the inflammatory response and may be responsible for the zzso observed during the initial stage of zzso To investigate the effect of the zzso of the zzso zzso during experimental zzso zzso we used analogue synthetic peptides derived from the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was expressed on both zzso and peripheral zzso during experimental zzso in zzso The zzso peptides inhibited the recognition by zzso of its zzso and protected zzso mice from zzso In septic rats, the zzso peptides improved the zzso status, attenuated the development of zzso zzso modulated the production of such zzso zzso as tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso and improved zzso The protective effect of these peptides on zzso pressure could partly be explained by a decreased production of zzso zzso These data suggest that in zzso zzso of zzso might be a suitable therapeutic tool for the treatment of zzso
