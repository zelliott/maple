zzso of properly zzso functional zzso zzso in a zzso system is governed by multiple factors like zzso zzso zzso copy number, upstream elements such as leader zzso zzso stability and presence of tightly controlled zzso Here we present a strategy for enhanced production of the functional zzso in zzso coli by zzso zzso We have previously reported the generation of humanized zzso form of a potentially zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso to the zzso B surface zzso However, the expression level of zzso in zzso coli was fairly low which was possibly due to the presence of rare zzso In the native zzso zzso almost zzso of zzso showed poor zzso bias with varying degrees of rare occurrence in the zzso coli zzso We therefore designed a synthetic gene zzso the zzso protein by using zzso coli preferred zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was further cloned into a zzso expression system with a zzso zzso and expressed as a soluble protein mainly in the zzso The zzso was both zzso by zzso and detected on Western zzso with this zzso Using the zzso zzso strategy, we were able to achieve a more than zzso increased zzso expression of soluble zzso Further, the zzso zzso was stable and retained its zzso affinity and zzso zzso Interestingly, based on secondary structure zzso we observed that the zzso secondary structure, including that of the zzso may not have a significant role in the increased expression of this zzso zzso
