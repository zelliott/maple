In the human, zzso zzso occurs in several tissue sites, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recent work from our laboratory has indicated that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso responsible for zzso zzso is determined, in part, by the use of zzso zzso Thus the expression of zzso in human zzso appears to zzso a promoter zzso to the translation zzso This promoter is not zzso in zzso but instead, the promoter used to drive zzso expression in zzso is at least 40 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso In addition, there is a minor promoter used in the expression of a small proportion of zzso transcripts which is 9 zzso upstream from the start of zzso zzso from these promoters are also expressed in other fetal zzso including zzso cells such as zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and other fetal zzso such as fetal zzso On the other hand, in zzso tissue expression of zzso may be achieved by yet another, zzso zzso The various zzso zzso unique for expression driven by each of these promoters are spliced into a common zzso boundary upstream from the zzso zzso This means that the protein expressed in each of the various zzso sites of zzso zzso is zzso
