Syrian golden zzso bearing zzso zzso pancreatic zzso were treated for 2 months with the delayed delivery systems of the zzso zzso zzso releasing 25 zzso for 30 zzso the zzso analog zzso (the zzso liberating zzso zzso for 30 zzso or with the combination of these two zzso The increase in the dose of zzso was possible in view of the lack of toxicity of this zzso This higher dose of zzso exerted a greater zzso effect on pancreatic zzso than the regimens previously used zzso zzso zzso zzso and their combination reduced the number of pancreatic zzso and significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared with the zzso The combination had the strongest zzso effect and reduced tumor weight by zzso as compared with zzso Both the light and electron microscopic analysis of the tumors showed that the zzso effect was due to the enhancement of zzso zzso cell zzso of tumor zzso zzso growth factor zzso receptors were detected zzso in the zzso tumors and their number decreased after the treatment with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to tumor cells was shown zzso and receptors to these zzso and zzso were also determined zzso by zzso zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso decreased the binding capacity of receptors for zzso and zzso producing zzso of these zzso This suggests that pancreatic tumor cells with receptors to these peptides are sensitive to the zzso This work reinforces the view that the combination of high doses of zzso analog zzso with zzso zzso or zzso should be considered for the development of a new hormonal therapy for zzso pancreatic zzso
