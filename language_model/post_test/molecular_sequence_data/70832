zzso that genes important in zzso processes in zzso might have zzso zzso counterparts in lower organisms, we used the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso as a probe for screening a mouse zzso zzso zzso This screening resulted in identification of a novel putative zzso zzso zzso Although it did not exhibit significant zzso to zzso it did show significant sequence zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is associated with various zzso processes including differentiation of the zzso zzso The new zzso gene was designated accordingly zzso zzso like zzso zzso like zzso sequences have been reported to occur in zzso zzso and in the zzso Positive zzso signals obtained in zzso analysis suggest evolutionary conservation of zzso throughout the zzso zzso Four distinct zzso transcripts were detected in mouse zzso at least one of which is zzso Northern and in zzso zzso analyses revealed that in normal zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso zzso and in round zzso zzso differ from one another in their 3' untranslated region, resulting from use of different zzso sites, and in the length of their zzso zzso Within the coding region, three of the putative peptides share the zzso and zzso zzso but differ in their zzso domain, suggesting that the latter may be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso We conclude that although zzso might have an essential role in all zzso these zzso are likely to take part in the complex array of zzso involved in regulating zzso
