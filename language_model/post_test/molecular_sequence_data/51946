A zzso gene deletion at the zzso locus of zzso DNA isolated from peripheral blood was investigated for its relationship with several types of cancer using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA samples were prepared from blood obtained from 128 healthy blood donors and 150 patients with cancer or chronic zzso zzso zzso were prepared based on the human zzso sequence and the zzso sequences of the rat zzso zzso The amplified sequence between zzso 5 and 6 including zzso 5 showed very clearly the presence of absence of the zzso zzso after zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the presence and absence of zzso product from samples of twins and their parents indicated that presence involves zzso or zzso normal zzso zzso while absence involves only zzso gene zzso The patients with stomach cancer had a significantly higher frequency of gene deletion than did the healthy controls zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso deletion may be a possible genetic marker for early detection of a group at high risk of stomach zzso
