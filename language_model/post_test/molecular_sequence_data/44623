zzso zzso is an early zzso event that is observed in potato zzso either after penetration of an incompatible race of zzso zzso the potato late blight zzso or after treatment with zzso wall components zzso prepared from zzso zzso In potato cells in suspension culture, the number of cells with zzso zzso increased upon treatment with zzso but such an increase was suppressed by treatment with zzso D prior to treatment with zzso This result suggested that zzso zzso in cultured potato cells might be connected with the association of zzso zzso To identify the molecular basis of zzso zzso we zzso zzso and zzso proteins by affinity zzso on a column of immobilized zzso I from cultured potato cells and isolated proteins of 43 zzso 32 zzso and 22 zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequences indicated that the 43 zzso 32 zzso and 22 zzso proteins were potato zzso basic zzso and zzso zzso zzso This conclusion was supported by the results of Western zzso analysis of the 43 zzso and 32 zzso proteins with zzso against zzso and basic zzso zzso analysis with zzso coupled to zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggested that the 32 zzso and 22 zzso proteins had zzso zzso In addition, examination of zzso interactions using an optical zzso confirmed the binding of zzso to zzso These results imply the possibility that basic zzso and zzso protein might be involved in zzso zzso hereby zzso In the potato cell's defense against attack by zzso
