zzso zzso I and II zzso are zzso toxins zzso produced by the Caribbean Sea zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso family, a unique class of zzso zzso exclusively found in sea zzso As for the rest of the members of this family, zzso are zzso zzso with molecular weights around 20 zzso high zzso points zzso and a preference for zzso zzso A three-dimensional structure of zzso solved by X-ray zzso showed that it is composed of a zzso zzso core flanked on the opposite sides by two alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A variety of experimental results indicate that the first thirty zzso zzso which include one of the zzso are directly involved in pore zzso This region contains an zzso stretch, well zzso in all zzso which is the only portion of the zzso that can change zzso without zzso the general protein zzso in fact, binding to model zzso only produces a slight increase in the regular secondary structure content of zzso zzso are produced in soluble form but they readily bind to different cell and model membrane systems such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both the binding and zzso steps are critically dependent on the zzso nature of the zzso In fact, a large population of toxin zzso binds with high affinity in zzso containing zzso whereas binding in zzso lacking this zzso is relatively low and zzso The joint presence of zzso and cholesterol largely promotes binding and pore zzso Minor amounts of lipids favoring a zzso organization also augment the efficiency of pore zzso The functional pore formed in cellular and model zzso has a diameter of approximately zzso zzso and is presumably formed by the zzso alpha zzso of four zzso zzso 31 degrees in relation to the zzso zzso Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that zzso as well as zzso II, another zzso form a zzso pore in zzso in which the zzso chains as well as the polar head groups of zzso are zzso
