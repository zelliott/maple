In 2005, a human zzso was discovered in children with respiratory tract zzso Attempts to culture this virus on conventional cell lines has failed thus zzso We investigated whether the virus can replicate on zzso human airway zzso This cell culture system mimics the human airway environment and zzso zzso of various respiratory zzso The cells were zzso with human zzso zzso washes from children, and virus replication was monitored by measuring zzso release of the virus via real-time zzso Furthermore, we identified different viral zzso in the infected zzso All zzso were transcribed from a single promoter but varied due to alternative zzso and alternative zzso similar to what has been described for bovine zzso and minute virus of zzso the other two members of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso of human zzso displays strong zzso to the zzso of the other zzso In conclusion, we report here for the first time that human zzso can be zzso in an in zzso culture system and present a detailed map of the set of zzso that are produced by the zzso
