The pancreatic zzso is the only cell in animals that expresses the insulin gene and zzso insulin zzso We have found copious release of zzso and zzso insulin into the medium from the primary culture of carp zzso zzso zzso this release to more than zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in these zzso These all reflect characteristics of a pancreatic zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso and the zzso of insulin and zzso confirmed the identity of these cells as zzso zzso carp zzso insulin zzso zzso with zzso and bovine insulin in zzso indicating the similarity of their molecular sizes zzso zzso zzso strongly reduced zzso in zzso diabetic zzso It also zzso significantly higher zzso zzso in carp and zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with rat and zzso insulin zzso showing the expression of the insulin gene in this zzso Using zzso zzso designed on the basis of zzso insulin domain, zzso zzso was reverse zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso A and B chain exhibited zzso zzso with zzso and more than zzso zzso with human, zzso and zzso zzso To understand the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso insulin, we have analyzed the zzso acid sequences and three-dimensional structure of zzso In the critical zzso segment for zzso zzso zzso has His at the A8 position instead of zzso in human and zzso insulin, and this attributed greater biological activity to zzso Our results show that carp zzso is a unique zzso As an insulin target cell it can express the insulin gene and zzso highly active insulin zzso thus, it may serve as a natural alternative to pancreatic zzso zzso
