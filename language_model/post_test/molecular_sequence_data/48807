zzso group of zzso producing zzso been successfully cultured and characterized from the nest material of diverse zzso Some are zzso that produce zzso chemicals found to protect nest zzso and resources from zzso zzso Others have no known fitness relationship with their associated insects, but have been found to produce zzso in zzso zzso insect nest material is being investigated as a new source of novel zzso producing zzso which could be harnessed for therapeutic zzso To extend studies of zzso associations beyond zzso dwelling insects and wood boring zzso we conducted a preliminary assessment of the zzso within the nests of the paper zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso were readily cultured from nest material across multiple invasive zzso zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thirty of these zzso were zzso for zzso activity against the challenge bacteria zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Sixty percent of zzso inhibited the growth of at least one challenge zzso This study provides the first assessment of bacteria associated with nests of zzso zzso and the first record of zzso producing zzso isolated from social zzso We provide a new system to explore nest associated zzso from a ubiquitous and cosmopolitan group of zzso
