Here we provide insights into the molecular structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and zzso X-ray scattering zzso zzso alignment and zzso studies have suggested that zzso comprises two zzso folds connected by a zzso region of approximately 70 zzso acid zzso The zzso domain zzso of this unusual zzso together with approximately 35 zzso acid zzso of the predicted zzso region, was expressed in zzso coli, zzso in the zzso form and the structure of the zzso form determined at high-resolution by zzso zzso The structure shows that the zzso domain is similar in fold to the conventional zzso zzso from other organisms, whereas the zzso region does not have any discernible zzso This tandem zzso structure of the zzso chain derived for the zzso protein was confirmed using solution X-ray scattering zzso X-ray scattering studies of zzso indicated that the zzso acid zzso zzso forms a zzso yet mobile, zzso segment connecting the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The X-ray scattering studies also showed that the zzso domain zzso has a molecular zzso similar to that of zzso The restored molecular shape indicates that the folded zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are noticeably zzso suggesting some domain movement on complex formation with zzso zzso to allow zzso electron transfer between the metal centers in zzso This study demonstrates the advantage of combining X-ray scattering and zzso methods in structural studies of zzso zzso proteins that are not suited to zzso zzso The study forms a structural foundation for functional studies of the interaction and zzso reactions of zzso with zzso zzso also reported zzso
