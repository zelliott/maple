The molecular properties of an zzso zzso zzso complex zzso from rat liver were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso On zzso the zzso complex zzso as almost a single component with a zzso zzso of zzso Dynamic zzso zzso indicated that it has a diffusion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso radius of zzso zzso From these two zzso the protein complex was estimated to have the high molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated a molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso and a radius of zzso of zzso zzso The zzso complex was found to be composed of multiple zzso of the zzso zzso with molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein species with molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso which were directly associated with the zzso zzso The electron zzso finding that the zzso zzso complex had a zzso shape, direct zzso observations on the zzso arrangement of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso of the latter into two groups with respect to sequence zzso suggested that the zzso complex is a symmetrical assembly of two zzso each containing a large terminal subset and half the central zzso subset of zzso For clarification of the molecular structure of the zzso zzso complex in solution, its zzso parameters were calculated theoretically using a model based on this zzso zzso The values obtained for the zzso radius and radius of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were consistent with the experimental zzso These results provide evidence that the zzso zzso complex is a zzso zzso structure of zzso in solution, consisting of a zzso zzso component with zzso function and multiple other zzso which possibly have regulatory zzso
