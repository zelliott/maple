zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by positive and negative zzso zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso in order to evaluate whether the two most common zzso linkage types, zzso 1 zzso 2 and 1 zzso 6, found for zzso containing a zzso zzso part can be zzso In the positive zzso mode the degree of internal zzso zzso loss was found to be strongly dependent on the zzso type and was very pronounced for zzso of the zzso zzso The relative abundance of the zzso zzso formed by fragmentation at zzso bonds only allows one to zzso the zzso linkage types in the case of zzso zzso In contrast, the negative zzso mode makes a clear differentiation between a zzso (1 zzso 6) and a zzso (1 zzso 2) zzso zzso possible for all zzso zzso The zzso compounds could be characterized by additional product zzso When the compounds were dissolved in pure methanol a molecular radical zzso was found to be the base peak in zzso
