zzso represent the most complex zzso viral elements zzso described to zzso zzso genes have been hosted within zzso zzso zzso since approximately 100 zzso They play a crucial role in the zzso life cycle as they produce zzso zzso which are injected into zzso zzso hosts during zzso zzso zzso particles zzso multiple zzso circles zzso zzso zzso Their expression in zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on the zzso organization of the zzso segments zzso master sequences used to produce the zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is composed of a zzso zzso two-thirds of the zzso segments and of seven dispersed zzso each containing one to three zzso Comparative zzso analyses with closely related species gave insights into the evolutionary dynamics of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the different zzso zzso showed the zzso of the zzso zzso across different zzso The zzso gene zzso is zzso within the zzso suggesting an ancient zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the evolution of zzso segments within the zzso has involved a series of zzso zzso
