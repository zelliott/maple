The zzso promoter of a zzso zzso virus, zzso mosaic virus zzso controlling synthesis of zzso zzso has been defined in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso templates were produced by in zzso zzso of cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso from these templates by a zzso zzso zzso zzso preparation extracted from infected barley zzso The activities of templates with zzso and deletions surrounding the zzso initiation site revealed a promoter of approximately 62 bases grouped into four functional zzso The core sequence consists of about zzso bases immediately upstream of, and including, the initiation zzso In addition to the core zzso a domain overlapping the zzso untranslated end of zzso apparently determines correct zzso Two zzso immediately upstream of the promoter core consist of the internal zzso tract of zzso which probably serves as an non zzso zzso zzso access of the zzso to the promoter, and a zzso zzso that is required for high levels of promoter zzso zzso to sequences surrounding the initiation sites of zzso zzso from several plant zzso zzso and from zzso have been zzso
