Directed cloning approaches and large-scale sequencing of several zzso zzso unveiled many new members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso among them zzso zzso studies showed that zzso is an zzso old zzso structurally related to a group of zzso zzso To gain insight into the zzso organization, regulation of zzso and zzso diversification of zzso several zzso species were zzso In contrast to the obviously zzso coding region zzso displays an evolutionary preserved zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, an alternatively used cryptic zzso was identified within the coding region, which shortens the N zzso by 47 zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is driven by zzso sequences upstream of at least two zzso start regions in mouse and rat but only one region in zzso In zzso both promoters are active in all zzso investigated, but the level of activity is zzso At the zzso level, several zzso zzso zzso within the first 150 zzso of the coding region may serve as start points for translation in human and other zzso zzso zzso and expression of reporter zzso confirmed these multiple zzso start points and revealed a preference for the second zzso zzso in human zzso Our data show that multiple translation initiation starts and alternative zzso contribute to the zzso diversification of zzso
