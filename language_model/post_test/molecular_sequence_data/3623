zzso zzso has been identified as a major zzso for zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus, two Old World zzso The situation with New World zzso is less clear: previous studies demonstrated that zzso virus also exhibited zzso binding to zzso but that zzso virus did zzso To extend these initial studies, several additional Old and New World zzso were screened for entry into mouse embryonic stem cells possessing or lacking zzso In addition, representative viruses were further analyzed for direct binding to zzso by means of a virus overlay protein zzso zzso zzso These studies indicate that Old World zzso use zzso as a major zzso zzso of the New World zzso only zzso C viruses zzso zzso and Latino zzso use zzso as a major zzso New World zzso A and B zzso which include the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to use a different zzso or zzso for zzso Previous studies with zzso have suggested the need for a small zzso zzso acid at zzso zzso zzso zzso acid position 260 to allow zzso binding to zzso As reported zzso this requirement appears to be broadly zzso to the zzso as determined by more extensive analysis of zzso zzso usage and zzso sequences of Old and New World zzso In addition, zzso zzso acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all zzso showing zzso zzso binding possess a bulky aromatic zzso acid zzso or zzso at this zzso
