zzso zzso zzso was previously isolated in our laboratory and was shown to be able to zzso high molecular mass zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 54, zzso In this research, the zzso zzso gene zzso of this strain was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso and directly zzso by cycle sequencing zzso We compared this sequence with all known zzso zzso zzso sequences available from zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the other zzso especially in the region of zzso zzso (in the zzso coli zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso a zzso tree was zzso The data from the zzso tree and similarity values suggest that zzso zzso zzso is closer to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using the same approach, we also determined the zzso zzso from an another zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso and colleagues (1991) zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be closer to zzso zzso and different from our zzso zzso zzso
