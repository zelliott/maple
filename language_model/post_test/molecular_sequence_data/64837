The authors analyzed the upstream regulatory region of zzso a gene that is expressed in a minority phase that zzso at dawn zzso 2 zzso zzso in zzso zzso to determine whether specific zzso elements are responsible for this characteristic expression zzso zzso of various zzso fragments to zzso reporter genes showed that normal class 2 phasing of zzso expression was correlated with promoter zzso No specific zzso element that is zzso from the promoter was responsible for determining zzso Very weak promoter activity of unstable phasing was mapped to a zzso zzso zzso of sequences that flank this minimal promoter either upstream or downstream increased the promoter strength and stabilized the phase in class 2, but neither segment was individually zzso Because the data suggested a role for the overall promoter context rather than a specific zzso zzso the authors proposed that DNA zzso is important in the phase determination of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, they fused the zzso DNA zzso zzso coli zzso promoter to zzso and showed that it acts as a class 2 promoter in zzso zzso
