We report the identification of 17 box zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso from the ancient zzso zzso zzso To systematically isolate and characterize these zzso the zzso zzso zzso for the box zzso zzso common zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein were generated in zzso zzso from zzso zzso extracts with the zzso zzso indicated that this zzso has at least 30 zzso zzso We have zzso zzso of them and designated them TBR for zzso zzso zzso zzso All of them bear zzso box C, D, zzso and zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso zzso in zzso Fourteen of them are novel zzso zzso zzso Fifteen bear potential guide regions to mature zzso suggesting that they are involved in zzso zzso Indeed, eight zzso zzso have been mapped in the zzso at sites predicted by the zzso zzso Comparative zzso indicates that six of the zzso are the first zzso zzso of known zzso and zzso zzso guide zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso has many zzso box zzso zzso with roles in zzso zzso of zzso and that the mechanism for targeting the zzso to be zzso at the fifth zzso upstream of box D or zzso originated in early zzso
