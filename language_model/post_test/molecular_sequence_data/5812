The zzso heat shock protein zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso in the absence of stress and is thought to regulate zzso filament zzso possibly by a zzso zzso zzso has also been suggested to be involved in contraction of zzso smooth zzso We have investigated zzso of zzso in airway smooth muscle in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso incorporation into canine zzso zzso and induced a shift in the distribution of charge zzso on two-dimensional gels to more zzso zzso zzso The canine zzso zzso acid sequence includes three zzso zzso corresponding to sites in human zzso known to be zzso by zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso To determine whether zzso receptors are coupled to a zzso zzso zzso in smooth muscle culminating in zzso of zzso we zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso thought to activate zzso zzso zzso canine zzso expressed in zzso coli was a zzso for zzso zzso in zzso as well as a zzso for zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso which was activated by zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity and blocked the shift in zzso charge zzso to zzso zzso We suggest that zzso in airway smooth muscle, in addition to being a stress response zzso is zzso by a zzso signaling cascade involving zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
