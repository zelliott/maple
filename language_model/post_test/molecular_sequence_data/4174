The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is initiated by zzso zzso which are zzso that cleave the zzso off core proteins and degrade them to shorter zzso We have zzso previously four zzso zzso activities from Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and Sun zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the present study we characterize further the most abundant activity zzso zzso This zzso zzso as a family of zzso zzso proteins from both zzso cells and the rat liver, with the major species being 37 and 40 zzso zzso acid sequence analysis shows the zzso zzso zzso protein is highly zzso with the zzso domain, or zzso domain, of the approximately 80 zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after zzso This domain, which is also found in zzso protein zzso links zzso proteins to zzso zzso against the zzso domain recognize all the zzso zzso proteins on Western zzso suggesting that the smaller species are derived from a larger zzso zzso binds to, and is affected by, molecules known to interact with zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso domain zzso Since zzso expressed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso lack zzso activity, and some zzso peptides generated from the zzso do not have a match in any zzso zzso it appears that, rather than being derived from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso may be a new member of the zzso domain zzso
