We have isolated and zzso complementary DNA zzso for the human zzso zzso a major zzso for protein zzso C and the human zzso of an zzso to zzso bovine protein named zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso The human zzso zzso encodes a protein of 332 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso sequences of the zzso indicated that their zzso regions are more zzso than the coding zzso Spot zzso zzso using zzso human zzso indicated that the gene zzso the zzso zzso designated zzso maps to the zzso region of human zzso 6, and it also suggested that a zzso region with a sequence zzso to the zzso region of the zzso zzso exists on zzso zzso
