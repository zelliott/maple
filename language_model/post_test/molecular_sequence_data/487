The efficacy of various zzso zzso therapy regimens for human zzso virus type 2 zzso infection remains zzso zzso is zzso resistant to the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso and may also be less susceptible than zzso to some zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso in zzso that zzso zzso resistance are not well zzso 

zzso patients were studied as part of an ongoing prospective zzso cohort study of zzso therapy for zzso infection in zzso Patients were treated with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pol genes from these patients were zzso and the zzso zzso of resistance in zzso were zzso zzso of zzso resistance were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in strains in zzso of zzso zzso had evidence of resistance to at least 1 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso high-level resistance to zzso and zzso in zzso were found in strains from zzso and zzso of patients, zzso The zzso zzso which zzso zzso resistance in zzso emerged in strains from zzso of zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not observed, with the exception of zzso which was present together with zzso and zzso in a strain from 1 zzso Eight patients had zzso with zzso zzso associated with zzso resistance, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 patients had strains with multiple zzso zzso zzso The duration of zzso therapy was positively associated with the development of drug resistance zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso of 11 patients with zzso with no zzso zzso zzso resistance had zzso plasma zzso zzso loads zzso zzso zzso compared with 3 zzso of 12 patients with zzso with zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso virus had higher plasma zzso zzso zzso compared with those with zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso individuals treated with zzso therapy in zzso commonly have zzso zzso consistent with zzso drug zzso Additional clinical studies are required to improve the efficacy of primary and salvage treatment regimens for treating zzso zzso
