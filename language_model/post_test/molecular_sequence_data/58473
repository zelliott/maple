We induced in allergic humans the counterpart of zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso lines from zzso humans were used to map zzso zzso for the principal zzso of cat zzso zzso d zzso Two peptides of 27 zzso acids each were zzso to contain the dominant zzso zzso zzso After a safety trial, we carried out a blinded study of the dose required for zzso We randomly divided 95 zzso patients into zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso and 750 zzso zzso Patients received a subcutaneous injection weekly for 4 zzso Before and after treatment, patients were exposed in a room inhabited by live cats and scored by nose and lung zzso zzso zzso and lung scores zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the 750 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Six weeks after treatment, scores adjusted for baseline differences were reduced in the 750 zzso group: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The 75 zzso group showed intermediate effects and the zzso zzso group no zzso Linear trend analysis indicated a significant dose response effect: p zzso zzso for nose and zzso for lung zzso zzso side effects occurred an hour or more after the first 750 zzso dose in 16 of 24 patients but required little or no treatment with one zzso zzso zzso treatment peptides safely improved allergic responses to zzso
