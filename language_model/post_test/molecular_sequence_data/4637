The zzso technology comprises several zzso involving the generation of zzso zzso zzso for zzso recognition studies in conjunction with zzso sequence determination by mass zzso Although zzso to any desired zzso procedures are greatly facilitated if the zzso are zzso as zzso is by reductive zzso of a reducing end zzso to a zzso Using bovine zzso zzso as a model for release of zzso in the reducing state, and based on yields of zzso and zzso from zzso reactions and degradation, zzso zzso zzso zzso at 22 degrees C for 48 h has been selected in preference to other conditions, zzso sodium zzso and zzso The integrity of the main zzso and neutral zzso released under these conditions, zzso to zzso was established by analyses of free zzso by liquid secondary zzso mass zzso zzso and of the derived zzso by zzso the repertoire compared favorably with that of the zzso zzso generated by conventional reductive alkaline zzso zzso More forcing conditions of zzso zzso zzso at 65 degrees C for 6 h were required to release zzso from zzso gastric zzso zzso to zzso were obtained of which about one-third had an intact core zzso Relative to yields after reductive alkaline zzso the overall yields for these two zzso were zzso and zzso for zzso and neutral zzso zzso Among zzso released from an zzso zzso zzso using zzso three zzso of the zzso zzso sequences were identified as zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso one of which is based on the unusual backbone zzso
