zzso distemper virus zzso causes highly contagious zzso zzso and neurological diseases in wild and domestic animal zzso Despite a broad vaccination campaign, the disease is still a serious problem zzso In this study, six field zzso strains were isolated from three dogs, two raccoon dogs, and one badger in zzso The full sequence of the genes zzso fusion zzso and zzso zzso proteins were compared with those of other zzso including field and vaccine zzso The zzso analysis for the F and H genes indicated that the two zzso strains isolated from dogs were most closely related to Chinese strains in the zzso zzso Another four strains were closely related to Japanese strains in the zzso zzso The six currently isolated strains shared zzso and zzso identities with eight commercial vaccine strains in their zzso and zzso acid sequences of the F zzso zzso They also showed zzso and zzso identities with the same vaccine strains in their zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the H zzso zzso Different zzso zzso sites were identified in the F and H genes of the six zzso from the zzso vaccine strain zzso zzso these results demonstrate that at least two different zzso zzso currently exist in zzso The considerable genetic differences between the vaccine strains and zzso zzso would be a major factor of the incomplete protection of dogs from zzso zzso
