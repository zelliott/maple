zzso is a zzso drug resistance zzso which is eliminated from host bacteria at 42 degrees C but not at 32 degrees zzso This zzso has been called zzso instability zzso We determined the zzso sequence of the zzso DNA zzso segment which causes this zzso Within this zzso segment, several open reading frames zzso were found, including one which encodes a protein with a molecular weight of zzso A protein approximately corresponding to this protein is expressed in zzso coli zzso harboring plasmids containing the zzso zzso In addition, we found the zzso sequence at 112 bases zzso to this zzso zzso elimination due to this segment was not observed in the zzso strain of zzso coli, but the zzso protein was not required for expression of this zzso We constructed various deletion derivatives and found that three portions, the region containing the zzso zzso 1 to 24), zzso zzso 25 to zzso and tail zzso zzso to zzso sequences are necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso I is required for zzso zzso
