zzso systems zzso are universal among bacteria and play critical roles in gene zzso Our understanding of the contributions of zzso in the biology of the zzso is just now beginning to zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent of zzso disease, zzso a zzso comprised of open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a response regulator designated zzso and zzso encodes a hybrid zzso zzso regulator designated zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso and produces the secondary messenger, zzso zzso zzso a critical signaling zzso in numerous zzso However, the regulatory role of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling in zzso biology are zzso In this study, the distribution, zzso expression and potential global regulatory capability of zzso were zzso zzso was found to be universal and highly zzso among zzso zzso with zzso zzso expressed during in zzso zzso and significantly zzso upon tick zzso zzso exchange replacement and zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso consists of a large number of genes zzso by the core zzso zzso zzso zzso linear zzso 54 and circular zzso 26) that zzso for proteins involved in central zzso processes and zzso mechanisms including immune zzso
