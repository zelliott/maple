zzso aligned zzso zzso are often used as model zzso to obtain structural details of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso drugs, and zzso zzso zzso samples can be difficult to prepare and no universal procedure has been reported that zzso all combinations of zzso zzso In this study, a new method for producing mechanically aligned zzso zzso samples using zzso a zzso solid, was zzso Using zzso zzso comparison of a conventional method of preparing mechanically aligned samples with the new zzso procedure found that the use of zzso significantly enhanced the alignment of zzso zzso to zzso The utility of the zzso procedure is also demonstrated on zzso of many different compositions, including zzso containing peptides such as zzso and zzso These results show that the zzso procedure is a generally zzso method for producing mechanically aligned samples for use in zzso zzso The increase in zzso alignment implies that this procedure will improve the sensitivity of solid-state zzso experiments, in particular those techniques that detect zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso
