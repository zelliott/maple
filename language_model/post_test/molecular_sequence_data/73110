zzso increases the zzso of the two zzso zzso nitrate zzso zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso and 330 zzso of the zzso zzso regions, designated as zzso and zzso of the two nitrate zzso genes zzso and zzso respectively, are sufficient for zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso Cheng zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso Here we identify the zzso elements of zzso and zzso that are necessary for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In transgenic plants one zzso zzso of zzso and two zzso zzso of zzso exhibited significantly lower zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso To distinguish which of these three zzso lost nitrate zzso competitive zzso zzso chain reaction was used to measure the zzso zzso zzso levels before and after nitrate zzso The single zzso zzso in zzso lost its response to zzso whereas the two zzso zzso in zzso partially lost their response to zzso A zzso sequence is zzso between the zzso site and the two zzso zzso This sequence motif is also zzso in the zzso zzso regions of other zzso plant zzso zzso mobility shift experiments indicate that these three regions bind to similar zzso The binding is zzso with respect to nitrate treatment and was observed in both zzso suspension cells and green zzso
