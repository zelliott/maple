The zzso coli zzso and zzso genes are involved in DNA repair and in the late step of zzso genetic zzso We have demonstrated previously that the zzso protein complex in the presence of zzso promotes zzso of zzso structures zzso from a zzso zzso with an zzso repeat zzso Because the zzso structure is zzso analogous to the Holiday structure, we have proposed that the role of the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso is to promote a strand exchange reaction at the Holliday zzso Here, we studied the specific interaction of the zzso complex with the Holliday structure using synthetic zzso prepared by zzso four zzso The affinities of the zzso protein for synthetic Holliday junctions are much higher zzso zzso than for duplex DNA, and the affinities of the zzso protein for the junctions are further enhanced zzso zzso by the interaction with the zzso zzso The zzso protein complex in the presence of zzso promotes zzso of the synthetic Holliday junction with zzso in the central core into two halves by catalyzing branch migration to the DNA ends, but it does not affect the structure of the synthetic Holliday junction without the zzso The separation of the synthetic Holliday junction is a result of the activity of the zzso complex that promotes strand exchange and DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso promote the strand exchange reaction at the Holliday junctions made by zzso These results provide further evidence that the zzso complex recognizes the Holliday junction and promotes branch migration in zzso zzso
