In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso family zzso zzso and the win locus of cellular zzso have been reported as frequent targets for integration of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso In this paper a further cellular zzso zzso is reported as zzso target for zzso integration in zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of a zzso integration and its cellular zzso regions showed that viral DNA was inserted in a zzso region already described for zzso integration in another single zzso The two integration sites are only zzso zzso zzso A link between zzso integration in zzso and zzso development may be zzso zzso analysis of the sequence of the unoccupied locus revealed that, in addition to zzso repeats and a zzso coding region, already zzso several features of zzso zzso Region zzso sequences are zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso might be a previously zzso zzso Organization of the zzso in functional zzso and regulation of gene expression are some functions attributed to zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso integration close to the same putative zzso in two different zzso suggests that a mechanism of deregulation of zzso functions by zzso zzso might act in some liver zzso
