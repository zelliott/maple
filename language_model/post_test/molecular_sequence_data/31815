zzso zzso is an important regulatory zzso modification in many zzso zzso The zzso analysis strategies developed in this study were all at zzso After using a standard zzso oven to assist protein zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with chemical zzso such as zzso and zzso to enable simultaneously relative zzso and zzso This method enabled the use of zzso alcohols for direct labeling of zzso sites (not labeled at the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso Various zzso parameters zzso zzso power, reaction time, zzso zzso and zzso efficiency parameters zzso reaction time, labeling tag zzso were studied and zzso In both control and experimental samples, zzso zzso coupled with relative zzso using analogue tags enabled calculation of zzso ratios in the same zzso A zzso method was also established for zzso zzso in human plasma by using the abundant protein zzso as an internal control for zzso relative quantities of zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso was combined with zzso zzso to enable simultaneous protein relative zzso and zzso These strategies proved to be effective for zzso zzso in biological zzso
