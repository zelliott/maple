By exploiting the correlation between the optimal growth temperature of organisms and a zzso index based on the propensity of zzso acids to enter zzso zzso an analysis is conducted in order to establish whether the last universal common zzso zzso was a zzso or a zzso This objective is reached by using maximum zzso and maximum likelihood to reconstruct the ancestral sequences of the zzso for two pairs of sets of zzso protein sequences by means of the zzso tree zzso derived from the small zzso zzso zzso even if this is rooted in all three possible zzso The zzso index of all the reconstructed ancestral sequences of the zzso belongs to the set of the zzso zzso thus supporting the hypotheses that see the zzso as a zzso or a zzso
