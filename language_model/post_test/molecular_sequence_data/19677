zzso and zzso are two zzso drugs known to induce weight loss in zzso zzso These molecules were recently shown to act as zzso zzso zzso zzso being presumed that the weight loss may be due to the zzso of the zzso zzso CA VA and CA zzso involved in zzso zzso among which zzso zzso To better understand the interaction of these compounds with zzso here, we report a zzso modeling and molecular dynamics simulations study on their zzso with human zzso zzso VA zzso zzso According to our results, in both cases the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso in the zzso interactions with the zzso zinc zzso whereas the organic scaffold establishes a large number of van der zzso and polar interactions with the active site zzso A structural comparison of these complexes with the corresponding zzso with human zzso zzso II zzso zzso provides a rationale to the different affinities measured for these drugs toward zzso VA and zzso zzso In particular, our data suggest that a zzso active site zzso together with a different hydrogen bond network arrangement of zzso VA compared to zzso II, may account for the different zzso values of zzso and zzso toward these zzso relevant zzso zzso These results provide useful insights for future design of more zzso zzso zzso with potential use as zzso drugs possessing a novel mechanism of zzso
