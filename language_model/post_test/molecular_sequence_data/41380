zzso a group of zzso zzso zzso are globally distributed zzso capable of causing zzso arthritis, encephalitis, and death in zzso The viral replication machinery consists of four zzso proteins zzso produced as a single zzso zzso of the zzso occurs in a highly regulated manner, with zzso at the zzso junction influencing zzso template use during zzso zzso Here, we report the structure of zzso in a zzso zzso The proteins form an extensive interface and zzso creates a ring structure that zzso zzso The zzso zzso site is located at the base of a narrow zzso and is not readily accessible, suggesting a highly regulated zzso The zzso zzso active site is over 40 zzso away from the zzso zzso site, supporting a trans zzso zzso zzso contains a previously zzso protein fold with a zzso zzso Known zzso in zzso that result in formation of zzso viruses or a temperature sensitive zzso cluster at the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso opposite the location of the zzso zzso zzso prevent efficient zzso of zzso affect zzso zzso and alter viral zzso production levels, highlighting the importance of the zzso interaction in zzso A potential zzso surface, spanning both zzso and zzso is proposed based on the location of zzso sites and zzso zzso These results offer unexpected insights into viral protein processing and zzso that may be zzso to other zzso viruses such as zzso zzso C virus zzso and zzso zzso
