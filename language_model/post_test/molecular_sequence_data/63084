The predominance of circulating and unique zzso forms zzso of Human zzso zzso Type 1 zzso in Cameroon suggests that dual infection occurs frequently in this zzso Despite the potential impact of these infections on the evolution of zzso diversity, relatively few have been zzso The failure to detect dual infections may be attributable to the zzso and costly sequence analysis involved in their zzso As such, there is a need for a zzso more rapid method to efficiently distinguish this subset of zzso individuals, particularly in regions where zzso diversity is zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso zzso was developed to detect dual zzso zzso This zzso was validated on sequential specimens obtained from 20 zzso study subjects, whose single or dual infection status was determined by standard sequence zzso By mixing gag fragments amplified from the sequential specimens from each study subject in zzso zzso it was shown that single and dual infection status correlated with the absence and presence, respectively, of zzso bands upon gel zzso zzso this novel zzso is capable of identifying dual infections with a sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of sequence zzso Given the impact of dual infection on viral zzso and diversity, this simple technique will be beneficial to understanding zzso evolution within an individual, as well as at a population level, in zzso Africa and zzso
