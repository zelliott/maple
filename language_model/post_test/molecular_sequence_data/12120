A systematic analysis reveals that out of 20 protein zzso zzso specific for either zzso or zzso the majority are extremely sensitive to zzso with zzso values in the low zzso zzso A few of them however, notably protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are relatively zzso to zzso zzso exhibiting zzso values in the zzso zzso With all protein zzso tested, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was competitive with respect to zzso regardless of its zzso zzso In contrast, either uncompetitive or zzso zzso of zzso with respect to the zzso zzso were exhibited by zzso and zzso protein zzso respectively, consistent with a different mechanism of zzso by these two zzso of zzso Computer modeling based on zzso crystal structure in conjunction with sequence analysis suggest that the low sensitivity to zzso of zzso may be accounted for by the bulky nature of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast these zzso zzso are either zzso or replaced by smaller ones in protein zzso highly sensitive to zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso appears to be responsible for the unique zzso of zzso with respect to a zzso zzso zzso bearing a zzso charged zzso zzso while zzso is zzso zzso less effective than zzso against zzso and most of the other protein zzso tested, it is actually more effective than zzso for zzso zzso but it zzso part of its efficacy if it is tested on a zzso zzso zzso in which zzso has been replaced by zzso It can be concluded from these data that the zzso sites of protein zzso are divergent enough as to allow a competitive inhibitor like zzso to be fairly selective, a feature that can be enhanced by suitable modifications designed based on the structure of the zzso site of the zzso
