As a step towards understanding coral immunity we present the first whole zzso analysis of the acute responses of zzso zzso to challenge with the bacterial cell wall zzso zzso and the viral mimic zzso zzso defined zzso provoking distinct but well zzso responses in higher zzso 

These experiments reveal similarities with the responses both of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso The most surprising finding was that zzso specifically induced three members of the zzso gene family, which has been implicated in immunity in zzso but is absent from zzso and zzso Like their zzso zzso zzso genes are arranged in a tandem cluster in the coral zzso 

A zzso survey of this gene family implies ancient origins, multiple independent losses and zzso expansions during animal zzso zzso functional convergence cannot be ruled out, zzso expression in zzso may reflect an ancestral role in zzso perhaps in zzso zzso
