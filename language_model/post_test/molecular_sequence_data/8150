zzso radiation can induce the zzso and release of zzso from zzso zzso These zzso have the potential to zzso local and systemic zzso zzso In this paper we report that northern zzso showed that human zzso and zzso lines expressed a zzso zzso transcript for the zzso and melanoma zzso zzso zzso and that ultraviolet B radiation zzso could zzso the expression of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso line zzso The zzso gene response to zzso was zzso at zzso zzso with 70 zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso revealed a zzso increase in zzso zzso over zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was measured in the culture media by zzso zzso zzso zzso Media from zzso cultures contained zzso zzso 83 zzso zzso zzso After zzso a zzso increase in zzso protein was seen in the culture media from zzso At zzso zzso the zzso protein content was zzso zzso zzso zzso or 23 times the zzso zzso This protein release could be inhibited by zzso when the cells were zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that another potent zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso cells by zzso This induction of zzso zzso began as early as zzso zzso when it reached twice zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and reached zzso zzso levels at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
