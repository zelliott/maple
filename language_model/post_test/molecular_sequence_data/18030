Until recently, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was regarded as an open corridor for the zzso movement of zzso zzso proteins from their site of membrane zzso to the zzso that ferry them from the transitional elements of the zzso to the zzso zzso Moreover, it was widely assumed that the folding and assembly of newly zzso zzso into their zzso and zzso structure is a spontaneous process that does not involve the intervention of other cellular zzso In this article we review evidence that the zzso is a highly zzso zzso that grants passage only to proteins that have attained an essentially native zzso and zzso current knowledge about resident zzso proteins that appear to facilitate and/or monitor protein folding and assembly in this zzso
