zzso and proteins differ from conventional chemical entities in their sensitivity to numerous environmental factors and their zzso to different degradation zzso zzso complex zzso zzso are necessary to characterize their molecular entity as well as to detect and zzso the possible degradation zzso The zzso of these molecules for a pharmaceutical product requires stabilization by various zzso Most of the products are brought to market as solutions or zzso In the first part, this article presents a comparison between the degradation profile of a zzso zzso and a protein zzso growth zzso in solution and as a zzso zzso The various zzso methods used to characterize and identify the degradation products are reviewed and zzso The second part contains an overview of the different zzso strategies for zzso and human growth zzso Finally, the different stress conditions used to obtain stability data are discussed zzso This leads on to general comments on the design of stability studies for zzso and protein drugs as pharmaceuticals taking into consideration the official zzso
