zzso virus is a zzso zzso of sheep whose gene expression is zzso regulated in cells of the zzso zzso Gene expression directed by the zzso virus long terminal repeat zzso is increased in infected cells by a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in part by increases in the zzso level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed to locate sequences in the zzso that regulate zzso and are responsive to viral zzso The activities of these zzso were tested by using them to drive zzso of the bacterial gene for zzso zzso in transient expression zzso Three regions located zzso and the cap site were found to be important for zzso zzso activity, and the importance of each region was found to be dependent on the cell zzso zzso responsive to viral zzso were found to be the same sequences required for zzso zzso zzso The zzso virus zzso contains six sequences that are zzso to the recognition site for cellular zzso factor zzso and a single sequence zzso to the recognition site for zzso factor zzso Both of these classes of binding sites appear to be important for regulating the zzso level of zzso of zzso zzso The zzso site most zzso to the zzso box was found to be one target for viral zzso The zzso virus promoter was found to be activated by zzso this serum response has also been mapped to the zzso sequences in the zzso
