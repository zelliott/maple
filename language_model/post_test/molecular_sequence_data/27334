zzso and efficient recognition of zzso sites during zzso zzso is essential for proper zzso zzso zzso site usage can be modulated by secondary structures, but it is unclear if this type of zzso is commonly used or occurs to a significant degree with secondary structures forming over long zzso Using zzso comparisons of zzso sequences among 12 zzso zzso we zzso a group of 202 highly zzso pairs of zzso each at least nine zzso long, capable of forming stable stem zzso This set was highly enriched in alternatively spliced zzso and zzso with weak zzso sites and long zzso and most occurred over long distances zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso of several of these zzso using zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns were changed by zzso that opened the stem structure, and restored by zzso zzso that zzso the zzso potential, demonstrating that these secondary structures were indeed implicated in the zzso site zzso zzso the zzso structures masked zzso sites, brought together distant zzso sites and/or zzso out zzso Thus, zzso interactions within zzso even those occurring over long zzso are more frequent zzso of alternative zzso than is currently zzso
