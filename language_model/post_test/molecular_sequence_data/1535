We recently developed a specific zzso zzso from zzso rabbits to zzso zzso protein that was expressed zzso and inhibited reverse zzso and viral zzso The zzso of zzso overcomes the innate zzso activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso G to A zzso in the viral zzso resulting in enhancement of viral replication zzso Here, we have developed a minimal scaffold zzso zzso with zzso properties derived from zzso zzso zzso that was engineered to mimic zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso by its interface for the light chain variable domain zzso was prevented through zzso acid zzso in framework 2 and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that all constructed zzso zzso zzso preserve the zzso activity and specificity in the absence of the parent zzso zzso However, only the most highly zzso zzso had high levels of zzso zzso The expression in zzso cells showed that zzso zzso could correctly fold as soluble proteins in the reducing zzso The results demonstrated an excellent correlation between improvements in protein zzso with gradually increasing zzso zzso zzso efficiently bound zzso protein and neutralized its zzso enhancing function, by reducing late reverse transcripts and zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was shown to be zzso with zzso effects only in cells zzso that require zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, cell specificity of zzso zzso was correlated with an increase of zzso which zzso viral zzso The present study strongly suggests that zzso of rabbit zzso zzso is a potentially useful approach for engineering zzso for gene zzso
