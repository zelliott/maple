The relevance of functional zzso acids for zzso transport by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso from 28 zzso zzso of the rat liver zzso clone was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated in five zzso zzso charged zzso acids zzso and zzso which were present in nine members of the zzso in two zzso zzso charged zzso zzso in all eight zzso and in two zzso from a protein zzso C consensus region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids were zzso zzso and zzso which were found to be essential for the maintenance of zzso acid zzso zzso is located in the large zzso loop III, whereas zzso and zzso are located in the large zzso loop zzso Four zzso of zzso from the zzso of the zzso by zzso or zzso showed no effects on zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso motif into several transport negative point zzso demonstrated that all zzso proteins besides one were present within the cell membrane of the zzso and provided proof that an zzso zzso has not caused transport zzso by these zzso zzso The latter was observed only with the transport negative zzso zzso In conclusion, loop zzso acids are required for zzso zzso zzso by the zzso
