A second member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso was identified in a human lung zzso zzso The gene zzso a protein named zzso that has 131 zzso acid zzso and a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso comparison showed zzso identity to zzso coli zzso and zzso identity to human zzso zzso within a zzso region of 87 or 120 zzso acid zzso zzso In comparison to the zzso coli zzso zzso possesses a zzso extension of 41 zzso acid zzso This extension does not contain a zzso II zzso motif typical of the known zzso zzso The zzso does not accelerate the zzso to trans zzso of zzso with side zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso In contrast, it showed preference of an zzso zzso adjacent zzso to zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed expression of the gene within various human zzso like heart, zzso liver, kidney and zzso
