The classical concept of zzso binding is defined as an exclusive and zzso interaction with one zzso The emerging reality about zzso combing sites, however, is that some can bind unrelated zzso The studies presented here define this quality as zzso recognition zzso by analyzing the capacity of zzso human zzso to bind sets of overlapping peptides zzso the complete structures of T cell zzso zzso alpha and beta chains and zzso zzso zzso We assessed the binding of these zzso zzso zzso to a set of zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso segments of human zzso gene products, a major zzso used in the selection of the zzso We present data on the binding characteristics of four human zzso selected for the ability to bind zzso zzso These zzso are zzso molecules with zzso and zzso sequences in zzso zzso but have diverse zzso zzso zzso These studies aim to characterize the property of zzso zzso and show that the relationship between the binding site and its zzso is a complex interaction and unpredictable from zzso sequence zzso Our results support the conclusion that zzso recognition zzso is a genuine feature of zzso and zzso zzso
