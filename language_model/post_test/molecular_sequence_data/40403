zzso partition of zzso zzso at cell division requires zzso attachment to opposite poles of zzso zzso zzso Any defects in this regulation bring about zzso instability, which may accelerate zzso progression in zzso To achieve zzso zzso at zzso the zzso passenger complex zzso composed of zzso zzso Aurora B and regulatory components zzso zzso and zzso must be localized to zzso to zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso changes the zzso zzso the regulation of zzso targeting is largely zzso Here we isolated a zzso zzso zzso B zzso defective specifically in zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso (also known as zzso zzso of zzso Preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting as well as zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso suppresses the zzso zzso in the zzso B zzso zzso zzso promotes direct binding with zzso which we now define as a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso In human cells, the zzso of zzso has a comparable zzso Thus, our study resolves the zzso mechanisms of zzso targeting to zzso highlighting a key role of zzso B in zzso zzso
