zzso muscular zzso zzso is an zzso dominant late onset zzso disease zzso by zzso muscle zzso zzso and swallowing zzso The only zzso zzso described to date is a zzso repeat expansion consisting of two to seven additional base triplets in a repeat sequence in zzso 1 of the zzso binding protein nuclear 1 zzso zzso This results in an increase in length of a zzso tract in the zzso protein from 10 to zzso zzso 

zzso of another zzso in a case of zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso 1 of the zzso gene was undertaken on 202 patients referred for a possible diagnosis of zzso but negative for the zzso repeat expansion zzso 

A case was identified with typical symptoms of zzso negative for the repeat expansion zzso but with a zzso zzso in zzso close to the 3' end of the normal zzso zzso repeat zzso 

The single base zzso changes a zzso zzso to an zzso zzso and results in an increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso This mimics the effect of the common zzso repeat expansion zzso and represents a previously zzso mechanism of zzso
