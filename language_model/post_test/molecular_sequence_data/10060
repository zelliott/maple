The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso protein zzso binds specifically to the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso thereby blocking zzso and zzso by TAP and subsequent loading of peptides onto zzso class I molecules in the zzso zzso In consequence, zzso cells are masked for immune recognition by zzso zzso To investigate the molecular details of this, so far, unique zzso interaction, the active domain and critical zzso acid zzso were identified by using short overlapping fragments and systematic deletions of the viral zzso A zzso of 32 zzso acid zzso zzso was found to be the minimal region harboring an activity to inhibit zzso to TAP comparable to the action of the full-length protein and therefore representing the active zzso Further N or zzso zzso cause an abrupt loss in zzso Within the identified active domain, various zzso and zzso of zzso derived from zzso and zzso helped to identify zzso acid zzso critical for TAP zzso On the basis of these results, therapeutic drugs could be designed that are zzso in treatment of zzso rejection or in novel vaccination strategies against zzso restoring the ability of the immune system to recognize zzso zzso
