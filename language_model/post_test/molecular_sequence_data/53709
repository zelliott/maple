A zzso designated zzso coding for a zzso zzso involved in zzso gene expression has been cloned from zzso zzso by screening for a clone that enabled to reverse the reduced expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso acid zzso of a putative zzso protein carrying a zinc zzso cluster motif zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso showed a significant restricted growth on starch medium and produced little of the zzso zzso including zzso and zzso compared with a zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso gene involved in zzso efficient expression of the zzso genes in zzso zzso In addition, sequencing analysis found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are clustered on a zzso DNA zzso of the largest zzso in zzso zzso and that zzso is about zzso zzso upstream of zzso and transcribed in the opposite zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene was expressed in the presence of zzso comparable to the level in the presence of zzso while the zzso genes were transcribed at high levels only in the presence of zzso
