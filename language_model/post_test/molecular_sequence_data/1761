The zzso zzso surface proteins of zzso B virus zzso and other zzso contain a zzso zzso in their zzso domain, which is essential for the zzso of viral zzso Recently, we also found zzso in the zzso domain of M protein from zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso motif is not zzso in all zzso of zzso the zzso patterns of zzso zzso A and C were zzso zzso zzso were released from zzso zzso zzso particles by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and identified by zzso acid and zzso sequence analysis as well as zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso sequential zzso zzso in combination with zzso demonstrating the presence of partially zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso sequential zzso zzso in combination with zzso The zzso domain of M protein and, to a minor extent, of L zzso protein from zzso zzso C and D was partially zzso by zzso or zzso at zzso within a zzso sequence zzso zzso A, containing no zzso at position 37 or 38, was not zzso zzso data further revealed that M protein is mostly zzso zzso in all examined zzso and that the terminal zzso is partially zzso The findings may be relevant for the zzso and the zzso of zzso
