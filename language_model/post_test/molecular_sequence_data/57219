The indirect flight muscles of zzso are adapted for rapid zzso movements which depend on properties of the zzso apparatus zzso Flight muscles are stretch activated and the frequency of contraction in these muscles is independent of the rate of nerve zzso Little is known about the molecular basis of these zzso We now report a novel protein that is found only in flight muscles and has, therefore, been named zzso Although we detect only one gene (in zzso region zzso for zzso this protein has several zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso appear to be created by zzso zzso A subset of these zzso is absent in newly emerged adults but appears when the adult develops the ability to zzso In intact muscles zzso is associated with the A band of the zzso where evidence suggests it interacts with the zzso zzso Computer database searches do not reveal extensive similarity to any known zzso However, the zzso 12 zzso show similarity to the zzso sequence of zzso a region that interacts with zzso These features suggest a role for zzso in the regulation of contraction, possibly by modulating zzso zzso
