Analysis of seven zzso zzso gene zzso in B zzso from a zzso bovine zzso revealed an extensive zzso zzso region 3 zzso length variation zzso zzso Indeed, the global zzso size zzso of zzso zzso zzso substantiated such an extensive zzso and was comparable with that noted in peripheral B zzso of adult zzso These observations are in contrast to species such as humans with extensive zzso zzso capability where shorter zzso length is noted early during zzso zzso zzso long zzso (as in adult zzso was noted in two zzso zzso zzso zzso by a single zzso zzso zzso Further, two zzso genes zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso is remarkable for repetitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that zzso the recruitment of zzso zzso It appears that closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso used in the zzso reading frame, zzso varying zzso lengths early during zzso zzso in zzso A comparison of zzso and expressed zzso zzso especially in the zzso and zzso confirms that zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso zzso diversification in zzso The biased zzso base use and high occurrence of zzso zzso zzso AG zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso zzso Overall, these observations suggest that extensive zzso length zzso including the generation of exceptionally long zzso (up to 56 zzso zzso and zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso diversification in zzso The extensive zzso length zzso early during the zzso development may compensate for constraints imposed on zzso diversification zzso to the limited zzso sequence diversity of genetic elements in zzso
