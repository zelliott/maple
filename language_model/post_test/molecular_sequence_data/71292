zzso zzso are monitored for errors that arise during gene expression by a mechanism called zzso zzso with the result that most zzso that cannot be translated along their full length are rapidly zzso This ensures that truncated proteins are seldom made, reducing the zzso of rogue proteins that might be zzso The zzso leading to accelerated zzso zzso is referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso The proteins that catalyze steps in zzso in zzso serve two roles, one to monitor errors in gene expression and the other to control the abundance of zzso zzso zzso as part of the normal repertoire of gene zzso The zzso zzso has a direct impact on hundreds of genetic disorders in the human population, where about a quarter of all known zzso are predicted to trigger zzso
