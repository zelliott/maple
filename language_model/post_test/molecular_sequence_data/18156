Using an zzso zzso zzso zzso employing two zzso zzso recognizing distinct zzso on the zzso 2 zzso zzso alpha chain zzso zzso we previously demonstrated that activated zzso release a soluble zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso is zzso and structurally related to zzso but its precise origin and functional role remain to be zzso We report here that a single zzso zzso is sufficient to direct the synthesis of both zzso and soluble released zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso lines revealed the presence of zzso species zzso for by known zzso termination or internal zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso zzso studies failed to detect alternately spliced zzso transcripts that specifically lack zzso or zzso zzso and which may zzso a zzso zzso zzso Therefore zzso does not appear to be the product of a unique zzso zzso zzso In the absence of any zzso zzso zzso is most likely generated by zzso zzso and release of cell surface zzso This zzso release of zzso may be but one example of a common cellular mechanism for regulating the membrane expression of cell surface zzso
