zzso zzso and zzso are zzso end point zzso derived from the same zzso pathway, which is found in several zzso zzso Recently, an ST gene zzso containing approximately 25 distinct genes that are each proposed to function specifically in ST zzso has been identified in zzso zzso Each of these structural genes is named zzso zzso followed by a consecutive letter of the zzso We have previously described zzso (formerly zzso as zzso a zzso required for the conversion of zzso A to zzso We now describe a second zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso that is located within 2 zzso of zzso in the ST gene zzso An zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso was unable to produce ST and converted zzso precursors to zzso A rather than zzso indicating that zzso functions at the same point in the zzso as zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso shows that it encodes a zzso zzso zzso and constitutes a novel zzso family, zzso Assuming that zzso activity mimics that of similar zzso it is likely that zzso zzso one of the proposed zzso steps necessary to convert zzso A to zzso These results constitute the first genetic proof that the conversion of zzso A to ST requires more than one zzso zzso
