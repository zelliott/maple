The crystal structure of zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso The binding of a zzso affinity inhibitor confirms the active site location in the zzso zzso this domain is similar to that of zzso zzso and shares the zzso zzso zzso A zzso mechanism is proposed that illuminates the unique chemical strategy for the zzso of zzso and man-made zzso zzso for zzso and zzso Surprisingly, a vestigial active site is found in the zzso domain similar to that of another zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the vestigial active site does not participate in zzso zzso the vestigial domain plays a critical structural role by stabilizing the zzso in a distinctive zzso zzso Given the genetic and structural relationships among these zzso of zzso zzso a zzso evolutionary sequence is zzso
