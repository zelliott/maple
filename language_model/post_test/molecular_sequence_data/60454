The zzso zzso zzso is a universal and potent inhibitor of zzso bond formation and selectively acts on several human zzso It binds to the zzso zzso at an unknown site, in the presence of an zzso donor zzso zzso which it zzso on the zzso Its site of action was investigated by inducing a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso on irradiating with low energy ultraviolet light (at 365 zzso The zzso was localized exclusively to the universally zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso loop region of zzso zzso by using a combination of a primer extension approach, zzso H zzso analysis, and zzso with radioactive zzso zzso of several zzso zzso modified near the zzso group, implicated the modified zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The yield of the zzso zzso was weak in the presence of zzso zzso and strong in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso which, as was shown earlier, increases the accessibility of zzso on the zzso We zzso that both zzso and its induced zzso switch are critically important both for the zzso transfer reaction and for zzso zzso This supposition is reinforced by the observation that other antibiotics that can prevent zzso bond formation in zzso zzso to different degrees, formation of the zzso
