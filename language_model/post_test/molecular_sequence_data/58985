zzso zzso is required for the onset of zzso We show that protein zzso by protein zzso 1 zzso is also essential for initiating zzso in zzso zzso zzso may directly or indirectly regulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso is shown to be zzso at the zzso upon the onset of zzso for zzso zzso a novel zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso that the gene dosage increase can relieve the requirement for zzso and the zzso for the onset of zzso The zzso gene is not essential for cell zzso but a zzso with the gene deleted cannot form colonies at 22 and 36 degrees zzso In the zzso deletion zzso the progression of zzso and zzso is retarded and cell shape is zzso These defects are overcome by plasmids carrying the genes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso These results demonstrate functions other than promoting zzso for the components of the zzso zzso and also a close functional relationship of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
