The zzso gene is a zzso regulatory gene for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso It acts as a negative regulator in the presence of excess zzso and as a positive regulator with limited zzso through modification of zzso zzso We constructed several zzso zzso with various deletions in the zzso regions, which were regulated by the zzso hybrid zzso The zzso and zzso proteins that lack the 83 and 158 zzso zzso zzso respectively, retained the positive function for the expression of zzso that codes for alkaline zzso but lacked the negative zzso The zzso protein that lacks the 262 zzso zzso acids was deficient in both zzso An zzso against zzso protein was zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso zzso obtained by differential zzso indicated that the intact zzso and zzso proteins are located in the inner membrane and zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso protein is anchored to the zzso membrane by the zzso zzso
