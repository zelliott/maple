The recent finding that several point zzso in the gene zzso for the zzso protein zzso correlate with neurological disorders has heightened interest in the mechanisms of zzso of this zzso In this study the functional consequences of the zzso zzso zzso on the interaction of the protein with zzso have been zzso zzso zzso is less zzso than its normal counterpart at zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso protein is unable to bind to zzso and, as a consequence, zzso assembled after transient zzso treatment in the presence of this zzso zzso contain only unmodified zzso and appear to form more and longer zzso than those assembled in the presence of zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso to zzso could accumulate in the zzso
