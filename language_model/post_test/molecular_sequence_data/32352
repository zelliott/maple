Novel diagnostic tools are needed to diagnose zzso infection and to provide biologically meaningful surrogate markers to define cellular immune responses against zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently been developed in addition to the more than 100-year-old zzso skin test zzso for the immune diagnosis of zzso in zzso The advent of soluble zzso zzso molecules allows to zzso zzso zzso T zzso We identified novel zzso class zzso zzso zzso and used zzso zzso complexes to zzso ex zzso zzso T cells directed against the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso shared between zzso and other zzso species, and zzso T cells which recognize the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells reside predominantly in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso subset and recognize naturally processed and presented zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso T cells show similar dynamics over time in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso when compared with zzso T cells directed against the corresponding zzso zzso zzso in patients with pulmonary zzso infection and subsequent successful zzso This was not found to be true for zzso responses directed against the zzso zzso The dissection of the cellular immune response in zzso tuberculosis infection will enable novel strategies for monitoring zzso vaccine candidates and to gauge zzso T cells directed against zzso
