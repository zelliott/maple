zzso is a structural protein that is produced and retained in the cells of the inner root sheath and zzso of the hair zzso The gene for sheep zzso has been zzso and the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso determined in an attempt to increase the understanding of the structure and function of this protein in the zzso network of the hardened inner root sheath zzso zzso zzso has a molecular weight of zzso and is characterized by the presence of a high proportion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together totaling more than zzso of the zzso zzso Over zzso of zzso consists of two sets of tandem zzso repeats which are based on two different consensus zzso zzso is predicted to form an zzso zzso rod structure but does not contain the sequences required for the formation of intermediate zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contains two zzso hand zzso zzso indicating that zzso plays more than a structural role within the hair zzso In zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso is expressed in the zzso of the zzso zzso and rumen as well as in the inner root sheath and zzso of the hair zzso
