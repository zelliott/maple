We have isolated and characterized two new protein zzso C zzso genes from zzso zzso One, zzso maps to zzso region zzso and displays over zzso zzso acid sequence identity with members of a recently described zzso zzso in zzso The other, zzso maps to region zzso on the second zzso and lies within 50 zzso of zzso gene previously characterized zzso While zzso transcripts are expressed throughout development, expression of the two genes mapping at zzso location zzso is primarily in zzso zzso and the previously reported zzso gene are transcribed predominantly in brain zzso In contrast, zzso is transcribed only in zzso zzso We will discuss the significance of this zzso zzso with regard to zzso
