The stable maintenance and expression of foreign genes in zzso zzso have been difficult to achieve due to the lack of suitable zzso In this paper we show for the first time that a replicating zzso can been used to express foreign genes other than zzso resistance genes in zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso could introduce and maintain four different genes for many generations in zzso zzso One of these, zzso the dominant membrane zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso however, expression was weak, the signal zzso of zzso was not zzso and the protein was not zzso modified by fatty zzso This resulted in a zzso character of zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso zzso To increase the expression of foreign zzso random zzso zzso DNA fragments were cloned into a zzso zzso and expression signals were selected using the zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso zzso was done in zzso coli as well as directly in zzso zzso Active zzso from zzso coli were also able to express zzso activities and an zzso of native size in zzso zzso The highest activity was obtained from a zzso selected directly in zzso zzso This is the first example of a promoter sequence selected in a zzso Analysis of the putative promoters in seven clones revealed similar zzso and zzso regions, and similar zzso distances in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso related to zzso should be useful for the genetic analysis of specific zzso zzso proteins and zzso
