The zzso motif zzso is recognized zzso by two zzso zzso factors: one that is expressed zzso and referred to here as zzso and another, zzso that is expressed in zzso zzso We report the zzso cloning of the human zzso zzso which encodes zzso by screening zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso for zzso zzso DNA zzso One zzso zzso zzso expressed a zzso fusion protein with a zzso specificity indistinguishable from human zzso cell zzso zzso As expected for a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all five human and two mouse cell lines zzso zzso rabbit zzso raised against the zzso fusion protein shows that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins are related zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso open reading frame shows that the zzso activity lies within a central highly charged domain of 160 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequences reveals that this domain is nearly identical between the two zzso zzso similar zzso are also present in the zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso cell lineage gene product (see Herr et zzso zzso Within this shared zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain (pronounced zzso lie two zzso a zzso zzso box and a zzso zzso The zzso protein is unique among the zzso proteins and other zzso box proteins because it is expressed zzso
