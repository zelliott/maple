DNA regions zzso the various zzso of a protein can be expressed as separate entities by inserting at appropriate sites a zzso cassette zzso a termination zzso a zzso sequence and an initiation zzso within the structural zzso This technique has been used to obtain a zzso zzso protein designated zzso zzso the final zzso zzso of zzso A preceded by an zzso zzso zzso was correctly expressed but poorly released to the zzso zzso Its zzso involved, as a final step, a partition in zzso zzso thus demonstrating that zzso regions are exposed in this zzso The ability of zzso to form zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso was investigated and pore properties were zzso The results indicate that zzso 1-3 of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso 10 zzso are not involved in zzso zzso through the zzso However, they are important in maintaining the stability of the soluble state of the zzso zzso
