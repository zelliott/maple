zzso in zzso zzso is characterized by the coordinated surface migration of zzso zzso of highly zzso zzso swarm zzso We describe a zzso zzso zzso that was unable to swarm even though zzso cells retained normal zzso and the ability to differentiate into swarm zzso However, these zzso cells were zzso curved and had variable zzso suggesting that the migration zzso results from the inability of these zzso swarm cells to align into zzso zzso The zzso was inserted at zzso 196 of a zzso gene that lacks recognizable zzso Multiple copies of the zzso zzso called zzso for curved cell zzso restored swarming to the zzso The zzso zzso protein is predicted to span the inner membrane twice, with its zzso major domain being present in the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed both by zzso and by electron zzso of zzso zzso Two forms of zzso were identified for zzso zzso zzso they were full-length integral membrane zzso and zzso truncated peripheral membrane zzso both present at approximately zzso higher zzso in swarm zzso zzso zzso zzso cells contained zzso levels of the zzso truncated versions of both zzso zzso cells of a zzso zzso zzso were less zzso than those of zzso and were able to zzso albeit more slowly than zzso zzso The truncated zzso proteins may therefore interfere with normal zzso while the zzso zzso which are not essential for zzso may enhance migration by maintaining the zzso of highly zzso zzso zzso with this view, zzso of the zzso gene caused cells of both zzso coli and zzso zzso to become enlarged and zzso
