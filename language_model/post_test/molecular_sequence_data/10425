We cloned the mouse zzso of zzso which was recently reported as a new member of the zzso zzso The predicted molecular mass of this zzso is zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso acid sequences show high degrees of similarity with those of the zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso expression in various zzso and zzso stages by Northern zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso to the rat counterpart, mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed relatively abundantly in zzso and the zzso and at much lower levels in brain and zzso In addition, a shorter transcript zzso zzso is expressed only in zzso Considering the high similarity in primary structure between zzso and zzso zzso as zzso growth zzso zzso we also examined the gene expression of zzso during wound healing using a mouse zzso zzso zzso was highly induced 1 day after injury and decreased rapidly by 3 zzso This suggests that zzso is a primary factor in the process of wound healing similarly to other growth factors such as zzso alpha and zzso
