The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is investigated in three different zzso water, the surface of a zzso zzso zzso and the core of the zzso zzso is known to kill bacteria by forming zzso membrane zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso are found in two zzso parallel and zzso zzso known as important intermediate structural units of the active pore zzso What is not clear is the sequence of events from zzso zzso in solution to pores inside zzso The step we focus on in this work is the zzso of zzso In particular, we are interested in determining where zzso zzso is most zzso We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to determine the potential of mean force as a function of distance between two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the surface of model zzso zzso and the interior of these zzso We investigate the two known distinct modes of zzso that result in either a parallel or an zzso zzso zzso The model zzso zzso are composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso ratio zzso We find the parallel zzso zzso association to be more favorable than the zzso one in water and inside the zzso However, we observe that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is somewhat more stable than the parallel zzso association at the surface of the zzso We explore the role of hydrogen bonds and zzso bridges in zzso zzso in the three zzso zzso knowledge of how networks of zzso bridges and hydrogen bonds contribute to zzso stability is essential for the purpose of understanding the mechanism of action for zzso peptides as well as for designing peptides which can zzso membrane zzso The findings are suggestive of the dominant pathways leading from individual zzso molecules in solution to functional pores in bacterial zzso
