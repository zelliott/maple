During zzso zzso defective or unwanted egg chambers are eliminated during zzso by programmed cell zzso In addition, final zzso transport from nurse cells to the zzso depends upon zzso of the nurse zzso To study the regulation of zzso zzso we analyzed the midway zzso in which egg chambers undergo premature nurse cell death and zzso The midway gene encodes a protein similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso zzso into zzso zzso midway zzso egg chambers contain severely reduced levels of neutral lipids in the zzso zzso of midway in insect cells results in high levels of zzso activity in zzso These results show that midway encodes a functional zzso and that changes in zzso zzso metabolism disrupt normal egg chamber development in zzso
