zzso zzso zzso in sweet cherry is determined by a locus S with multiple zzso In the style, the zzso zzso for an zzso zzso ( zzso that is involved in the rejection of zzso that carries the same S zzso In this work we report the cloning and zzso DNA sequence analysis including the zzso zzso regions of four zzso of sweet cherry ( zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA from the zzso zzso Pico Colorado, zzso zzso and zzso was amplified through zzso using zzso designed in the zzso sequences of sweet cherry zzso Two zzso were amplified for each zzso and three of them zzso to three new zzso named zzso zzso and zzso present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To confirm the identity of the amplified fragments, the zzso DNA of these three putative zzso and the zzso zzso amplified in the zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The zzso and deduced zzso sequences obtained contained the structural features of zzso zzso The isolation of the zzso sequences of these four zzso revealed a zzso putative zzso box and high similarity among them downstream from that zzso However, similarity was low compared with the zzso regions of zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso sequences are highly similar, and most zzso zzso among these two zzso occur outside the zzso zzso region zzso but within another highly variable zzso The confirmation of the different specificity of these two zzso would help zzso which regions of the zzso sequences play a role in zzso specific zzso
