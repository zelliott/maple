Although the sequence zzso zzso and low toxicity of zzso zzso zzso zzso make them good zzso agents to study gene function, their limited ability to cross cell zzso limits their use in cell zzso In this paper we show that zzso to zzso peptides significantly enhanced the cellular zzso of zzso The factors that affect the zzso cellular zzso and its zzso activity toward a targeted zzso were zzso zzso studied include the number of zzso in the zzso the choice of zzso the zzso zzso position, the length of the zzso and the cell culture zzso zzso of zzso to the cell nucleus and zzso required zzso rather than zzso of peptides to zzso zzso was best suited to deliver a zzso to its target zzso resulting in the strongest zzso zzso By simply adding the zzso zzso into the cell culture medium at low zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso This particular zzso zzso was more effective than the zzso zzso to the zzso transport peptides of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or to peptides with fewer zzso zzso of zzso did not affect a zzso delivery zzso but all other factors were zzso zzso zzso provided a simple and efficient delivery of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso enhances the opportunities to evaluate gene functions in cell zzso
