The ornamental tobacco zzso zzso produces a series of zzso zzso zzso that are derived from a 43 zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso contains six highly zzso repeats that fold to generate six separate structural zzso each corresponding to one of the native zzso An unusual feature of zzso is that the structural zzso lie across adjacent repeats and that the sixth zzso domain is generated from fragments of the first and sixth zzso Although the zzso of the repeats suggests that they may have arisen from gene duplication, the observed folding does not appear to support zzso This study of the solution structure of a single zzso repeat zzso forms a basis for zzso the mechanism by which this protein may have zzso 

The three-dimensional structure of zzso closely resembles the zzso zzso beta sheet observed in each of the native zzso The zzso sequence zzso which forms the zzso between the six structural zzso in zzso exists as a zzso loop in zzso The presence of this loop in zzso results in a loss of the characteristically flat and zzso topography of the native zzso 

A single repeat from zzso is capable of folding into a compact zzso domain that displays zzso zzso zzso zzso it is possible that a similar zzso inhibitor represents the ancestral protein from which zzso zzso
