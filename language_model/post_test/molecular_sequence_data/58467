To identify and characterize novel factors required for nuclear zzso a genetic screen was conducted in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that were lethal in combination with a zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso were isolated using a zzso zzso Three zzso groups of zzso (for zzso zzso zzso were zzso In this report, the characterization of zzso is zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with striking similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso In indirect zzso and nuclear pore complex zzso experiments, zzso was associated with nuclear pore zzso zzso zzso of zzso displayed zzso of zzso zzso zzso however, nuclear protein import was not apparently zzso zzso and zzso electron microscopic analysis revealed that the nuclear pore complex and nuclear envelope structure was zzso zzso in zzso zzso Because the clusters of zzso pore complexes appeared subsequent to the export block, the structural zzso were likely indirect consequences of the export zzso Interestingly, a zzso interaction was detected between zzso and zzso the nuclear zzso signal zzso as well as zzso a nuclear export zzso zzso We propose that zzso has a novel role in zzso nuclear zzso
