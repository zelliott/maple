zzso in the mouse zzso zzso gene cause skeletal zzso hyperactivity, abnormal zzso deafness, white belly zzso and zzso of zzso duct zzso To map zzso to high resolution, we zzso two zzso Initially, we analyzed an zzso zzso to construct a detailed genetic map of simple sequence length zzso markers within a zzso region surrounding the zzso zzso zzso we analyzed a second zzso zzso segregating for the zzso zzso which positioned zzso within a zzso region between zzso and zzso A physical zzso of zzso clones spanning the zzso critical region was constructed, and eight potential zzso candidate genes were excluded by genetic or physical zzso Together these results lay the foundation for zzso cloning of the zzso zzso
