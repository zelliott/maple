Two transcripts coding for proteins zzso to zzso were identified by massive sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis revealed that the zzso acids important for zzso activity including zzso activity and the binding of calcium and zzso were well zzso in these zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso The resulting protein efficiently zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso in a zzso zzso Further, the zzso protein inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that this zzso protein plays an important role in the zzso process in zzso zzso Its unique zzso activity makes the zzso zzso an attractive candidate as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso zzso as well as a zzso for a wide variety of research zzso
