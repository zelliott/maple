Acute stress provokes lethal cardiac zzso in the zzso long zzso zzso Here we provide a novel molecular mechanism linking zzso signaling and altered human zzso related gene zzso channel zzso Stress stimulates zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso that can regulate zzso zzso channels both directly and via zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso We show that zzso associates with zzso to zzso zzso effects upon zzso The binding of zzso occurs simultaneously at the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso an effect that requires zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The interaction also zzso the lifetime of the zzso state of the channel by shielding the zzso from cellular zzso The net result is a zzso of the effect of zzso stimulation upon zzso zzso Thus, zzso interactions with zzso may provide a unique mechanism for plasticity in the control of membrane zzso and cardiac zzso
