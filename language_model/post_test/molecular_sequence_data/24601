The mature human zzso virus type 1 zzso rapidly folds into an zzso active stable zzso exhibiting an intricate interplay between structure formation and zzso We now show by zzso and zzso equilibrium studies that a zzso zzso containing the zzso substitution zzso within the highly zzso zzso sequence forms a zzso with a fold similar to a single zzso of the zzso However, binding of the inhibitor zzso to zzso produces a stable zzso zzso Based on the crystal structure and our zzso results, we zzso that loss of specific interactions involving the side chain of zzso zzso zzso by zzso the inner zzso zzso zzso zzso from each zzso a region that is sandwiched between the two zzso formed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the mature zzso We systematically examined the zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso deletions of either one of the terminal regions zzso zzso or zzso or zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso were found to contribute to zzso stability, our results indicate that the inner zzso strands are absolutely essential for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fold and regions critical for zzso may aid in the rational design of novel zzso of the zzso to overcome the problem of drug zzso
