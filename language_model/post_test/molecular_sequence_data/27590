Upon modification of zzso zzso at zzso groups with zzso zzso four zzso and four zzso derivatives have been zzso zzso of the zzso zzso group led to zzso decrease of toxicity in zzso zzso of the toxin with either zzso or two out of three zzso zzso zzso modified showed a zzso drop in toxicity as compared with the native zzso zzso caused a 30 to zzso decrease in zzso the zzso zzso group being modified in all the zzso As assessed by circular zzso method, the modification of zzso groups, except for zzso one, affected secondary structure of the zzso The data suggest the zzso zzso group to be essential for toxicity of zzso
