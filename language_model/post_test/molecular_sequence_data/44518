The role of zzso 6, which forms the major portion of the most zzso expansion segment of zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by in zzso zzso zzso zzso that increased the size of the zzso part and/or the loop, even to a relatively small extent, abolished zzso zzso formation almost zzso zzso zzso zzso and an abnormal zzso precursor species zzso zzso units containing these zzso did not support cell zzso A deletion removing zzso 6 almost completely, on the other hand, had a much less severe effect on the formation of zzso zzso and cells expressing only the zzso zzso remained able to grow, albeit at a much reduced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso base pair by a single point zzso did not cause a noticeable reduction in the level of zzso zzso but did result in a twofold lower growth rate of the zzso This effect could not be reversed by introduction of a second point zzso that restores base zzso We conclude that both the primary and the secondary structure of zzso 6 play an important role in the formation and the biological function of the zzso zzso
