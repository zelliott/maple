The exported proteins of zzso tuberculosis that are localized at the bacterial cell surface or zzso into the environment are zzso situated to interact with host factors and to function in zzso In this study, we constructed a novel zzso reporter zzso and used it directly in zzso tuberculosis for zzso identification of exported zzso From 177 zzso zzso zzso we identified 111 different exported zzso The majority of these proteins have no known function, and for nearly half of the zzso our demonstration that they are exported when fused to a zzso reporter is the first experimental proof of their zzso zzso The zzso zzso in our banked library were of further value as a collection of zzso lacking individual exported zzso By individually testing each of 111 zzso for growth in zzso six attenuated zzso with insertions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Given that much of the zzso tuberculosis zzso encodes proteins of unknown function, our library of mapped zzso zzso is a valuable resource for efforts in functional zzso This work also demonstrates the power of a zzso reporter zzso that could be applied similarly to other bacterial zzso
