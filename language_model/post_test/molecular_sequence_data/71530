We have cloned the promoter regions of the genes for the mouse and human zzso zzso of the type A receptors for zzso acid zzso For the zzso the two major zzso start sites were at zzso (by zzso and zzso as established by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and primer zzso This zzso places the start zzso at zzso There was no zzso or zzso zzso Both mouse and human sequences have a candidate zzso zzso element zzso site in the first zzso zzso in zzso We made assorted zzso zzso zzso zzso starting from a core extending from zzso to zzso varying sizes at both ends, and including and excluding the putative zzso and more zzso zzso These were tested by transient zzso in several zzso and zzso cell zzso Both zzso and zzso downstream elements appeared to help direct expression to zzso cells, the zzso in the zzso by repression in zzso and a zzso portion of the zzso untranslated region starting at zzso (named zzso by zzso promoting expression in zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso factor for zzso reduced reporter expression in zzso cells for zzso containing the zzso in two zzso In gel mobility shift zzso the mouse zzso zzso and a consensus zzso both bound in zzso translated zzso very similarly, and the zzso gave the same major shifted band with the mouse zzso zzso as was observed with nuclear zzso
