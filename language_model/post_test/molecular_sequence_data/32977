The zzso status and species number of the zzso zzso have rapidly changed in the last zzso In this study, two new zzso zzso strains isolated from traditional balsamic vinegar, zzso zzso and zzso were investigated to zzso their zzso relationships with zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence approach was zzso including regions of the zzso repeat zzso two internal transcribed zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and two nuclear genes zzso and zzso Cloning and sequence analysis of zzso zzso revealed that these strains bear an unusual zzso for this zzso Three highly divergent zzso sequences were zzso one identical to zzso zzso the other two showing some zzso to zzso zzso zzso and gene number zzso was also observed for the zzso nuclear genes zzso and zzso as two copies for each gene different from those found in zzso zzso were zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso domain showed that zzso and zzso have only one type of zzso sequence statistically different from that of zzso zzso The findings obtained in this work suggest that the zzso background of strains zzso and zzso is different from the other zzso zzso We speculated that they could belong to a new putative species related to zzso zzso
