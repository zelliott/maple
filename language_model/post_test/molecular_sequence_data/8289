zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that contains a coupled zzso site and zzso the zzso reduction of zzso to zzso An expression system which produced zzso active spinach zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli was developed in order to study the zzso relationships of the coupled active site using zzso zzso The spinach zzso zzso without the sequences zzso the zzso transit zzso was expressed as a zzso fusion containing five additional zzso acids at the zzso The expressed zzso in zzso cultures was mostly zzso and zzso After zzso growth conditions, active zzso represented zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso approximately zzso to zzso as indicated by zzso gel zzso The expressed zzso zzso was recognized by rabbit zzso zzso zzso as zzso by Western zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso zzso was identical to authentic spinach zzso with a zzso and alpha band at zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and a zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso to the oxidized zzso preparation produced the characteristic shifts in the zzso The specific activity for the zzso zzso reduction of zzso of zzso zzso zzso was 100 zzso and the zzso determined for zzso was zzso zzso which are in agreement with reported values for this zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is fully comparable to spinach zzso in zzso zzso activity, and physical zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
