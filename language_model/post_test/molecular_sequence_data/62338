zzso zzso the transmission of gene expression states from parent to daughter cells, often involves zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso is a frequent component of zzso zzso Failure to transmit faithfully a zzso or an zzso state of zzso can lead to altered zzso in plants and zzso A central unresolved question in zzso concerns the mechanisms by which a locus maintains, or changes, its state of zzso zzso We developed zzso zzso to analyze these zzso This method reveals the extent of zzso symmetry between the complementary strands of individual DNA zzso Using zzso zzso we determined the zzso of zzso transmission in the zzso island of the zzso gene in human zzso For the zzso zzso island of this zzso characteristic of zzso zzso we estimate a maintenance zzso efficiency of approximately zzso per site per cell zzso For de zzso zzso efficiency zzso remarkably different estimates were obtained for the zzso zzso island zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso island on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results clarify the mechanisms by which the alternative zzso and zzso states of zzso islands are zzso maintained through many cell zzso We also analyzed a region of human zzso zzso zzso These zzso data provide accurate zzso patterns for the complementary strand of each repeat sequence zzso zzso zzso will be a powerful tool in studying other processes for which genetic or zzso information differs on the two complementary strands of zzso
