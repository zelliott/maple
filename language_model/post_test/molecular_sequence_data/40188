Minority zzso in the zzso zzso of viral zzso may differ in relative zzso Here, we report experiments designed to evaluate the contribution of relative fitness to selection by a zzso zzso zzso zzso We have reconstructed a zzso disease virus zzso zzso with two matched pairs of distinguishable zzso zzso as minority zzso of the zzso zzso Each zzso of a pair differs from the other by zzso or zzso in relative zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of virus populations selected with different zzso of zzso in infections in liquid culture medium has documented a dominance of the high fitness counterpart in the selected zzso zzso development as a function of increasing concentration of the zzso has shown that each zzso of a matched pair yielded the same number of zzso although the high fitness zzso required less time for plaque formation, and attained a larger plaque size at any given zzso This result documents equal intrinsic resistance to the zzso of each zzso of a matched pair, confirming previous zzso zzso and genetic studies, which indicated that the zzso of each zzso pair were indistinguishable regarding zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, relative viral fitness can influence in a significant way the repertoire of viral zzso selected from a viral zzso by a zzso zzso We discuss the significance of these results in relation to zzso selection, and to other selective forces likely encountered by viral zzso in zzso
