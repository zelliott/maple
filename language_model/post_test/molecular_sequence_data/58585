Random amplification of zzso DNA zzso was evaluated for its ability to differentiate zzso strains from various zzso Under defined conditions zzso using a zzso primer zzso produced a series of amplification products able to zzso distinguish strains representing 20 different zzso of zzso zzso zzso also proved capable of discrimination between some but not all zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso typing proving to be most zzso for the latter zzso Cloning of fragments into a zzso allowed sequencing and database searching for identification of fragments and an indication of criteria for primer template interaction in zzso Southern zzso using a zzso probe allowed identification of related bands between zzso zzso These observations demonstrate the potential of rapid molecular typing by zzso for the zzso typing of zzso zzso
