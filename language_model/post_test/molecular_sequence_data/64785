zzso plays a pivotal role during assembly of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two zzso that engage in an zzso interaction that can be disrupted by the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we describe a novel human zzso zzso zzso two point zzso in the highly zzso zzso charged cluster zzso This zzso zzso zzso exhibits an enhanced affinity in its zzso interaction when compared with zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso displays a significantly reduced affinity for zzso However, its ability to complex with zzso protein at a model promoter is equivalent to that of zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso is able to support high order zzso complex assembly in the absence of an zzso zzso though, an zzso fails to recruit the zzso zzso to the zzso Taken together, our results show that a zzso zzso change is critical for the formation of zzso zzso zzso
