zzso zzso zzso has been studied for many decades, but only recently structural data have been zzso making it possible to simulate its molecular zzso In the present study, zzso properties of zzso are investigated theoretically using zzso calculations and zzso following pH zzso via zzso zzso properties are determined for several structural models, including an ensemble of zzso structures obtained at low zzso The changes in zzso forces upon changes in zzso strength, zzso zzso constant, and pH are calculated and compared with zzso zzso are zzso for all zzso sites and compared with zzso zzso zzso The analysis of theoretical and experimental results suggests that zzso there may be more than one binding sites for zzso charged zzso zzso at low pH the core of the zzso is more compact than observed in the structures obtained via restrained molecular dynamics from zzso data, but loop and terminal regions must be zzso
