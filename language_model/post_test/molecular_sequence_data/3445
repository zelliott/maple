We have previously shown that zzso deprivation activates zzso transport in a zzso and protein zzso fashion in zzso zzso a mouse cell zzso zzso with this is loss of zzso Because zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso degradation, we have examined its regulation to determine the relationship between transport zzso and zzso zzso We first cloned the zzso zzso zzso and found sequence similarity to rat and human liver zzso Because the mouse liver zzso zzso sequence was zzso we cloned this zzso as well and showed zzso identity between mouse zzso and liver zzso A zzso zzso transcript was readily observed in total zzso isolated from mouse liver or zzso by Northern zzso analysis but, surprisingly, not in either total or zzso selected zzso from zzso zzso To evaluate regulation in zzso zzso we amplified zzso zzso from total zzso using zzso zzso zzso but found that expression did not change in response to zzso zzso protein levels did not change zzso However, zzso zzso activity from zzso cells was significantly elevated relative to controls, due to an increase in the zzso form of zzso zzso Finally, we zzso zzso to determine its direct influence on the zzso transport zzso These results were negative, which suggests that the zzso control of zzso transport and zzso occurs independently despite kinetic similarities in transport zzso and zzso zzso
