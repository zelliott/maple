zzso zzso expression can be detected in only a small percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso acutely and zzso infected with zzso zzso virus zzso in which the zzso reporter gene was placed zzso of the zzso associated transcript zzso promoter at the zzso zzso However, DNA zzso suggests that a larger percentage of cells is infected than is expressing zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism involved in regulation of genes expressed from the zzso promoter in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were employed to determine on a zzso basis zzso gene expression both at the zzso and protein zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso construct in zzso strain zzso it was found that there were zzso more cells positive for zzso transcript than cells positive for zzso zzso in acutely infected zzso zzso and a zzso difference in zzso infected zzso zzso Thus, there is a zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso infected cells during acute and zzso infection, and the zzso reporter gene activity does not faithfully compare the zzso promoter activity between acute and zzso infected zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed in mice acutely infected with a virus in which 140 zzso of the zzso promoter sequences zzso the zzso element were replaced by zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso zzso This construct showed a correlation between zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso in acute and zzso zzso These findings suggest that sequences at the zzso end of the zzso transcript influence translation of the zzso zzso
