zzso zzso studies have shown that when a zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso zzso interacts with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso involves the whole length of the zzso zzso of zzso reduced the affinity of the zzso for the pump by predominantly affecting the interaction with the zzso zzso of zzso In the zzso zzso weakened interaction occurs with zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso is shown to interact with a zzso corresponding to zzso zzso located in the zzso region of zzso and related zzso This interaction involves the zzso regions of both peptides and zzso to that affected by zzso The data provide direct structural evidence for complex formation involving zzso zzso of zzso They also suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso separate segments of the zzso domain of zzso with the zzso of zzso associated with a region other than that corresponding to zzso
