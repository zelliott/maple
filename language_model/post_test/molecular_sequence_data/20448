The zzso incorporation of zzso into nascent zzso by zzso the zzso stop zzso occurs in all zzso of zzso In zzso this event requires at least three specific factors: zzso binding protein 2 zzso a specific translation zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso element in zzso zzso While the zzso relationships of zzso families and the evolution of zzso usage are well zzso the evolutionary history of zzso binding proteins has not been zzso 

In this report we present a zzso of the zzso zzso binding protein family which includes zzso and a related protein we zzso term zzso Here we show that zzso is an zzso zzso in zzso and is the only form of zzso binding protein in zzso zzso suggesting a key role in zzso incorporation in these organisms, but an zzso fusion protein is unable to support zzso incorporation in zzso An in-depth zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso binding domain suggests an ancestral relationship with zzso protein zzso In addition, we describe the emergence of a motif upstream of the zzso zzso binding domain that shares significant similarity with a motif within the zzso zzso zzso 

Our analysis suggests that zzso binding proteins arose once in evolution but zzso significantly in multiple zzso In addition, likely due to a gene zzso event in the early zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso
