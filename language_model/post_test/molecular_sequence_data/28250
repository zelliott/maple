The proposed zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso is unstable due to a weak stem III and therefore is unable to mediate zzso A zzso structure with greater theoretical stability has been shown to mediate the zzso of this zzso zzso et zzso 1988, Nature zzso zzso We have found that the zzso zzso zzso reaction of a 40 base zzso containing the zzso sequence zzso zzso can be converted to a zzso reaction by increasing the size of stem III and/or of its loop, thereby enabling a zzso structure to zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can act in trans to mediate the zzso of a full-length zzso by the formation of a partial zzso zzso
