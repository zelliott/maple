In a zzso compartment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins such as zzso Y zzso are actively sorted away from the zzso zzso and transported to the zzso via a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein sorting zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso zzso and zzso markers in an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene has been cloned and found to zzso a 48 zzso protein which belongs to the protein family of zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso and shown to exhibit an zzso zzso zzso A single zzso acid change within the AAA motif of zzso yielded a protein that lacked zzso activity and did not complement the protein sorting or zzso defects of the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, when expressed at normal levels in zzso cells, the zzso zzso gene acted as a zzso zzso The zzso characterization of a zzso zzso zzso showed that the immediate consequence of loss of zzso function is a zzso in zzso protein zzso In this zzso precursor zzso was not zzso but instead accumulated in an zzso zzso presumably the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that upon temperature shift, exaggerated stacks of curved zzso zzso zzso zzso also accumulated in the zzso zzso Based on these and other zzso we propose that zzso function is required for efficient transport out of the zzso zzso
