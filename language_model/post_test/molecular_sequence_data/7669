In recent years, a variety of chronic degenerative diseases that mainly involve brain, heart and muscle have been shown to result from zzso in zzso DNA zzso A zzso deletion zzso also known as the common zzso is the most frequent zzso in patients with zzso zzso A low percentage of zzso is also found in various zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso of this deletion as well as other zzso deletions and point zzso is thought to contribute to normal cell zzso We examined blood and bone zzso samples of 63 zzso normal patients undergoing zzso for cardiac zzso Using zzso zzso which favors the amplification of molecules carrying large zzso we detected the common deletion in 22 zzso of the zzso In one of the zzso a zzso unknown zzso deletion was identified zzso zzso In each sample the percentage of zzso was very low, since detection always required zzso zzso of a primary zzso zzso Because zzso molecules with large deletions are known to be progressively enriched through their tendency to replicate more rapidly than full-size zzso the small amount of zzso detected is likely to be concentrated in a small fraction of zzso The common deletion was not zzso in 20 patients with zzso syndromes zzso 20 patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso and 10 patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso The seeming paradox of zzso of zzso in zzso normal individuals and its absence in zzso zzso disorders is explained by varying selection against zzso stem cells harboring the common zzso zzso appears to be effective under circumstances of zzso stress zzso among continuously zzso stem cells in zzso zzso whereas in normal zzso zzso affected stem cells persist because they are rarely recruited into cell cycle and can thus tolerate zzso zzso
