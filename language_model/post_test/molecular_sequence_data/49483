The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene is a member of the large family of G zzso receptors zzso that mediate multiple signal zzso zzso The third zzso loop of zzso has been identified as a likely site of interaction with G zzso To determine the extent of allowed zzso within this loop, we subjected a stretch of 21 zzso acids zzso to intensive random zzso and screened multiply zzso zzso for zzso zzso The 91 partially functional zzso zzso that were recovered contained 96 unique zzso acid zzso Every position in this region can be replaced with at least two other types of zzso acids without a significant effect on zzso The tolerance for zzso zzso indicates that zzso of the G protein by zzso receptors involves multiple zzso interactions that do not strongly depend on particular sequence zzso Many of the functional zzso zzso exhibit greater than normal levels of zzso consistent with an zzso role for the third zzso zzso zzso of increasing numbers of positively charged zzso from the loop by zzso zzso causes a progressive loss of signaling function, indicating that the overall net charge of the loop is important for zzso zzso Introduction of zzso charged zzso also leads to a reduced level of zzso The defects in signaling caused by substitution of charged zzso acids are not caused by changes in the abundance of receptors at the cell zzso
