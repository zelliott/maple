zzso zzso receptors are modulated by zzso zzso and zzso and are blocked in a zzso manner by zzso and zzso derivatives such as zzso zzso The effects of zzso in the first and third zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso loop zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso Surprisingly, some zzso in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso including zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso reduced zzso stimulation and zzso zzso These zzso may have long-range zzso effects or may change zzso and zzso gating processes rather than directly affecting the binding sites for these zzso because zzso stimulation and zzso zzso are not zzso dependent and are thought to involve binding sites outside the zzso regions of the zzso A number of zzso in zzso including zzso at zzso and zzso zzso near the zzso sides of zzso and zzso reduced block by zzso and zzso The effects of these zzso on channel block were characterized in detail by using zzso which produces block but not stimulation of zzso zzso Block by zzso was studied by using zzso ramps analyzed with the zzso model of channel zzso zzso at zzso (in zzso and zzso zzso after zzso in the zzso zzso and at zzso (in zzso and zzso (in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso reduced the affinity for zzso without affecting the zzso dependence of zzso These zzso may form part of a binding site for zzso zzso of a zzso zzso at position zzso in the zzso region of zzso greatly reduced block by zzso and zzso could easily zzso channels containing this zzso The results suggest that at least parts of the zzso and zzso segments contribute to the pore or zzso of the zzso channel and that a zzso in zzso zzso in zzso may contribute to the narrow zzso of the zzso
