We describe a zzso procedure for the removal of sodium zzso zzso zzso from proteins isolated by zzso It involves zzso of zzso on zzso zzso a support initially developed for zzso interaction zzso The zzso zzso against ammonium zzso zzso is directly injected onto the column, which is zzso in an zzso concentration greater than zzso Bound proteins are zzso with a zzso of decreasing zzso This procedure removes essentially all of the zzso zzso zzso and separates zzso from the zzso Due to the use of volatile buffer systems, the proteins are recovered in completely zzso form, which zzso further protein zzso After removal of the organic zzso from the zzso zzso step, the recovered proteins are directly amenable to zzso protein sequencing and, after evaporation of the organic phase, to zzso zzso and subsequent separation of fragments by zzso zzso
