zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein in the small zzso of the zzso zzso We have determined a high-resolution solution structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso were calculated using zzso distance and zzso angle restraints derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The structures show that zzso is a mixed zzso protein with long zzso zzso The folding zzso is not zzso to that of any other known protein zzso Potential zzso and protein binding sites have been identified on the zzso zzso
