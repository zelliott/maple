zzso is a common compatible zzso in higher zzso zzso zzso in response to water stress and zzso is preceded by a rapid increase of the zzso level of delta zzso zzso zzso controlling the zzso step of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso regulated genes in zzso Gene zzso mapped to zzso zzso is expressed in most plant zzso but silent in dividing zzso Gene zzso located close to marker zzso on zzso zzso contributes zzso of total zzso zzso in plant zzso but is solely responsible for the synthesis of abundant zzso zzso in rapidly dividing cell zzso zzso of zzso transcripts is regulated in a tissue specific manner and zzso by drought, zzso zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso involves an immediate early zzso response regulated by zzso zzso that is not inhibited by zzso but abolished by the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of protein synthesis by zzso prevents the induction of zzso zzso zzso and blocks further increase of zzso zzso levels during the second, slow phase of zzso zzso zzso and zzso affecting zzso in zzso reduce the zzso of both zzso zzso during zzso whereas zzso functions defined by the zzso and zzso zzso have no effect on zzso of the zzso zzso
