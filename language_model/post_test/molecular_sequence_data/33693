Several studies have demonstrated an association between zzso zzso syndrome zzso and the zzso repeat zzso marker zzso which is located in zzso 55 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and 2, interact with zzso transforming growth factor zzso proteins zzso and thereby control the zzso of zzso zzso stimulate zzso replication and collagen zzso The zzso zzso zzso includes increased zzso collagen and expansion of the zzso cortex, features zzso influenced by abnormal zzso zzso To examine a possible role of zzso in zzso particularly zzso we undertook tagging and functional single zzso zzso zzso analysis (32 zzso including 10 that generate zzso zzso acid zzso using DNA from 173 zzso patients and zzso zzso No zzso showed a significant association with zzso and zzso of most zzso showed almost identical population zzso between zzso and control zzso No significant differences were observed for zzso zzso In human zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and in human zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were approximately 100 times greater than zzso and zzso greater than zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso greater than zzso We conclude that zzso appears to have little involvement in zzso but cannot rule out that other markers in the region of zzso zzso are associated with zzso or that zzso expression occurs in other zzso and that this may be influencing the zzso zzso
