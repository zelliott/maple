A new species of zzso associated with zzso fruits is zzso The fungus causes fruit rot on apples during storage and is associated with a zzso zzso and zzso disease of zzso trees and dead zzso of pear zzso To characterize the biology of the fungus and compare it with zzso zzso the type species of the zzso effects of nine media and light on zzso growth and zzso production, zzso growth in response to temperature and mode of zzso zzso in response to zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and oatmeal zzso zzso favored zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not favor zzso zzso Light effect on zzso formation was medium zzso zzso zzso with mature zzso formed in 14 d old zzso and zzso cultures at 20 C, regardless of light, whereas none or very few zzso formed on other media in the zzso Fluorescent light zzso formation of zzso except on zzso The fungus grew at zzso C, with optimum growth at zzso zzso zzso zzso either by forming germ tubes or less often by zzso zzso of zzso occurred in 1 and zzso zzso solutions but not in zzso zzso zzso Six zzso of zzso zzso from different species of zzso fruits had identical ITS zzso The sizes of the ITS region were the same for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and four zzso zzso sites were found in the ITS region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The similarity in ITS sequences between these two zzso is zzso evidence for the zzso of the new species of zzso associated with zzso fruits we describe zzso
