The zzso zzso zzso zzso occupies a unique position in zzso as the most primitive extant zzso and is regarded as the sister zzso to the zzso of all other living zzso Eight structurally related zzso termed zzso zzso were isolated from zzso skin zzso of zzso zzso and were shown to possess differential growth zzso activity against zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso may be represented by the consensus zzso acid sequence zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso The zzso show no appreciable structural similarity with other families of zzso peptides from zzso skin but display limited sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso 1 and zzso 1, isolated from the zzso of African zzso zzso shows the highest potency against a range of zzso zzso but has the greatest zzso zzso The data indicate that the host zzso strategy of using zzso peptides in skin zzso arose early in the evolution of zzso
