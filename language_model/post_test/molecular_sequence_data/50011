A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was generated by zzso zzso zzso to identify genes involved in bacterial magnetic particle zzso zzso zzso of the DNA sequences zzso the zzso allowed the isolation of an open reading frame zzso within an zzso consisting of five zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso which functions for zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed under zzso conditions and localized in the zzso of zzso Iron zzso and growth of zzso were lower than wild zzso zzso electron zzso zzso of zzso revealed that no zzso were completely zzso but zzso zzso zzso were persistently zzso These results indicate that zzso may contribute to zzso iron reduction during zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso
