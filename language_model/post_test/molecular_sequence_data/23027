zzso zzso complexes between the large zzso of the U2 small nuclear zzso auxiliary factor zzso with the zzso factor 1 zzso or the zzso component zzso are exchanged during a critical, zzso step of zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso domain of zzso interact with a zzso zzso motif zzso of zzso zzso contains seven zzso sites with sequence similarity to the previously characterized zzso domain of zzso We show that the zzso domain lacks zzso secondary structure using circular zzso zzso and demonstrate that five of the zzso zzso sites are recognized by the zzso using intrinsic zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso When compared with zzso similar spectral shifts and sequence requirements indicate that zzso interactions with each of the zzso sites are similar to the minimal zzso zzso However, zzso comparison of zzso or zzso proteins with minimal peptides demonstrates that formation the zzso complex is likely to affect regions of zzso beyond the previously identified, linear interaction site, in a remarkably distinct manner from the local zzso binding mode of zzso Furthermore, the complex of the zzso interacting zzso is stabilized by zzso zzso zzso relative to the complex of the zzso interacting zzso consistent with the need for zzso zzso to drive exchange of these partners during zzso zzso We propose that the multiple zzso binding sites within zzso regulate zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sites defines an zzso consensus sequence for predicting zzso zzso from zzso zzso where parentheses zzso zzso that contribute to, but are not required for zzso
