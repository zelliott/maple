The zzso position of unidentified group 6 of zzso zzso as described by Nakamura and zzso zzso Nakamura and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1983) was determined, and the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The results of zzso amplification of a zzso zzso gene zzso with a specific primer and comparative analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences warranted placing the two zzso in the zzso zzso The levels of DNA zzso among the strains revealed four groups zzso groups I, II, III, and zzso each with a high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso characteristics correlated well with DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were scattered in groups I, II, and zzso zzso labeled the type strain of zzso zzso from different culture collections appeared in groups I and zzso zzso found in group I were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and the one strain found in group III was identified as zzso zzso Group 6 zzso strains formerly assigned to zzso zzso group 6, and group II contained other strains identified as zzso zzso Groups 6 and II were zzso and genetically distinct zzso that were distinguishable from the previously described zzso These findings showed that groups 6 and II were new species, for which we propose the names zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
