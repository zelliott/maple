The circular physical map of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was established by using zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains eight zzso fragments of 1,100, zzso 400, zzso zzso 45, 30, and 20 zzso in size and eight zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 70, and 25 zzso zzso the total length of the zzso is zzso zzso To order the zzso fragments on the zzso we used a strategy which can be of general zzso We first cloned zzso zzso or zzso fragments in zzso DNA extracted from the total libraries was zzso by zzso and zzso to a zzso resistance cassette obtained by cutting zzso with zzso After transformation in zzso coli, zzso clones originating from zzso zzso or zzso fragments were zzso The two zzso or zzso fragments of each zzso zzso were isolated and used as zzso on Southern zzso zzso to identify and link the corresponding zzso zzso Seven zzso fragments were ordered in this zzso The last junction was demonstrated by partial digest zzso All zzso zzso genes identified so far as well as the six zzso zzso were localized on the zzso zzso zzso zzso to genes from closely related bacteria were also detected and zzso Southern zzso analysis of simple zzso zzso or double zzso zzso zzso with the various zzso zzso allowed us to align the zzso fragments and zzso the single zzso site, resulting in the establishment of the first genetic and physical map of the zzso zzso zzso
