zzso zzso possess multiple origins of zzso whereas bacterial zzso are zzso from a single zzso The zzso zzso zzso also appears to have a single origin, suggesting a common rule for zzso However, in the current work, we describe the identification of two active origins of replication in the single zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, we identify zzso sequence motifs within the origins that are recognized by a family of three zzso proteins that are zzso to the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso We demonstrate that the two origins are recognized by distinct zzso of these zzso zzso These data, in conjunction with an analysis of the levels of the three zzso proteins in different growth zzso and cell cycle zzso lead us to propose a model for the roles for these proteins in modulating origin zzso
