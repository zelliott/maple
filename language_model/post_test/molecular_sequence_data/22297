zzso is a member of zzso molecules zzso and a hormone zzso from mature zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso We now report the cloning and characterization of the full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that the pig zzso zzso sequence had an open reading frame of 330 zzso zzso a 12 zzso protein of 109 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity to the human zzso The zzso zzso gene was composed of four zzso and had exactly the same zzso structure as the human zzso zzso The tissue distribution of zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso gene expression was the highest in zzso zzso and low in zzso zzso zzso protein could be detected in zzso serum by western zzso and it circulated in serum as zzso and zzso We provided the first evidence that zzso was abundantly expressed in zzso zzso and had an expression pattern similar to that in human zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that the pig may be a suitable animal model for studying the function of zzso in human insulin zzso
