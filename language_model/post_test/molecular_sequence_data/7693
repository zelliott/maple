zzso zzso responses require zzso peptides presented on the cell surface by the major zzso complex zzso zzso The structural characteristics of these peptides are being zzso It is now known that the majority of peptides that associate with zzso Class I are 8-10 zzso long, with zzso binding motifs containing up to three anchor zzso This is consistent with the presence of six pockets and the zzso structure of the zzso Class I zzso binding zzso In contrast to peptides associated with zzso Class I, those associated with zzso Class II are zzso zzso in length and are commonly presented in zzso sets with extensions or zzso at the zzso or zzso zzso zzso motifs for zzso Class II appear to contain up to four anchor positions, with more loosely defined zzso acid zzso The expression of zzso proteins in cells that do not load peptides but fold them correctly has permitted the X-ray analysis of the three-dimensional structure of Class I and Class II complexes with single defined zzso The differences in length between the Class I and Class II sequences can be ascribed to small structural differences between the two binding sites and the positioning of key zzso that make hydrogen bonds to the bound zzso Recent advances in mass zzso are making possible the analysis and sequencing of zzso quantities of zzso peptides and the zzso of the size of the total population of zzso The sequence information derived from this technique, in conjunction with X-ray zzso analysis of zzso complexes involving single, defined zzso may provide a new approach towards the development of useful zzso for therapeutic zzso
