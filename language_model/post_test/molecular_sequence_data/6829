The response of zzso to agents such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso includes the zzso zzso of numerous zzso We have used the method of differential screening of a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso library to isolate and characterize zzso zzso One such message, zzso is induced by zzso zzso and zzso but not by a panel of other zzso or pharmacological zzso zzso zzso is zzso to two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence is approximately zzso identical and zzso similar to both these putative protein zzso All three putative zzso particularly zzso bear zzso to a T cell product, zzso induced by T cell zzso zzso The three zzso proteins share areas of zzso with zzso zzso are approximately 415 zzso acids in zzso and have similar zzso of induction by zzso This suggests that these genes may be members of a new family of zzso zzso
