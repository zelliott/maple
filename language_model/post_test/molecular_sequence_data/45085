A series of zzso coli zzso constructed originally by zzso and Miller zzso zzso zzso Miller, A set of zzso zzso in zzso coli that allow rapid detection of each of the six base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86 (1989) zzso provides a unique system for zzso zzso zzso and the repair processes that limit their establishment, in bacteria under selective and zzso zzso We zzso on one strain in which a zzso replacement zzso the zzso zzso zzso of this strain can occur through zzso of G, leading to zzso zzso We show that spontaneous zzso occurred both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso per viable cell was much greater in medium containing zzso or both zzso than zzso zzso In zzso zzso the rate of zzso was highest below zzso zzso and strongly inhibited at and above that zzso Evidence that zzso occurred through zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso media came from two zzso by sequence analysis of a series of zzso and by comparing the zzso rates in strains possessing and lacking the zzso gene zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso However, the rate of zzso was zzso by reducing zzso to zzso and inhibited or delayed by increasing zzso to zzso In zzso cells grown on zzso zzso the proportion of zzso increased over a zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells, zzso appeared primarily during the first 2-3 days after zzso few new zzso appeared in the following zzso These data imply that base zzso repair initiated by zzso was less effective in the first 2 days and more effective later in stationary zzso
