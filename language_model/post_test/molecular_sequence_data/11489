In a coordinated approach, several laboratories zzso zzso zzso zzso II during the European BRIDGE zzso Here we report on the sequence and functional analysis of a zzso zzso zzso located on the right arm of zzso II between zzso and zzso The zzso contains four open reading frames probably zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All four open reading frames zzso new zzso as concluded from data base zzso The respective genes were destroyed by gene replacement in one zzso of zzso zzso After zzso and zzso analysis, the resulting zzso zzso strains were zzso No zzso with respect to spore zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth was found for zzso zzso the smallest open reading frame zzso Gene replacement within the zzso gene zzso a highly basic and possibly nuclear located protein was zzso zzso revealed similarities to the zzso zzso protein with respect to the zzso zzso zzso harboring a zzso in the zzso gene showed strongly reduced growth as compared to the zzso zzso The protein predicted from zzso shared zzso identical zzso acid zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were only able to grow at reduced temperatures, but even under these conditions the zzso grew slower than zzso zzso
