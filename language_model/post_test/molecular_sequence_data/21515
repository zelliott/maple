zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso highlight the important role of zzso in the negative regulation of plant programmed cell death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso zinc finger zzso which are involved in the zzso zzso 

To further understand the function of zzso we have analyzed cellular zzso and functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of green fluorescent protein zzso zzso indicates that zzso is localized in the zzso Using a series of zzso zzso deletion zzso we found that the three zzso zinc finger motifs of zzso alone can target zzso to the nucleus, whereas deletion of the three zinc finger motifs or any individual zinc finger motif causes zzso to lose its nuclear zzso indicating that the three zinc finger motifs are necessary and sufficient for its nuclear zzso Moreover, zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicates that zzso structure and basic zzso acids of each zinc finger motif are necessary for zzso nuclear zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that the three zinc finger motifs of zzso directly bind to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso 

Our data demonstrate that the zzso zinc finger motifs of zzso are a novel nuclear zzso signal and directly bind to zzso zzso and suggest that the nuclear import of zzso may rely on the interaction between its zinc finger motifs and zzso zzso Moreover, the nuclear zzso of zzso suggests that zzso may function as a zzso regulator involved in zzso regulating zzso
