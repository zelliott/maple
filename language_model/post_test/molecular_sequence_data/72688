The first zzso unit of the zzso region of zzso zzso which comprises six genes zzso exhibiting similarity to fatty acid zzso zzso is required for the production of a novel type of zzso zzso that is involved in root zzso development and structurally analogous to group II K zzso found in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Noel, zzso zzso Carlson, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1993; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Carlson, and zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we present the zzso sequence for the other three zzso units of the zzso zzso revealing the presence of four additional open reading frames assigned to genes zzso and zzso The putative zzso protein shares similarity with zzso zzso is zzso to zzso alcohol zzso and zzso shows significant sequence identity with bacterial zzso transport zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso No significant zzso was found for zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso derivatives for each gene demonstrated partial or complete loss of zzso zzso from the cell surface; on this basis, we suggest that all genes in the zzso region are required for zzso synthesis or zzso
