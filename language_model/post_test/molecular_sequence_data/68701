We exchanged specific zzso acids in the basic region of the zzso zzso protein and tested the zzso proteins for their DNA binding zzso The zzso acids we exchanged were chosen in zzso to zzso of the zzso basic regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were expressed in zzso coli and specific DNA binding was monitored by gel shift zzso For this we used zzso target sequences with systematic base pair zzso Several zzso with altered DNA binding specificity were zzso zzso acid exchanges of zzso zzso or zzso of the basic region lead to specificity changes (we define zzso 402 of zzso as zzso comparable to zzso see zzso The zzso zzso recognition sequence zzso is no longer recognized by the zzso zzso but DNA fragments with symmetrical exchanges of the target sequence zzso zzso at position zzso broaden the binding zzso These data were used to build a computer based model of the putative interactions of the zzso basic DNA binding region with its target zzso
