The zzso gene zzso in zzso an zzso dominant zzso zzso hearing loss and zzso disorder, encodes zzso Previously, we reported three bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which exhibit significant molecular zzso in zzso Here we have characterized zzso zzso by generating four zzso zzso zzso The same three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in human and cow inner ear zzso however, zzso and zzso were not detected in zzso We identified a novel short zzso zzso in human zzso and a zzso zzso in cow zzso named zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso of full-length zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains all of the known zzso sites associated with zzso The zzso of zzso is not fully clarified as yet, and this novel zzso zzso zzso might provide zzso clues to how zzso in the zzso gene damage the inner ear zzso
