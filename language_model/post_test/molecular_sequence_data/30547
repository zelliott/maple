The zzso hormones are a family of zzso zzso proteins which share a common alpha zzso but differ in their zzso beta zzso We used zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso beta zzso to identify zzso which enable zzso zzso zzso to distinguish the two zzso The zzso zzso beta zzso appeared to fold similar to zzso zzso since they combined with zzso alpha and, depending on their zzso were recognized by zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso form a major zzso region and appear to be adjacent to each other on the surface of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are recognized by zzso zzso while zzso is recognized by zzso which have highest affinity for the free beta zzso These observations suggest that the zzso of this region of the beta zzso changes when the alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso which are zzso of zzso form a second zzso zzso zzso to the third domain distinguish zzso beta and zzso beta by the presence of zzso in zzso beta and can be detected after zzso binds to zzso These findings were used to develop a model of zzso beta which predicts the locations of these zzso and their positions relative to the alpha zzso and zzso zzso
