In this study we mapped the zzso initiation site of the gene for zzso zzso by primer extension analysis, situated 125 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the zzso zzso We showed that the zzso in position zzso of the zzso gene is part of a functional zzso A 280 zzso region of the zzso region exerted a strong positive effect on promoter zzso In this region we identified consensus sequences for the zzso control elements zzso zzso zzso and zzso
