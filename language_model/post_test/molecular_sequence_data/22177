zzso Forest virus zzso is enveloped by a zzso zzso enclosed within a zzso cage made by zzso E1 and zzso E1 is responsible for inducing membrane fusion, triggered by exposure to the zzso environment of the zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso allowing E1 to interact with the target zzso and, at the same time, to rearrange into E1 zzso that drive the membrane fusion zzso We previously reported a preliminary zzso trace of the zzso E1 zzso zzso and its organization on the virus zzso We also reported the zzso A structure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso E1 refined to 3 A resolution and describe the zzso acids involved in contacts in the zzso These results identify the major zzso for the zzso zzso shell formation and open the way to rational zzso approaches to shed light on zzso zzso
