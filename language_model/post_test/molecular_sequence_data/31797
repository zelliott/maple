The zzso binding of zzso by bacteria is thought to contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso are group A zzso zzso receptors for zzso but it is not known if this binding has any impact on zzso To further investigate the binding of zzso to zzso we engineered zzso of an M type 4 strain of zzso by zzso the genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and tested these zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso dramatically decreased the binding of human zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso had only minor effects, indicating that zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso of human zzso to a zzso zzso form of zzso indicated that it selectively binds to the zzso domain of human zzso but not zzso or zzso and that it zzso bound zzso zzso zzso proteins encompassing different regions of zzso were engineered and used to map its zzso domain to its zzso region and a zzso protein with 3 zzso was a better inhibitor of zzso binding than one with a single zzso A zzso zzso expressing zzso with an zzso deletion of DNA zzso the zzso had a dramatically reduced ability to bind human zzso and to grow in human zzso zzso exhibited host specificity in binding zzso human zzso was the best inhibitor of the binding of zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso donkey, chicken, and guinea pig were poor zzso of zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso binds human zzso and that this binding contributes to the ability of zzso to resist zzso and may be a factor in the restriction of zzso infections to the human zzso
