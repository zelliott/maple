zzso zzso are commonly found in systemic zzso diseases such as zzso syndrome and systemic lupus zzso and some of these zzso appear to be responsible for certain pathological zzso including zzso heart block in zzso zzso In this study, we generated three human zzso zzso fragments that specifically bind to zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of a patient with zzso syndrome by using a zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that two of the three zzso clones zzso and zzso used zzso heavy chains derived from the zzso zzso gene zzso in combination with different light chains which were derived from zzso V zzso gene zzso and V zzso gene zzso The third zzso clone zzso used another heavy chain derived from the zzso zzso gene zzso in combination with the identical light chain as that of zzso All three zzso clones revealed a high number of zzso zzso that likely occurred in the context of zzso zzso These findings suggest the restricted usage of zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso
