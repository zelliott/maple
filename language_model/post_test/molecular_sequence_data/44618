zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified with 1, zzso to give an zzso support suitable for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso acid was incorporated and the zzso carrier protein sequence zzso was zzso manually on this support by the zzso procedure under controlled conditions with monitoring of the zzso zzso The performance of the support in automated multiple synthesis in open reactors, with an zzso zzso 422 according to standard zzso was evaluated by the synthesis of the zzso carrier protein sequence zzso and two other zzso and zzso zzso The quality of the resulting crude peptides was determined by zzso and zzso and compared with the same sequences zzso in parallel on the commercial zzso synthesis zzso zzso S zzso The modified zzso material was found to be particularly suited for zzso zzso zzso synthesis and should be advantageous for the zzso of immobilized peptides and zzso libraries in biological zzso
