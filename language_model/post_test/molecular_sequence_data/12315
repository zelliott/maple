A zzso of zzso zzso carrying an zzso into the zzso gene zzso zzso I zzso has been studied by zzso analysis and genetic zzso zzso When compared to the zzso strain, the zzso zzso exhibited altered nitrogen fixing ability and zzso lower levels of zzso activity as zzso in zzso When zzso in zzso with an artificial zzso zzso activity was only 3- to zzso lower than in the wild zzso These results suggested that the zzso zzso had impaired electron transport to zzso zzso zzso of both zzso components showed that the zzso zzso contained about zzso less zzso than zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeling experiments using zzso indicated that zzso was significantly less stable in the zzso zzso When a copy of zzso was introduced in the zzso in zzso the resulting strain appeared to be fully zzso with respect to both zzso growth and zzso zzso Depending on whether zzso expression was driven by a zzso promoter or a zzso promoter, zzso was zzso either at zzso level or in zzso lower zzso The strain producing zzso less zzso did, however, display normal zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins by zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso produced a 14 zzso zzso in amounts about zzso greater than zzso zzso This protein was identified by zzso zzso as a recently zzso zzso zzso called zzso which cannot reduce zzso It is concluded that zzso serves as the main electron donor to zzso in zzso zzso and that an ancillary electron carrier, distinct of zzso is responsible for the residual zzso activity observed in the zzso zzso
