Low molecular mass proteins are implicated in chemical communication throughout zzso species, being involved in both perception and delivery of zzso zzso In zzso zzso are zzso in saliva to cause zzso zzso to take up the mating zzso These zzso are the zzso steroids, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contain a low molecular mass zzso zzso which is capable of binding these zzso zzso zzso was zzso cloned and zzso It was found to be a zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and the major zzso protein present in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso One zzso zzso A, was found to be zzso to zzso zzso C1 and C2 and zzso A and B, whereas the other zzso zzso C, was zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso A was limited to the prostate and zzso zzso zzso from both the zzso and zzso whereas zzso of the other zzso zzso C, was more zzso This is similar to the zzso distribution of zzso in zzso Many zzso of zzso were found to exist, with a molecular mass range of zzso zzso these are probably products of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate mature zzso zzso probably include zzso zzso of zzso A, followed by additional zzso
