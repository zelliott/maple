The complete assignment of zzso and zzso backbone zzso and near-complete zzso zzso resonance assignments have been obtained for the reduced form of a zzso of human zzso zzso zzso in which the three zzso site zzso have been zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The assignments were made primarily on the basis of three-dimensional zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso in conjunction with two-dimensional zzso and zzso correlation zzso Based on comparisons of short-range and zzso nuclear zzso effects, patterns of zzso exchange, and zzso differences, the structure appears essentially unchanged from that of the previously determined solution structure of the native protein zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso An zzso for zzso shows that the zzso zzso zzso zzso retains zzso The assignment of the spectrum for this zzso of human zzso constitutes the basis for future studies aimed at comparing the details of the zzso zzso in the reduced and oxidized forms of the zzso
