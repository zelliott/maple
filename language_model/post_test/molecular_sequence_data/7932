zzso channel proteins sense a change in the zzso electric field and respond with a zzso change that allows zzso to diffuse across the zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso analysis of expressed zzso in zzso zzso has previously established the zzso zzso segment as an element of the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso zzso charged zzso in zzso and zzso of a brain zzso channel, thought of as zzso for the positively charged zzso in zzso selectively zzso channel gating without zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso that neutralize or reverse charge increase the probability of channel opening and the apparent gating zzso In contrast, replacements of zzso by zzso or zzso by zzso in zzso decrease the open probability and the apparent gating zzso zzso zzso in zzso tolerated replacement only by zzso zzso whereas zzso in zzso was intolerant to any attempted zzso These results imply that zzso and zzso are unlikely to be involved in channel zzso yet, together with zzso may be additional components of the zzso zzso
