zzso zzso has been implicated as a major cause of chronic zzso in human zzso virus zzso zzso So far diagnosis depends on direct zzso of the zzso by light and transmission electron zzso We evaluated the diagnostic value of zzso DNA amplification by zzso on zzso biopsy specimens obtained from patients with and without zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso Thirteen zzso patients (all zzso stage zzso were zzso Eight patients had zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were diagnosed by light zzso of stool samples and confirmed by light and electron zzso of zzso biopsy zzso Five patients had no zzso in their stool samples or in their zzso biopsy zzso as examined by light and electron zzso Additionally, DNA prepared from zzso zzso derived from mouse zzso was used as a further zzso A zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso gene could be amplified from all six biopsy specimens infected with zzso zzso and the nature of the zzso products was confirmed by Southern zzso zzso No amplification of DNA fragments was seen by using DNA extracted from biopsy specimens with zzso zzso or zzso zzso infection or without zzso infection and with template DNA extracted from zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso testing of zzso biopsy specimens may be a useful approach to diagnosing zzso in zzso zzso
