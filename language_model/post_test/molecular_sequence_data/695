Shell formation is one of the important events during zzso development and metamorphosis in zzso However, the molecular mechanisms and environmental cues regulating shell initiation and growth are zzso Here, we report that zzso a principal protein for biological iron storage and zzso might play a role in zzso shell development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso named as zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso expression in different zzso zzso from zzso to post larvae, was analyzed by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso expression in larvae of later zzso stages increased at least zzso following zzso Moreover, the zzso and spatial expressions of zzso zzso were examined by whole mount in zzso zzso In the zzso stage, zzso was zzso where it was supposed to be for shell zzso In the later zzso zzso zzso was found near zzso zzso and mantle that secret zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected in larvae cultured in artificial seawater with different iron zzso ranging from 0 to 100 zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in the shell formation of zzso
