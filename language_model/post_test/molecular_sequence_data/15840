The gene zzso zzso of zzso is necessary not only for female sexual differentiation but also for normal zzso in zzso We have cloned and characterized the zzso zzso Its putative protein has a domain that is zzso to zzso binding zzso This suggests that the zzso protein might achieve the zzso zzso of the transcript of zzso a zzso gene whose mode of expression depends on zzso The protein coding region of the zzso transcript is identical in males and zzso In both zzso a low level of transcript is present in the zzso and a high level in the germ zzso This indicates that zzso is regulated in a way different from other zzso zzso
