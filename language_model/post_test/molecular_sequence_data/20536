zzso zzso of zzso were shown to activate both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso which has an aromatic ring in the zzso chain, exhibited a stronger zzso activity against human zzso cells and a much weaker activity against zzso zzso cells than zzso that has an almost identical fatty zzso chain as zzso In this study, we have found that zzso zzso zzso expressed by zzso cells, but not zzso expressed by zzso command the zzso preferential activity of zzso and that their preferential activity against human vs zzso zzso cells correlate with the binding affinity of zzso complex to zzso of respective zzso cells rather than that of zzso to human or zzso zzso zzso Overall, the structural difference of zzso appears to zzso those of zzso zzso in shaping the strength of the biological activity of zzso zzso
