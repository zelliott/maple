zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso In this study, attempts have been made to identify and define zzso of zzso zzso zzso possessing contraceptive efficacy in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso was reduced and zzso and subsequently zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso digest yielded zzso two zzso zzso When tested against zzso zzso against sequential zzso on zzso zzso was zzso with two zzso zzso and zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recorded versus zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso the zzso values obtained with intact zzso zzso acid analysis, zzso degradation, and zzso identified zzso as the zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso zzso of overlapping zzso further identified zzso and zzso as the minimum motifs with zzso activity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso replacement peptides confirmed zzso zzso as critical for binding zzso and zzso as critical for binding zzso Both zzso inhibited binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso These results, the first to define zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso will assist in the design of an zzso vaccine based on synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso or its zzso in other zzso
