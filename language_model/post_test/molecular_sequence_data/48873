Two zzso zzso bacterial strains were isolated from the zzso of common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso primer grouped these zzso into a single cluster separated from all known zzso zzso The two strains revealed identical zzso zzso gene sequences placing them within the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the closest relative zzso % zzso Further zzso investigation using sequencing of the genes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso as well as application of zzso protein zzso automated zzso and extensive zzso confirmed that both strains belong to the same zzso Based on data from this zzso study, these strains represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
