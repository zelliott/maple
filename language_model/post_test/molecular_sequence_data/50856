We have recently reported that the zzso of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso rat zzso has a capacity to influence blood pressure in a zzso rat population prepared from zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we have undertaken a similar genetic zzso analysis of the zzso rat population prepared from zzso and Lewis zzso The result indicated that, although overall effects of the zzso gene zzso on blood pressure were not zzso a correlation of the zzso of the zzso gene with blood pressure was significantly observed in the female rats of this zzso The present results further strengthen our hypothesis that the zzso zzso or a gene closely linked to this zzso has a capacity to influence blood zzso
