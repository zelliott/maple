A program is described which generates hydrogen bonding zzso of protein structures and zzso zzso wheels and zzso zzso The program can also zzso zzso and to automatically extract simple structural motifs such as zzso or Greek zzso The program greatly reduces the effort required to produce these zzso and offers considerable flexibility in the information which can be zzso The usefulness of the program is illustrated by several examples including comparing zzso families, zzso protein structure with attributes of individual zzso and zzso all examples of the zzso motif from the Brookhaven Data zzso
