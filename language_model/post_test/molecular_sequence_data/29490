Members of the zzso III zzso of zzso zzso participate in diverse cellular zzso maturation and degradation zzso A recently identified zzso zzso III family member, named zzso functions in the zzso interference zzso zzso by producing zzso zzso zzso which target the selective destruction of zzso zzso zzso is operative in animals, plants, and zzso where it is proposed to inhibit viral reproduction and zzso movement, as well as to participate in zzso zzso zzso functions in zzso cells, including mouse zzso and zzso This article reports the zzso sequence characterization and expression analysis of the mouse zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is 1906 zzso acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 215 zzso Mouse zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso a tandem repeat of zzso III zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso gene maps to a single locus on the zzso portion of mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript is expressed from the embryonic through adult stages of zzso The zzso transcript is also present in a wide variety of adult mouse zzso The highly zzso set of functional zzso and the occurrence of a zzso gene strongly indicate that the zzso protein is the zzso III zzso responsible for zzso processing in the zzso zzso
