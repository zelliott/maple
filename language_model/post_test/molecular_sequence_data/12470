Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and IX comprise an interrelated set of molecules (the zzso zzso that together form a surface zzso zzso for the zzso von zzso zzso To complete the primary structural characterization of the genes involved in this system, we have analyzed zzso clones for both the zzso V and IX genes and used these clones to zzso the two genes by zzso in zzso zzso Both genes were found on the long arm of zzso 3, but at distinct sites, the zzso gene on 3 band zzso and the zzso IX gene on 3 band zzso The zzso start site of the zzso gene was defined by zzso zzso and primer zzso The zzso gene contains two zzso the first consisting of approximately 37 bases and the second of approximately zzso zzso interrupted by a single zzso base zzso The zzso transcript has multiple start sites spread over a zzso base zzso The zzso zzso region of the zzso gene has a series of potential consensus regulatory elements including zzso zzso and zzso sites, similar to those found in other described zzso zzso including those of the zzso zzso In assessing the four zzso genes as a group, all four have a simple, zzso structure with the entire open reading frame of the mature zzso located within a single zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
