zzso interaction molecules zzso function as zzso zzso calcium zzso sensors that zzso regulate plasma membrane zzso release activated zzso channels in various zzso To probe the structural basis for the functional differences between zzso and zzso we engineered a series of zzso and sterile zzso motif zzso domain zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso SAM domain are major contributors to the zzso of zzso in each respective zzso Our nuclear magnetic resonance zzso derived zzso zzso structure provides a rationale for an zzso stability, which involves a zzso zzso in the zzso domain orientation permissible by an expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso and an enhanced zzso SAM core, unique to zzso Live cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in the full-length context show a remarkable correlation with the in zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that divergent zzso and zzso stabilization of the zzso fold contributes to the disparate regulation of zzso zzso entry by zzso and zzso
