The alignments of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso 175 zzso zzso are examined in the light of zzso and chemical modification results placing specific zzso acid zzso at the active site of the zzso zzso The major results are: zzso the full zzso sequence zzso within zzso zzso of zzso raising the possibility that the zzso and zzso portions of zzso may not be essential for activity, and zzso that whereas the overall identity between the two sequences is only modest zzso depending on the choice of alignment zzso of some 17 putative active site zzso zzso are identical between zzso and zzso zzso thus appears to be an example of zzso from widely divergent species that conserve common functional elements within the context of substantial overall sequence zzso
