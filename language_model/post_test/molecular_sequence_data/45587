In this report the evolution of insect zzso zzso is reviewed with particular emphasis on the relationship between their zzso protein and a zzso envelope fusion zzso In addition, selected features of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso are zzso These include characterization of the 21 zzso acid predicted fusion zzso sequence that is highly zzso to a region of zzso envelope fusion zzso We found that, although this sequence could not substitute for the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso envelope fusion zzso by changing four zzso zzso the hybrid construct became active for zzso induced cell zzso In addition, a zzso zzso construct was found to zzso to cell zzso
