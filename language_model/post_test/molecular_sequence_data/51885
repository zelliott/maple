zzso domain proteins exhibit distinct biological functions with zzso that cannot be predicted by their sequence zzso for binding zzso zzso of the surface of the zzso zzso zzso domain provides a general model for the contribution of selective zzso interactions to the functional specificity of the zzso domain family of zzso The assembly of zzso into a zzso complex on the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso is specified by the interactions of its zzso domain with ancillary zzso This complex zzso zzso is composed of the viral alpha zzso protein zzso zzso and one additional cellular zzso the C1 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain were generated by zzso zzso which altered the zzso predicted to form the exposed surface of the zzso zzso zzso with single zzso acid zzso on the surface of either zzso 1 or 2 of the zzso zzso zzso domain had decreased abilities to form the C1 zzso The behavior of these zzso in a cooperative zzso zzso with alpha zzso suggested that the zzso zzso zzso domain is principally recognized by alpha zzso in the C1 zzso The preferential recognition of zzso over the closely related zzso protein is critically influenced by a single zzso on the surface of zzso 1 because the introduction of this zzso into the zzso zzso zzso domain significantly enhanced its ability to form a C1 zzso
