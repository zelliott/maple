zzso zzso zzso have become one of the most widely used tools to measure zzso T cell responses in zzso With the aim of understanding the requirements for zzso personalized zzso in which individuals expressing zzso of the commonly studied zzso zzso are encountered, we assessed how the ability to detect zzso T cells for a given zzso is affected by zzso differences between zzso zzso First, analysis of a set of 10 zzso T cell clones demonstrated that zzso with zzso zzso of seven distinct zzso of the zzso zzso group was highly variable and not predicted by sequence zzso Second, to analyze the effect of minor sequence variation in a clinical setting, we screened zzso zzso of an zzso melanoma patient with either zzso or zzso zzso loaded with 145 different zzso zzso This revealed that of the four zzso zzso T cell responses observed in this patient, two responses were underestimated and one was overlooked when using zzso zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, these data provide the first demonstration of the strong effect of minor sequence variation on zzso personalized zzso and they provide tools to prevent this issue for common zzso within the zzso zzso zzso
