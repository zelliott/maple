A new extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso was isolated from the zzso sediments of zzso Lake in zzso This zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that grew zzso at 40 degrees C in the presence of 180 to 200 g of zzso per zzso The DNA base composition was 32 zzso zzso plus zzso The zzso products from zzso were ethanol, zzso zzso and zzso zzso extract was required for zzso The zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the results of a zzso zzso sequence analysis, strain zzso was found to be related to zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of strain zzso differed from the sequences of the three previously described zzso species, and strain zzso also differed from these organisms in its zzso range for growth zzso to 340 zzso strain zzso grew in the presence of the highest zzso concentration recorded for any zzso zzso zzso including the three previously described zzso zzso We propose that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a new zzso species, zzso zzso
