The enhanced zzso of zzso 2 zzso fusion protein into the zzso of zzso zzso larvae was studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seven signal zzso When the zzso zzso zzso the signal sequences from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected into zzso larvae, zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso For zzso zzso of the total zzso activity was zzso into zzso and only zzso remained in the zzso of zzso zzso For zzso zzso of the total zzso activity was zzso to the zzso but zzso remained in the zzso of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso the amount of zzso zzso was zzso per zzso which was zzso of the total amount of protein in the zzso
