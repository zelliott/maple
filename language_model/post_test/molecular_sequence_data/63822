We report the characterization of a zzso protein isolated from zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This protein has an apparent molecular weight of zzso and is highly zzso The zzso protein zzso sequence is comprised almost entirely of a novel domain termed zzso for zzso zzso repetitive zzso domain, that is repeated 8 times and that contains zzso aromatic, zzso and potential zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso belongs to a large family of modular proteins that consist of a variable number of zzso domain zzso Based on cell surface zzso and zzso data, zzso appears to migrate more rapidly with zzso when extracted from cells exposed to high levels of zzso however, the discovery of a large family of zzso zzso proteins leaves open the possibility that the zzso may be zzso with members of this protein family that are responding differently to zzso The response of the gene zzso zzso at the zzso level during synchronized progression through the normal cell cycle is similar to previously characterized genes in zzso zzso zzso cell wall proteins called zzso
