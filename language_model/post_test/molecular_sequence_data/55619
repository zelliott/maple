Packaging of zzso zzso is attained through the specific recognition of a zzso zzso site zzso near the zzso end of the viral zzso by components of the zzso precursor zzso Human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso are two zzso that lack apparent sequence similarity in their putative zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to determine whether zzso particles can recognize the zzso zzso site and functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid was zzso by zzso zzso Thus, efficient zzso zzso can take place at the zzso zzso zzso examination of the zzso contents of virus particles indicated that zzso of this zzso zzso is zzso zzso of deletion zzso in the untranslated leader region of zzso zzso indicates that only a very short region at the zzso end of the zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso of this region with the corresponding region of zzso reveals that both are marked by secondary structures that are likely to be zzso Thus, it is likely that a similar zzso zzso structure is required for zzso
