zzso the zzso zzso for the human zzso virus zzso is a member of the zzso zzso gene zzso It contains four zzso sequences zzso to zzso zzso zzso The first of these zzso is sufficient for binding to zzso however, the structural basis for this binding has yet to be zzso While several models for the structure of zzso zzso in zzso have been proposed on the basis of crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso direct evidence that zzso and zzso zzso fold similarly has not been zzso To produce individual zzso of zzso for structural studies, we used molecular zzso of such zzso with zzso heavy chain zzso zzso which are very efficiently expressed and zzso in zzso cells and can be easily isolated in zzso zzso with protein zzso Since these fusion molecules are zzso zzso zzso we investigated the possibility that they might be zzso zzso to produce zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso with zzso releases an zzso zzso containing the zzso and V2 zzso zzso this zzso fully retains the ability to bind to the zzso envelope zzso zzso and to block zzso infection in zzso Moreover, folding of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and in the parent zzso is zzso as indicated by circular zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso suggests that secondary structure content is identical with that predicted from the known structure of zzso zzso zzso this directly supports the hypothesis that the zzso and V2 zzso of zzso fold similarly to zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
