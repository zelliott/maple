Modeling of the active site of zzso zzso zzso zzso onto zzso utilizing the known crystal structure of zzso shows that the only zzso zzso directly on the active site that were not zzso in the two zzso are zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso These zzso of human zzso were each zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing both zzso was also zzso The zzso zzso forms were expressed in zzso cells, and their properties were compared with those of the normal zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso forms all had apparent zzso values within zzso that of the wild type zzso and the specific activity of the zzso were within zzso of that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are selective zzso zzso that act as zzso zzso of zzso and rapidly zzso competitive zzso of zzso The single zzso zzso Val zzso increased the sensitivity to each of these selective zzso with most of the effect detected using instantaneous zzso zzso except for zzso whose potency was further increased by zzso with the zzso The double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Val zzso became more sensitive to zzso by zzso and zzso than the single IV zzso and zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, the single zzso zzso did not increase the sensitivity to zzso by the selective zzso zzso The potency of a selective zzso zzso zzso was decreased zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso All the results indicate that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso can strongly increase sensitivity to selective zzso zzso and restore zzso zzso They also suggest that the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are essential zzso in zzso between the interaction of zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso and their mechanism of zzso
