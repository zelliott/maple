The membrane zzso zzso binds zzso zzso saturated with vitamin B12 zzso zzso and mediates cellular zzso of the zzso The specificity of zzso for zzso and of the zzso for zzso ensures efficient zzso of zzso into zzso The zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso was investigated using deletions and zzso of zzso acid sequences in zzso Only the zzso region zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso but the zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso are of no importance for this zzso zzso the zzso region zzso zzso that separates the two zzso zzso zzso type A zzso zzso does not affect zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso charged zzso zzso involved in zzso binding are critical zzso of zzso zzso The zzso tail is apparently crucial for zzso of the zzso Within this region, the zzso motif and the zzso binding motifs zzso appear to be involved in initiating and completing the process of zzso zzso zzso and deletions of these regions involved in binding and zzso of zzso are likely to produce the zzso and clinical zzso of zzso zzso
