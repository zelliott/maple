zzso regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso and their associated genes are linked to a mechanism of acquired resistance against zzso zzso can integrate short stretches of zzso sequences zzso within zzso zzso to become zzso zzso In this study, we further characterized the efficiency of zzso as a zzso resistance mechanism in zzso zzso First, we show that zzso is distinct from previously known zzso defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso of 30 zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicate that the addition of one new zzso in zzso is the most frequent outcome of a zzso challenge and that the zzso addition of zzso increases the overall zzso resistance of the zzso The added new zzso have a size of between 29 to 31 zzso with 30 being by far the most zzso Comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired zzso with the complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that the newly added zzso must be identical to a region (named zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso a zzso resistance zzso Moreover, we found a zzso sequence zzso located downstream of the zzso region that is important for the zzso resistance zzso Finally, we show through the analyses of 20 zzso zzso that virulent zzso are rapidly evolving through single zzso zzso as well as zzso in response to zzso
