One of the final steps in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is the packaging of a single zzso into a zzso empty head zzso In addition to the zzso zzso the packaging zzso zzso protein zzso is required for efficient DNA zzso In this study, we demonstrate an interaction between zzso and the major head zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso that reduced the strength of this interaction also decreased the biological activity of zzso zzso that this head binding activity is essential for the function of zzso We also show that zzso is a zzso zzso and the zzso domain is responsible for the head binding zzso Using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso we determined the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain and characterized the zzso nature of the zzso zzso Through structural zzso we were able to identify two previously zzso zzso proteins with zzso structures similar to zzso although they lack significant zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis of these diverse zzso led us to identify related proteins in a variety of zzso and zzso revealing that zzso function has a more highly zzso role in zzso zzso than was previously zzso Finally, we present a novel model for the mechanism of zzso zzso activity in the DNA packaging reaction of zzso zzso
