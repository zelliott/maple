Two new technologies have made the study of proteins by mass zzso zzso zzso with molecular masses of up to more than 100 zzso can be analyzed at zzso sensitivities to give simple mass zzso corresponding to the intact zzso This development has allowed unprecedented accuracy in the determination of the molecular weights of zzso A number of zzso zzso are used to present the revolutionary impact that these powerful new ways of looking at proteins are having on biological zzso
