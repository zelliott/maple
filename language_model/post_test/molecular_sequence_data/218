Ras zzso zzso family zzso play a pivotal role in the regulation of numerous cellular functions associated with zzso transformation and zzso To evaluate the role of these zzso in zzso cancer, the zzso expression levels in matched sets of tumor and zzso zzso from surgical specimens were zzso The relationship between the zzso levels in tumor zzso to the zzso features was also zzso 

A total of 68 patients with zzso zzso were recruited and the levels of zzso and zzso zzso transcripts in cancer, zzso and normal zzso were characterized by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso Their correlation to clinical zzso parameters was zzso 

The levels of zzso and zzso zzso transcripts in zzso zzso were significantly higher than those in the matched zzso and normal zzso from the same patient zzso The expression levels of both genes were significantly correlated with zzso of cancer cells to zzso zzso and liver zzso The levels of zzso expression were significantly correlated with the zzso degree of cancer, while the expression of zzso was correlated with the extent of local invasion to zzso 

This is the first study with zzso to examine the expressions of zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso of Chinese zzso The significantly zzso zzso and zzso expressions suggest that they may contribute to the zzso development, invasion and zzso of zzso zzso in Chinese zzso
