zzso zzso is a novel zzso protein isolated and characterized from a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is a single 101 zzso acid chain containing two zzso zzso bonds and considerable internal sequence duplication, but no significant zzso to previously described proteins or to the zzso products of known zzso zzso In solution, zzso exists largely as a zzso protein with internal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diverse laboratory zzso primary zzso and zzso of zzso as well as strains of zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso binds with extremely high affinity to highly zzso binding zzso on the viral envelope zzso zzso preventing zzso fusion, viral entry and infection of zzso The zzso binding site appears to zzso but is not identical with, the unique zzso zzso zzso and may lie predominantly within an zzso zzso region of zzso zzso is undergoing zzso development for topical zzso zzso zzso zzso applications to prevent sexual transmission of zzso Since zzso may be zzso in humans, methods for using zzso for ex zzso zzso of zzso in blood, zzso or putative vaccines preferably would allow for its exclusion from zzso for zzso zzso To explore this concept we zzso zzso zzso and coupled it to zzso coated magnetic beads to provide a product which we termed zzso zzso zzso When reacted with a laboratory strain and a primary isolate of zzso 1, the zzso completely zzso 100 zzso of the zzso However zzso of the viral extracts indicated that only a fraction of the virus was removed by the zzso leaving behind a relatively larger fraction of zzso virus in the zzso which we designated as replication incompetent zzso zzso It would be worthwhile investigating the role of zzso as a putative zzso zzso
