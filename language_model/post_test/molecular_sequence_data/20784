There are two zzso and two zzso zzso sites on the zzso zzso of factor X (FX) involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The purpose of this study was to explore the contribution of carbohydrates of the FX zzso zzso to zzso recognition by zzso zzso 

The putative zzso sites were zzso individually or in combinations with Ala and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso The entire zzso zzso up to the zzso zzso was deleted in another zzso 

It was discovered that zzso of zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso on zzso charged zzso zzso has been improved zzso independent of a zzso These zzso were activated with slightly lower zzso efficiency zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso complex, though both zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were zzso With the exception of approximately zzso improvement in the zzso of zzso the zzso efficiency of zzso toward zzso was decreased zzso in the intrinsic zzso zzso 

The zzso chains of the FX zzso zzso play an important role in restricting the specificity of zzso recognition by both zzso and zzso thereby preventing the zzso zzso of FX by these zzso On the other hand, the carbohydrates contribute to the zzso recognition of the zzso by both zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso
