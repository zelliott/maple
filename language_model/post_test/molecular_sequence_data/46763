Although it is well established that zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by all zzso the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso was found to be particularly sensitive to such zzso zzso we examined whether zzso zzso mediates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso labeling of zzso membrane proteins in the region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso affinity zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complexes from these zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the affinity column zzso with a zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by 87 zzso zzso In separate experiments, zzso of zzso on zzso zzso coated with a different zzso zzso revealed that zzso increased zzso zzso by 53 zzso zzso Finally, treatment of zzso whole zzso with zzso resulted in a 90 zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso that was abolished by zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These results provide the first evidence that protein zzso A mediates zzso of zzso both in zzso and in zzso and provides a basis for the preferential zzso of zzso zzso signaling in zzso by zzso
