Human zzso zzso is a part of a major zzso zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso family of genes is highly zzso and our aim is to describe novel zzso at the zzso locus and determine how they alter zzso metabolism and drug zzso One hundred healthy Japanese adults volunteered for the present zzso We zzso zzso fragments of the gene directly, and calculated the frequency of the genetic variations zzso To measure zzso zzso activity, we constructed five expression models and used zzso as the zzso in the zzso We identified six novel single zzso zzso zzso Of these, four caused zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the remaining two were silent zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found five types of zzso having differing zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies found that the zzso changed the zzso efficiencies ( zzso zzso to zzso of the wild type for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Several zzso zzso zzso exist in the Japanese population, having different levels of zzso These zzso are capable of affecting the steady state levels of zzso and may increase sensitivity to adverse drug zzso
