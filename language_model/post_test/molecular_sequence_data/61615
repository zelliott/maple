The activities of zzso zzso zzso 1), a principal cellular zzso that reverses zzso protein zzso can be altered by zzso whose activities are themselves regulated by zzso We now describe a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso The shorter zzso that encodes this zzso zzso is expressed in brain, stomach, small zzso colon and zzso whereas a longer zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in zzso Human zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso contains a consensus zzso motif at zzso 21-25 and consensus sites for zzso by zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso A or zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso after zzso by zzso zzso can even enhance zzso activity by zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso is inactive in both zzso Each of the zzso in zzso acids located in potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso decrease the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso in the potential zzso zzso site zzso also dramatically decrease the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso Interestingly, when zzso zzso is further zzso by zzso it no longer zzso zzso Thus, zzso is well positioned to integrate zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to regulate zzso protein zzso patterns in brain and zzso zzso its closest family member zzso zzso zzso zzso and two other family members, zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso probably zzso integrated control of protein zzso states in these and other zzso
