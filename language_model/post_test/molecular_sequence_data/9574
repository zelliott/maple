To investigate the correlation between zzso gene promoter zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 5 through 9 in 198 zzso primary zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso and direct zzso 

zzso gene promoter zzso and zzso zzso were detected in zzso and zzso of tumors, zzso Both were higher in males than in females and in smokers than in zzso A higher prevalence of zzso promoter zzso was found in patients with advanced stage tumors than those with zzso stage zzso zzso gene zzso were more frequent in zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso than zzso All such differences were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly higher in tumors with zzso zzso than in those without zzso zzso A significantly higher prevalence of zzso zzso was found in tumors with only zzso zzso in zzso gene than those without zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference zzso zzso zzso was still statistically significant zzso zzso in smokers zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso or patients with advanced tumors zzso zzso zzso after adjusting for age and zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso in zzso gene in zzso
