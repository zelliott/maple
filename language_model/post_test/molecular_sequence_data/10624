A bacterial strain which is able to degrade zzso was previously isolated from the zzso zone of an oil zzso column and described as zzso zzso strain zzso However, zzso species have been transferred to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso analysis and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso DNA zzso sequence zzso The zzso content of strain zzso is zzso zzso The cell wall zzso contains zzso acid as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso The cellular fatty acid profile of strain zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso similarity of strain zzso with previously described zzso species is zzso zzso zzso and a zzso tree based on zzso zzso sequences revealed a distinct lineage for strain zzso within the evolutionary radiation enclosed by the zzso zzso zzso on the basis of our data, we propose that strain zzso should be placed in the zzso zzso as a member of a new species, zzso zzso The type strain of the new species is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
