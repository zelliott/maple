By zzso expression of zzso derived from a Ewing zzso cell line in zzso cells, we isolated a transforming gene zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso to the cot zzso which encodes a novel zzso zzso Whereas the cot product was truncated at its zzso end as a result of gene zzso during zzso zzso encodes the normal cot zzso Thus, this gene can be activated as an zzso by zzso as well as by gene zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso formed progressively growing colonies in soft zzso and were zzso in nude zzso The zzso zzso transcript was expressed at low level in both human zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the tumor promoter, zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso but not serum or zzso growth factor zzso induced increased expression of the zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we localized the zzso gene to the short arm of human zzso 10 at band zzso
