A potentially zzso expansion of T cells expressing T cell zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso A humanized zzso zzso directed against these T cells has been developed to further investigate the role of this zzso of T cells in zzso The zzso and safety of zzso zzso zzso zzso over 30 zzso were investigated in 14 patients with zzso The effect of treatment on zzso expression and zzso to peptides of zzso basic protein zzso was also zzso zzso was well tolerated and raised no safety zzso zzso of the zzso was low and elimination zzso was approximately 3 zzso The majority of the target zzso expressing T cells were depleted for at least 18 zzso The small remaining fraction of target cells showed a marked decrease in their zzso zzso which was recovered within 8 zzso The numbers of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso with spontaneous expression of zzso was decreased at 72 h and 8 weeks after treatment, whilst no clear effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso expression were zzso There was also a significant decrease in the number of zzso producing zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso We conclude that long-term depletion of T cells expressing defined zzso zzso in zzso patients is feasible using selective zzso The selective depletion of zzso expressing T cells in this study resulted in a decrease in potentially disease promoting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
