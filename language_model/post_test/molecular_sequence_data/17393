zzso zzso zzso is an acquired zzso disorder characterized by severe zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso patients have circulating zzso that bind to zzso and zzso zzso Previously, we showed that zzso was a component of the zzso complex recognized by zzso zzso In the present study we generated a zzso zzso zzso against human zzso The zzso bound to zzso cell surfaces and reacted with the zzso zzso zzso confirming its specificity for zzso The variable regions of the heavy zzso and light zzso chain genes were cloned from the zzso and shown to belong to mouse H chain zzso III and zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso The L chain of zzso was zzso identical to the k chains of some zzso and zzso acid zzso and had an identical zzso acid sequence in all three complementary determining regions, suggesting that the H chains determine the specificity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of clinical, zzso and zzso criteria for diagnosing zzso
