The ancestors of zzso and zzso were once zzso bacteria that became zzso as a result of zzso According to this theory, a key bacterial division zzso zzso plays a role in zzso division in algae and plants as well as in zzso division in lower zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso division is a process that combines features derived from the bacterial division system with features contributed by host zzso zzso Two zzso versions of zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso zzso whereas most bacteria have a single zzso zzso To examine whether there is also more than one type of zzso in zzso zzso (red zzso zzso and zzso that originated from the secondary zzso of red zzso and in zzso we obtained zzso sequences from the complete sequence of the primitive red zzso zzso zzso and the draft sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses that included known zzso proteins identified two types of zzso zzso in red algae zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso These analyses also showed that zzso emerged after the red and green lineages diverged, while zzso arose by the zzso of an zzso gene that in turn descended from a red zzso engulfed by the zzso of zzso A comparison of the predicted proteins showed that like bacterial zzso and zzso zzso zzso has a short zzso zzso sequence (the zzso core zzso whereas zzso and zzso like the zzso zzso lack this zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso two types of zzso zzso zzso one of which lacks the zzso variable zzso These results suggest that the acquisition of an additional zzso protein with a modified C zzso was common to the primary and secondary zzso that produced zzso and that this also occurred during the establishment of zzso presumably to regulate the zzso of these zzso
