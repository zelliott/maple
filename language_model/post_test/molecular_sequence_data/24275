The zzso zzso domain of zzso the plasma membrane zzso zzso of zzso contains a binding site for zzso zzso II zzso To examine the zzso role of the zzso interaction, zzso exchange activity of zzso zzso cells was monitored by following the changes in zzso pH associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange was reduced zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso which indicates that zzso activity is required for full zzso transport zzso zzso zzso unable to bind zzso had significantly lower transport activity than zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that a direct interaction was zzso To determine the effect of displacement of zzso zzso zzso from its binding site on zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso for a functionally inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso inhibited 61 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso A similar effect of zzso zzso was found for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso transport activity and allows for zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso forms a transport zzso a membrane protein complex involved in regulation of zzso metabolism and zzso
