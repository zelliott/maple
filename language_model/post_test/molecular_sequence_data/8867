We simultaneously examined the bacteria, zzso and zzso communities in zzso from four zzso sites in Japan using zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and statistical analyses to test the effects of environmental factors including soil properties on these communities depending on geographical zzso zzso analyses such as Principal component analysis zzso and zzso analysis zzso revealed that the compositions of the three soil zzso communities were strongly affected by geographical sites, which were in turn strongly associated with soil characteristics such as total C zzso total N zzso zzso ratio and annual mean soil temperature zzso In particular, the zzso zzso and zzso ratio had stronger effects on bacterial and zzso communities than on the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso cluster analysis using the combined zzso profile also indicated that all soil samples were classified into four clusters corresponding to the four sites, showing high site specificity of soil samples, and all DNA bands were classified into four zzso showing the coexistence of specific zzso bands of bacteria, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that geography relative to soil properties has a simultaneous impact on soil microbial and zzso community zzso This is the first combined profile analysis of bacteria, zzso and zzso at different sites with agricultural zzso
