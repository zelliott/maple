zzso attachment regions zzso can be zzso defined as DNA fragments that bind to the nuclear zzso We have created a library of randomly obtained zzso from tobacco zzso zzso by cloning DNA fragments that zzso with nuclear zzso prepared by a method involving zzso zzso The interactions of several of the cloned zzso with nuclear zzso were tested by an in zzso binding zzso in which zzso DNA was used as zzso Based on this zzso the zzso were classified as strong, zzso and weak zzso Examples of each of the binding classes were further studied by in zzso binding using zzso and zzso Estimates of zzso zzso for several zzso ranged from 6 to 11 zzso and correlated zzso with binding zzso The number of binding sites per zzso for several zzso ranged from 4 zzso zzso to 9 zzso zzso and correlated directly with binding zzso We conclude that binding strength, as we have measured it, is a function of both numbers of binding sites and affinity for the zzso The tobacco zzso were zzso and analyzed for overall AT content, for distribution of zzso regions, and for the abundance of several zzso zzso Previously identified zzso motifs correlate to various degrees with binding zzso zzso the zzso zzso II motif does not correlate with binding strength of the tobacco zzso A newly identified zzso the zzso zzso zzso better with binding strength than any of the previously identified motifs we zzso
