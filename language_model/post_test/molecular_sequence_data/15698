zzso plays an important role in regulation of nervous system development and zzso We are developing zzso zzso zzso as a model system to study the role of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in development and the effects of nicotine on the developing zzso nervous zzso We previously characterized the expression of several zzso zzso zzso To further develop the zzso model, here we report a study on the molecular characterization of two additional zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso have a high degree of sequence identity to zzso expressed in a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to show that both zzso zzso zzso were expressed early in zzso development, with the zzso transcript present at 3 hours zzso zzso and the zzso zzso present at 10 zzso In zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in 24, 48, 72, and 96 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were each expressed in a unique pattern, which changed during zzso At various ages, zzso was expressed in zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Most notably, zzso was expressed in zzso zzso in the zzso but was also present in zzso cells in both zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells supports the use of zzso as a valid model system to better understand the molecular basis of zzso regulation of zzso signaling and the role of zzso zzso in Parkinson's zzso The most notable zzso expression was in neural crest cells at 24 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso at 48 zzso zzso zzso exhibited a widespread and robust expression pattern in the zzso in 72 zzso and 96 zzso zzso
