The zzso primary transcript zzso alternative zzso in three zzso sites: the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the more complex zzso zzso We have shown previously that an zzso region within the zzso zzso is necessary for zzso recognition and that this region contains at least two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a nearby zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the function of both elements in different cell zzso We have mapped the zzso to the zzso level, showing that a single base change is sufficient to abolish its zzso Testing of the zzso and zzso elements in zzso zzso individually or as part of the complete zzso regulatory region, showed that only the zzso element is active in different zzso zzso studies coupled to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso sequence zzso suggest that the role of the zzso element may be exclusively to ensure the proper zzso zzso and raise the possibility that the display of the zzso element in a loop position may represent a significant feature of the zzso zzso zzso
