The zzso salt export pump zzso or zzso mediates the zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso across the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso in the corresponding zzso gene cause progressive familial zzso zzso type zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of human zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso First, a zzso human zzso promoter region was zzso zzso analysis for possible regulatory elements showed a zzso X zzso responsive element zzso at position minus zzso The zzso X zzso zzso functions as a zzso with the zzso X zzso alpha zzso and can be activated by the zzso salt zzso acid zzso zzso reporter gene zzso showed that the zzso promoter is positively controlled by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strongly zzso the zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso regulation was studied in zzso cells, zzso expressing the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was induced by adding zzso zzso to the culture zzso and this effect was zzso by combining it with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels using zzso interference fully zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these results show that zzso is required for the zzso zzso zzso control of the human zzso gene and that the cellular amount of zzso is critical for the level of zzso of zzso zzso
