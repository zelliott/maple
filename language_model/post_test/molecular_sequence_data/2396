zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene is considered a fundamental event in the formation of several types of human zzso A substantial proportion of RB gene zzso are partial or complete deletions that extend an unknown distance beyond one or both ends of the zzso To provide a framework for measuring the extent of these zzso we have constructed a long-range restriction map of zzso sites spanning zzso zzso around the RB zzso This map was applied in a molecular analysis of RB gene deletion in breast cancer cell line zzso A previous study of this cell line demonstrated deletion of the entire RB gene except for zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Lee, Science zzso zzso zzso clones containing the deletion junction were isolated from a library made from zzso zzso A probe obtained from the far side of the deletion junction was used to zzso and clone the unknown 3' zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso in this case was a simple deletion spanning 200 zzso zzso analysis of the deletion junction indicated a conservative deletion with no loss or gain of zzso The deletion zzso had no sequence zzso to each other or to any repetitive sequence family, such as zzso so the zzso event was zzso zzso analysis of this and other RB gene deletions is important for understanding molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
