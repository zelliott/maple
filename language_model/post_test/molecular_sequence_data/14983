zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso plant species that is highly tolerant of freezing zzso zzso zzso is a major player in various zzso processes involved in plant growth and development and stress zzso A recent study has found that the zzso of zzso synthesis decreases the chilling tolerance of zzso zzso callus zzso Wu et zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso the key zzso of zzso zzso from the leaves of zzso zzso with the aim of zzso our understanding of the role of zzso at the molecular zzso zzso gamma zzso was found to zzso a zzso acid protein with moderate to high zzso sequence similar to previously reported plant zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso transcripts were detected in the zzso roots and leaves of zzso zzso but there was no zzso zzso The transcripts of zzso gamma zzso accumulated both rapidly and at high levels when zzso zzso was treated with chilling (4 degrees zzso freezing zzso degrees zzso several other environmental stresses (such as heat, zzso zzso and heavy zzso zzso acid and hydrogen zzso These results suggest that zzso gamma zzso may participate in the cellular responses against multiple environmental stimuli in zzso zzso
