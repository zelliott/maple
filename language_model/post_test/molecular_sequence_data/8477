We zzso the zzso of alpha and beta zzso receptors zzso including zzso J, and zzso regions, expressed by 54 zzso basic protein zzso zzso clones generated from the peripheral blood of 15 multiple sclerosis zzso patients and three normal zzso Thirteen V alpha gene zzso 18 V beta gene zzso 23 zzso alpha zzso and 30 zzso beta sequences were represented among these zzso Some zzso motifs were common to several clones that shared zzso zzso while other motifs were common to clones with diverse zzso zzso The extensive zzso of zzso gene expression in the human immune response to zzso indicates that therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking a limited number of zzso are unlikely to fully suppress the zzso response to zzso in zzso
