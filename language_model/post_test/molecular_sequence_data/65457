zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a bacterial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have solved the crystal structure of the zzso core of zzso in complex with zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso The structure exhibits a zzso zzso interaction and two distinct zzso zzso The zzso zzso group of zzso forms a salt bridge with the zzso group of bound zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and other zzso the equivalent zzso are zzso or zzso which cannot form a similar zzso We suggest that the local positively charged environment and the zzso constraint created by zzso mediate the selectivity of zzso binding by preventing the binding of positively charged and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso core forms a new zzso interface in which the two zzso are arranged differently than the known zzso and zzso zzso zzso The significance of there being two different zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso zzso
