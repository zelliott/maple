zzso organization is a fundamental zzso in zzso zzso and a striking feature of the zzso zzso a zzso factor, has recently been zzso as a marker of cells in the layer 5 of the zzso We further pursued the distribution of zzso to investigate the identity of the zzso cells in the zzso zzso transcript was expressed in a subset of zzso cells that were scattered throughout the entire zzso of layer zzso In the rat cortex, zzso transcripts were first detected in the zzso zone at zzso remained expressed in putative prospective layer 5 zzso during infant and juvenile zzso The zzso zzso in adult layer 5 zzso did not segregate with the zzso of the projection zzso By retrograde labeling combined with zzso or reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, we found zzso expression in nearly all of the layer 5 zzso projecting to the spinal zzso or to the superior zzso while in only one-third of the layer 5 zzso projecting to the zzso zzso zzso was also detected in layer 5 zzso in a zzso Japanese zzso monkey but not in adult monkey zzso These findings suggest that a zzso class defined by a molecular criterion does not necessarily segregate with that defined by an anatomical zzso that zzso is involved in cell differentiation of a subset of layer 5 projection zzso and that this mechanism is zzso among zzso and zzso
