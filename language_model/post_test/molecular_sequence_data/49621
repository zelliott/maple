The reported draft human zzso sequence includes many zzso that are separated by gaps of unknown zzso These gaps may be due to zzso regions that are not present in the zzso coli libraries used for DNA sequencing because they cannot be cloned zzso if at all, in zzso Using a zzso artificial zzso zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso library generated in zzso we found that approximately zzso of human DNA sequences tested transformed zzso coli cells less efficiently than zzso cells, and were less stable in zzso coli than in zzso When the ends of several zzso zzso cloned in zzso were zzso and compared with the reported draft zzso major inconsistencies were found with the sequences of those zzso zzso that transformed zzso coli cells zzso Two human zzso fragments were zzso from human DNA by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these regions showed that the errors in the draft are the results of both zzso and loss of specific DNA sequences during cloning in zzso zzso These results show that zzso cloning might be a valuable method that could be widely used during the final stages of the Human Genome zzso
