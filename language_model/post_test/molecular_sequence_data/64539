A zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was grown at 4 and 20 degrees C, and total soluble proteins extracted from the cells were analyzed by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso of these patterns showed that the cellular content of a protein with a molecular mass of 28 zzso and an zzso point of four greatly increased at 4 degrees C compared to that at 20 degrees zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso followed by the cloning and sequencing of the gene zzso this zzso revealed that this protein is a member of the zzso family of proteins with an zzso acid sequence identity of zzso to zzso coli zzso This protein was zzso in zzso coli in a zzso form, zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso zzso zzso When this activity was determined by the zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso at various temperatures, the protein exhibited the highest activity at 10 degrees C with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 and 20 degrees C, the protein exhibited higher activity at 10 degrees C with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso values are lower but comparable to those of zzso coli zzso We propose that a zzso family protein is involved in zzso of zzso zzso
