Recently we demonstrated the zzso of deletion zzso in the zzso region of human zzso zzso in human primitive zzso tumors zzso zzso disruption was shown to occur between the two markers zzso and zzso a region previously shown to be deleted in the zzso zzso To characterize the molecular basis of this zzso instability, we established clone zzso covering this zzso An initial physical map of zzso zzso has been constructed with overlapping sets of zzso zzso clones were transformed into five clone zzso according to their content of 30 previously known and 16 newly established zzso sites zzso To circumvent the complications inherent in zzso technologies, such as internal zzso zzso and complex zzso we then converted the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Thirty-nine individual zzso clones were identified and were used to construct six different zzso zzso ranging from 130 to 1200 zzso in size and covering approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso The composite zzso map covers a region of zzso 6 zzso of zzso DNA consisting of four different clone zzso of up to zzso zzso in zzso We have demonstrated that three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso suggesting the occurrence of low abundant repetitive sequences in this zzso By integration of publicly available information we further mapped 10 genes and zzso to their precise zzso positions and thus could exclude or identify them as candidate genes for zzso and/or the zzso zzso
