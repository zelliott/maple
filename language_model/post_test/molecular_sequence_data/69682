We are using the zzso gene as a model system to study the control of expression of the genes zzso zzso peptides during the zzso immune zzso In order to investigate the putative regulatory regions in the zzso promoter, we performed zzso zzso experiments combined with zzso zzso in two zzso zzso the zzso fat body and a zzso zzso blood cell zzso Our results confirm the importance of zzso zzso elements previously described in the immune response of insects and reveal for the first time the involvement of other regions containing sequences zzso to zzso zzso response zzso
