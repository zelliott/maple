The proteins zzso and zzso are essential for initiation of zzso zzso In dividing cells, zzso accumulates during zzso and is zzso during the S and zzso cell cycle zzso A zzso degradation zzso including an essential zzso zzso site at zzso regulates zzso zzso during cell division and links zzso zzso to the cell zzso zzso within this signal abolish periodic degradation of zzso protein in dividing zzso In mice expressing zzso or zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulate zzso in zzso zzso this restriction is relieved by zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Thus, periodic destruction of zzso protein couples zzso zzso to cell cycle zzso Using transgenic mice expressing the zzso zzso zzso and a functional T cell zzso beta chain, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso to the cell cycle is not essential for enforcement of zzso zzso
