A series of zzso virus zzso zzso cell lines which are zzso with regard to expression of zzso protein and zzso were characterized for their ability to transcribe the zzso zzso zzso chain extension zzso showed that zzso zzso levels in these cells were determined predominantly at the zzso zzso The zzso promoter and zzso sequences were fused to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso the ability of the resulting expression zzso to drive zzso zzso expression after zzso into these zzso cell lines was zzso The activity of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso in primary zzso was also zzso The zzso promoter was expressed zzso in these zzso however, no correlation was found between the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was functional in some but not all zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso was mapped to a zzso pair zzso extending from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso three elements within this zzso recently shown to be necessary for zzso function in a zzso zzso cell line were also essential for zzso zzso function in the rat zzso cell line zzso A zzso zzso was identified which could suppress the expression of the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that multiple regulatory sequences may act zzso to determine efficient zzso expression of the zzso zzso
