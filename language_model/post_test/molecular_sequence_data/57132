zzso to synthetic peptides of human zzso 1 beta zzso zzso and to zzso human zzso beta were used to identify zzso of zzso beta associated with the zzso of its biological zzso Analysis of zzso raised to 17 synthetic peptides derived from the mature zzso beta sequence showed that five regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both zzso and zzso Using a zzso zzso mapping method, comparison of the regions recognized by four zzso rabbit zzso with those recognized by a rabbit zzso raised to zzso zzso beta suggested two further zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind to the peptides zzso and zzso by zzso binding and zzso All of these regions appear predominantly on one face of zzso zzso The effect of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso which lie within this face, on zzso binding and biological activity was zzso Most of the zzso tested affected both zzso binding and activity, whereas zzso in another face of zzso beta zzso zzso had no zzso zzso of two of the zzso with reduced zzso and zzso binding and analysis by two-dimensional zzso indicated no gross changes in zzso zzso A third zzso had reduced zzso in two different zzso but no change in zzso zzso Although two-dimensional zzso revealed no gross changes in zzso small changes did occur at a site zzso from that zzso The data are consistent with other zzso mapping and zzso binding zzso data and suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso recognize different but overlapping regions of zzso zzso
