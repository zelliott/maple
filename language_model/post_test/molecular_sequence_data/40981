In zzso zzso the precise zzso of sodium channels at the zzso initial segment zzso ensures action potential zzso This zzso precedes the zzso of membrane proteins and lipids by a diffusion barrier at the zzso Using zzso zzso we measured the mobility of a zzso zzso channel bearing the zzso motif of the zzso sodium zzso We found that zzso G zzso limits membrane diffusion of zzso channels when zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with decreased affinity for zzso exhibit increased diffusion zzso In immature zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso channel zzso by zzso is regulated by protein zzso zzso and occurs as soon as zzso accumulates at the zzso of zzso zzso Once the diffusion barrier is formed, zzso is still required to stabilize zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that specific binding to zzso constitutes the initial step for zzso channel zzso at the zzso membrane and precedes the establishment of the diffusion zzso
