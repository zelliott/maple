zzso B zzso is the zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso groups from zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In man, a zzso of this zzso activity causes the zzso storage disorder, zzso disease zzso Type zzso zzso zzso zzso VI in zzso cats also has been zzso and the comparative zzso and zzso abnormalities of the human and zzso disorders have been well zzso The present study describes the isolation and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the assignment of the zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso sequence is 1939 zzso including 3 and zzso zzso of zzso and 3' untranslated zzso respectively, and a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted human and zzso zzso proteins are zzso identical and zzso zzso However, despite this high zzso the predicted zzso zzso zzso has nine zzso zzso while the human zzso has zzso The presence of the extra zzso zzso at position zzso in the zzso zzso may explain why zzso zzso is a zzso and the human zzso is a zzso To facilitate comparative zzso studies of the human and zzso zzso and to initiate zzso gene therapy trials in the zzso VI zzso a full-length zzso zzso zzso was reconstructed from a zzso partial zzso and an zzso zzso amplified from zzso zzso zzso by the zzso chain zzso The functional integrity of this zzso was demonstrated by transient expression in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
