We studied the bacterial communities in biological soil zzso zzso from the Colorado zzso by enrichment and zzso and by statistically analyzed zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso of environmental zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso tens of zzso apart, consisting of 10 equally spaced samples each, were zzso zzso communities consistently displayed less richness zzso zzso zzso bands per zzso and Shannon diversity zzso than typical soil communities, with apparent dominance by few zzso In spite of some degree of small-scale zzso significant differences in diversity and community structure among zzso was zzso probably related to the degree of crust zzso zzso zzso surveys indicated that the zzso zzso zzso was dominant, with zzso zzso second among zzso Among the 48 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were very common and diverse, with 18 zzso and an average contribution to the total zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso contributed around zzso each; zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were common zzso However, the second largest contribution was made by zzso zzso zzso zzso with some of them representing candidate bacterial zzso Many of the novel strains isolated are likely new zzso and some were representatives of the zzso detected in the zzso The zzso or zzso nature of many of these zzso speaks for their role in crust zzso
