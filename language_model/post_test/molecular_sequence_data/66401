The second zzso zzso has been extensively studied for half a century, but the plethora of regulatory mechanisms controlling zzso synthesis in zzso cells is just beginning to be zzso In zzso cells, zzso is produced by two evolutionary related families of zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These two zzso families serve distinct zzso zzso They share a zzso overall architecture in their zzso zzso and a common zzso zzso but they differ in their zzso zzso and responses to various zzso The major regulators of zzso are zzso G zzso which zzso zzso signals via G zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, are regulated by the zzso signaling molecules zzso and zzso Here, we discuss and compare the zzso structural and regulatory characteristics of the two zzso zzso zzso This comparison reveals the mechanisms underlying their different properties but also illustrates many unifying themes for these evolutionary related signaling zzso
