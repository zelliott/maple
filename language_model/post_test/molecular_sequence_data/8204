An essential step in zzso zzso is the binding of zzso zzso to specific zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso While there is agreement on the primary role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso there is a striking lack of consensus on both the terminal zzso required for a functional binding site and the zzso protein on the zzso cell surface that recognizes this zzso Much current debate centers on the essential role of zzso terminal zzso or zzso zzso zzso to form a functional zzso binding zzso zzso to this debate, we demonstrated that alpha zzso zzso zzso which adds zzso terminal zzso zzso to zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso or zzso The objectives of this study were to determine whether alpha zzso is expressed in female germ cells and to compare the pattern of expression of two other terminal zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso between male and female germ zzso Total zzso was isolated from growing zzso obtained from zzso animals, fully grown zzso and eggs as well as zzso zzso and zzso The presence of alpha zzso beta zzso and alpha zzso zzso was analyzed by an zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the alpha zzso gene is expressed in female germ cells, but not in male germ zzso In contrast, both beta zzso and alpha zzso are expressed during zzso and zzso This differential expression of alpha zzso in female germ cells is consistent with the model of zzso binding in which a zzso terminal zzso zzso is required for a functional zzso on zzso and with our hypothesis that the biological significance for the suppression of alpha zzso expression in male germ cells is to prevent zzso zzso
