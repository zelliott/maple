The zzso coli Rob protein is a zzso factor belonging to the zzso protein family that regulates genes involved in resistance to zzso organic zzso and heavy zzso The genes zzso these proteins are activated by the zzso proteins zzso and zzso although the level of zzso can vary for the different zzso zzso Here we report a zzso A crystal structure of Rob in complex with the zzso promoter that reveals an unusual mode of binding to zzso The zzso complex differs from the previously reported structure of zzso bound to the zzso promoter, in that only one of Rob's dual zzso zzso motifs engages the major groove of the binding zzso zzso studies show that sequence specific interactions involving only one of Rob's zzso motifs are sufficient for high affinity binding to zzso The two different modes of DNA binding seen in crystal structures of Rob and zzso also match the distinctive patterns of DNA protection by zzso at several sites within the zzso zzso These and other findings suggest that gene zzso by zzso zzso factors might involve two alternative modes of binding to DNA in different promoter zzso
