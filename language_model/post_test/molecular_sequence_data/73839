zzso II type 2 zzso zzso is highly expressed in the fetal zzso and decreases rapidly after zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the adult zzso zzso zzso Recently, it has been reported that zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso we have cloned human zzso zzso zzso and mapped it to the zzso To further analyze the organization and function of the zzso zzso zzso in this study we cloned the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso gene is composed of three zzso and two zzso zzso extension analysis revealed a putative zzso initiation site at 24 zzso downstream from zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified a zzso zzso in 3' untranslated region of zzso 3, which may be a useful genetic marker for genetic analysis of human zzso inherited zzso In this study, we zzso that the patients with premature zzso failure, which has been reported to be linked with zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso that may contribute to the early onset of zzso We examined the entire coding sequence of this zzso in two different families of sisters with premature zzso failure zzso but found no changes in zzso zzso
