A zzso zzso protein zzso exhibiting an zzso signal sequence for zzso zzso membrane zzso and a zzso zzso region was isolated by screening the zzso of a zzso zzso bovine zzso cell line with zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was found to be most closely related to the zzso DNA sequence of zzso zzso zzso database, zzso and the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is expressed within the zzso zzso and zzso stages of the zzso zzso that it is zzso transcribed throughout the zzso life zzso zzso zzso were found between zzso originating from different geographical regions, however not affecting zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the protein was found to be both located in the zzso zzso and to zzso with a zzso protein of the zzso within infected zzso
