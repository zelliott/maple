The zzso placement of two closely related freshwater zzso zzso and zzso was assessed by using zzso analysis of zzso characters, partial sequences of the large zzso zzso DNA and restriction site variations in the internal transcribed zzso zzso The two zzso have some zzso features that are used to define zzso in both the zzso and zzso and, zzso their zzso relationships are zzso Equally weighted analyses of zzso zzso characters produced unresolved zzso trees and unequivocal conclusions could not be drawn based on the zzso zzso The zzso chain zzso ITS region was variable in length between the two zzso and restriction sites in the ITS region were zzso Analysis of variation in restriction sites in the ITS region placed zzso and zzso in one zzso with zzso sampled from zzso About 350 zzso of DNA sequence from the zzso end of the large zzso zzso were also zzso In zzso analysis of the sequence data with zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso showed a closer relationship to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso than to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso
