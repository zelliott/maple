The b gene encodes a zzso regulator of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Certain b zzso participate in zzso an zzso interaction that zzso alters zzso The moderately transcribed zzso zzso zzso reduces the zzso of the highly transcribed zzso zzso in a zzso zzso such that the zzso zzso becomes zzso To identify the zzso sequences required for zzso we used zzso or zzso zzso to isolate zzso zzso with zzso an zzso that is insensitive to zzso and has distinct zzso zzso Physical mapping of the zzso zzso showed that most of the crossovers were in a small region near the zzso end of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that the ability to cause and respond to zzso and the control of zzso expression both zzso to the zzso region of the zzso The 3' boundary of these functions lies just upstream of the translation initiation zzso The zzso boundary has been estimated to be no more than zzso zzso further upstream zzso zzso Thus, sequences critical for zzso lie upstream of the b coding sequences and may include zzso regulatory zzso
