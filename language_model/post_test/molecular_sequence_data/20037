Research to understand and zzso coastal pollution is moving toward a zzso approach in which traditional zzso of zzso indicators is accompanied by molecular analysis of a variety of zzso Technology that rapidly detects multiple microbial zzso would benefit from such an zzso The zzso 100 system is a suspension array that zzso multiple zzso rapidly in a single well of a zzso zzso The ability of the system to simultaneously detect multiple zzso indicating bacteria in environmental samples was zzso zzso sets were designed to simultaneously detect the following zzso zzso the zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity of the zzso zzso was tested against laboratory zzso In addition, sequencing, culture plate testing, and specificity testing with environmental zzso were steps taken to validate the function of the zzso with environmental zzso zzso response to cultures and to environmental samples was consistent with sequencing results, suggesting that the technology has the potential to simultaneously detect multiple targets for coastal water quality applications, particularly as progress is made to efficiently extract DNA from water and zzso zzso
