Administration of zzso zzso zzso to mice treated with zzso zzso induced zzso of a high level of gamma zzso zzso into the circulation system, while it induced no significant release in zzso zzso In order to analyze this high-level induction of zzso in these zzso mice, we investigated the factors that might be zzso An activity that zzso zzso in T cells was observed in the liver extracts of mice treated with zzso zzso and subsequently challenged with zzso Here, we zzso an zzso factor from the liver extract to zzso and characterized zzso Its molecular mass was 18 to 19 zzso and its zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso portion was determined and shown to have no similarities to any protein in the zzso zzso and zzso data zzso The same zzso was also demonstrated in the serum factor that was previously reported to have an zzso activity and to have an apparent molecular mass of 75 zzso Moreover, the activity of this serum factor was recovered in the fraction containing the zzso to zzso protein under reducing conditions and was shown to have the same zzso zzso acid sequence as that of the factor from the liver zzso In addition to the ability to induce zzso this protein zzso zzso proliferation and zzso activity in the zzso zzso Thus, several of its biological activities were apparently similar to those of zzso These results indicated that this novel zzso which exhibited marked zzso activity on zzso production in zzso was elevated zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso This factor, probably released from the producing cells by zzso zzso may be involved in the high-level induction of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
