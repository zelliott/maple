Animal African zzso is a serious constraint to livestock sector development in sub-Saharan zzso The disease, mainly caused by zzso zzso has a limitation in its diagnosis and zzso There is urgent need for a simple, rapid detection technique to replace the few available zzso tests that are of variable sensitivity and zzso Currently, there is a promising use of zzso proteins to improve on the zzso zzso to detect zzso In this respect, we have identified a zzso gene that is relatively highly expressed in zzso and blood zzso of zzso zzso According to previously obtained differential protein expression data, the gene zzso zzso is by zzso times more expressed in zzso and blood zzso than in zzso zzso and zzso The same stage specific expression pattern was shown in Western zzso zzso In addition, in zzso laser scanning zzso the zzso protein was present in the zzso and on the cell surface of zzso and blood zzso Through zzso the zzso had zzso signal zzso zzso zzso domain, single zzso zzso and short zzso domain, which is characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso surface zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso surface zzso the zzso existed as a single copy gene with a probable zzso zzso at the zzso I restriction zzso The zzso zzso zzso detected zzso against zzso as early as zzso post infection in zzso infected mouse zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso is a novel potential diagnostic zzso of Animal African zzso
