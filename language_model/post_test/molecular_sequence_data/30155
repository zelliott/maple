A simple, rapid sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso method is presented for zzso the zzso zzso and beta zzso of rabbit muscle zzso zzso The zzso procedure can yield zzso amounts of alpha and beta from a single zzso gel and also allows isolation of the zzso zzso free of zzso zzso the method provides the zzso zzso in a form amenable to structural zzso zzso degradation of alpha and zzso reveal identical zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of the zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso are in good agreement with their deduced primary zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso in alpha and 713 zzso in beta were determined by gas phase zzso zzso The data support the recently deduced primary structures of alpha zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 1988, 85, zzso
