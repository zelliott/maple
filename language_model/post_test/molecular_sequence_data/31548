zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we present crystal structures of zzso in zzso form, in complex with the zzso zzso and in complex with zzso plus the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fold with an inserted zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso a large shift of the zzso motif X tail to make it cover the zzso binding site and trigger zzso changes in motifs IV and zzso zzso zzso binds in a partly zzso state with the target zzso atom 7 zzso away from the zzso of zzso The active site of zzso with motif IV sequence zzso is more similar to DNA zzso zzso than to zzso zzso zzso and structural comparison suggests that zzso binds its zzso base similarly to DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso transcribed zzso zzso as well as a minimal zzso corresponding to zzso 72, demonstrating independence of previous modifications and zzso interactions in the zzso zzso zzso displays specificity for zzso and zzso experiments demonstrate the critical roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
