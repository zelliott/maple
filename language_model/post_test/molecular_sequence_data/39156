zzso zzso zzso are a family of structurally related zzso zzso consisting of the five zzso zzso zzso A to zzso and three newly characterized zzso zzso G to I) produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso They also work as zzso and cause food poisoning and shock symptoms in zzso In this study, we cloned a new zzso gene of the zzso and characterized its zzso properties and distribution among the clinical zzso of zzso zzso The gene encodes a 233 zzso acid protein which is highly zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed by the cloned gene exerted zzso activity on human peripheral blood zzso cells at the concentration of 100 zzso T cells bearing zzso 12, zzso zzso 14 and 15 were zzso expanded after stimulation with the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso gene was detected in the total zzso of the organisms bearing this zzso By zzso 27 out of 48 clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso possessed either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso or zzso is one of the most frequently produced zzso zzso by zzso zzso and may participate in the inflammatory process of the host by zzso a distinct set of zzso families of T zzso
