zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are characterized by expression of a hybrid zzso zzso the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso fused to a partner zzso This hybrid zzso is often zzso by the zzso zzso zzso fusion gene resulting from the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso gene at zzso may also be involved in 2 zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso which create the zzso and zzso fusion zzso zzso We report here 2 zzso with an unusual finely zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern, clearly different from the pattern observed in zzso zzso carrying zzso or its zzso A cloned complementary DNA sequence from 1 of these 2 zzso contained the zzso gene fused to the second zzso heavy chain gene (also referred to as zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso The distinctive zzso zzso zzso pattern for zzso was likely to be due to binding of the fusion protein to zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso cells and therefore presumably contributes an active promoter for the zzso zzso The fusion protein had a molecular weight zzso zzso that differs from all known zzso products, and it was zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso confirming that it is zzso active and hence capable of contributing to zzso zzso These 2 cases, therefore, represent a zzso zzso mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso and further illustrate the diversity of fusion partners for the zzso zzso
