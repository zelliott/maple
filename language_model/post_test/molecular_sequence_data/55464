zzso zzso coli zzso is an important cause of zzso mainly in developing zzso Although there are 25 different zzso zzso described in strains affecting humans, between zzso and 50% of the clinical zzso from different geographical regions are negative for these zzso suggesting that additional unidentified zzso zzso might be zzso Here, we report the discovery of zzso Surface zzso 23 zzso a novel zzso expressed by an zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso which was negative for the previously known zzso zzso albeit it has the ability to adhere to zzso zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso locus which contains 9 open reading frames zzso 7 of them sharing significant identity with genes required for assembly of zzso zzso This gene zzso named zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso ability of zzso zzso and was able to zzso this adhesive zzso to a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso major structural zzso zzso shares limited identity with known zzso zzso and it is more closely related to the zzso zzso protein zzso carried by human zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a new member of the diverse zzso repertoire used by zzso zzso
