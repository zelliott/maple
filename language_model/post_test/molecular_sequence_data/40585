Members of the zzso family of zzso factors, such as BABY BOOM zzso play important roles in cell proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but how this occurs is not zzso We have isolated three zzso genes zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cultures of zzso zzso max zzso zzso and discovered zzso to be zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso induced zzso zzso on zzso zzso and other zzso effects on zzso zzso organ zzso zzso comparisons of zzso zzso revealed the presence of ten sequence motifs outside of the zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso was specific to the zzso zzso zzso and domain swap analyses revealed that zzso was important for zzso zzso and acted zzso with at least one other zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso development in transgenic zzso The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso
