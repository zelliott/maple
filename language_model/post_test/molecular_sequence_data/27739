zzso clones zzso precursors of zzso hormone common zzso zzso and of zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso anterior zzso zzso library using DNA zzso and the zzso sequences were zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso contained an entire coding region zzso zzso including zzso and 3' untranslated zzso The zzso zzso was about 900 bases zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence consisted of a signal zzso of 24 zzso acid zzso and a mature zzso protein of 96 zzso Six zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso of the predicted mature protein had not been found by direct zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso beta zzso contained an entire coding region and a 3' untranslated region which has two zzso zzso The length of the zzso beta zzso was about 500 bases zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence consisted of a signal zzso of 20 zzso acid zzso a mature protein of 112 zzso and an additional extension of six zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso which had not been found in the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso The coding sequences of the zzso showed high zzso with those of other zzso species zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Comprehensive data of our serial molecular cloning for zzso zzso hormones revealed low but significant zzso zzso among three zzso Upon comparison of frequency of zzso A sequence in 3' untranslated region, zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso were grouped into a moderate class of zzso stability whereas zzso zzso beta and zzso beta were grouped into unstable and stable classes, zzso
