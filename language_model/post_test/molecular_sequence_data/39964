zzso contributes to sex differentiation by zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso We have cloned the promoter of the zzso zzso gene from the sea zzso zzso zzso a species whose farming is complicated by zzso sex zzso The promoter shows a zzso binding site for zzso as well as two zzso response elements zzso and putative binding sites for zzso factors belonging to the Sox and zzso zzso Analysis of promoter sequences from individual fish suggests the presence of three promoter zzso that arise due to three single zzso zzso zzso in linkage zzso
