The zzso protein is a zzso factor that acts as the major tumor zzso in zzso The core zzso domain is zzso in about 50% of all human zzso The crystal structure of the core domain in complex with DNA illustrated how a single core domain specifically interacts with its DNA consensus site and how it is zzso by zzso However, no structural information for the zzso full-length zzso complex is zzso Here, we present novel experimental insight into the zzso of two zzso core zzso upon cooperative binding to consensus DNA in solution obtained by zzso The zzso data show that the zzso core domain itself does not appear to undergo major zzso changes upon addition of DNA and zzso the zzso interface between two zzso core zzso which includes the short zzso zzso A zzso model for the zzso zzso zzso complex incorporates these data and allows the conclusion that the zzso interface also forms the actual interface in the zzso zzso zzso The significance of this interface is further zzso by the finding that hot spot zzso map to the zzso zzso and by the binding of the putative zzso inhibitor zzso to this region via one of its zzso zzso Based on symmetry considerations it is proposed that zzso zzso might link zzso DNA consensus sites in a zzso manner generating DNA zzso as observed for zzso active zzso zzso
