A zzso zzso negative and zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso heated soil sample collected at zzso National Park, zzso Yunnan Province, zzso zzso zzso of the strain were found to be zzso and colonies were light beige and zzso The strain was found to grow in the presence of zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso The only zzso detected was zzso and the zzso DNA zzso content was determined to be zzso The major fatty acids zzso were identified as zzso and zzso The zzso were found to consist of zzso zzso zzso five unknown zzso and three zzso Based on the zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso zzso was found to form a cluster with zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two strains formed a distinct lineage of the family zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso data, a new zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AB zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2012 is reclassified in the new zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso AB zzso zzso based on zzso zzso
