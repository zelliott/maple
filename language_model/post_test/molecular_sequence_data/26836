It has recently been demonstrated that the zzso drug zzso zzso also displays zzso activity against the human zzso virus type 1 zzso The zzso form of zzso is accepted by zzso reverse zzso zzso and subsequent incorporation leads to classical chain zzso Like all approved zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso the selective pressure of zzso is associated with the emergence of zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso appears to be dominant in this zzso By itself, this zzso is usually not associated with resistance to currently approved zzso Here we studied the underlying zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is also selected under the selective pressure of a zzso zzso that was designed to bypass the bottleneck in drug zzso to the zzso form zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso discriminates against the inhibitor at the level of zzso whereas binding of the inhibitor remains largely zzso The incorporated zzso zzso is vulnerable to zzso in the presence of the zzso donor zzso zzso compromises binding of the next zzso that can otherwise provide a certain degree of protection from zzso zzso the results of this study suggest that zzso is sensitive to two different resistance zzso which warrants further investigation regarding the detailed resistance profile of zzso Such studies will be crucial in assessing the potential clinical utility of zzso and its derivatives in combination with established zzso
