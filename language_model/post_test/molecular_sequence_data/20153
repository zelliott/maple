Here we describe the establishment and prediction utilities for a novel zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso that is common to the zzso zzso of a large number of zzso and animal zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso motif is required for the function of the zzso domain of zzso and the related zzso factors zzso and zzso The zzso zzso possesses an autonomous zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso Using sequence alignment and experimental data we derived a pattern that can be used for zzso zzso zzso The pattern allows the identification of zzso zzso in other zzso family members or unrelated zzso animal, and viral zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso represents the smallest known zzso for a broad range of zzso zzso The wide occurrence of the zzso zzso suggests that this domain mediates zzso interactions with general zzso zzso A zzso search for the zzso zzso is available online from National zzso Austria at zzso
