The zzso zzso of zzso class II genes by zzso regulatory proteins requires zzso in addition to the general zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso cells and identified by sequence analysis and functional zzso as human DNA zzso I zzso Under identical conditions zzso mediates both a net zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and repression of zzso transcription, thereby leading to a large induction of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is dependent on the presence of both the zzso zzso domain and the zzso protein zzso zzso in natural zzso factor zzso while repression of zzso zzso is observed with either zzso or the derived zzso zzso These results suggest novel functions, apparently through distinct mechanisms, for human DNA zzso I in the regulation of zzso initiation by zzso zzso zzso
