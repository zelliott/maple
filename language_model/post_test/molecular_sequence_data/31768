The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a promising malaria vaccine candidate, however it remains unclear which regions are naturally targeted by host immunity and whether its high genetic diversity will zzso coverage by a zzso zzso To assess its feasibility as a vaccine candidate, we investigated the global population structure of zzso 

New sequences from zzso New zzso zzso zzso were zzso together with published sequences from Thailand zzso India zzso Sri Lanka zzso Venezuela zzso and a collection of zzso from disparate geographic locations zzso A total of 92 single zzso zzso zzso were identified including 22 synonymous zzso and 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso and signatures of balancing zzso zzso D and low zzso zzso selection were predominantly clustered in domain I, suggesting it is a dominant target of protective immune zzso To estimate global zzso diversity, zzso comprised of zzso zzso zzso and zzso common zzso minor zzso frequency, zzso zzso zzso acid sites were then zzso revealing a total of 219 and 210 distinct zzso zzso Although highly diverse, the 210 zzso comprised of only common zzso were grouped into zzso zzso however substantial geographic differentiation was observed, and this may have implications for the efficacy of zzso vaccines in different zzso zzso The zzso zzso form a distinct group of clusters not found in any other geographic zzso zzso zzso were rare and geographically zzso suggesting potentially poor efficacy of candidate zzso zzso 

It may be possible to cover the existing global zzso diversity by selection of diverse zzso based on these analyses however it will be important to first define the relationships between the genetic and zzso diversity of this zzso
