zzso bundle proteins have been designed that catalyze the zzso and zzso reactions of zzso zzso by a cooperative zzso and general acid zzso The zzso consist of two zzso peptides that fold into zzso motifs and zzso They have previously been shown to recognize zzso and zzso zzso and to follow zzso zzso The zzso entity is a zzso pair in a zzso segment spaced zzso zzso which can be supplemented by zzso and zzso in the adjacent zzso The binding zzso have now been zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and found to vary with the location of the zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso site in zzso II in positions 30 and 34 is enhanced by the introduction of zzso and or zzso zzso in positions 11 and 15, but not in 8 and 11 or in 15 and zzso The most efficient catalyst using this site, zzso zzso the reaction with a zzso rate constant of zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution at pH zzso and 290 zzso The zzso rate constant is larger than those of the corresponding sites with zzso and zzso binding zzso Similar experiments have shown that the efficiency and selectivity of zzso based on a zzso site in zzso I are enhanced the most by the introduction of zzso and zzso
