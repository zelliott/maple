zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso interactions through the recognition of zzso sequence motifs on cellular zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed three binding sites involved in this zzso two zzso interactions (between zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and highly zzso aromatic zzso on the surface of the zzso zzso and one salt bridge (between zzso of zzso and an zzso three zzso upstream of the zzso zzso motif in the zzso We examined the importance of the zzso binding site of zzso zzso by comparing the binding properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with those of a zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso binding site zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso engineered to contain an zzso binding site zzso and zzso We found that the zzso zzso diminished binding to most zzso zzso proteins in whole cell zzso however, there was only a moderate reduction in binding to a small subset of zzso zzso proteins (including the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to contain two zzso zzso binding sites and one zzso binding site which lacks an zzso Moreover, substitution of zzso for zzso in zzso zzso changed the binding specificity of this domain and zzso the ability to recognize zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is important for zzso zzso binding specificity and that zzso binding interactions play a dominant role in zzso zzso recognition of cellular binding zzso and they suggest the existence of two zzso zzso binding mechanisms, one requiring zzso and the other independent of this zzso
