zzso zzso strains of the classical zzso express the genes zzso zzso toxin zzso and zzso zzso zzso under a variety of environmental conditions in zzso whereas El zzso zzso strains express these genes only under specialized culture zzso We show here that a single zzso difference at positions zzso and zzso of the classical and El zzso zzso zzso respectively, is responsible for the differential regulation of zzso gene expression in these two zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso coli indicated that zzso zzso of the El zzso zzso promoter by the zzso regulator zzso was significantly reduced relative to that of the classical zzso zzso exchange of the zzso promoter between the two zzso in zzso zzso showed that the ability to activate the zzso of zzso is not dependent on the zzso of the strain per zzso but on the zzso promoter zzso Classical and El zzso zzso promoter zzso in zzso coli localized the region responsible for the differential zzso of zzso by zzso to within 75 zzso of the zzso start zzso Individual zzso changes within this region showed that the presence of either an A or a G at position zzso or zzso zzso the classical or El zzso respectively, pattern of zzso zzso by zzso zzso exchange of these base pairs between zzso in zzso zzso switched the zzso pattern of expression of zzso as well as the production of CT and zzso in response to environmental zzso
