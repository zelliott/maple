zzso degrade zzso proteins in the zzso The potential contribution of the zzso to the effect of zzso sequences on the presentation of an zzso zzso presented by the major zzso complex class I zzso zzso was zzso zzso generated in cells from zzso coding for peptides of zzso and zzso acid length were compared with the in zzso zzso zzso degradation products of the respective synthetic zzso The quality of generated peptides was independent of zzso In zzso and in zzso processing products were indistinguishable with respect to zzso size and zzso zzso the neighboring sequence substantially improved the yield of the final zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that, in addition to the presence of major zzso complex class I zzso zzso the zzso preference of the zzso can define the zzso potential of a zzso
