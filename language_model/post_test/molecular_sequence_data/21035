The structure of the zzso protein from zzso zzso was determined at 2 A zzso The crystal structure and zzso characterization of this zzso support the conclusion that this protein is an zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso contains the zzso zzso fold zzso and exists as a zzso Contacts between the two zzso in the zzso are formed both by hydrogen bonds and salt zzso zzso characterization reveals that zzso zzso zzso bonds with high affinity toward short to medium chain zzso unlike the other known zzso which have greater affinity toward shorter chained zzso A potential role for zzso in regulation of zzso activity through zzso is also zzso
