zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso In this study, the zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso and then expressed in zzso zzso A high yield of the active zzso zzso zzso of wet cells, was obtained in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso using heat treatment, zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed an apparent optimal pH of 7 and an optimal temperature at 75 zzso The zzso was stable at pH values ranging from 5 to 9, and the activity was fully retained after a 2 h incubation at zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso zzso to date, and it has a high specific activity zzso zzso and an acceptable purity after heat treatment, suggesting that this zzso has the potential to be used in rare sugar zzso
