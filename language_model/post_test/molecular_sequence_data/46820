zzso zzso zzso previously described for production of zzso zzso an zzso zzso was shown to zzso a second zzso The latter was zzso and its molecular mass of zzso zzso obtained by mass zzso analysis, indicates that this zzso should be identical to zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This second zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso was named zzso zzso Its structural zzso zzso was then localized by a reverse genetic approach, zzso and zzso zzso was found on the zzso zzso next to zzso gene zzso zzso experiments led to isolation of two zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso and zzso The latter had lost zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore explaining its zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso still harbors the zzso but did not produce any zzso Thus, its zzso could likely result from a point zzso within a zzso probably zzso a protein involved in production of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
