zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso due to its ability to degrade zzso zzso component of the joint cartilage tissue that cushions the bone from zzso zzso zzso hip zzso a zzso orthopedic disease which results in zzso condition as is seen in human zzso is an excellent system to study the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso To date, however, no report is available regarding canine zzso promoter and the regulatory mechanism by which increased synthesis of zzso protein might be zzso To gain an insight, we have investigated the promoter region of canine zzso zzso synthesis in the resident cells of zzso zzso is regulated via two major zzso zzso and zzso By using a series of progressively deleted reporter zzso multiple zzso elements were identified in the zzso promoter region of canine zzso These include zzso elements of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso element resulted in marked reduction in the zzso responsiveness of zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso zzso activities are increased in zzso cells as well as in zzso cartilage zzso In zzso zzso analysis indicated higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso but not in the normal cartilage zzso These results show that induction and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso factors are involved in the regulation of zzso expression in the zzso which could be used as therapeutic targets to combat zzso of zzso
