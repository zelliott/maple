We previously demonstrated zzso zzso produces two zzso zzso of 100 zzso and 80 zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 48, zzso zzso Here, we identified the protein sequence of these zzso and found they come from a single gene product designated as zzso zzso zzso has a modular design where the zzso contains five zzso repeats and a zzso zzso active zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but no other oral zzso This suggests zzso possesses strong zzso specificity towards zzso bacteria present in the human oral zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso fragments released by zzso shows the zzso is an zzso We found zzso enhances the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid inhibit the zzso The optimum pH range for zzso activity was 6 to zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso results in the formation of a longer bacterial cell chain length that was dispersed by the addition of a low concentration of zzso This suggests zzso is involved in zzso zzso cell zzso
