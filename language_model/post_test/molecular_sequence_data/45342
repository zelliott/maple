Two zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated during studies of zzso in human zzso using zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the isolated strains belonged to the zzso zzso The zzso content zzso zzso and major fatty acid composition zzso zzso zzso supported the affiliation of the two strains to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with their closest zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that the two strains belonged to the same species zzso zzso of 89 zzso and were distinct from their close relatives, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso On the basis of these data, a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, zzso the designated type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain 176 zzso zzso
