Most zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein react with its central domain, which contains about 40 repeats of the zzso zzso zzso To search for new zzso in the zzso part of the zzso zzso we expressed the zzso regions of the protein in zzso coli as fusion proteins with mouse zzso zzso linked to six adjacent zzso zzso These fusion proteins were obtained at greater than zzso purity by a single zzso affinity zzso zzso Of the new zzso defined in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso three are located in a stretch of 65 zzso acids immediately zzso of the zzso central repetitive zzso zzso zzso from inhabitants of a zzso area reacted with zzso in this region of the zzso and four mouse zzso zzso to this region also reacted with the native zzso protein on zzso Two of the zzso zzso reacted with a zzso zzso derived from a zzso region of the zzso zzso The other two zzso showed different zzso to zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso One, which reacted with a zzso zzso recognized zzso but not zzso zzso while the other reacted with a small percentage of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso which react with zzso regions of the zzso protein could contribute to maintaining its genetic zzso
