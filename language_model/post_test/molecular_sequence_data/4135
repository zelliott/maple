In avian species, an egg envelope zzso to the zzso zzso zzso is called the zzso zzso We have previously reported that one of its zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso cells of the quail zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso zzso of the newly zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of the cell zzso demonstrated that the zzso protein is the precursor of mature zzso zzso and is converted to the zzso protein before zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso A, and conversion of zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso indicate the possibility that the zzso processing of zzso occurs in the zzso zzso An analysis of zzso sequence identified that the C zzso of mature zzso protein is zzso and the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso was determined as zzso These results suggest that newly zzso zzso is zzso at the consensus zzso zzso site, and the resulting two basic zzso at the C zzso are subsequently trimmed off to generate mature zzso prior to zzso
