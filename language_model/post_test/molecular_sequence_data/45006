zzso zzso zzso zzso is a unique zzso that has no zzso and whose zzso has been zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Watanabe, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Complete Genome zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that lacks zzso DNA Research 10 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were isolated and analyzed by zzso followed by zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as predicted from the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes at order locus named zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso are 56 and 55 zzso acids longer at the zzso than the open reading frame proposed in the zzso The two zzso acid extensions showed a zzso identity to one zzso Also, the zzso extensions of these sequences were similar to zzso in both the zzso protein zzso and to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein zzso These zzso are not only unusual in their zzso location, but are unusual in that they are more closely related in sequence similarity to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso than to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso in other zzso These zzso proteins with unique special zzso are indicators of the unusual structure of the zzso of zzso zzso
