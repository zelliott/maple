In this study, we used human zzso for the isolation of the 60 zzso component of the zzso zzso following the method described by Wu et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analyses were carried out using zzso human zzso syndrome zzso to follow the zzso through the zzso zzso A 60 zzso zzso component was zzso as a broad peak from a zzso Q zzso Within this peak, a much more abundant zzso zzso with the zzso component on zzso was also zzso The more abundant protein was further zzso on a zzso 12 column and its zzso sequence was shown to be identical to that of human zzso The 60 zzso zzso zzso was also further zzso on the zzso 12 column and was zzso as an zzso peak, with the majority being zzso at a position corresponding to 60 zzso whereas the zzso protein was zzso from the same column as an apparent zzso of approximately 120 zzso A panel of five zzso human zzso reacted with the zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso zzso it is clear that the zzso protein is not a zzso zzso and is distinct from the 60 zzso zzso zzso As the zzso protein is a much more abundant protein than the 60 zzso zzso zzso its zzso with the zzso on zzso and its close migration with the zzso on zzso may explain why zzso sequences for human zzso were derived from apparent 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso
