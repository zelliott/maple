zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso naturally produced by plants because it is a strategic raw material used in more than 40,000 products, including more than 400 medical zzso The sole commercial source, at present, is natural rubber harvested from the Brazilian rubber tree, zzso zzso zzso due to its molecular structure and high molecular weight zzso 1 million zzso this rubber has high performance properties that cannot easily be zzso by artificially produced zzso such as those derived from, zzso bacterial zzso zzso These high performance properties include zzso zzso abrasion resistance, efficient heat zzso zzso heat zzso under zzso and impact zzso Medical rubber gloves need to fit well, be zzso allow the wearer to retain fine tactile sensation, and provide an effective barrier against zzso The sum of all these characteristics cannot yet be achieved using synthetic zzso The lack of zzso in natural rubber production renders continuity of supply zzso because of the risk of crop failure, diminishing zzso and other disadvantages outlined zzso A search for alternative sources of natural rubber production has already resulted in a large number of interesting plants and prospects for immediate industrial exploitation of zzso zzso zzso as a source of high quality zzso zzso engineering will permit the production of new crops designed to accumulate new types of valued zzso zzso such as rubber and zzso and new combinations zzso from the same zzso Currently, experiments are zzso to genetically improve zzso rubber production strains in both quantitative and qualitative zzso Since the choice for gene activities to be introduced or changed is under debate, we have set up a complementary approach to zzso with zzso species, which may more quickly show the zzso and relevance of genes zzso Although economic considerations may prevent commercial exploitation of new zzso zzso transgenic zzso and bacteria may yield intermediate or alternative zzso suitable for specific zzso
