The association between zzso and zzso is currently being zzso in the light of zzso zzso At least 11 different zzso have been described among which zzso zzso and zzso could be less closely associated with disease at the population zzso zzso in the presentation of zzso peptides by these zzso could be related to differences in disease zzso We focused our work on the comparison of zzso and zzso which differ at a single position at zzso 59 in pocket A of the zzso binding zzso zzso peptides from the human zzso line zzso by zzso or zzso were zzso and separated by zzso Major individual zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso observed between zzso versus zzso individual zzso were confirmed in an in zzso stabilization zzso with zzso or zzso zzso cells in the presence of synthetic zzso One zzso associated zzso is derived from the sequence zzso in the second zzso domain of several zzso class I molecules including zzso This sequence zzso is highly zzso to a previously reported sequence zzso sharing similarities with proteins from enteric zzso We show here that it is naturally presented as a major zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and not by zzso
