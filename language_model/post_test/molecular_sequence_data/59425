A gene of zzso zzso a typical zzso zzso was evaluated as a new index for detecting zzso coli in zzso An zzso zzso gene zzso containing a zzso sequence of the gene was amplified from zzso DNA of zzso coli by a zzso chain reaction, and then labeled with zzso as a probe for detecting zzso zzso Food samples and bacteria were each treated as at 25 degrees C for 10 zzso in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso before being directly spotted on to nylon zzso for DNA zzso The probe was specific for zzso zzso all 48 strains of zzso coli zzso including such zzso strains as zzso coli zzso showed positive signals, whereas all 59 strains of zzso coli species, except for one strain zzso zzso did not show a zzso Various foods zzso with zzso coli K-12 showed positive signals whereas no zzso foods showed any zzso zzso of zzso coli cells in the death phase by the zzso method showed good correlation with that by the plate culture zzso The zzso zzso gene could prove useful as an index for detecting zzso coli in zzso
