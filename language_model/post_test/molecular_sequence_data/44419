The class II zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso zzso for the expression of zzso class II zzso Its zzso 125 zzso acids function as an independent zzso zzso zzso zzso of the primary zzso acid sequence of the zzso domain predict the presence of three zzso each with a high proportion of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that two of these predicted zzso are required for full zzso zzso by zzso Moreover, a zzso protein in which both functional zzso have been deleted displays a dominant negative zzso This zzso domain of zzso interacts with the 32 zzso zzso of the general zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso deletions of zzso is correlated directly with their reduced binding to zzso We conclude that interactions between zzso and zzso are responsible for zzso of class II zzso
