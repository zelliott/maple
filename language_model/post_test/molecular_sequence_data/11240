Previously, we discovered multiple direct repeats of zzso DNA zzso sequences clustered at a single zzso position in zzso zzso zzso Here we show that, in addition to zzso multiple copies of these elements occur in the zzso of three related zzso species, all in the section zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in 9 other more zzso related zzso species, nor in various other zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of 18 zzso copies reveal 4 zzso but highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In addition to novel zzso all elements share significant but varying lengths of DNA sequence similarity with the zzso replication origin plus the adjacent rep zzso There is extended sequence similarity to zzso protein at the deduced zzso acid sequence level, including motifs associated with other rolling circle replication zzso Our data suggest that all zzso elements descend from a unique zzso integration event, most likely in a common zzso of these zzso zzso
