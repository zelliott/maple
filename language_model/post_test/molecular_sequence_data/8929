zzso zzso by zzso zzso are a family of very large scaffold proteins capable of zzso numerous receptors and zzso channels to specific, zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso are known to be associated with diseases including zzso cardiac zzso and bipolar disorder in humans, although the underlying molecular bases are poorly zzso The middle zzso domain of zzso contains highly zzso zzso zzso arranged into the zzso zzso zzso most of the zzso zzso in the tandem have no apparent impact on the zzso binding of zzso The high resolution structure of the zzso zzso tandem determined here reveals that the zzso zzso form a tightly packed structural zzso whereas zzso is freely zzso Although the formation of the zzso zzso does not influence the zzso binding of zzso zzso altering the zzso zzso of zzso impair the functions of zzso Our structural analysis further indicates that the zzso zzso of zzso has two additional surfaces that may bind to targets other than zzso Finally, the structure of the zzso zzso provides zzso explanations to many zzso zzso identified in zzso
