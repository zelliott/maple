A zzso acid rich, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso was obtained by zzso zzso and differential ethanol zzso and further zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein content was zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the first ten zzso was as zzso zzso This sequence is identical to that of human embryonic zzso cell zzso zzso as well as to human zzso After zzso ABC treatment, two peptides (Mr 22,000 and 16,000 zzso were detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso analysis using rabbit zzso raised against a synthetic zzso that contained 15 zzso acids in the same sequence as the zzso zzso of human fetal membrane PG showed significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso had an apparent Mr of approximately zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso liberated zzso zzso zzso chains having an Mr of zzso zzso The conversion of zzso to zzso indicated that the zzso chains are attached to the PG protein core at zzso through a zzso zzso zzso also contained both N and zzso zzso and did not zzso with zzso zzso These results, together with those reported zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso have the same zzso zzso acid sequence at the zzso zzso but different protein zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso with zzso zzso and is, therefore, distinctly different from zzso zzso
