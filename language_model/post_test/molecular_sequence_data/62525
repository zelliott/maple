We have cloned and determined the zzso sequence of the zzso coding for a cellular zzso protein type I zzso from zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso showed highest sequence identity ( approximately zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis clustered the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso gene zzso both consist of four zzso separated by three zzso identical to all other zzso genes in zzso Two zzso start sites were identified in the zzso promoter and a single zzso start site was identified for zzso zzso hybrid mapping assigned the zzso zzso gene to linkage group 16 and zzso zzso genes were found by comparative analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected zzso transcripts in the adult zzso liver, brain, zzso and zzso for zzso gene and in the zzso and liver for zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso expression in the developing zzso central nervous system at specific sites that are known to have abundant zzso acid distribution and significant zzso acid zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso also showed that the zzso zzso zzso was localized specifically in the embryonic zzso bulb and the developing zzso during the zzso stage, zzso a novel function for the zzso gene product during zzso and development of the zzso zzso
