zzso zzso zzso zzso play important roles in regulating zzso zzso We have been investigating the regulation and function of zzso a zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso Recently, the crystal structure of a zzso of the membrane zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso was described zzso zzso zzso den zzso zzso Hunter, zzso and Noel zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Within this crystal structure, the zzso site of each zzso of the zzso is zzso blocked by the zzso of the zzso zzso segment of the zzso zzso It was proposed that zzso would lead to zzso of zzso activity and may provide a paradigm for the regulation of the zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure, to zzso A resolution, of zzso zzso which shares zzso sequence identity with that of zzso zzso Although the zzso structures of zzso D1 and zzso D1 are very similar, with a root mean square zzso between equivalent zzso atoms of zzso A, the zzso structures of these two proteins are zzso Neither the zzso site nor the zzso zzso segment of zzso D1 zzso in zzso zzso The zzso site of zzso D1 is zzso and adopts an open zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Flint, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso of zzso activity may not be a general feature of this family of zzso
