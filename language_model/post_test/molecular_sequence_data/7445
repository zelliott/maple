The human type I zzso 16 is zzso expressed in a number of complex zzso zzso including skin, but is better known for its induction under conditions favoring enhanced proliferation or abnormal zzso including wound healing, zzso and zzso We cloned the coding sequence of human zzso by applying a coupled reverse zzso chain reaction procedure to zzso prepared from cultured human skin zzso We then expressed the human zzso coding sequence in zzso coli and zzso the zzso protein by zzso zzso The zzso protein recovered behaves similarly to human zzso (a related zzso zzso on the zzso zzso with native human zzso on zzso zzso 48 zzso and zzso with zzso directed against human zzso Based on the zzso sequence obtained and the properties of the corresponding zzso zzso we conclude that we have cloned the coding portion of the human zzso zzso The sequence data obtained in this study is compared to earlier reports of the human zzso zzso which are conflicting in many zzso The availability of zzso in a zzso zzso form will allow us to study how its properties may relate to its function during wound healing and in skin zzso
