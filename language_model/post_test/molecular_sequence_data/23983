Complete zzso sequences except the zzso zzso tract and zzso zzso tail of a vaccine strain zzso zzso and an zzso field isolate zzso zzso of zzso disease virus zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso acid zzso sequence analysis of the zzso protein of the field isolate revealed that the latter has 212 instead of 210 or 211 zzso found in the so far available sequences of other zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was localized in the zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the entire zzso was therefore carried out to detect changes in other parts of the zzso if any, besides zzso which could contribute to its zzso An zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso were compared with each other and also with the known sequence of zzso zzso another vaccine strain of zzso zzso zzso of the entire zzso coding zzso to zzso region of zzso zzso with those of the two zzso vaccine strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed no significant zzso A similar comparison of zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed zzso across the entire length of the zzso In addition to the zzso region, sequence zzso was also observed in zzso proteins albeit to different zzso This study shows that in the gene pool of zzso zzso at least three groups of zzso are present with respect to the length of zzso zzso
