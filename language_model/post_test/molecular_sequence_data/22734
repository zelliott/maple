zzso against zzso proteins are highly specific for zzso zzso We previously reported that functional zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso type 4 were closely associated with zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso recognized by serum samples from patients with zzso The human zzso zzso expression library was zzso by zzso and was zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso from patients with zzso zzso One zzso zzso clone containing a zzso pair insert was isolated and sequence analysis revealed that the zzso included a part of the zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso against a zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed with high specificity in zzso of zzso zzso The levels of zzso against zzso zzso were correlated with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a candidate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso may thus be involved in the zzso of zzso
