The zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides that are zzso in the skins of a wide range of species of frogs belonging to the zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated using zzso the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso brown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously isolated from an extract of the skin of zzso zzso skin, were amplified and cloned from the stomach, liver, zzso skeletal zzso However, a net zzso of 10 zzso resulted in the presence of a premature stop zzso in the open reading frame that was not present in the corresponding region of zzso from zzso The zzso zzso obtained from small zzso contained an additional 12 zzso zzso in the region that encodes the zzso sequence so that a novel zzso zzso termed zzso is zzso This zzso also contained a premature stop zzso in the open reading zzso Although it is unclear whether zzso is produced in zzso zzso zzso a synthetic replicate of the zzso of was biologically active, zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and producing zzso of human zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso
