zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and most other zzso bacterial plant pathogens largely depends on a type III zzso zzso system which is zzso by hypersensitive response and zzso zzso zzso These genes are induced in the plant and are essential for the zzso to be virulent in susceptible hosts and for the induction of the hypersensitive response zzso in resistant host and zzso zzso The zzso machinery zzso proteins into the zzso milieu and zzso proteins into the plant cell zzso In the plant, the zzso presumably interfere with cellular processes to the benefit of the pathogen or have an zzso activity that zzso the zzso to the plant surveillance zzso Type III zzso were identified by their zzso activity, zzso with the zzso system and zzso to known zzso A number of zzso proteins are members of families, zzso the zzso family in zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus of the plant cell where it zzso plant gene zzso Another family that is also present in zzso is the zzso zzso The latter proteins appear to act as zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Here, we will present an overview about the regulation of the zzso system and its zzso and discuss the function of the zzso and zzso family members in more zzso
