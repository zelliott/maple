The mechanism by which diverse drugs zzso zzso zzso channels is zzso We have approached this problem by examining the interaction of zzso with a zzso synthetic channel zzso zzso that exhibits functional similarities to authentic zzso zzso channels in terms of zzso selectivity and zzso as well as interaction with zzso and blocking drugs (Grove et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88, zzso Different possibilities of binding of zzso inside the zzso SCP were simulated using the zzso zzso zzso In the optimal mode of the zzso zzso adopted a folded zzso and fit zzso in the zzso The zzso groups of the drug zzso with two zzso zzso coordinated to the zzso zzso of zzso thus forming a zzso complex of the drug, zzso and zzso The zzso group of zzso abetted a ring of four zzso zzso zzso the putative SCP zzso The zzso of this gate by zzso in this manner was zzso similar to that accomplished by the zzso group of zzso zzso In conjunction with an earlier study on SCP bound to zzso drugs zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 70, zzso our data suggest that, in general, drug zzso of SCP would involve the interaction of the zzso with the zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso In light of the functional similarity between SCP and zzso zzso channel, it is likely that the latter would also interact with drugs in a similar zzso
