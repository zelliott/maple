zzso donated by patients with T cell acute zzso leukemia zzso were screened for zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso blood cells of zzso zzso patient zzso were found to possess a zzso point zzso at zzso 175 of the zzso zzso To determine whether this was an inherited zzso a B cell line zzso was zzso zzso T cell lines zzso were zzso established by growing peripheral blood zzso T cells at low oxygen tension in medium supplemented with zzso Previously we had shown that zzso zzso of zzso T cell lines possessed zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that might have originated with the donor's zzso cells, or might have been induced during establishment of the cell zzso To answer whether establishment of the zzso lines was associated with the induction of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso lines were zzso The zzso lines retained the same zzso zzso zzso that was present in the patient's zzso zzso The zzso line lacked zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso showed that zzso cells produced zzso proteins of zzso and wild type zzso while the zzso line zzso only zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells had an abnormal zzso while the zzso cells possessed a normal zzso zzso These experiments suggest that zzso zzso zzso occurred in the zzso cells of zzso zzso patient zzso zzso the zzso was of zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso the zzso was leukemia zzso and zzso establishment of human leukemia cell lines needs not be associated with in zzso induction of zzso zzso It may be significant that patient zzso belonged to a category of zzso zzso patients in whom a second zzso could not be zzso
