zzso is a zzso protein from the zzso of the Indian zzso zzso zzso zzso It binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso It has two zzso alpha and zzso consisting of 131 and 123 zzso acid zzso zzso The two chains are linked with a zzso zzso The level of zzso acid sequence zzso between two zzso is zzso The protein was zzso from the zzso of zzso and zzso using ammonium zzso as a zzso The crystal structure has been determined at zzso resolution and refined to an zzso of zzso zzso dimensions of the zzso are approximately zzso The backbone folds of the two zzso are zzso The central portions of the zzso chains of alpha and zzso move into each other to form a tight zzso zzso The remaining portions of the chains of both zzso fold in a manner similar to those observed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso the zzso sites are not present, despite being zzso equivalent to other similar zzso proteins of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso proteins of the related family are zzso but the zzso zzso are replaced by zzso at the corresponding sites in the alpha and zzso
