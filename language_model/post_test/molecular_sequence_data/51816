We have analyzed the occurrence of transcripts produced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso gene during zzso in the zzso We found that tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso specificity of these zzso parallel that previously reported for the two protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by these two zzso This indicates that primary regulation of differential expression of the zzso genes during zzso is exerted at the zzso zzso We first detected zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso is initiated zzso with the onset of zzso in male germ cells, and then continues to increase in later zzso and zzso round zzso This expression zzso prior to an initial decline in zzso transcript levels observed in zzso zzso which apparently follows zzso of the single X zzso in zzso zzso However, unlike zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso X zzso in female zzso cells, we show that zzso of the zzso locus in zzso cells is not followed by zzso of a key zzso zzso in the promoter zzso These results support the idea that specific expression of the zzso gene in zzso and zzso zzso cells has evolved to compensate for reduced levels of zzso gene product caused by transient zzso zzso in these zzso They further suggest that zzso of zzso of the paternal zzso zzso shortly after zzso is facilitated by zzso zzso in the promoter region of this gene throughout zzso
