The virus isolate H was identified by molecular zzso was collected from zzso zzso plant showing leaf zzso vein symptoms in zzso zzso Garden of zzso zzso 

The virus isolate H was observed in electron zzso and zzso detected by zzso using universal primer pair for the zzso zzso 

The results indicated that all sequences zzso to the specific zzso belonged to the zzso zzso of the family zzso There was the highest similarity shared zzso zzso at zzso between the specific zzso and zzso of zzso yellow vein virus zzso 

These findings suggested that there was zzso in zzso zzso and the disease probably caused by zzso yellow vein zzso
