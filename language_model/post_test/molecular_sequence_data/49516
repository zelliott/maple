A major factor in the emergence of zzso resistance is the existence of zzso that chemically modify common zzso The genes for these zzso are commonly carried on mobile genetic zzso zzso their zzso One such class of zzso is the zzso zzso zzso family, which uses zzso zzso transfer to chemically modify and zzso zzso antibiotics such as zzso and zzso As part of a program to define the molecular basis for zzso recognition and zzso by such zzso we have determined the high resolution zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso in complex with zzso The structure was solved by molecular replacement using multiple models derived from the related zzso zzso zzso and refined to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso The bound zzso zzso is very well defined and occupies a highly zzso charged zzso formed by the zzso domain of the zzso zzso to this is the binding site for zzso which can be modeled on the basis of zzso complexes of zzso only one change is apparent with a loop, zzso zzso in a position where it could fold over an incoming zzso The three rings of the zzso occupy distinct zzso in which a highly zzso loop, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso play important parts in zzso The A ring, the site of zzso transfer, is adjacent to the zzso base zzso These results give new information on the basis of zzso recognition, and on the relationship between this zzso family and the protein zzso
