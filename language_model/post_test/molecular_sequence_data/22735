In a previous paper, we reported the cloning of a zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Few studies concerning the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso a growth zzso zzso protein zzso that encodes a putative zzso have been zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso expression revealed ubiquitous expression in mouse zzso and adult zzso as well as zzso cell zzso The pattern of zzso expression suggested that once zzso zzso was expressed in the putative brain region of mouse zzso zzso cells spread zzso throughout all zzso during embryonic zzso In addition, Western zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso of the zzso portion in zzso appears to regulate the expression level, suggesting that zzso is essential for the proper expression of zzso
