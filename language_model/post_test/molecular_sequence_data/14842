The mechanics of zzso with gene flow are still zzso zzso among genes in population differentiation zzso between zzso species is often interpreted as evidence for zzso species zzso with selection preventing zzso genes from zzso despite ongoing gene zzso However, zzso can remain high before it reaches equilibrium between the lineage sorting of species divergence and the zzso effects of gene flow (via secondary zzso Thus, when interpreting zzso the dynamics of zzso gene flow, and selection need to be taken into zzso We illustrate this view with a zzso analyses of gene flow and selection in three closely related zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report that although zzso zzso appears to have evolved in zzso isolation with zzso gene flow between zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso perhaps as a result of zzso zzso followed by more extensive zzso Interestingly, we detected the signatures of apparently independent instances of positive selection at the same locus in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite gene flow between the species, the zzso zzso have not crossed the species boundary, suggesting that this gene has independently undergone zzso zzso or zzso zzso
