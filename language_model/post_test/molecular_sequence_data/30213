We have investigated whether the size zzso of the human zzso zzso is due to differences in the number of zzso zzso zzso repeat units present in the different zzso Using the Southern zzso zzso technique and a DNA probe for the zzso 4 domain of zzso we have observed that in 31 different individuals a zzso zzso restriction zzso band varies widely in intensity relative to other zzso A strong correlation zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso was found between zzso protein size and the variation in intensity of the detected restriction zzso zzso We confirmed this correlation in a large family where the parents are zzso for the zzso protein size zzso The specificity of the zzso band was established by using an zzso zzso These correlations strongly suggest that the observed size zzso in zzso protein is due to different numbers of copies of the zzso 4 sequence in the zzso zzso zzso
