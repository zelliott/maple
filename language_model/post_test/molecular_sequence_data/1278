The zzso zzso encodes a response regulator, zzso and a zzso zzso zzso which activate or repress genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso required activity of both zzso and zzso suggesting zzso of the zzso a suggestion that is supported here by zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso extension zzso using zzso from zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso isolated at different stages of growth and/or under different growth conditions, suggested that expression of the zzso zzso represents the sum of five zzso each responding to a specific growth phase and environmental zzso The zzso expression of the zzso promoters was investigated using in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso isolated at different stages of zzso zzso from zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified zzso and zzso as zzso promoters and zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately P) enhanced zzso from each of these zzso zzso was sufficient for in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was active only in a zzso zzso zzso These studies are the first to report a role for zzso approximately P in zzso of promoters that also have activity in the absence of zzso zzso induction and an zzso role for zzso approximately P at an zzso zzso Information concerning zzso and zzso creates a basis for further exploration of the regulatory coordination or overlap of the zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso
