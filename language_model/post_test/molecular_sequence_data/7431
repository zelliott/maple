Two integral membrane zzso zzso and zzso were found in protein bodies isolated from pumpkin zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization revealed that both zzso and zzso belong to the seed zzso zzso intrinsic zzso zzso The predicted 29 zzso precursor to includes six putative zzso zzso and the loop between the first and second zzso zzso is larger than that of zzso The zzso sequence of the mature zzso starts from zzso 66 in the first loop, indicating that an zzso 7 zzso zzso that contains one zzso domain is zzso zzso During maturation of pumpkin seeds, zzso for zzso and zzso became zzso in zzso at the early stage, and their levels increased slightly until a rapid decrease occurred at the late zzso This is consistent with the zzso of the 29 zzso precursor and zzso in the zzso at the early zzso By contrast, zzso appeared at the late stage simultaneously with the disappearance of the 29 zzso zzso Thus, it seems possible that the conversion of the 29 zzso precursor to the mature zzso might occur in the zzso after the middle stage of seed zzso Both proteins were localized zzso on the zzso of the zzso at the middle stage and the protein bodies at the late zzso These results suggest that both zzso and the precursor to zzso accumulate on zzso zzso before the deposition of storage zzso and then the precursor is converted to the mature zzso at the late zzso These two zzso might have a specific function during the maturation of pumpkin zzso
