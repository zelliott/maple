The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso termed zzso was identified and its structure was resolved in two different space groups, zzso and zzso at a resolution of zzso and zzso A, zzso zzso belongs to a large and widely distributed zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso characterized by the lack of zzso and regulatory zzso The core structure of zzso shows a high degree of similarity to the two zzso structures identified so zzso In contrast to human zzso but similar to zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibits a third metal zzso in addition to the zzso metal zzso universally zzso in all zzso zzso The fact that the third metal is only zzso by zzso zzso which are universally zzso in all zzso members, implies that the third metal could be general for all members of this zzso As a specific feature of zzso a flexible zzso previously recognized as a zzso domain, could be zzso zzso of different structural zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso implied that the zzso domain is involved in zzso binding and zzso zzso The structural arrangement of the zzso domain was accompanied by a large zzso movement of an zzso zzso zzso at the basis of the zzso zzso of this zzso strongly impaired protein stability as well as zzso activity, emphasizing the importance of this zzso acid for the regional zzso of the zzso zzso and confirming the assumption that zzso domain flexibility is involved in zzso
