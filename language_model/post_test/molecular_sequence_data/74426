zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that causes zzso in zzso In this study, we identified a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and characterized zzso properties of the zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with those of previously reported zzso zzso zzso from other zzso zzso showed that zzso shares common zzso zzso and motifs that were zzso in zzso However, the zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso did not show sequence identities to any other zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso suggested that it shares common zzso characteristics found in zzso targeting sequences and predicted zzso of zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso showed typical zzso properties with other characterized zzso including molecular structure, broad pH zzso and sensitivity to hydrogen zzso
