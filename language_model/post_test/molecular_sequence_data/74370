The zzso zzso zzso has many uses in biotechnology but a stabilized zzso would have even wider zzso To enhance zzso stability, we applied consensus zzso zzso successfully with other zzso to zzso zzso zzso and generated five zzso zzso zzso these zzso had greater effects on zzso zzso than on zzso zzso Only two zzso zzso zzso marginally exceeded the wild zzso zzso stability zzso and zzso gain in zzso at 50 degrees C zzso the others zzso zzso zzso were less stable than wild zzso zzso of a zzso combination zzso matched that of zzso the zzso single zzso These results were zzso the Class III plant zzso display wide differences in zzso stability, yet the consensus zzso failed to reflect these natural zzso We examined the sequence content of Class III zzso to determine if there are identifiable molecular reasons for the stability differences zzso zzso analysis validated our choice of sites and zzso and generated an zzso zzso sequence for comparison with extant zzso It seems that both genetic variation and differences in protein stability are confined to zzso regions due to the presence of a highly zzso zzso structural scaffold in these zzso
