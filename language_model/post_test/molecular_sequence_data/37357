High molecular weight zzso zzso zzso are of a particular interest because of their zzso properties, which are important in many food systems such as zzso Using zzso techniques, we identified a fold compatible with the zzso domain of zzso zzso This fold zzso to the one adopted by proteins belonging to the cereal inhibitor zzso Starting from three known protein structures of this family as templates, we built three models for the zzso domain of zzso zzso We analyzed these models, and we propose a number of hypotheses regarding the zzso domain properties that can be tested zzso In particular, we discuss two possible ways of interaction between the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The first way consists in the creation of zzso zzso zzso According to our models, we propose two plausible zzso zzso the existence of an zzso zzso bridge between zzso 22 and 44, leaving the three other zzso free of engaging in zzso zzso and zzso the creation of two zzso zzso bridges zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leaving a single zzso zzso for creating an zzso zzso zzso We discuss these scenarios in relation to contradictory experimental zzso The second way, although less zzso is nevertheless worth zzso There might exist a possibility for the zzso domain of zzso zzso to create zzso because zzso cereal inhibitor proteins are known to exist as zzso zzso and zzso We also discuss, in relation to the function of the cereal inhibitor zzso the possibility that this zzso domain has retained similar zzso zzso
