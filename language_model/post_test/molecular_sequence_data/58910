A molecular zzso analysis of some zzso was undertaken in order to clarify the zzso and zzso of this class in the northeast zzso DNA sequence for portions of two zzso zzso the large zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 was obtained from 16 species of sea zzso including nine members of the family zzso As reported for many zzso zzso a strong bias against G was noted in the coding strand at synonymous zzso In order to verify trees recovered in the presence of this bias, zzso maximum likelihood, distance, and log zzso methods were all zzso The resulting molecular zzso of the zzso with a few exceptions, supported existing zzso which is based largely on the zzso of zzso zzso In particular, evolutionary relationships among the brooding species were zzso Our results confirm that zzso zzso zzso is distinct from zzso zzso zzso and that these two species do not represent geographic zzso of a single zzso In fact zzso zzso appears to be zzso with the more zzso distributed zzso zzso zzso We also clarify the identity of zzso zzso Clark and further suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso revised to zzso should be considered a junior synonym of zzso zzso The recent description of zzso zzso zzso and Lambert as a species, distinct from zzso zzso zzso is also zzso The zzso zzso trees are consistent with multiple origins of direct development within the zzso Finally, we suggest that an in-depth zzso analysis of sea cucumber families will require examination of zzso more slowly evolving, regions of the zzso
