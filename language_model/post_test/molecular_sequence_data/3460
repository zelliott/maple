Although zzso duck zzso zzso shares properties with the zzso isolated from chicken, commonly named avian zzso zzso the two virus species are zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso previously identified, the three other zzso zzso small zzso segments of zzso have been cloned and zzso They were zzso zzso and zzso zzso long, respectively, and contained zzso terminal sequences common to zzso They coded for single expression products, except the smallest zzso which contained two overlapping open reading frames zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that the proteins zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso genes shared high identity levels with zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and to a lesser extent with other zzso zzso No zzso was found for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso product zzso by zzso zzso appeared to be zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso Introduction of large gaps in the zzso part of the zzso protein was necessary to improve zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso However, a zzso zzso motif was zzso and secondary structure analyses predicted a zzso zzso zzso feature at this zzso zzso Thus, despite extensive sequence zzso zzso zzso was suggested to be structurally and probably functionally related to zzso zzso This work provides evidence for the diversity of the zzso S class genes of zzso isolated from birds and raises the question of the relative zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso
