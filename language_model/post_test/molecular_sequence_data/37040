zzso water is currently a scarce world resource, the preparation of which requires complex treatments that include clarification of suspended particles and zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso a tropical tree, have been proposed as an zzso alternative, due to their traditional use for the clarification of drinking zzso However, the precise nature of the active components of the extract and whether they may be produced in zzso form are zzso Here we show that zzso or synthetic forms of a zzso seed zzso mediate efficient zzso of suspended mineral particles and zzso zzso the zzso was also found to possesses a zzso activity capable of zzso heavily contaminated zzso Furthermore, the zzso has been shown to efficiently kill several zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, this zzso displays the unprecedented feature of combining water zzso and zzso zzso Identification of an active principle derived from the seed extracts points to a range of potential for drinking water treatment or skin and zzso zzso in clinical zzso
