zzso zzso the spreading of zzso effects to cells and zzso that have not initially encountered a zzso trigger, is a common phenomenon in many zzso However, the underlying mechanisms of systemic zzso remain largely zzso Here, we studied the characteristics and possible mechanisms of systemic zzso in zzso zzso We observed that the locust has pronounced sensitive systemic zzso in response to zzso injection for both zzso as well as zzso zzso Only a 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dose could induce significant systemic zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso was identified in the locust zzso which exhibited a progressively increasing expression pattern with development and its expression was enriched in the zzso To test the role of zzso in systemic zzso we performed in zzso and in zzso zzso The results from in zzso experiments showed that zzso of zzso gene dose not influence zzso effects of other zzso The results from in zzso experiments confirmed that the expression of the zzso protein in zzso zzso cells could not enhance zzso zzso Thus, these findings imply the existence of alternative mechanisms underlying insect systemic zzso which may be different from zzso zzso or zzso
