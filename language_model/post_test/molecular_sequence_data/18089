When zzso genes are to be expressed in transgenic plants, their zzso must be correctly zzso To gain information useful for predicting whether foreign zzso will be accurately zzso we have zzso the processing of an artificial gene in zzso and zzso zzso zzso A synthetic plant zzso devised to contain the elements necessary for zzso zzso in zzso was found to be efficiently spliced in a zzso zzso transient expression zzso A series of deletion zzso of the synthetic zzso was constructed to assess the minimum functional zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso this was found to be between 70 and 73 zzso This length requirement is similar to that seen in zzso but significantly greater than that in zzso and zzso
