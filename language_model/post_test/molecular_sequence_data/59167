zzso DNA vaccines capable of preventing zzso zzso and zzso infections are currently under zzso Our labs have shown that a zzso DNA vaccine zzso the zzso protein of the malaria zzso elicits protective immunity against live zzso challenge in adult zzso zzso We now find that the same DNA vaccine zzso tolerance rather than immunity when administered to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso animals were unable to mount zzso zzso or zzso responses when zzso with DNA vaccine in zzso or in zzso zzso was specific for zzso zzso expressed by the zzso zzso produced zzso Mice challenged with zzso zzso protein produced zzso against a different set of zzso and were not zzso These findings demonstrate important differences in the nature and specificity of the immune response zzso by DNA vaccines versus conventional protein zzso
