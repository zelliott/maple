Genes coding for components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso from zzso zzso the alfalfa zzso have been isolated on the basis of their high expression in symbiotic zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a situation encountered in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in some zzso bacteria and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso No gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the immediate vicinity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso likely constitute an zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso expression is induced in the symbiotic stage, compared with zzso zzso We demonstrate that symbiotic expression of zzso genes does not depend on the fix zzso regulatory cascade that regulates nitrogen fixation and zzso gene expression in symbiotic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression could be obtained under zzso conditions upon the addition of zzso to the culture zzso zzso by zzso and symbiotic zzso of zzso gene expression take place at the same zzso
