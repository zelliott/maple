Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is the result of zzso zzso between two zzso zzso long, zzso DNA zzso zzso 2) and zzso 1), located in the adult alpha zzso zzso The two segments can also undergo zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso into zzso dividing zzso cells zzso zzso The existence of a zzso of sequence divergence between zzso 2) and zzso 1) makes them an interesting system to study the relationship between efficiencies of zzso DNA zzso and the extent of dispersed and localized base zzso By partial restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of plasmids zzso in zzso 7 cells and rescued from bacteria HB 101, we have determined the distribution of zzso resolution sites along the two X zzso zzso if not all, of the zzso zzso events between the two X blocks appear to be single zzso without efficient gene correction or repair of base zzso The distribution of the sites of zzso resolution is zzso correlated with that of the zzso of sequence zzso with only approximately zzso of the X zzso resolved within the 3' third of the X blocks where two zzso zzso family repeats zzso The zzso sequence within which one of the X zzso resolved is zzso to a previously characterized alpha zzso deletion zzso
