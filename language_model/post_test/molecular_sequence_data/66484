zzso zzso zzso zzso have been used to measure steady state zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unfortunately, the same zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso and resulted in high zzso zzso To measure zzso changes over a wide range zzso to zzso zzso with higher zzso ratios were expressed in these zzso zzso of leaf zzso with zzso led to zzso ratio changes for zzso with in zzso zzso values of 600 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but one with 170 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso In intact roots, zzso zzso gave no response, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all responded to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso steady state zzso levels depend on external supply in both leaves and roots, but under the conditions tested they are lower in root versus zzso and guard zzso Without photosynthesis and external supply, zzso zzso can decrease to zzso zzso in root zzso Thus, observed zzso are steeper than expected, and steady state levels do not appear subject to tight zzso zzso zzso plants can be used to assess zzso flux differences between cells, zzso zzso zzso in zzso delivery of zzso to roots, and zzso flux in zzso affected in sugar zzso zzso and zzso
