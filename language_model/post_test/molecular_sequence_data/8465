The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are simply organized zzso zzso They have long been the subject of zzso zzso Some authors have suggested that zzso represent an offshoot from an early zzso zzso Other workers considered them to be zzso progeny of higher zzso possibly zzso zzso We determined the almost complete zzso sequences of zzso zzso in two species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated purely from zzso zzso We compared these sequences with sequences determined in the present study from three zzso species, as well as with a variety of zzso sequences obtained from zzso The zzso trees reconstructed with the use of the zzso zzso and zzso methods indicated that the zzso belong among the zzso animals zzso However, we cannot firmly establish the position of the zzso within the zzso because we cannot ignore the problem of long branch attraction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present results favor the hypothesis that the zzso do not represent an early divergent zzso group, but rather a group zzso from a zzso zzso
