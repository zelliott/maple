A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by suppression zzso zzso and rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein contained a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso mature protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso Da and a theoretical zzso of zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso zzso from insects, zzso fish and other zzso The zzso gene contains three zzso and two zzso with at least two copies in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene was zzso during the initial zzso zzso zzso comparison and evolutionary marker analysis revealed that zzso was a member of the zzso zzso zzso family with potential zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso modeling showed that zzso adopts a two zzso fold typical of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso off early during zzso zzso
