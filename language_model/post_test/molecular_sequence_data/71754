We previously presented evidence zzso et zzso (1997) zzso 78, zzso that, in addition to their ubiquitous expression of zzso zzso produce a second zzso suggested to be zzso a recently discovered member of the family of gap junction zzso A zzso specific zzso was subsequently developed and zzso here to confirm and extend our earlier zzso On western zzso this zzso detected a 30,000 zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso cat and human brain, and exhibited no zzso with zzso zzso or any other known zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso was localized in zzso at gap junctions between these cells and on the zzso side of gap junctions between zzso and zzso Double zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso gap zzso zzso zzso patterns for both zzso were zzso similar, but differences were zzso In contrast to regional zzso zzso zzso and zzso areas exhibited considerably greater expression than zzso areas, zzso zzso zzso zzso were more heavily zzso for zzso white matter tracts such as corpus zzso internal capsule and anterior zzso were devoid of zzso and appreciable levels of zzso during development were not seen until about zzso day zzso These results indicate that zzso is expressed by gray, but not white matter zzso its distribution is highly zzso in gray matter, it is zzso with zzso at zzso gap junctions where it forms zzso or zzso zzso and its emergence is delayed until relatively late during brain zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso expression at both regional and cellular levels is subject to regulation in adult brain as well as during brain zzso
