zzso zzso and zzso resonance assignments have been made for all 145 zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso in oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained by recording and analyzing zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso experiments on zzso zzso zzso pH zzso at 300 zzso Many of the zzso zzso have also been zzso zzso zzso long-range zzso in combination with zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso exchange data, indicate that the secondary structure consists of a zzso parallel zzso and four zzso with a zzso identical to that determined previously by X-ray zzso zzso One zzso which is distorted in the X-ray structure, is zzso in solution as zzso Several zzso zzso which serve to dock the zzso zzso to its binding site, have also been zzso Based on zzso into zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso ring is zzso accessible and not strongly zzso in the zzso binding site, in contrast to what has been observed in several other zzso The resonance assignments presented here can form the basis for assigning zzso zzso zzso and for zzso structural differences between zzso and zzso zzso with altered zzso zzso
