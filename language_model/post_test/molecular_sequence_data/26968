DNA extraction bias is a frequently cited but poorly understood limitation of molecular zzso of environmental microbial zzso To assess the bias of a commonly used soil DNA extraction zzso we varied the cell zzso protocol and conducted multiple zzso on zzso of zzso sand, and organic zzso DNA, as well as bacterial and zzso zzso gene copies as measured by quantitative zzso continued to be isolated in successive zzso When terminal restriction zzso length zzso was used, a significant shift in community composition due to extraction bias was detected for bacteria but not for zzso zzso indicated that the relative zzso of sequences from rarely cultivated groups such as zzso zzso and zzso were higher in the first extraction than in the sixth but that the reverse was true for zzso and zzso This suggests that the well-known zzso bacterial zzso bias may be partially exaggerated by DNA extraction zzso We conclude that bias can be adequately reduced in many situations by pooling three successive zzso and additional measures should be considered when divergent soil types are compared or when comprehensive community analysis is zzso
