To identify putative tumor zzso genes in zzso we combined the zzso difference analysis and reverse northern zzso identifying zzso genes in human zzso zzso One of them was zzso zzso was zzso in 11 out of the 20 human zzso zzso as compared to their counterparts of zzso liver zzso by northern zzso zzso It was also zzso in 29 out of 48 human cancer samples including the zzso urinary zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso Its gene product, zzso was found to be zzso and have two zzso the 55 zzso in the zzso and 50 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 7 cells led to suppression of cell growth, which was primarily attributable to induction of cell zzso The suppression phenomenon was found to be zzso related (most prominent in zzso and least in zzso zzso and zzso dependent zzso as the cell density zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso cells caused suppression on colony formation in zzso and reduced tumor growth rate in zzso zzso nude zzso In conclusion, these data indicate that zzso functions as a zzso for human tumor zzso
