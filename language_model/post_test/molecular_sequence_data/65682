zzso quantitative zzso by mass zzso aims to selectively detect one or a panel of zzso in a complex sample and is particularly appealing for novel zzso zzso because it does not require specific zzso Here, we demonstrated the application of targeted quantitative zzso in searching, zzso and zzso selected peptides in human zzso spinal fluid zzso using a zzso laser zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso The approach involved two major zzso the use of zzso synthetic peptides as references for targeted identification and zzso and a highly selective mass zzso analysis based on the unique characteristics of the zzso zzso The platform provides high confidence for targeted zzso detection in a complex system and can potentially be developed into a zzso zzso Using the liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso platform and the complementary identification strategy, we were able to selectively identify and zzso a panel of targeted peptides in the whole zzso of zzso without prior depletion of abundant zzso The effectiveness and zzso of the approach associated with different sample complexity, sample preparation strategies, as well as mass zzso zzso were zzso Other issues related to zzso separation and the feasibility for zzso analysis were also zzso Finally, we applied targeted quantitative zzso to analyze a subset of previously identified candidate markers in zzso samples of patients with Parkinson's disease zzso at different stages and Alzheimer's disease zzso along with normal zzso
