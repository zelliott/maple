When zzso virus 40 zzso is serially zzso at high zzso a zzso collection of naturally arising zzso is zzso Those which are the most abundant presumably have a selective zzso advantage over other defective and zzso helper zzso Two such naturally arising zzso zzso of zzso have been characterized in terms of complete zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by Lee et zzso zzso zzso zzso is from zzso serial passage 13, whereas zzso is newly isolated from zzso serial passage 6 of an zzso evolutionary zzso Both zzso contain a zzso zzso repeated segment of DNA consisting of viral zzso C and zzso A sequences that have zzso with a segment of host DNA that is not highly reiterated in the monkey zzso The monkey segment differs in the two zzso as does the size of the viral segment zzso In two additional zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from serial passage 20 by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from serial passage zzso the zzso sequences derived from the replication origin are present as zzso zzso The zzso repeat regions of these two zzso have been analyzed at the zzso sequence level and are compared with zzso zzso zzso from passage 45 zzso characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The viral segment containing the regulatory signals for replication and viral gene expression is considerably shortened in later serial passages as demonstrated by these five zzso It is of interest that the zzso presumably arose due to their enhanced replication efficiency, yet are missing some of the sequence elements implicated in the regulation of zzso Furthermore, a comparison of the structure of the replication origin regions indicates that additional changes occur in the zzso regulatory region with continued zzso serial zzso
