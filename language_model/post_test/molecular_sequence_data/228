zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the steroid required for resumption of zzso arrested zzso in zzso Though zzso zzso have been cloned from few fish species, its role in final zzso maturation zzso is still zzso To study the role of zzso in zzso more zzso we cloned and characterized zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso coli expressed zzso zzso both full-length and an zzso truncated proteins zzso the reduction of steroids and zzso however there was significant difference between zzso zzso zzso and Western blots demonstrated the presence of zzso transcript and protein in various zzso with relatively higher level in zzso zzso kidney and zzso A positive correlation of zzso expression was observed in different zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis with specific zzso identified presence of zzso in zzso layer of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso showed an induction of zzso expression during human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso a rise in zzso zzso activity was also zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited not only zzso protein zzso activity but also zzso zzso maturation in a zzso manner as evidenced by blocking of zzso zzso break zzso These results together provide new zzso for the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso
