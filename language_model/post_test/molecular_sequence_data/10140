zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected from clinical specimens of 15 patients in a burn unit and a plastic surgery ward over a zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso were compared for the zzso typing of these 18 zzso and zzso zzso unrelated zzso These 18 zzso demonstrated an identical fingerprint pattern and were easily distinguished from the 15 zzso unrelated strains by zzso gel zzso typing and both zzso repetitive zzso zzso and repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso gel zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA is a highly zzso and zzso method for zzso typing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, poor resolution due to frequent cutting in the smaller fragments zzso zzso zzso may lead to difficulty in zzso zzso is a rapid and highly zzso but less zzso technique with occasional loss of major zzso The fingerprints produced by repetitive zzso zzso primed zzso had more intense bands and were easier to read than those produced by zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso in this zzso
