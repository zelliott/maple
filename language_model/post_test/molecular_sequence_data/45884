In plant zzso zzso zzso serves both as a template for replication through reverse zzso and a zzso zzso This zzso has a complex leader sequence preceding the first large zzso The leader contains multiple short zzso and strong secondary structure, both zzso zzso zzso zzso on this zzso is initiated by zzso in which scanning zzso bypass a large portion of the leader with the zzso secondary structure and short zzso In zzso mosaic virus zzso the zzso zzso mechanism involves translation of the zzso short zzso terminating in front of the secondary structure that appears to force zzso to take off and resume scanning at a landing site downstream of the zzso Using two plant zzso systems and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that in Rice zzso zzso virus zzso zzso also depends on the first short zzso followed by strong secondary zzso zzso of the zzso shunt elements between zzso and zzso revealed the importance of zzso composition of the landing sequence for efficient zzso The results suggest that the mechanism of zzso zzso is evolutionary zzso in plant zzso
