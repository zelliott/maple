In most insect groups, the zzso gene zzso specifies the development of consecutive zzso anterior abdominal zzso In contrast, the zzso family shows pronounced differentiation of the anterior abdominal segments: the first is fused to the zzso zzso the second, the zzso is a zzso segment in all zzso and the third, the zzso can either take the appearance of a gastric segment (as in the zzso or of a zzso segment, (as in the zzso Changes in the regulation of the zzso gene are suspected to be instrumental in this zzso zzso Previous work has shown that the zzso coding sequences of the zzso gene is nearly identical between all zzso zzso Therefore any evolutionary change within the zzso family in the zzso activity of zzso is most likely due to a change in gene expression than to a change in the activity of the zzso zzso Here I present the embryonic expression of the zzso gene in two zzso species with different abdominal zzso I find that by the zzso band stage, zzso transcripts are detected in a similar pattern in both species whereas the early patterning of zzso is distinctly different between the two zzso
