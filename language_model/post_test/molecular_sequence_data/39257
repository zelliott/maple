Two novel zzso zzso bacterial strains were isolated from forest zzso According to their zzso zzso gene zzso these strains are related closely to each other and form a distinct cluster within the order zzso They show the typical features of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and production of aerial zzso The distinct zzso positions and the combination of zzso characteristics of these strains justify the proposal of zzso zzso zzso Both strains display zzso acid plus traces of zzso acid, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso cellular fatty acids zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso They differ in the fatty acid profiles, in the quantitative ratios of the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in the occurrence of additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso in strain zzso and zzso in strain zzso zzso in the zzso characteristics and in the zzso zzso gene sequences suggest the description of two species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (the type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso Due to the large zzso distance from known zzso zzso it is proposed to accommodate zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso is proposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the newly proposed family zzso described in the accompanying zzso
