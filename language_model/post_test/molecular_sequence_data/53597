zzso is one of very few zzso proteins for which high resolution structures have been zzso The structure shows a bundle of seven zzso connected by six zzso Some turns in proteins are stabilized by short range interactions and can behave as small zzso These observations suggest that peptides containing the sequence of the turns in a membrane protein such as zzso may form stable turn structures in zzso To test this hypothesis, we determined the solution structure of three peptides each containing the sequence of one of the turns in zzso The solution structures of the peptides closely resemble the structures of the corresponding turns in the high resolution structures of the intact zzso
