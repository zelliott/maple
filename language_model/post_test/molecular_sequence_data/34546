Beech zzso were infected with the root rot pathogen zzso zzso to study its impact on leaf physiology and water zzso Net photosynthesis rate decreased two days after zzso in infected zzso In contrast, electron quantum yield of zzso II, leaf water potential, and total water consumption were only slightly impaired until 6 zzso At the same time, zzso symptoms occurred on zzso These results indicate the involvement of a mobile signal triggering the early changes in leaf physiology by root zzso As the zzso gene of zzso zzso was induced during root infection, we zzso and zzso the zzso protein and tested its ability to change leaf zzso parameters of zzso and tobacco zzso zzso zzso produced a single zzso zzso zzso which caused necrosis and decreased gas exchange of tobacco zzso Furthermore, it induced an zzso burst in tobacco cell suspension zzso However, none of these effects were observed in zzso
