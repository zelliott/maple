Forty zzso zzso strains were investigated for zzso sequences related to the zzso locus from zzso zzso by Southern zzso of zzso DNA using the zzso locus from zzso zzso strain zzso as a probe and by zzso using zzso internal to the zzso zzso The intensity of the zzso signal at high stringency and positive zzso results suggested that 12 zzso zzso strains possessed a similar zzso zzso zzso was negative for another 12 zzso zzso strains and the zzso signal obtained from 11 of these was weak and one was zzso All zzso zzso strains zzso under low stringency zzso These results indicated that there is variation among the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Among seven strains of zzso zzso and the proposed species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was weak and no zzso products were zzso suggesting that these species have sequences related to, but divergent from, the zzso sequences of strains of zzso zzso Both gene probe zzso and zzso analysis of nine strains of the proposed new zzso zzso including zzso from pigs and humans, gave negative zzso
