A new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso has been isolated and zzso The gene contains zzso zzso and codes for a protein containing zzso zzso acids and a mass of zzso zzso A putative signal zzso of 29 zzso acids is present and the mature protein has a mass of zzso zzso zzso does not have zzso acid sequence zzso to previously isolated zzso and zzso but does show sequence zzso to family 5 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is not a component of the zzso and does not contain a duplicated sequence zzso at its zzso zzso zzso is capable of binding to cellulose and zzso zzso but not zzso The cellulose binding domain zzso differs from types I, II and III zzso and no obvious zzso has been found to other zzso zzso The maximum activity of zzso occurs at pH zzso and at 47 degrees zzso Its properties suggest that zzso plays an ancillary role in the degradation of cellulosic zzso
