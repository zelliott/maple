The zzso zzso delta zinc finger protein controls zzso gene expression during zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso delta zzso display various zzso zzso ranging from abnormal zzso to zzso adult zzso We report here that zzso delta is a zzso zzso zzso A single zzso delta consensus binding site zzso in either orientation, is sufficient to promote zzso zzso in cell culture, and multiple zzso mediate a strong synergistic zzso reflecting the zzso of zzso delta binding to zzso Further, several lines of evidence strongly suggest that zzso delta binds to DNA as a zzso While each of three point zzso located in the third zinc finger of zzso delta drastically reduces its DNA binding zzso a fourth zzso located in the zzso region of the zzso specifically affects the zzso of DNA zzso This zzso reveals the functional importance of a putative zzso zinc finger motif of a novel type, located outside the DNA binding zzso A systematic deletion analysis shows that interaction between this proposed zzso motif and a classical zzso zinc finger mediates zzso which is required for DNA binding zzso
