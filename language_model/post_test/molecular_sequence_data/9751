The conversion of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important step in the mechanism of zzso action in the zzso However, the distribution of zzso zzso in adult zzso monkey brains has not been studied because specific zzso have not been zzso To address this deficit, we cloned and zzso a zzso segment of the zzso coding region of the zzso zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted from a zzso monkey zzso zzso 47 of gestation and subjected to reverse zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using consensus zzso zzso selected from published human and rat zzso DNA zzso The zzso product was zzso into a zzso and zzso The monkey zzso zzso was zzso identical to the human sequence but shared only zzso zzso with the rat zzso We then developed a zzso protection zzso using a monkey zzso zzso and studied the distribution of zzso zzso in adult monkey zzso This zzso protected two zzso fragments, one 455 zzso zzso in length and the second approximately 300 zzso The relative distribution of zzso zzso (the zzso zzso between brain areas of the adult zzso zzso 3) was high in the bed nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso nucleus, median zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso zzso and low in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso cortex, zzso and zzso zzso activity, as measured by the zzso zzso correlated well with the distribution of zzso zzso (the zzso protected zzso r zzso zzso in the same zzso A shorter protected zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso zzso the bed nucleus of the zzso zzso the amygdala, and the zzso and zzso zzso but not in the other brain areas zzso Its presence did not correlate with zzso activity in brain zzso This study describes the development of a zzso protection zzso using a monkey zzso produced by zzso and its usefulness for studying the distribution of zzso zzso in brains of nonhuman zzso
