We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso that encompasses the entire zzso unit of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence reveals that the zzso encodes a zzso of 508 zzso and zzso molecular zzso zzso of the zzso clone isolated as zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by the following criteria: zzso zzso acid zzso are zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso acid sequence probably corresponding to the zzso site is highly zzso zzso to that reported for chicken liver zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression product of the zzso in zzso coli has zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein includes a sequence of 37 zzso acid zzso at the N zzso that is not present in the zzso zzso The predominantly zzso zzso and zzso nature of the zzso of this sequence suggests that it is a leader zzso to target zzso zzso inside zzso These data plus the zzso pattern in zzso Southern zzso analysis, the different transcript size zzso zzso versus zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and the different expression pattern shown in zzso zzso experiments suggest the presence of two zzso zzso zzso one for the zzso and another for the zzso zzso
