zzso zzso zzso catalyze the sequential zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso In zzso these are precursors of zzso zzso a zzso which plays a central role in the zzso of essential zzso cell wall zzso such as the zzso complex and zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that open reading frame zzso of the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso encodes a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now zzso the zzso to near zzso by using an zzso coli expression system and have shown that the product of this zzso is zzso zzso zzso has an absolute requirement for zzso zzso and an optimal pH range of zzso to zzso and the activity is zzso by both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso the addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso values for the zzso zzso of zzso 29, 84, zzso and 40 zzso zzso The zzso value for zzso zzso is 89 zzso The zzso efficiency is greatest when zzso zzso is used as the zzso zzso suggesting that this is the natural zzso in zzso a conclusion that is supported by previous structural studies of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso This is the first report of a bacterial zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso an zzso zzso primer having the zzso unit in the Z zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso act zzso in the zzso zzso that leads to the formation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
