As a step in zzso the biological role of plasma zzso zzso present in the zzso fluid of zzso zzso we examined pig zzso fluid to determine its constituent zzso and zzso Using the inactive precursor form of plasma zzso zzso as a zzso we zzso an zzso capable of zzso this zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be the active zzso blood zzso factor zzso We also isolated high molecular weight zzso zzso from the same zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso fluid zzso resulted in the production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso blood zzso factor zzso and zzso was examined by Northern zzso analysis using zzso and liver zzso zzso All these transcripts were found in the liver, but none were found in the zzso In addition, it was found that BK levels in the fluid derived from the small zzso were approximately 6 times higher than those from medium and large zzso These results demonstrate the presence of a zzso system in the zzso zzso and suggest the zzso importance of this zzso hormone in the early stages of zzso development and at zzso
