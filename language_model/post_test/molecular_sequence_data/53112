We isolated a human zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso The human zzso was composed of 450 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of human zzso was zzso identical to that of human zzso zzso identity in the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso transcripts were abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso nucleus, and heart followed by skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells had a low zzso zzso value of zzso 13 zzso which is similar to the zzso value of zzso human zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the relative zzso value of zzso zzso was half to one-third of zzso zzso The zzso activity was inhibited by zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso exhibited unique tissue distribution in humans and kinetic zzso Human zzso showed the lowest zzso values compared to the other zzso zzso which have been reported to be expressed in the zzso zzso human zzso may be involved in the control of zzso neural activity and zzso metabolism in the zzso
