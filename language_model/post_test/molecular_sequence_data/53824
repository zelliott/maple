In mature male zzso the level of nutrition acutely influences the zzso of zzso zzso The mechanism involved is not fully understood but findings in humans and laboratory zzso would suggest a major role for zzso that is zzso from zzso tissue and then travels via the circulation to the central nervous zzso Before we can begin to test this hypothesis, we need to be able to measure zzso zzso in blood plasma and zzso zzso We have therefore developed a zzso using zzso raised against biologically active zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we found that plasma zzso of zzso were highly correlated to zzso thickness and to the ratio of zzso thickness to zzso in female and zzso male zzso Plasma zzso of zzso were higher in female sheep than in zzso or intact male zzso zzso samples zzso 5 zzso suggested that the zzso of zzso in male sheep is episodic but it does not appear to show clear zzso increases zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso in both plasma and zzso fluid increased within 5 days in male sheep fed a diet with a high content of energy and protein that also stimulates the zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that in zzso as in other species, zzso production is correlated with the mass of zzso tissue and that the hormone passes from the circulation to the zzso fluid and then to zzso zzso There, it may affect appetite and perhaps zzso zzso The role of zzso in the link between nutrition and reproduction needs further zzso
