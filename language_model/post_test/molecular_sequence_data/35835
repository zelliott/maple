The zzso method has been used to study zzso of zzso genes zzso and zzso and genes of class of basic zzso complex zzso and zzso zzso in some cattle zzso zzso of zzso locus has been carried out using analysis of protein zzso and DNA zzso It is shown that both methods give identical results and can be used for this purpose, but the zzso method is more zzso A new zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso has been revealed and zzso using the above zzso While analyzing zzso of zzso region of zzso gene two previously zzso zzso sites for zzso zzso I are found which occur only in animals of zzso zzso The high level of zzso of zzso of gene zzso is zzso zzso of zzso was revealed already at the level of zzso analysis of zzso zzso For zzso domain gene zzso the zzso level was much lower and zzso itself during restriction analysis of amplified zzso
