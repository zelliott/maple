zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate rice genes zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso library constructed with the tester zzso from rice zzso and driver zzso from rice zzso fed by zzso consists of 200 zzso Fifty clones were randomly picked and screened by reverse Northern dot zzso and Northern zzso As a result, two zzso fragments have been isolated: one is zzso which encodes rice zzso I antenna zzso the other is a novel rice zzso and designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso library for rice zzso was screened using zzso as probe, and a full-length zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso is 1 285 zzso in zzso the putative open reading frame is zzso zzso long, which encodes a protein with two CBS zzso zzso with zzso zzso
