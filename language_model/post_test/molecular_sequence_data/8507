It appears that the switch zzso machinery of a B zzso targets zzso zzso heavy chain genes that have been rendered zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso human C alpha 1 and C alpha 2 genes is triggered by zzso 1 and is controlled by zzso positive and zzso negative regulatory elements residing upstream of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 switch regions zzso In this report we characterize the positive zzso regulatory elements and zzso their interaction with DNA binding zzso Our data demonstrate that a 100 zzso zzso that contains a zzso responsive element zzso zzso factor zzso zzso a putative zzso binding site and an element that is created by two previously described zzso direct repeats zzso can increase the zzso level of zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso to a zzso promoter in an zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed DNA binding proteins interact specifically with the zzso the zzso site and the zzso zzso Additionally, nuclear proteins interact with sequences which are located downstream of this zzso are not essential for zzso in the transient expression zzso zzso however, they contain motifs that have been previously implicated in regulating DNA zzso zzso These motifs include a Chi motif and a zzso element previously found in the zzso hotspot region of the zzso zzso and close to zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our findings raise the possibility that the intervening region associated regulatory elements in addition to regulating the zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain genes could also facilitate the physical interaction of zzso and zzso controlling molecular zzso
