The zzso zzso A zzso comprises a diverse array of zzso proteins that have a variety of zzso activities and zzso zzso Two rapidly evolving zzso of higher primates are of particular interest as they are major zzso proteins of zzso zzso and have been found to possess zzso activities in zzso To understand how these zzso acquired this function during evolution and to develop animal models for the study of their functions in zzso it is necessary to investigate these genes in many zzso Here, we report the sequences of 38 functional genes and 23 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family from 5 zzso zzso Our zzso analysis of these genes showed a clear pattern of evolution by a rapid zzso process and gene zzso a process characterized by rapid gene zzso and zzso occurring zzso among zzso This process ultimately generates distinct or only partially overlapping inventories of the zzso even in closely related zzso Positive zzso selection also contributed to the diversification of these zzso zzso The striking similarity between the evolutionary patterns of the zzso genes and those of the major zzso complex, zzso and T cell zzso genes stands in strong support of the hypothesis that zzso and generation of diversity are among the primary zzso function of the zzso zzso The discovery of a large number of divergent zzso suggests the intriguing possibility that these proteins have been specifically tailored to fight against distinct zzso zzso
