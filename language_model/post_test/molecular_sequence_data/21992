The zzso tumor zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor that plays an important role in the development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in humans lead to anomalies of kidney and zzso development and cause zzso zzso a pediatric kidney zzso The zzso of both zzso zzso in mice gives rise to multiple organ zzso among them zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso an zzso of zzso has been described that is expressed in the zzso field and is later restricted to the zzso Here, we report the existence of a second zzso gene in zzso which we have named zzso (we named the initial gene zzso The overall sequence identity of the two zzso proteins is zzso and zzso between the zzso regions, zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is expressed from the earliest stages of development zzso albeit at low zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed in the intermediate zzso with zzso being restricted to a smaller area lying at the zzso end of the zzso expression zzso In adult fish, high expression levels for both genes can be found in zzso zzso heart, zzso and zzso
