The zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of one of the two zzso bonds in zzso a potent zzso isolated from zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso has been cloned from a zzso library from zzso zzso by colony zzso using an exact zzso zzso An open reading frame has been identified that encodes a protein of molecular mass zzso zzso in good agreement with the zzso molecular mass of the zzso zzso recently isolated from this source zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene shares significant sequence similarity with that of zzso zzso an zzso that zzso the related zzso of zzso and zzso When the zzso gene was zzso into the zzso zzso the zzso was expressed as about zzso of the total soluble cellular protein in zzso zzso The zzso has been zzso to zzso in three steps in zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso gives zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and this zzso zzso for the product of the zzso reaction has been employed in the zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso reaction have been evaluated for the zzso zzso and for the putative reaction intermediate zzso both of which have been prepared by chemical zzso zzso is converted to zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is converted to zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso Although the zzso added intermediate is not zzso competent, these results suggest that the mechanism for the zzso reaction involves an initial zzso to the intermediate zzso followed by zzso to yield the product zzso
