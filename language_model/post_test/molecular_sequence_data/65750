zzso pneumoniae, a zzso cell zzso zzso has a differentiated terminal zzso that is essential for zzso and gliding zzso zzso an important protein associated with the terminal zzso is required for the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with an zzso N zzso and an exposed C zzso In the present study, we amplified and zzso the full-length zzso gene of zzso zzso directly from 18 Indian zzso zzso zzso diversity was observed in the zzso genes from 16 clinical samples when the sequences were compared with the sequence of strain zzso We also successfully expressed a zzso of the zzso gene zzso that includes the complete zzso zzso zzso acid sequences in different zzso coli expression zzso The zzso binding protein zzso fusion protein was recognized by zzso zzso patient zzso in zzso and the protein was zzso in zzso We further analyzed the zzso of the zzso fusion protein with patient zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared it with the zzso obtained with a commercial kit (the zzso zzso Classic zzso The sensitivity and the specificity of the in-house zzso were zzso and zzso zzso This study suggests that the zzso protein can be used as an zzso along with other zzso proteins for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
