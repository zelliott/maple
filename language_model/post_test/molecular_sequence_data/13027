We have recently demonstrated that synthetic peptides modeled on the extension zzso of zzso zzso can be a good zzso of zzso processing zzso and that zzso zzso present at positions zzso or zzso and distant from the zzso point were important for recognition by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ito, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We further investigated the elements required for zzso of the zzso To analyze the reaction by a more rapid yet quantitative method, we have developed zzso zzso fluorescent zzso Using the zzso zzso we demonstrated that at least one of the zzso and zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also important while other connecting sequences were zzso In addition, the zzso showed considerable preference for aromatic and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso acids in the zzso These results together with the previous data suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso between them, and zzso zzso acid could be critical zzso for the specific zzso of the zzso by the zzso
