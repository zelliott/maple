Using zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso human, zzso or zzso origin, we analyzed serum zzso responses to zzso in zzso calves and zzso infected by the zzso or zzso route with bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso James, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity in zzso zzso zzso resistance to human virus induced by bovine zzso Science zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity of zzso to either zzso or zzso outer zzso protein zzso resistance to challenge with a virulent zzso bearing the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following primary infection and challenge with virulent zzso the animals developed higher or significantly higher zzso zzso to zzso host zzso zzso than to zzso host zzso or zzso host zzso zzso indicating that zzso responses were species specific rather than zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso corresponded closely with the zzso relationships of zzso within a zzso region of zzso acids zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso determined by zzso acid full-length sequence identity predicted poorly their zzso In zzso zzso to zzso induced by previous oral infection failed to zzso protection against challenge from a zzso zzso bearing zzso different zzso and zzso but essentially identical zzso to the zzso zzso in primary zzso Thus, in an approach to zzso with a live oral zzso zzso the zzso protein does not appear to play an important role in protection against zzso disease and zzso
