It is shown that, when zzso in the visible, zzso zzso zzso engages in direct zzso with its DNA binding zzso At the zzso end point, an average of one zzso break is produced per bound zzso zzso in a reaction which also zzso the dye zzso Using high-resolution zzso we have mapped the distribution of zzso zzso sites on DNA, at zzso zzso It is argued that because the zzso is zzso the resulting pattern is similar to, if not identical with, the local distribution of zzso binding zzso When interpreted in the context of the extensive zzso and structural data which are available for zzso a binding distribution of that kind can be used to zzso details of DNA structure variation within the underlying zzso As a first application of the method, we have used zzso to probe the structure of a 265 zzso zzso of DNA, which had been described as being bent as the result of a periodic array of zzso segments zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mapping data provide evidence that the zzso elements in this zzso assume a local secondary structure which is different than that assumed by isolated zzso nearest neighbors and that the ends of the zzso elements comprise a zzso domain with zzso binding properties which differ from those of the zzso element or of zzso zzso
