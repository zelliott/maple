We report on the molecular cloning of a novel human zzso by its interaction with the zzso factor zzso in a zzso zzso zzso This zzso is predominantly expressed in muscle and encodes a protein that is present in the zzso and concentrated in zzso It was therefore termed zzso zzso protein of 30 zzso We have also identified a related zzso with a different zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene demonstrated that both zzso are generated by alternative zzso zzso site usage from a single gene that consists of four zzso spans at least zzso zzso and is located on zzso zzso The alternative zzso zzso site usage introduces a zzso creating two different zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is rich in zzso and zzso and has been found to target the protein into the nucleus, whereas its zzso is characterized by zzso acid zzso in its zzso zzso and is predominantly found in the zzso zzso studies in zzso in zzso protein interaction zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and binds to the zzso domain of zzso but not to other zzso factors zzso zzso of zzso changes alternative zzso usage in zzso and zzso reporter zzso suggesting that zzso influences alternative zzso site selection in zzso
