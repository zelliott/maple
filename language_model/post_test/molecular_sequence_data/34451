zzso of zzso zzso is essential for the differentiation and other zzso processes of germ zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso play key roles in zzso To zzso whether an zzso mechanism is involved in the controlled expression of zzso and zzso we examined the dynamics of DNA zzso at two gene zzso zzso showed changes in zzso patterns in the promoter regions of both genes during the period of germ cell zzso while the zzso patterns in first zzso and first zzso (near the zzso initiation zzso remained zzso The zzso zzso at the zzso zzso locus in the zzso promoters zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and in the zzso promoter zzso zzso to 173 zzso was found to correlate with the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Data therefore suggested that a dynamic DNA zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso but not in the zzso and zzso zzso is linked to the regulation of gene expressions, even though zzso islands are also present in their zzso or zzso
