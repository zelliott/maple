zzso has been isolated from bovine and zzso zzso cartilage and the attached zzso zzso chains subjected to zzso by zzso zzso The zzso generated have been reduced and subsequently isolated by strong zzso zzso Their structures have been determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso acid have been found in the capping zzso and, zzso which is zzso to zzso has been found as a branch in both repeat region and capping zzso These data demonstrate that there are fundamental differences between the structures present in the zzso zzso zzso chains attached to zzso from zzso cartilage and those from zzso cartilage, which lack both zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso It has been confirmed that the zzso zzso chains are short, being only eight or nine zzso in zzso Very significant differences in the levels of zzso zzso have been identified at the zzso end of the zzso The zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso cap is zzso in only zzso of zzso compared with a zzso level of over zzso closer to the reducing zzso This highlights the difference between the chain zzso and the repeat region in terms of structure and points to the potential for functional zzso The repeat region and capping fragments of the zzso zzso zzso from bovine and zzso zzso cartilage zzso have been found to have the following general zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
