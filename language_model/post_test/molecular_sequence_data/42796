We have determined the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso start site of the human zzso releasing hormone gene zzso and identified several putative regulatory zzso Interestingly, we did not detect any zzso responsive zzso we did however find five zzso perfect half zzso zzso responsive zzso which might zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We have identified a segment spanning from zzso to zzso which has about zzso zzso to the 3' terminal half of the human zzso I family of highly repetitive zzso and another one, which spans from zzso to zzso and has greater than zzso zzso to members of human type O family of repetitive zzso These elements may zzso DNA zzso since the zzso for zzso and the human fragile site zzso zzso in human zzso zzso The structural information reported represents a first step in the study of regulation of the zzso gene at the molecular zzso
