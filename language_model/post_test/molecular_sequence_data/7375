zzso and zzso accessory proteins of zzso zzso are required for zzso and the subsequent development of disease zzso The classic example has been zzso pneumoniae, which causes primary zzso pneumonia in zzso zzso of zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso and zzso or in zzso proteins zzso through zzso are unable to colonize host zzso and are zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso zzso pneumonia, arthritis, and AIDS zzso was found to zzso a zzso zzso that shared both DNA and protein sequence similarities with zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso possesses additional zzso sequences to zzso zzso genes and proteins of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are designated zzso and zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso pneumoniae, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 1993, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso organizations of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are similar to the organizations of zzso and zzso genes of zzso pneumoniae, suggesting that the conservation of these zzso genes and proteins might have occurred through horizontal gene transfer events originating from an ancestral gene zzso
