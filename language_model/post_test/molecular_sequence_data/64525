zzso surface zzso zzso is a zzso genetic marker that is highly zzso for characterizing zzso zzso field zzso zzso diversity of zzso obtained from symptomatic patients residing in zzso Cameroon was analyzed by an zzso zzso chain reaction and direct sequencing of amplification zzso Of 137 zzso 25 zzso had only zzso zzso 40 zzso had only zzso zzso and 72 zzso had multiple zzso populations with both zzso Of 295 fragments, 145 zzso and 150 zzso belonged to zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were 23 different zzso zzso (10 zzso and 13 zzso that yielded 44 different combinations in multiple zzso DNA sequencing showed distinct individual zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso family were relatively zzso with most of the zzso arising from differences in the number of repeat zzso In contrast, the sequences within the zzso region in zzso zzso family were less zzso but many of the sequences in zzso zzso have been identified in other zzso from geographically distant zzso Our results show an extensive diversity of the central region of zzso in size, zzso family, combinations of these two features in multiple infections, and sequence variations underlying the complex population structure of zzso zzso clinical zzso in zzso zzso
