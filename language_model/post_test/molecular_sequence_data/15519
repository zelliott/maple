Increased zzso flexibility is the prevailing explanation for the high zzso efficiency of zzso zzso at low zzso However, less is known about the structural zzso of zzso We reported two novel zzso zinc zzso in the zzso family, zzso zzso from a deep sea zzso and zzso zzso from an Arctic sea ice zzso and compared them with their zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso Their zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso followed the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a ratio of approximately zzso zzso and zzso have the same optimal temperature zzso 57 degrees C, 5 degrees C lower than zzso and apparent melting temperature zzso zzso 64 degrees C, approximately 10 degrees C lower than zzso zzso analysis showed that the slightly lower zzso resulted from a decrease in the number of salt zzso Fluorescence zzso experiments and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the zzso of the proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of flexibility is a strategy for cold zzso zzso dynamics results showed that the zzso increase in flexibility from zzso to zzso and zzso especially the increase from zzso to zzso mainly resulted from the decrease of zzso stability in the dynamic structure, which was due to the increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, a model for the cold adaptation of zzso and zzso was zzso This is the first report of the zzso of zzso dynamics as a strategy for cold adaptation and provides new insights into the structural basis underlying zzso zzso
