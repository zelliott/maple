zzso is zzso zzso when modified by zzso and zzso but zzso zzso if only zzso is present, zzso that zzso provides major support for membrane zzso However the direct contribution of zzso to zzso membrane interaction or the extent of its cooperation with zzso is unknown, because in the native protein the zzso must be present before zzso can be zzso To examine if zzso can maintain zzso membrane association despite multiple cycles of zzso a zzso zzso was constructed, with an zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso Although zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso the zzso had less than zzso of the transforming activity of fully zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Poor focus formation was not due to incorrect targeting or gross structural changes, because zzso localized specifically to plasma zzso and triggered differentiation of zzso cells as zzso as native zzso zzso zzso indicated that in zzso both the zzso and the two remaining zzso zzso of zzso were zzso A zzso lacking all three zzso zzso zzso had decreased membrane binding and zzso zzso zzso even with correct targeting and zzso at the zzso zzso was only partially zzso These results indicate that although zzso and zzso share responsibility for zzso membrane zzso each zzso also has distinct zzso zzso may be important for zzso especially zzso while zzso may provide potentially dynamic regulation of membrane zzso
