zzso and zzso positioning was studied in the complexes between two DNA fragments of different zzso both containing a strongly curved sequence from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso either normal or lacking zzso zzso The results obtained by zzso III and zzso I selective zzso were: zzso The first and most stable zzso formed with both types of zzso zzso is positioned on the curved zzso showing a multiple zzso axis zzso positioning with the same zzso zzso This result is in very good agreement with the theoretical zzso obtained by adopting a method developed by us, based on the evaluation of DNA distortion energy from the zzso zzso zzso The second zzso has two main different zzso The first one, near the zzso of the DNA zzso opposite to the curved zzso presents a higher frequency in the case of normal zzso whereas an intermediate position appears populated with a higher frequency in the case of the zzso zzso
