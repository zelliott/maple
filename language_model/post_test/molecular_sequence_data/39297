Using molecular and genetic zzso 28 zzso strains were zzso isolated from widely different geographical localities in Europe, North America, zzso Asia and zzso Most of the strains have been assigned to the species zzso zzso zzso revealed two Japanese zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso to have peculiar zzso Comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence analysis showed that the two strains respectively represent a novel species and a novel zzso Based on the results of sequence analysis, genetic zzso and zzso zzso two new members of the zzso zzso are formally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso has a worldwide distribution, while the species zzso zzso is represented only by the type culture CBS zzso isolated in zzso zzso analysis revealed a correlation between zzso fingerprints and geographical origin of the zzso zzso zzso Despite this molecular zzso zzso zzso strains collected in different regions of the world formed predominantly fertile hybrids, with normal zzso of control zzso
