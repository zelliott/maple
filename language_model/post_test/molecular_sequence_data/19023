zzso architecture of coronary artery disease zzso is still to be zzso Since low density zzso zzso protein 6 zzso gene play critical roles in zzso signal zzso which are important for vascular development and zzso zzso we therefore zzso it to search for zzso in zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso all the zzso and promoter region of zzso gene in a sample of 380 early onset zzso patients and 380 control subjects in zzso 

In total, we identified 5 zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso (one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (one zzso All these zzso located at the zzso domain of zzso zzso In zzso functional analysis of zzso zzso demonstrated that these zzso resulted in a significant reduction in both protein level transporting to cell membrane and downstream zzso signal zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso novel zzso attenuated proliferation and migration of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso when compared with wild type zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrated that these zzso zzso might contribute to disease liability in a subset of zzso and defects in zzso signal zzso might be important contributing factors for the onset of zzso
