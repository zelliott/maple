zzso is an unusual zzso zzso that has been reported to cleave the zzso precursor protein zzso near the middle of its zzso domain zzso but cleave zzso near the zzso end of its zzso To ascertain whether the zzso sequence of the zzso determines where zzso zzso and whether the region just before the zzso zzso in recognition by the zzso we expressed zzso human zzso molecules containing either the zzso or zzso regions of zzso or other zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso released similar amounts of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides as did intact zzso Mass zzso revealed that the principal zzso zzso ended at zzso 40, indicating zzso at the middle of the zzso zzso in the zzso Generation of zzso peptides was significantly decreased when the zzso zzso was replaced by those of zzso or human zzso growth factor zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso region zzso zzso with that of zzso increased generation of zzso zzso while those of human zzso growth factor zzso 3 or zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso We conclude that zzso can cleave near the middle of the zzso zzso that zzso peptides may arise during zzso processing, and that the zzso sequence of the zzso influences recognition or binding by the zzso
