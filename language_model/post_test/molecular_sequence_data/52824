zzso zzso zzso zzso contain an zzso highly zzso zzso motif in the zzso This is called the zzso motif according to the zzso zzso acids along one side of the zzso We studied the function of this motif using zzso zzso experiments of human zzso zzso We replaced each of these zzso acids with zzso and constructed deletion zzso lacking parts of the zzso All zzso were expressed in zzso zzso cells, but only one, zzso was not processed to mature zzso zzso nor was it zzso or zzso into the culture zzso zzso is part of the zzso core in the zzso region of zzso S zzso two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso also zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the latter with zzso led to consequences similar to those with the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso of one of the three zzso zzso were three orders of magnitude less effective as zzso of mature zzso S than the zzso zzso The results point to a dominant role of the respective zzso stack in the proper zzso transport and maturation of zzso S and related zzso zzso zzso zzso
