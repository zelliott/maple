zzso peptides with zzso acid sequences zzso to the zzso sequence of the gamma chain of human zzso were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit zzso zzso A zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso propagation in zzso Since this effect was localized to the surface, we proceeded with in zzso zzso using zzso topical application zzso In a rat model of zzso trauma and zzso repair, topical application of the zzso zzso significantly reduced the rate of zzso to zzso as compared with a control rate of zzso in comparison, a zzso zzso reduced the zzso rate only modestly to zzso which was not significant compared with the control zzso These results indicate the feasibility of zzso therapy with zzso applied agents, an approach that may zzso the use of systemic zzso in zzso zzso
