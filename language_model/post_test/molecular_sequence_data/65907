The unique zzso organization in the zzso zzso coli zzso I zzso zzso has been exploited to generate zzso fragments which, when cloned and zzso reassemble in the presence of zzso to yield a zzso competent zzso zzso zzso zzso methods have been employed for obtaining near complete sequence specific zzso assignments for backbone zzso zzso zzso and zzso atoms of the zzso binding domain of zzso on samples that were zzso enriched in zzso zzso and zzso zzso assignments were obtained for 169 of 177 backbone zzso atoms and zzso of zzso side chain zzso zzso The secondary structure determined on the basis of observed zzso secondary chemical shifts and sequential zzso agrees well with the structure of this domain in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso was studied by both circular zzso and isotope edited solution nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Changes in CD zzso indicate that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and not with the zzso zzso zzso chemical shift mapping methods show that zzso binds close to the zzso binding site in zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso domain zzso The implication of this interaction on the role of the regulatory zzso on the activity of the zzso is zzso
