The biological functions of zzso growth factor zzso I and II are modulated by a family of zzso proteins zzso in complex zzso and zzso zzso For further understanding of the actions of zzso some of these binding proteins have been cloned and zzso We report the molecular cloning of zzso zzso for zzso The zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and the hormonal regulation of its expression have also been determined by comparative reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of this analysis revealed high levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and fin zzso zzso of zzso zzso was throughout the entire embryonic development, with the highest level of expression observed at 36 hours after the onset of zzso zzso levels of expression of zzso were observed 24 hours after injection with zzso and 48 hours with zzso or zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso gene might be modulated by zzso zzso and zzso
