zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso plant in which female sex expression zzso is controlled by the Female zzso locus that can be modified by other zzso genes as well as by environmental and hormonal zzso As in many other zzso zzso is the major plant hormone regulating female sex zzso Previously we isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene that encodes the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We proposed that zzso is present in a single copy in zzso zzso plants whereas zzso plants zzso contain an additional copy zzso that was mapped to the F zzso To study the origin of zzso we cloned and analyzed both the zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is the result of a relatively recent gene zzso and zzso between zzso and a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Taking into consideration that the zzso gene was mapped to the F zzso we propose that this zzso event gave rise to the F locus and to zzso cucumber zzso Computer analysis of the 1 zzso region upstream of the zzso initiation site revealed several putative zzso regulatory elements that can potentially zzso the responsiveness of zzso to zzso and hormonal factors and thereby control female sex determination in zzso These findings lead us to a model explaining the action of zzso and zzso in cucumber floral sex zzso
