The kinetic zzso of a zzso delta zzso includes an essential structural zzso involving the zzso zzso a stem that is formed between the zzso and the zzso We performed zzso experiments to determine the zzso position within the zzso center of an zzso zzso delta zzso zzso that included a zzso either in position zzso zzso or zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso site, or located either in the middle of or at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and shown to be efficiently zzso zzso of the zzso conditions, the use of various zzso zzso as well as the probing and characterization of the resulting zzso complexes, revealed several new features of the molecular zzso zzso the close proximity of several bases between zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso the active zzso complex folds in a manner that zzso the middle of the zzso stem on the zzso zzso while zzso the zzso zzso is in close proximity to the zzso zzso and, zzso some complexes appear to be compatible with being active zzso along the folding pathway, while others seem to zzso to zzso zzso To provide a model representation of these data, a three-dimensional structure of the delta zzso was developed using several zzso zzso software zzso
