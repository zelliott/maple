zzso metabolize a variety of zzso acting as a zzso system that produces zzso of varying chain zzso including zzso and zzso It is, however, still largely unknown how zzso products exit zzso and where they are further zzso zzso contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that produce zzso zzso for transport out of zzso together with recently characterized zzso zzso zzso that produce free fatty zzso Here we have performed tissue expression profiling of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and show that they are largely expressed in different zzso suggesting that they do not compete for the same zzso but rather provide complementary systems for transport of zzso across the zzso zzso These data also explain earlier observed tissue differences in zzso production of zzso and underscores the differences in zzso function in various zzso
