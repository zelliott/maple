zzso virus zzso causes progressive zzso zzso under conditions of zzso especially associated with zzso Despite the high prevalence of zzso infection, few cases of progressive zzso zzso have been reported and only a small number of zzso strains have been characterized in AIDS patients in Southern zzso Diagnosis of progressive zzso zzso through zzso detection of zzso DNA in zzso may result in false negative results if variable regions of the zzso are zzso zzso of circulating zzso zzso in Southern Africa may assist with designing appropriate diagnostic zzso and characterizing the molecular epidemiology of zzso in African AIDS zzso In this study, a new real-time zzso using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso targeting the zzso large zzso was developed and compared to a conventional zzso zzso targeting the variable zzso zzso zzso against known zzso positive specimens confirmed its specificity while amplification of a serial dilution of zzso control DNA suggests that the new real-time zzso can detect lower zzso of zzso than the zzso zzso zzso Investigation of zzso specimens from 44 suspected progressive zzso zzso patients suggest that the new zzso is more sensitive being able to detect zzso in 12 specimens versus 5 specimens with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso region is completely zzso while zzso analysis of the five zzso products identified two zzso 3, one zzso 1 and two zzso 4 zzso the latter two identified for the first time in South African AIDS zzso
