A zzso zzso deletion was made in the zzso zzso region separating the coat and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This region is the focus of several zzso structures zzso high zzso One such element is the operator zzso which, in the course of infection, will bind a zzso zzso thereby zzso further zzso synthesis and initiating zzso Another structure is a long-distance base pairing zzso controlling zzso zzso The zzso deletion does not directly affect the operator hairpin but it zzso the zzso zzso Its main effect, however, is a frame shift in the overlapping zzso zzso This gene starts in the upstream coat zzso runs through the zzso zzso region, and ends in the downstream zzso zzso Here we report and interpret the spectrum of solutions that emerges when the crippled zzso is zzso Four different solutions were obtained by sequencing 40 zzso Three had cured the frame shift in the zzso gene by inserting one zzso in the loop of the operator hairpin causing its zzso Yet these zzso zzso could further improve themselves when zzso The zzso operator was replaced by a substitute and thereafter these zzso found several ways to restore control over the zzso zzso To allow for the evolutionary enrichment of zzso but zzso zzso we zzso zzso samples before zzso zzso obtained in this way also restored the frame shift, but not at the expense of the zzso By taking larger and larger zzso samples for such bulk evolution, ever zzso and zzso zzso zzso Only one made it back to wild zzso As a rule, however, zzso moved further and further away from the zzso sequence because zzso zzso are, in the majority of cases, selected for their capacity to improve the zzso by zzso one of several potential alternative zzso zzso that emerge as a result of the initial zzso This illustrates the role of structural constraints which limit the path of subsequent zzso zzso
