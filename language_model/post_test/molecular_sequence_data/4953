The inherited long zzso syndrome zzso characterized by a prolonged zzso zzso in the zzso and cardiac zzso is caused by zzso in at least four different zzso three of which have been identified and zzso cardiac zzso zzso The most common form of zzso is due to zzso in the zzso channel gene zzso but their effects on associated currents are still zzso Different zzso in zzso cause the dominant zzso zzso syndrome and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso syndrome, which, in addition to cardiac zzso includes zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso protein elicits slowly zzso zzso currents resembling the cardiac zzso zzso We now show that zzso not only changes the zzso of zzso zzso but also its zzso zzso Several zzso found in zzso including a novel zzso zzso in the putative channel zzso abolish channel activity and reduce the activity of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso By contrast, a zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso channel protein zzso channel function without having a zzso zzso This fully explains the different patterns of zzso Further, we identified a novel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but could not achieve functional expression of this nor of a previously described zzso zzso
