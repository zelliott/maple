The DNA sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were determined, along with 500 base pairs zzso of zzso sequence and 320 zzso of zzso zzso An open reading frame, designated zzso occurs upstream of zzso and encodes a zzso of 89 zzso acids which seems to be expressed in a coupled zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso is not zzso to any known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping of in zzso transcripts indicated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are arranged into a single zzso with the zzso initiation site located 30 zzso upstream from the start of zzso zzso centered at zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the zzso initiation site are somewhat zzso to the zzso coli promoter consensus sequence and are zzso to sequences found upstream of genes from several organisms which are zzso related to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso promoter sequence lacks zzso to promoter sequences identified for certain zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso The structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were further analyzed in terms of zzso zzso zzso content, and genetic signals and were related to genetic signals previously identified in zzso zzso and other zzso Taken together, these results are relevant to the analysis of gene expression in zzso zzso and the study of zzso gene structure and zzso
