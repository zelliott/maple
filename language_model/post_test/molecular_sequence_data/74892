zzso is a relatively recently established group of zzso that includes the zzso zzso (which have two similar zzso per zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the more typical one nucleus per zzso The zzso of the group was confirmed by molecular zzso studies, but neither the internal zzso nor its position on the zzso tree has been clearly zzso 

Here we have introduced data for three genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a wide zzso sampling of zzso including ten zzso of zzso representing the zzso zzso and zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences formed two main zzso in individual gene and combined gene zzso with zzso (and zzso on one side of the zzso divergence and zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso to earlier evolutionary scenarios, none of the studied zzso appeared zzso to zzso zzso Instead, the zzso zzso were all robustly situated within the second of the two zzso zzso Furthermore, our analyses suggested that zzso do not constitute a zzso group, and zzso zzso was statistically rejected in zzso zzso tests of the combined gene zzso 

We suggest that all higher zzso intended to unite multiple zzso zzso be abandoned, that zzso and zzso be considered as part of zzso and that the term zzso be used in a strictly utilitarian zzso Our result suggests either that the zzso condition characteristic of zzso arose several times zzso or that the zzso cell of zzso originated several times independently by secondary reduction from the zzso zzso Both scenarios are zzso zzso More comparative data on the similarity of the zzso of the two zzso of zzso will be necessary to resolve which evolutionary scenario is more zzso
