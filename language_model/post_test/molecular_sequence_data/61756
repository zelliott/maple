zzso is a zzso complex responsible for maintaining zzso length of zzso zzso Human zzso has two main zzso the human zzso reverse zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso essential for zzso activity are the template domain, comprised of an zzso zzso and alignment zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain form the zzso zzso which is important for assembly and activity of zzso zzso Here, we have determined that zzso zzso can participate in a long-range zzso interaction with the template region of zzso We characterized this interaction through mobility shift zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso loop zzso participate in the interaction with the zzso The site of interaction at the template domain was determined via zzso zzso zzso These data show that an zzso interaction exists between two highly zzso regions of zzso that are critical for the higher order folding of zzso zzso This interaction argues for the proximity of the template and the zzso domain, and provides the basis for a revised model of zzso zzso the zzso into a zzso domain and a zzso zzso
