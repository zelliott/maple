zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso lead to zzso in the polarity of certain zzso cell zzso We have discovered that zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso which zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso Both in zzso zzso experiments using zzso transcripts and experiments using reporter zzso designed to mimic patterns of zzso expression indicate that zzso is expressed in zzso cells at the tip of the tail and zzso to the cells with zzso affected by zzso zzso Our mosaic analysis indicates that zzso acts cell zzso We propose that zzso protein is zzso by tail zzso cells and affects the polarity of zzso cell divisions that occur more zzso in the zzso
