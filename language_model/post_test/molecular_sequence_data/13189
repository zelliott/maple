This study was designed to determine whether the genes for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso were expressed in close proximity to one another in various regions of the gut and whether they both were evident in two zzso zzso cell zzso The findings would test the idea that zzso acts as an zzso or zzso factor in the zzso 

zzso zzso and Northern analysis were used to detect zzso for zzso and its zzso in various regions of the normal rat gut, in zzso cell populations isolated along the zzso zzso axis in rat zzso and in a rat and a human gastrointestinal zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso also were used to detect the zzso in rat gastrointestinal zzso or in growth medium from cultured zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found in all regions of the rat gut, in all cell populations isolated from rat zzso and in the rat and human cell zzso zzso zzso in tissue sections was observed in rat zzso zzso cells all along the zzso but not in zzso cells, and zzso zzso was found in growth medium from the cultured zzso zzso zzso 

The results show that genes for zzso and its zzso are expressed widely in gut zzso zzso of the two genes in the same regions of the gut and in the same cell line implies a local zzso action of the zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso cells suggests a role in zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso
