We determined complete zzso sequences of lineage 2 West Nile virus zzso strains isolated from patients in South Africa who had mild or severe zzso zzso These strains had previously been shown to produce either highly or less zzso infection and induced genes similar to corresponding highly or less zzso lineage 1 strains in zzso zzso and zzso acid comparison of highly and less zzso lineage 2 strains demonstrated that the zzso zzso especially the zzso protein 5 zzso were most zzso All South African lineage 2 strains possessed the zzso zzso site previously zzso to be associated with zzso Major deletions existed in the 3 zzso region of 2 lineage 2 strains previously shown to be either less or not zzso relative to the highly zzso strains zzso in this zzso
