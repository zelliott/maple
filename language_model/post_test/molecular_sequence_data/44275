We have used circular zzso zzso to determine the extent and location of the DNA bend induced by the DNA binding domain of human wild type zzso zzso upon binding to several naturally occurring DNA response zzso We have found that zzso binding zzso zzso zzso in all of the response elements zzso In particular, response elements having a zzso sequence at the junction of two consensus zzso in each zzso favor highly bent complexes zzso angle is approximately 50 degrees ), whereas response elements having zzso bases at this position are less bent zzso angles from approximately 37 to approximately 25 degrees zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso of different complexes show a direct correlation between the DNA zzso angle and the binding affinity of the zzso with the response zzso zzso the greater the stability of the complex, the more the DNA is bent by zzso zzso The study provides evidence that the zzso of DNA bending, as determined by the presence or absence of flexible sites in the response zzso may contribute significantly to the overall binding affinity of the zzso for different zzso The results therefore suggest that both the structure and the stability of the zzso complex may vary with different response zzso This zzso may be correlated with zzso in zzso zzso
