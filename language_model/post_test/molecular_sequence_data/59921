zzso zzso play a significant role in nature by recycling zzso one of the main components of plant zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso the major constituent of zzso The use of these zzso could greatly improve the overall economics of processing zzso materials for the generation of liquid fuels and zzso Recently zzso zzso have received great attention in the development of environmentally friendly technologies in the paper and pulp zzso In zzso that produce zzso low molecular mass fragments of zzso and their zzso zzso play a key role in regulating its zzso zzso and zzso production appear to be regulated zzso although the zzso of zzso which causes the elimination of both zzso suggests some linkage in the synthesis of the two zzso zzso are found in a cornucopia of organisms and the genes zzso them have been cloned in zzso and zzso hosts with the objectives of zzso the zzso and altering its properties to suit commercial zzso zzso analyses of zzso have revealed distinct zzso and cellulose binding zzso with a separate zzso domain that has been reported to zzso enhanced zzso in some zzso zzso of three-dimensional structures and the properties of zzso have revealed the involvement of specific zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso binding site and of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Many lines of evidence suggest that zzso operate via a double displacement mechanism in which the zzso zzso is zzso although some of the zzso catalyze single displacement reactions with inversion of zzso Based on a zzso obtained from zzso acid sequence similarities the evolutionary relationship between zzso is zzso In addition the properties of zzso from zzso organisms have been evaluated in terms of zzso zzso
