A new strategy for the detection of infectious zzso zzso zzso in water samples, which combines zzso separation zzso for recovery of zzso with in zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso was field tested with a total of 122 raw source water samples and 121 filter zzso water grab samples obtained from 25 sites in the United zzso In addition, samples were processed by zzso zzso and zzso were detected by an zzso zzso zzso as a baseline zzso zzso of different water quality were seeded with viable zzso zzso to evaluate zzso recovery efficiencies and the performance of the zzso zzso Mean method zzso recoveries, including concentration of seeded zzso samples, from raw water were zzso for IMS and zzso for zzso while zzso from seeded filter zzso water were zzso and zzso zzso There was full agreement between zzso zzso counts of zzso seeded samples and zzso zzso In natural samples, zzso detected infectious zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the raw water samples and zzso zzso of the filter zzso water samples, while zzso detected zzso in zzso zzso of the raw water samples and zzso zzso of the filter zzso water zzso All zzso products were confirmed by cloning and DNA sequence analysis and were greater than zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso DNA sequence analysis also revealed zzso zzso zzso among the zzso fragments, suggesting that several different strains of infectious zzso zzso were zzso
