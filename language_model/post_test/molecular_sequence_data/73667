zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso following successful therapy of a primary zzso has been recognized with increasing frequency among cancer survivors over the past several zzso Many of these zzso cases are associated with the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens that employ one or more agents which target zzso zzso II zzso zzso and demonstrate zzso zzso zzso involving either the zzso zzso zzso gene at zzso or the zzso gene at zzso Although many investigators have speculated that these zzso are induced by the therapeutic use of zzso II zzso the molecular sequence of events by which zzso II zzso might induce a zzso zzso are not well zzso We describe here the zzso induction of highly specific, zzso DNA zzso at a specific site within the zzso locus by zzso II zzso This DNA zzso which maps to a region of the zzso locus frequently disrupted by zzso zzso can be induced in several cell lines, with multiple different zzso II zzso indicating that this phenomenon is not restricted to a specific cell type or specific zzso II zzso It is conceivable that zzso zzso DNA zzso within the zzso locus induced by zzso II zzso represents the initial molecular event leading to a zzso zzso and zzso
