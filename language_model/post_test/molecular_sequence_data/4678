zzso proteins are not naturally selected for high affinity major zzso complex zzso binding zzso indeed, if there is any selection, it is likely to be negative in zzso Thus, one should be able to increase viral zzso binding to zzso in the rational design of synthetic zzso zzso The zzso helper zzso from the zzso envelope protein was made more zzso for inducing T cell proliferation to the native sequence by replacing a zzso that exerts an adverse influence on zzso binding to an zzso class II zzso Mice zzso with vaccine zzso combining the more potent zzso helper zzso zzso with a zzso T zzso zzso zzso developed greatly enhanced zzso zzso Use of class II zzso mice confirmed that the enhancement of zzso response was due to class zzso zzso Thus, enhanced T cell help is key for optimal induction of zzso and, by modification of the native zzso to increase binding to zzso it is possible to develop second generation vaccine zzso that enhance both zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso
