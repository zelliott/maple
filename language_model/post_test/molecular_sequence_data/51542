zzso compounds exert their zzso and zzso by complex zzso reducing pathways that generate a variety of zzso forms of zzso and free zzso To investigate the molecular nature of zzso zzso we characterized the entire coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of 27 independent zzso derived from zzso oxide zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, by direct sequencing of zzso zzso Among these zzso 10 consisted of single base zzso five contained two base zzso one had four base zzso six were zzso zzso and five exhibited single base pair insertions or zzso All of the base zzso and most of the zzso zzso observed were located at zzso zzso More than zzso of the base zzso zzso occurred in zzso base zzso Among them, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso hotspots for single and double base zzso were the 3' zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso sequences zzso This zzso specificity was also observed in zzso cells treated with two other zzso compounds, namely zzso and zzso Strand bias was noticed in zzso zzso since zzso of T base zzso occurred on the zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso spectrum suggests that a particular form of zzso may directly interact with DNA at these hotspot zzso
