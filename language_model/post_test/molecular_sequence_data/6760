Six zzso clones from human zzso 21 have been mapped in a set of complete zzso zzso spanning the entire zzso zzso The mapping positions between two zzso on the zzso zzso and the zzso coordinates starting from the zzso of zzso were determined for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso mapping positions agree well with those using a comprehensive zzso cell hybrid mapping zzso
