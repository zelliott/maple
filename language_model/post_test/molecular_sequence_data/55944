zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter zzso and is reduced in various central neurodegenerative zzso From a previously selected zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified and characterized a promoter region of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of a zzso box, a zzso box and several putative regulatory responsive zzso Three zzso initiation sites were determined by primer extension zzso The Northern zzso of zzso zzso showed a single band of zzso zzso in the human nucleus zzso and facial zzso By using transient zzso into zzso and zzso cells of the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene we identified a sequence of 66 zzso upstream of the zzso start site which zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso gene may be a zzso target of zzso and therefore may play a role in zzso responses to various zzso
