A variety of synthetic peptides derived from either the zzso zzso zzso sites or the optimal sequences selected in an oriented zzso library have been compared for their zzso to zzso by protein zzso zzso (also termed zzso zzso The zzso peptides are by far preferred over the library peptides by both rat liver zzso (and by the zzso gamma and zzso zzso zzso from it) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The superiority of the zzso peptides over the library ones is reflected by zzso values one to two orders of magnitude higher while the zzso values are zzso Individual zzso of any of the zzso acids with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso producing both a fall in zzso and an increase in zzso which are more pronounced at position zzso zzso but also quite significant at positions zzso zzso zzso -5 and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso The zzso effect of these zzso is more evident with rat liver zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso resulting from the combination of the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso site and the zzso zzso cluster selected in the library peptides zzso and zzso is zzso as efficiently as the zzso zzso in terms of both zzso and zzso These combined data strongly support the conclusion that, at zzso with the optimal sequences selected in the library, optimal zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso critically relies on the presence of a cluster of zzso zzso (preferably zzso zzso upstream from position zzso zzso while the highly zzso region downstream from zzso selected in the library appears to be zzso The reason for these discrepancies remains zzso The possibility that the library data are biased by the zzso elements forming its scaffold zzso would be consistent with the observation that the zzso zzso despite their low zzso values, fail to compete against the zzso of protein and zzso zzso by zzso suggesting that they bind to elements partially distinct from those responsible for zzso zzso
