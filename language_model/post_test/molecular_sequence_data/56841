This study addresses the DNA sequence recognition event of the zzso antibiotics zzso A1 and zzso gamma zzso by the use of synthetic DNA zzso salt effects, and circular zzso zzso The results reported here provide several important zzso zzso zzso A1 requires a zzso zzso in host DNA for favorable interaction, zzso the sequence selectivity of zzso C is an origin of zzso A1 and zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso in the target recognition by zzso C, its total structure and zzso are important, and zzso the binding of zzso zzso to DNA duplex zzso zzso and zzso change of the host zzso The specific sequence recognition process of zzso has been zzso
