zzso in zzso zzso viruses is one of the principal mechanisms responsible for their zzso Here we show, using a variety of different methods, that the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso II strains of cucumber mosaic virus zzso is related more closely to that of tomato zzso virus zzso than to those of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso arose by zzso zzso zzso The putative crossover is close to the zzso end of the zzso at a zzso hot spot previously observed in short zzso zzso The zzso strains show divergence from zzso at specific points along the zzso that most probably indicate zzso changes due to natural zzso Thus, for the large majority of zzso strains zzso the zzso has two discrete regions, W zzso zzso and Y zzso zzso that are more similar to the corresponding regions of zzso than to those of zzso zzso
