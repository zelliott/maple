The zzso zzso zzso causes fire blight on members of the family zzso with economic importance on apple and zzso During zzso the zzso is exposed to a variety of zzso zzso zzso In plants of zzso many zzso zzso zzso affecting zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediate resistance toward structurally unrelated compounds might zzso tolerance to these zzso To prove this hypothesis, we cloned the zzso locus from zzso zzso zzso a resistance zzso zzso transport zzso In zzso coli, zzso of zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was impaired in zzso on apple rootstock zzso zzso Furthermore, it was susceptible toward extracts of leaves of zzso 106 as well as to the apple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was determined using the zzso reporter gene zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in zzso by the addition of zzso and zzso The promoter activity of zzso zzso a regulatory protein involved in zzso zzso was increased by zzso In zzso an induction of zzso was proved by zzso laser scanning zzso Our results strongly suggest that the zzso transport system plays an important role as a protein complex required for zzso of zzso zzso in resistance toward apple zzso and that it is required for successful colonization of a host zzso
