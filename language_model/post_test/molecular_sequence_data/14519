zzso zzso I zzso functions as the molecular switch of the thin zzso Studies have shown that a zzso button engineered into zzso zzso zzso specifically enhances zzso function in the context of numerous zzso zzso To gain zzso insight into the basis of this finding, we analyzed zzso zzso states zzso by studying the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso that act as zzso chemical zzso of altered zzso zzso We also assessed the role of zzso zzso zzso by means of molecular dynamics zzso A functional zzso analysis of zzso at baseline zzso zzso indicated similar cellular zzso function and zzso calcium sensitivity between zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso showed increased zzso calcium zzso Under zzso conditions, compared with zzso zzso the zzso expressing zzso zzso maintained a zzso performance similar to that observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations showed similar zzso atomic contacts between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, simulations of zzso zzso zzso showed various potential structural zzso one of which included a salt bridge between zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso This salt bridge was zzso in simulations of the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that differential zzso zzso may be necessary for zzso zzso to act as a molecular sensor capable of modulating zzso performance in response to changes in the zzso zzso
