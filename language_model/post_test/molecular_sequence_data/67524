zzso marine snails like zzso species are known to possess zzso zzso in their zzso zzso The zzso zzso have been identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, it is still unclear which zzso family zzso the zzso zzso belong to, since no complete primary structure of zzso zzso has been zzso Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the primary structure of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso covering entire coding region of zzso consisted of zzso and zzso an zzso sequence of zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence comprised an initiation zzso a putative signal zzso of 14 zzso a zzso region of 16 zzso and a mature zzso domain of 260 zzso The mature zzso domain showed zzso zzso identities with other zzso zzso zzso The zzso important zzso in zzso zzso which were identified in the Chlorella virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso in zzso zzso zzso regarding these zzso that is, replacements of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to Ala, decreased the activity of zzso zzso to various zzso From these results we concluded that zzso is a member of zzso zzso zzso Besides the effects of above zzso we noticed that the replacement of zzso by Ala changed the zzso preference of zzso zzso the activities toward sodium zzso and zzso zzso increased and became comparable with the activity toward zzso zzso This suggests that the region including zzso of zzso closely relates to the recognition of zzso region of zzso
