zzso of DNA synthesis by human zzso virus, type 1 reverse zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and is incompletely understood at the zzso and structural zzso zzso acid substitution at only three zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso is known to increase zzso We report here that substitution at zzso can also increase zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced primer extension in zzso zzso lacking a complementary zzso and exhibited a zzso decrease in zzso frequency in the zzso zzso forward zzso zzso Previous structural studies indicate that zzso and zzso lie in a region that interacts with template zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso exhibited 6- to zzso decreases in binding affinity zzso for zzso and DNA templates relative to wild type zzso In contrast, zzso zzso which also increases zzso zzso et zzso zzso showed a 6- to zzso increased zzso The zzso of zzso zzso on both zzso and DNA templates was substantially reduced relative to wild type zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso We discuss relationships of zzso template zzso and zzso in these and other zzso zzso zzso
