The putative structural gene zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli was cloned and zzso zzso sequence determination with the isolated zzso protein showed that this zzso is coded by the zzso gene and that it is zzso initially with an zzso signal zzso No significant sequence zzso with the other zzso zzso zzso zzso or any other protein was zzso The precise zzso mapping position of zzso relative to two other zzso zzso and zzso was shown to be zzso zzso zzso coli strains carrying zzso plasmids with the zzso gene produced zzso more zzso and zzso it into the zzso where it appeared to function normally in zzso since the release of cell wall peptides into the medium increased in zzso The transformed cells were, however, not unusually sensitive to zzso and their zzso had a normal degree of zzso
