zzso zzso protein zzso is the initial zzso in the zzso cassette (ABC) system of bacteria, which exhibits a broad specificity in binding zzso without regard to zzso Here, we present a zzso study on the structural properties and energetic landscapes of zzso protein interacting with its zzso zzso on the basis of 28 zzso zzso zzso By employing a zzso protocol that couples the hybrid quantum zzso mechanical zzso scheme and the sophisticated zzso area zzso zzso model together to analyze and decompose the energy components associated with the zzso zzso we demonstrate that the broad specificity of zzso peptides is originated from a series of exquisite balances between the free energy contributions from, for example, the direct zzso interactions and indirect zzso effects, the main chains and side zzso and the different zzso positions of the zzso zzso We also show that, in a framework of zzso quantitative zzso relationship zzso methodology, the zzso energy terms could be used as a good zzso to characterize the interaction profile of zzso with peptides and correlate pretty well with the zzso measured affinities of the zzso
