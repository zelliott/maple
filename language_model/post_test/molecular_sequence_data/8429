zzso zzso 1 zzso is zzso in most normal humans, but in some patients with the zzso disease primary zzso type 1 zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso In an attempt to identify the sequences in zzso that mediate its targeting to zzso and to determine the mechanism by which zzso is zzso in zzso we have studied the zzso zzso of various normal and zzso zzso zzso in normal human zzso and cell lines with selective deficiencies of zzso protein import, using zzso zzso after zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso The results show that zzso is imported into zzso via the zzso targeting sequence type 1 zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of human zzso was shown to be necessary for its zzso import, this zzso was unable to direct the zzso import of the bona fide zzso protein zzso zzso or the reporter protein bacterial zzso zzso An zzso region immediately upstream of the zzso zzso was also found to be necessary for the zzso import of zzso but again this region was found to be insufficient to direct the zzso import of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of human zzso by the zzso zzso found in the zzso of other zzso species zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso also allowed zzso zzso showing that the allowable zzso motif in zzso is considerably more zzso than, or at least very different from, that acceptable in zzso zzso possessing the two zzso acid zzso responsible for its zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso was targeted mainly to the zzso However, zzso possessing each zzso acid substitution on its own were targeted normally to the zzso This suggests that zzso increased functional efficiency of the otherwise weak zzso targeting sequence zzso by the zzso zzso is not due to interference with the zzso targeting or import of zzso
