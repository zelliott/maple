We have studied the structure and the function of a truncated human insulin zzso in which 113 zzso acids zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso were zzso In this study, zzso and truncated insulin receptors were expressed by stable zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso processing of the insulin zzso zzso zzso is zzso and degradation of the truncated zzso is zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of the zzso insulin zzso is zzso This is associated with a zzso in zzso zzso Finally, in zzso cells, the zzso insulin zzso failed to mediate the zzso effects of zzso In zzso cells, zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not alter zzso response to zzso It has previously been shown that deletion of 43 zzso acids at the zzso of the zzso did not affect insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the structural domain located zzso zzso acids from the zzso appears to have several functional zzso First, the domain appears to promote folding of zzso into the optimal zzso for zzso zzso Second, the presence of this domain appears to promote the stability of the zzso zzso in intact zzso Finally, perhaps as a consequence of the effects upon the stability of the zzso this domain is required in intact cells for zzso zzso and signal zzso
