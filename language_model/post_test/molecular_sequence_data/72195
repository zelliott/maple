In a zzso artificial zzso zzso close to the nude locus on mouse zzso 11, we identified a novel zzso zzso that encodes a protein with similarity to the active site of zzso zzso is zzso between zzso species, and two zzso genes were found in zzso zzso The zzso transcripts are expressed in all adult zzso zzso but restricted to the nervous system and the limb buds in Day zzso zzso The zzso protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus of cells zzso with the zzso expression zzso Since the zzso expressed protein of zzso showed zzso activity of the insulin zzso bonds with zzso similar to that of zzso it may be a zzso regulator of the nuclear zzso such as zzso zzso
