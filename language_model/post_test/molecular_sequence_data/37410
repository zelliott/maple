zzso data quality now makes it feasible to exploit the weak anomalous signal derived only from the zzso inherent to the protein or in particular from zzso zzso incorporated by zzso The latter technique requires the location of a high number of partially occupied zzso zzso This number appears to be roughly zzso to the exposed protein zzso This paper explores the application of zzso zzso zzso methods as implemented in the program zzso to the location of zzso of sulfur in zzso experiments, zzso in zzso and MAD experiments and zzso using zzso and zzso to determine the zzso zzso zzso of atoms consistent with the Patterson function were generated as a starting point for the zzso recycling procedure in zzso The zzso is then expanded to the full structure by zzso phasing with zzso and density modification with the program zzso Success in the location of the zzso and subsequent phasing depends critically on the quality of the data and on the extent of the anomalous zzso This varies with each crystal and zzso but for the same crystal the significance of the anomalous signal was found to be highly sensitive to the zzso of the intensity zzso which in some cases made all the zzso This is illustrated by the determination of the previously unknown structure of repeat 11 of the human zzso growth factor II zzso zzso with 310 zzso acids in the zzso unit, which was phased by soaking the zzso in a zzso solution containing zzso zzso
