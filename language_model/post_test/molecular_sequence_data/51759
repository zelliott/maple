In the cerebral zzso of the central nervous system of the freshwater snail zzso zzso many zzso are zzso processed from larger zzso at sites marked by both single and multiple basic zzso zzso In the present study we identified cloned zzso and zzso products corresponding to three putative zzso that may be involved in zzso zzso The zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso with an overall sequence identity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the recently characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso has approximately zzso zzso with the zzso domain, and approximately zzso and approximately 50% with the zzso and zzso part, respectively, of the zzso zzso Two cloned zzso products, zzso 1 and zzso 2, show highest sequence identity to zzso zzso of the zzso gene is exclusively in the central nervous system, where two zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso
