A zzso coding for bovine zzso zzso zzso endowed with zzso activity was cloned from calf zzso zzso by zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends protocols zzso and 3' zzso Two products were isolated: a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a 3' zzso zzso zzso fragment, with an overlapping region of zzso zzso leading to a total length of zzso zzso zzso The similarity in the coding region to that of the human zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indirectly identified as a zzso was zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences were zzso zzso The bovine zzso sequence included the sequences zzso for six peptides obtained from zzso zzso from calf zzso Northern blots of human zzso species from different zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso expressed at equal levels in most zzso The zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso and the protein obtained after induction had a molecular mass of 61 zzso under zzso It exhibited both zzso and zzso activity, as well as zzso and kinetic properties similar to those of the zzso zzso from calf zzso This is the first time that a fully active zzso zzso has been zzso
