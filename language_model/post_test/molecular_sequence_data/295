The seven members of the zzso family are responsible for generation of the zzso and zzso required for a variety of host defense and cell signaling functions in zzso zzso Two members, the dual zzso zzso zzso and zzso share a structurally unique zzso an zzso zzso zzso Despite sequence similarity to the zzso zzso the absence of key active site zzso makes their binding of zzso and their zzso function zzso To explore this domain we have expressed in a zzso system and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins demonstrated that the isolated zzso does not bind zzso and has no intrinsic zzso zzso In contrast, zzso binds zzso zzso exhibits a modest zzso activity, but does not zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso appears to have two zzso links to the protein despite the absence of a second zzso zzso group in the active zzso Although the zzso dual zzso motif has been proposed to directly convert zzso to zzso neither zzso domain demonstrated significant zzso zzso zzso These results strengthen the in zzso conclusion that the zzso protein supports controlled zzso zzso of zzso zzso and indicate that the zzso protein either has a unique function or must interact with other protein factors to express its zzso zzso
