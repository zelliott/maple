zzso catalyze the synthesis of the zzso and zzso zzso or the D zzso zzso in an early step of zzso zzso Their function is essential for bacterial growth and specific to bacteria, making them attractive targets for the development of novel zzso This review examines the zzso and structural features of these zzso and presents the main families of zzso described so zzso Over the last 20 years, 7 structures of zzso have been solved by X-ray zzso giving a detailed view of the general zzso of the active site and of the zzso in the zzso pocket that play a central role in zzso zzso This has paved the way to the rational design of zzso which can be classified as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the product of the reaction, zzso zzso of the transition state, and zzso original scaffolds discovered by screening or by rational zzso zzso The three first strategies have led to molecules that are polar by nature and have therefore poor access to their zzso zzso The fourth one is potentially most promising as it yields more diverse zzso The most active molecules show affinity zzso in the zzso range, but zzso evaluation remains scarce zzso zzso zzso zzso for the tested zzso These data strongly suggest targeting zzso is a promising approach for discovery of new zzso Future research should, however, aim at finding more potent zzso endowed with the appropriate zzso properties that ensure access to their zzso zzso
