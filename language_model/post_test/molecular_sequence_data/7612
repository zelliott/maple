The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are involved in the assembly of viral zzso and required for efficient viral zzso The full-length zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and is zzso processed at the release zzso site and the maturation zzso site, releasing the zzso domain No zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso To understand the biological importance of zzso at these sites, we constructed several zzso in the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine the functional properties of these zzso proteins by their abilities to complement the growth of the zzso deletion zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso expression of full-length zzso is not required for viral zzso since a zzso zzso zzso lacking the M site could support viral zzso and that zzso elimination of the R site by changing the zzso zzso to zzso abolished viral zzso To better understand the functions that are zzso by zzso processing at the R site of the zzso we engineered an zzso zzso virus containing a zzso at this zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso virus demonstrated that zzso the zzso zzso retained the ability to cleave at the M site and to trans process zzso but failed to support viral growth on zzso cells, demonstrating that release of the zzso domain No from zzso is required for viral zzso and that zzso only empty zzso structures were observed by electron zzso in thin sections of zzso zzso cells, indicating that viral DNA was not zzso Our results demonstrate that processing of zzso is not sufficient to support viral replication and provide genetic evidence that the zzso zzso has nuclear functions other than zzso zzso
