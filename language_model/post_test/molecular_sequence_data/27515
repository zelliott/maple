Small zzso zzso zzso are localized within the zzso a zzso zzso in which they guide zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Up until now, zzso have only been identified in zzso and zzso zzso but are notably absent in zzso By screening B zzso for expression of zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso virus zzso we here report, for the first time, the identification of a zzso gene within a viral zzso designated as zzso This genetic element displays all hallmark sequence motifs of a zzso zzso box zzso namely zzso as well as zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was verified by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso We also confirmed binding of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso The zzso motif of zzso was shown to be crucial for the stability of the viral zzso its selective deletion in the viral zzso led to a complete zzso of zzso expression levels within zzso B zzso We further provide evidence that zzso might serve as a zzso zzso which is processed into 24 zzso sized zzso species, designated as zzso A potential target site of zzso was identified within the zzso of zzso zzso which encodes the viral DNA zzso zzso was found to be expressed in all investigated zzso cell lines, including zzso cell lines zzso Interestingly, induction of the zzso cycle markedly zzso expression levels of zzso up to zzso By a zzso approach, we identified a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This evolutionary conservation suggests an important role of zzso during zzso zzso
