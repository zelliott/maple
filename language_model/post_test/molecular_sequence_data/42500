We zzso the zzso method to amplify the zzso zzso area of the Southeast Asia type and several regions of the zzso gene cluster to diagnose rightward deletion zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso or zzso forms of the zzso H zzso For the zzso form, a natural restriction site of zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso Spring zzso zzso or other termination zzso zzso Another naturally occurring restriction site of zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso For the deletion form of the zzso H disease, the differences among zzso I, II and III of the rightward or zzso deletion were used to distinguish the zzso For further characterization of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the same zzso for detecting termination zzso zzso were used to amplify part of the zzso zzso then the zzso product was zzso by the restriction zzso zzso In the 57 cases which were zzso 19 were deletion forms while 38 were zzso zzso In the deletion form cases, 13 were rightward deletion zzso zzso and the other 6 were zzso deletion zzso zzso However, all of the zzso form cases were zzso with zzso zzso After the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 11 out of 13 were type I deletions and the other 2 were type II zzso
