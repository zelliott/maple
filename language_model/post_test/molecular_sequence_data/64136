zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso such as zzso releasing single zzso zzso from the reducing end of the zzso zzso Using directed evolution techniques of zzso zzso and zzso library zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been isolated that zzso the zzso zzso at a zzso greater rate than its wild type zzso zzso The zzso library, expressed in zzso coli, was screened at 85 degrees C for increased zzso of zzso a native zzso rather than a zzso zzso using a zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso was 108 zzso 3 units zzso whereas that of the zzso was 75 zzso 2 units zzso The zzso for both proteins was nearly the zzso The zzso for the new zzso increased by zzso and its zzso efficiency zzso for zzso also rose by zzso as compared with the zzso The zzso sequence of two positive clones and two zzso clones identified 11 single base zzso The zzso transition in the most active clone caused an zzso to zzso zzso acid substitution at position zzso zzso models for zzso and zzso proteins were derived by sequence zzso with zzso Data Bank code zzso from zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso model structures indicated that the substitution in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and reconfigured entry to the active zzso
