Recently, zzso and other structures discovered on zzso have been reported as examples of functional zzso structures, zzso Such motifs were shown to be present as zzso valid structures but they are obscured among other zzso zzso Here, I present a novel, practical virtual zzso (the zzso zzso visualizing motifs on zzso strands as zzso zzso Every motif along with zzso of their zzso could be observed on the zzso in zzso manners, and whole structures of zzso could be zzso zzso the zzso helped distinguish valid and less valid zzso The zzso was applied to variety of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso to identify structures of high zzso on them, previously reported functional motifs were successfully zzso These findings indicate that the structures of zzso that may be folded into multiple forms can be further discussed zzso based on the visual zzso to discover functional zzso zzso
