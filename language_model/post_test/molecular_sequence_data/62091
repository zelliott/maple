zzso evidence revealed protein zzso zzso and zzso activities in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso A novel zzso sequence of a zzso zzso was identified in both sexual and asexual stages of zzso zzso and named zzso since the predicted primary structure of the zzso acid zzso showed significant similarity to the human and zzso zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain within a zzso zzso zzso The zzso region, consisting of one zzso and eight zzso represented a zzso domain with a potentially unconventional zzso zzso zzso contained zzso of zinc per zzso protein and zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso in the putative zinc finger region abolished zinc binding and drastically reduced zzso activity, suggesting an zzso role of zinc in zzso zzso was expressed in essentially all zzso stages of the zzso and shuttled between the nucleus and the zzso in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso protein zzso was also characterized and shown to interact with zzso thus implicating zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso represents the first zzso zzso zzso characterized in the zzso zzso
