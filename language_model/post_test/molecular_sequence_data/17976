In zzso patterns of expression of a miniature zzso class I major zzso zzso zzso were analyzed both in zzso in the zzso and in transgenic zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA sequences revealed that zzso is highly zzso to the pig gene zzso which encodes a classical transplantation zzso Despite the extensive zzso zzso is expressed in zzso at markedly lower levels than zzso in nearly all zzso Introduction of zzso into mice results in a pattern of zzso expression in the transgenic animals that parallels that observed in zzso in the zzso zzso of two lines of zzso transgenic mice, which differ only in the extent of zzso zzso zzso reveals the presence of a zzso zzso The zzso activity is tissue zzso differences in zzso expression are observed only in zzso zzso and zzso zzso from both lines of zzso mediates graft zzso but the rate of rejection zzso with the level of zzso zzso
