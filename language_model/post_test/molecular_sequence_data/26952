Factor zzso zzso functions in blood zzso zzso is composed of four apple zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to an zzso bleeding disorder, which is remarkable for the lack of correlation between bleeding symptoms and zzso zzso activity zzso The number of zzso previously reported in our interactive web database zzso is now significantly increased to 183 through our new patient studies and from literature zzso Eight novel zzso zzso give a total of 120 throughout the zzso gene zzso The most abundant defects in zzso are revealed to be those from zzso plasma levels zzso I: zzso that originate from protein zzso rather than from functional defects zzso II: zzso A total of 70 zzso zzso zzso were zzso using a consensus zzso domain structure generated from the zzso zzso crystal zzso This showed that all parts of the zzso domain were zzso The 47 SP zzso zzso were also distributed throughout the SP domain zzso The periphery of the zzso zzso structure is sensitive to structural zzso caused by zzso changes throughout the zzso domain, yet this zzso is crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso interface in the zzso are much less directly zzso We conclude that the abundance of Type I defects in zzso results from the sensitivity of the zzso domain folding to zzso changes within this, and discuss how structural knowledge of the zzso improves our understanding of zzso zzso
