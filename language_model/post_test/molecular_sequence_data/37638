Two novel zzso zzso one from human, zzso and one from zzso zzso have been isolated, zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and radiation hybrid mapping have identified zzso to be zzso on human zzso zzso and zzso on human zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso mapping has zzso the genes to mouse zzso 9 and 6, zzso Northern analysis reveals zzso zzso expression only in brain zzso However, zzso zzso can be found in heart, skeletal muscle and zzso Both receptors are closely related with 36 and zzso overall zzso acid identity, respectively, to the zzso zzso However, although successful cell surface expression in a zzso expression system can be achieved no specific binding to this zzso family can be zzso indicating that perhaps additional factors are required for zzso
