zzso is an important constituent of membrane zzso and is a precursor for the zzso signaling zzso It is zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso composed of a zzso zzso in most zzso zzso It is a putative target for zzso drugs such as zzso and zzso Here, we show that the rat gene zzso zzso this zzso generates a number of alternatively spliced transcripts in addition to the fully spliced form that encodes the zzso zzso (the alpha zzso Specifically, we identify a small zzso zzso (the zzso zzso derived by an zzso retention mechanism and provide evidence for its existence in rat zzso The zzso zzso is highly zzso in zzso but it lacks the zzso domain while retaining the zzso binding zzso Both alpha and zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in many rat zzso and display apparent zzso in zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso not only detects the alpha and zzso zzso but also several other zzso in zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso is composed of unique zzso in various zzso Interestingly, the alpha zzso is not expressed in the zzso zzso zzso activity zzso using zzso alpha and zzso zzso indicate that the latter zzso zzso alpha zzso activity, possibly by competing for zzso zzso Our findings have important ramifications for understanding the mood stabilization process and suggest that zzso zzso is a highly regulated and dynamic zzso
