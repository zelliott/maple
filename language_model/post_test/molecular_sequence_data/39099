The human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso of primary zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso zzso We previously used a panel of zzso zzso zzso proteins to identify linear zzso acid segments that have roles in zzso the distinct zzso zzso to these proteins zzso zzso zzso and Grant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies indicated that a zzso central region zzso zzso distinct from that containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso was important in determining zzso zzso zzso In the present study we have refined our analysis through further zzso generation of this zzso region and by subsequent zzso zzso of individual zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso proteins with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso respectively suggests that zzso zzso zzso and 129 are important zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had the greatest effect on specificity for zzso whereas changing zzso had the greatest effect on specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso values for zzso that were comparable with those of the zzso zzso zzso that the zzso affected zzso zzso specificity rather than zzso binding zzso Taken together with previous zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and 129 might contribute to the formation of the zzso pocket surrounding zzso and function as important zzso of zzso zzso zzso
