zzso using 1 primer specific for zzso zzso and 1 primer zzso to the zzso allowed amplification of a 377 zzso zzso zzso part of an zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso Use of this zzso as a probe allowed the isolation of a larger zzso zzso In common with 2 other zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso predicted protein has several of the general characteristics of this class of zzso but lacks specific zzso of zzso zzso
