Do the zzso mechanisms that control an zzso zzso content, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respiratory zzso also cause differences between zzso We explored the zzso of zzso c zzso zzso activities in muscles from 12 zzso differing zzso in zzso zzso muscles differed in zzso patterns from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Consideration of zzso domain reduced the differences within species, but zzso differences zzso For zzso zzso there was no significant zzso relationship in zzso for zzso zzso or zzso yet zzso zzso was a good predictor of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated with each other zzso zzso zzso and both could predict zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso and zzso This paradox was resolved by zzso analysis, which explained zzso of zzso variation, about equally zzso between mass effects and zzso (or zzso zzso levels, independent of zzso To explore the zzso of zzso zzso we analyzed 52 zzso zzso zzso promoters and found no size dependence in regulatory element zzso Likewise, the activity of zzso promoter reporter genes from 30 zzso showed no significant relationship with body zzso zzso these studies suggest that not all muscles scale zzso but for those that show zzso zzso zzso regulation of the master regulators, zzso and zzso does not account for zzso patterns, though it does contribute to zzso differences in zzso activities independent of zzso
