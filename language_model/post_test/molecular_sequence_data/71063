zzso C zzso is an zzso zzso derived zzso from zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso A gene zzso involved in synthesis of zzso has been identified and found to be linked to the zzso resistance zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that zzso encodes a zzso protein that has zzso identity zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso as well as with two additional zzso zzso from related zzso zzso zzso Gene disruption and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso copy of zzso completely blocked the production of zzso The function of zzso was confirmed by zzso of an zzso zzso strain containing a zzso zzso in zzso with zzso A second gene zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso to a group of zzso was identified immediately downstream of zzso that upon disruption resulted in zzso of zzso zzso This work has localized a cluster of key genes that mediate assembly of the unique zzso class of natural zzso
