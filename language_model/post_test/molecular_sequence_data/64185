Members of the zzso zzso protein family serve as regulated zzso zzso proteins that, upon zzso bind the scaffolding protein zzso of 50 zzso zzso Here we report a zzso A resolution zzso analysis of a complex between the active zzso zzso zzso domain and a 38 zzso zzso from the C zzso of zzso This zzso result, combined with sequence and structural zzso suggests that the zzso 11 zzso of zzso binds as an zzso at the same site occupied in the dormant zzso by the last 11 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso support for this interpretation derives from in zzso studies showing that appropriate zzso in both the zzso tail zzso and the zzso domain reduce zzso and that a zzso representing just the zzso 14 zzso of zzso also binds to zzso Combined with the recent identification of the zzso binding site on the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso Shimizu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 22, zzso this study reveals that the zzso domain contains two distinct binding sites for zzso zzso The contribution of each zzso to zzso function can now be dissected by making zzso zzso that specifically affect the binding of each zzso
