zzso is an essential zzso for all cells because it plays a role in the synthesis of the membrane zzso components of the cell zzso as a zzso donor in zzso metabolism as well as in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso affects the expression of genes involved in cell zzso zzso and zzso and it has been associated with liver dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso transport and metabolism have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's zzso zzso the study of zzso transport and the characteristics of zzso zzso are of central importance to understanding the mechanisms that zzso membrane integrity and cell signaling in such zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso distinguish three systems for zzso zzso zzso zzso facilitated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It is only recently, however, that the proteins having transport characteristics of at least one of these systems have been zzso They include zzso zzso organic zzso zzso zzso with low affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso are selectively inhibited with zzso and essentially display characteristics of specialized zzso for targeted zzso zzso zzso is abundant in zzso and almost exclusively supplies zzso for zzso zzso The focus here is more on zzso zzso zzso zzso They are expressed in different organisms and cell types, apparently not for the zzso of zzso but for the production of the most abundant zzso of zzso the membrane zzso zzso
