The zzso receptors zzso detect molecular signatures of invaders known as zzso molecular patterns zzso Ten members of the zzso family have been identified in cattle to date and 4 of these recognize zzso specific to viruses zzso 3, 7, 8, zzso The objective of this work was to detect zzso in the zzso sequences of bovine zzso 3, 7, 8, and zzso To achieve this objective, a panel of nine breeds representing zzso zzso and zzso zzso was assembled for sequencing and comparison with the zzso Genome Project zzso Comparative sequence analysis revealed a total of 139 zzso which include zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of the 139 zzso zzso zzso are zzso In addition, the protein domain architecture of these four zzso was examined between human, zzso zzso and dog, which revealed several regions of conservation in the zzso variable zzso zzso
