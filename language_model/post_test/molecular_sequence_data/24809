The gag zzso zzso sequences of human zzso virus type 1 zzso were analyzed from three zzso mothers zzso who failed to transmit zzso to their infants in the absence of zzso zzso including multiple deliveries in the case of mother zzso There was a low degree of zzso of gag zzso zzso sequences in zzso mothers compared with our previously analyzed zzso zzso zzso Whereas most of the functional zzso essential for zzso zzso function were generally zzso the zzso site was less zzso Several zzso acid zzso including zzso zzso zzso at the major zzso site, were variable and the zzso zzso zzso a zzso or zzso at position 15, an zzso at position 54, a zzso at position 76, a zzso at position 104, and an zzso acid at positions 102 and 121 were zzso in zzso zzso sequences compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of 82 zzso zzso sequences revealed distinct clusters for each zzso zzso Some of these motifs in gag zzso zzso sequences that are present in zzso mothers and absent in zzso mothers could be used as new targets for the development of preventive strategies for zzso zzso
