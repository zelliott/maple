zzso zzso type C zzso cause zzso zzso in humans or zzso zzso and zzso in domestic zzso Type C zzso always produce alpha toxin and beta toxin but often produce additional zzso zzso zzso toxin or zzso Since zzso carriage of zzso genes has not been systematically investigated for type C zzso the current study used Southern zzso zzso of zzso gels to test whether several toxin genes are zzso borne among a collection of type C zzso Those analyses revealed that the surveyed type C zzso carry their beta zzso gene zzso on plasmids ranging in size from zzso to zzso zzso When present in these type C zzso the zzso toxin gene localized to plasmids distinct from the zzso zzso However, some zzso type C zzso appeared to carry their zzso zzso gene on a zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso the large zzso zzso was localized to the zzso plasmids of some zzso type C zzso The zzso plasmids in most surveyed zzso were found to carry both zzso sequences and the zzso zzso which can mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso which is often present near zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso was identified upstream of the zzso gene in many type C zzso Overlapping zzso analyses suggested that the zzso plasmids of the surveyed type C zzso differ from the zzso plasmids of type A zzso These findings provide new insight into plasmids of proven or potential importance for type C zzso
