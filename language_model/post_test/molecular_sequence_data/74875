zzso is required for protein processing, zzso and zzso in zzso cells, although the particular roles of the zzso involved in the zzso system of plants are zzso One zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso in protein zzso yet, zzso appears similar in transport activity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in its zzso zzso pumps zzso the ability to grow on zzso medium and tolerance to toxic levels of zzso A green fluorescent zzso zzso was functionally competent and localized to zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso loading into internal zzso enhanced zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso fluorescent protein associated with a zzso of zzso compartments based on partial zzso with the zzso zzso Interestingly, three independent zzso zzso disruption zzso showed severe reduction in root growth normally zzso by 3 zzso zzso indicating that zzso function cannot be replaced by an zzso zzso Furthermore, root growth of zzso is sensitive to 50 zzso zzso indicating that zzso is also important for the zzso of excess zzso zzso zzso zzso roots produced zzso more zzso protein than zzso roots, as monitored by zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso process was zzso Together, these results demonstrate that the role of zzso is distinct from that of the more abundant zzso zzso zzso supports zzso root growth and the zzso of high zzso possibly through activities zzso by zzso compartments that coordinate membrane traffic and sorting of materials to the zzso and the cell zzso
