zzso is an important innate immune zzso that causes human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso which can result in zzso viral zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by targeting it for degradation and zzso its incorporation into viral zzso Additional zzso zzso zzso have been identified, such as zzso which has a similar mode of action but different sequence zzso A relationship between zzso and zzso disease progression has been zzso During zzso sequence analysis of the zzso region of 240 zzso subjects from zzso Kenya, 13 drastically zzso zzso sequences were zzso zzso derived from plasma virus, however, lacked zzso as did zzso zzso When zzso of disease progression were zzso subjects with zzso zzso were found to have significantly higher zzso counts than the other zzso Furthermore, zzso as estimated by elevated zzso content positively correlated with zzso count for all 240 study zzso The sequence context of the observed zzso was statistically associated with zzso zzso In contrast to previous studies, this study demonstrates that higher zzso counts correlate with increased zzso in the absence of obvious zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This strongly suggests that host factors, such as zzso are playing a protective role in these patients, modulating viral zzso and host disease zzso These findings support the potential of targeting zzso for therapeutic zzso
