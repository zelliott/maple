A sample of 204 zzso zzso zzso from 10 zzso representing 24 species were collected from 10 different localities in New zzso and examined for blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 8 infections showing 2 distinct zzso types of malaria zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso sequence data, in the form of zzso zzso b sequences from the zzso infections, showed 2 distinct zzso of zzso 1 in zzso zzso hosts and 1 in zzso zzso which zzso to the 2 zzso There was substantial genetic variation between the 2 zzso as well as within the zzso of zzso zzso Nearly half of the zzso sampled had green blood zzso resulting from the presence of zzso in the zzso however, only 1 of these zzso was infected with zzso zzso and only 2 had any blood zzso These preliminary results suggest a high degree of zzso diversity but a very low prevalence of zzso zzso infections in the zzso of this globally important zzso hot zzso
