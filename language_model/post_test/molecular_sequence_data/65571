Human zzso is a newly identified 46 zzso protein that has a zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standing for zzso A for generally zzso zzso acid, and X for any zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are known to associate with charged zzso body protein 4 zzso a component of zzso sorting complex required for transport III, via their zzso zzso and to play roles in sorting of zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso has an authentic zzso domain on the basis of its capacity for interacting with zzso Both zzso zzso binding sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulled down zzso zzso that was zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of cells with a zzso zzso zzso caused an zzso mobility shift of zzso and the mobility coincided with that of zzso The inhibitor also caused a mobility shift of zzso zzso detected by western zzso using zzso zzso to zzso suggesting zzso of zzso in zzso Fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that zzso exhibited zzso in the zzso area and caused a zzso pattern of zzso that was zzso expressed in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso showed a diffuse pattern throughout the cell, including the nucleus, and did not cause zzso of zzso Fluorescent signals of zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso merged partly with those of zzso markers and with those of abnormal zzso induced by zzso of a dominant negative zzso of AAA type zzso zzso in zzso cells, but such zzso was less efficient for zzso These results suggest a zzso significance of zzso of zzso in its zzso distribution and efficient interaction with zzso in zzso
