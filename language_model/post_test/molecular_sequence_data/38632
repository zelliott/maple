zzso zzso the agent of zzso is a normal inhabitant of aquatic zzso in which it survives under a wide range of conditions of pH and zzso In this work, we identified the zzso gene in a zzso epidemic strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 382 zzso acids that is very similar to the proteins zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso ( approximately zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso enabling it to grow in 700 zzso zzso pH zzso indicating functional zzso to zzso coli zzso However, unlike zzso coli, the growth of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not restricted at various pH and zzso zzso although it was inhibited in the presence of 120 zzso zzso at pH zzso Nevertheless, using a zzso zzso fusion, we observed induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso contributing to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequences were detected in all strains of zzso zzso from the various zzso This gene is presumably involved in the survival and persistence of zzso bacteria in their natural zzso
