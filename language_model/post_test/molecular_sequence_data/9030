zzso surface protein C zzso is an important candidate for a cost-effective vaccine with broad coverage against zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso is able to bind to both human factor H zzso an inhibitor of complement alternative pathway, and human zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso was classified into 11 groups based on variations of the zzso In this work, we used three zzso fragments from different groups zzso zzso and zzso to zzso mice for the production of zzso zzso with zzso induced zzso that recognized the majority of the clinical zzso as analyzed by Western zzso of zzso extracts and flow zzso of intact bacteria, while zzso zzso showed zzso with the zzso zzso surface protein A zzso and zzso zzso reacted only with the zzso zzso Most of the zzso tested showed strong binding to FH and weaker interaction with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso led to some zzso of binding of zzso and zzso with zzso partially inhibited zzso binding in Western zzso The analysis of intact bacteria through flow zzso showed only a small decrease in FH binding after incubation of strain zzso with zzso zzso and one clinical isolate showed zzso of zzso binding by zzso zzso We conclude that although zzso zzso were able to recognize zzso zzso from the majority of the strains tested, partial zzso of FH and zzso binding through zzso zzso in zzso could be observed for only a restricted number of zzso
