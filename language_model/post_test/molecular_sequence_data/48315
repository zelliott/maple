zzso drug delivery of proteins is challenging because the skin acts as a natural and protective zzso Several techniques including using the zzso peptides have been studied to increase the penetration of therapeutic proteins into and through the zzso zzso peptides facilitate and improve the zzso of large and zzso cargo molecules through plasma zzso We have recently reported an efficient skin delivery of zzso protein in complex with a zzso zzso called zzso As the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso complexes have been linked with their biological responses, in this study, we investigated zzso properties of zzso complexes zzso zzso stored in three temperatures zzso zzso and zzso by zzso correlation zzso circular zzso and zzso zzso We also evaluated the ability of zzso of this complex into cells and skin tissue using both zzso zzso and Kodak zzso FX Pro Imaging zzso
