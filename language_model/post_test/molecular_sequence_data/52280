Recent zzso studies on human zzso II have led to the conclusion that the zzso zzso and/or zzso are important for biological zzso These studies have been confirmed and extended with the help of chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso 17), and zzso zzso zzso The CD zzso of synthetic human zzso and of the derivatives are zzso Yet, only the native human zzso II is biologically active and binds strongly to zzso zzso preparations in zzso The zzso is strictly due to side chain functions, in particular the replacement of either or both zzso in the positions zzso or zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso and zzso interaction via zzso zzso and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso alone are sufficient and a positive charge zzso from the B chain zzso is equally zzso This binding mechanism appears to be unique, as concerns hormone zzso zzso
