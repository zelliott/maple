We carried out molecular analyses of the novel flaky skin zzso zzso zzso synonym for zzso which we found in a previous zzso It was revealed that this zzso involved a zzso zzso deletion including zzso 9 and 10 of the zzso zzso and that the zzso deletion in zzso zzso zzso disrupt the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Based on a comparison of three zzso zzso including zzso zzso synonym for zzso and zzso zzso synonym for zzso it was suggested that either zzso 9 or zzso 10 or both may play a more important role than the other zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene expression analyses using Northern zzso revealed that zzso zzso is expressed in 11 zzso except zzso In conclusion, we confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for abnormal zzso observed in various zzso of mice with the flaky skin zzso
