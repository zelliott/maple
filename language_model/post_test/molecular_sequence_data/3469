We report the cloning and expression analysis of a mouse gene zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso is similar to that of zzso and zzso during early zzso being prominent in the zzso zzso boundary, zzso zzso zzso limb bud and zzso of mouse zzso These expression profiles indicate that zzso zzso and zzso belong to a zzso group and suggest that these genes may functionally interact during embryonic zzso From zzso zzso partially distinct patterns of expression of these genes are observed in the zzso sense zzso and zzso zzso that are known sites of expression of other zzso
