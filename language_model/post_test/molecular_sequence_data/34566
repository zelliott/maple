zzso is expressed in the zzso layer of zzso and known to be one of the zzso targets in zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso in zzso is thought to be an zzso zzso recognized by zzso the diagnostic sensitivity of synthetic zzso zzso is zzso To investigate the implication of zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso in zzso arthritis, we zzso zzso zzso using unmodified zzso zzso in the zzso from 73 patients with zzso arthritis, 150 patients with other zzso tissue diseases and 70 normal zzso We also performed the correlation analysis between zzso zzso and the clinical variables in patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in zzso arthritis patients compared to normal controls zzso but not in patients with zzso zzso zzso or systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso zzso were more frequently found in patients with zzso arthritis compared to normal controls zzso vs zzso respectively, zzso An zzso zzso zzso was correlated with visual analogue scale of pain, tender joint count, Ritchie zzso index or zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso recognizes the zzso zzso as an zzso and its zzso zzso with clinical zzso explaining the variable sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso
