Aging is associated with bone loss and degenerative joint diseases, in which the aging of bone zzso zzso stem cell zzso may play an important zzso In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of zzso from 14 donors between 36 and 74 years old, and obtained zzso genes (in the background of zzso and zzso genes (in the background of old zzso zzso analysis of these genes suggests that zzso in zzso might play an important role in the aging of human zzso On the other hand, zzso presentation and signaling of immune cells were the top pathways enriched by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso of zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso Most zzso we found significant zzso differential expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso those genes have been implicated in the bone loss and the pathology of osteoporosis and zzso in zzso zzso our results suggest a pathological role of zzso in zzso skeletal diseases, and suggest the possibility that zzso in the zzso of zzso might also play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso
