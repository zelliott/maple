zzso to type I diabetes is linked to class II zzso zzso in both mouse and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso molecules mediate disease zzso are zzso To analyze how I-A zzso zzso to, or zzso the development of type I diabetes, we have zzso as the first step, to investigate the immune response to an important zzso cell protein in zzso and zzso zzso zzso class II zzso zzso zzso and resistance to diabetes select completely different sets of zzso zzso from the beta zzso cell zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso studies, analysis of zzso zzso and zzso with these zzso zzso indicate that the two zzso acid zzso within the zzso chain that distinguish a zzso from a zzso zzso are sufficient to alter zzso binding and zzso restriction and may also influence zzso presentation and the selection of the T cell zzso The data indicate that the molecular mechanisms for class zzso selection of zzso zzso are complex and differ for each individual zzso zzso Further study of the functional characteristics of the response to these zzso should provide insight into mechanisms of zzso diabetes zzso
