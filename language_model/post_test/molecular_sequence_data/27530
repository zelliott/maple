zzso zzso receptors zzso display a broad variety of zzso which in turn present a complex zzso and regional expression pattern in the brain, as well as a specific pharmacological zzso The association of these zzso with different types of brain disease has turned them into interesting drug targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or zzso or for zzso compounds among zzso In the same way, zzso zzso present at zzso junctions are also being targeted by muscle zzso However, to date no high-resolution structural data are available on functional zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the selectivity profiles of different zzso zzso zzso enabling efficient drug design, is a serious zzso Over the last eight years various high-resolution structures of zzso binding protein zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso in complex with different zzso have provided detailed insight into the neurotransmitter binding site of zzso zzso zzso We present here the various efforts towards zzso zzso specificity in these receptors through the structural studies of zzso binding zzso zzso
