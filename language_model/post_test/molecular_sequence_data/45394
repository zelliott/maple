During zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso it became apparent that a second zzso copy of the locus was present in most of the investigated zzso The zzso event was older than the radiation of all recent zzso and the zzso zzso copy was zzso in nearly all members of the plant zzso Using single zzso zzso and inverse zzso we could exclude a zzso location for the second zzso Although zzso into the nucleus is possible, zzso zzso seems more likely based on these zzso In total, the zzso sequence contained at least zzso base pairs zzso that were zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis of the zzso copy revealed a high amount of zzso compared to zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this copy proved to be insufficient for zzso reconstruction of the zzso Since two different zzso of the zzso copy were found in one species, it is feasible that different zzso were zzso in different groups and that zzso sequences were included in the data zzso These data demonstrate that zzso analyses of zzso copies of zzso relevant zzso should be performed with great zzso In addition, zzso copies can exist in nearly every member of a plant family, and can be zzso at levels comparable to the specific zzso In this case, the inclusion of such copies can easily remain zzso thus leading to faulty zzso
