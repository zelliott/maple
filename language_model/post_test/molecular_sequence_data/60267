We report the expression cloning of a novel zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso clone zzso that is identical to a recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso Comparisons to other known zzso family members zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show that zzso zzso and zzso constitute a unique related zzso with a high level of overall zzso acid zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso The zzso zzso are not as highly zzso but display novel motifs which are putative sites of zzso zzso including an zzso zzso zzso zzso motif and a motif found in zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso showed high levels of zzso zzso in zzso and moderate expression in zzso peripheral blood zzso and small zzso zzso zzso was detected in peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso specific for zzso confirmed high expression in the zzso and zzso of the zzso Using this zzso on peripheral blood zzso showed an almost exclusive expression pattern on B zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for specific binding of zzso While zzso exhibited tight binding zzso 91 zzso the other two showed weak binding with zzso values in the 1-2 zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso indicated that zzso selectively bound zzso zzso allowing its formal designation as zzso The identification of zzso as a zzso family member, coupled with its restricted expression pattern, suggests that it may mediate zzso recognition events by interacting with zzso zzso zzso expressed on specific cell zzso We also propose a role for zzso in zzso zzso as a molecular sink to regulate zzso serum zzso
