zzso is a zzso fatty acid zzso that stimulates zzso hormone release from zzso zzso cells and is implicated in zzso and zzso zzso The functional consequences of long zzso and short zzso human zzso zzso zzso which differ by zzso of 16 zzso acids in the third zzso loop, are currently zzso Here we compare signaling and zzso trafficking of zzso and zzso zzso using calcium zzso and dynamic mass zzso zzso zzso together with quantitative imaging zzso of zzso association and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso receptors zzso both zzso calcium zzso and zzso responses in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, when zzso with zzso acid, zzso acid, or the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were insensitive to zzso zzso but increases in zzso calcium were attenuated by zzso zzso an inhibitor of store zzso zzso zzso Despite equivalent cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso no specific calcium or zzso responses were observed in cells zzso with this zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso receptors both recruited zzso and underwent robust zzso with similar zzso zzso in each zzso After zzso zzso zzso neither zzso zzso recycled rapidly to the cell zzso In both cases, zzso zzso indicated zzso targeting to zzso zzso Thus, the third zzso loop zzso in zzso prevents G zzso zzso calcium and zzso responses, but this zzso zzso remains functionally coupled to the zzso pathway, providing one of the first examples of a native zzso zzso
