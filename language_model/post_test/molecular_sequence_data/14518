zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is almost exclusively expressed in the zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso no other target zzso is known at zzso In this study, we defined the zzso loop to zzso 48 and 49 of zzso and characterized the zzso and binding of different zzso zzso towards zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of single zzso acids in the zzso loop had a large impact on both zzso efficiency and zzso zzso studies showed that it is mainly the zzso rate that is affected by the zzso acid zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was clearly zzso with an improved effect at a pH similar to that of the outer layers of the zzso Modeling of the zzso complexes showed that the zzso loop of zzso fits very well into the deep zzso charged binding pocket of zzso A decrease in pH zzso zzso of the zzso protein resulting in a positively charged zzso thereby explaining the observed decreased zzso zzso Interestingly, substitution with a positively charged zzso acid at position 48 resulted in a more efficient inhibitor at higher zzso
