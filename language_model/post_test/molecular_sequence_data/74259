Genome analysis of zzso zzso proved that, in this zzso besides zzso DNA, a relatively small zzso DNA element is zzso This element was shown to be a zzso circular zzso DNA of approximately 7 zzso it was designated as zzso The zzso was characterized by molecular and zzso zzso No zzso zzso DNA sequences were detected in other rumen zzso zzso The overall zzso content of the zzso zzso is approximately 56 zzso which is higher than in other zzso plasmids or zzso The zzso module of the zzso zzso consisting of the rep gene and the region of repeats was identified within a zzso zzso The putative rep gene encodes the replication protein belonging to the zzso zzso family of proteins with the highest similarity zzso % within zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein from the green sulfur zzso zzso zzso
