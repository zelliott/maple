Fish species vary in their capacity to zzso the zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids that are crucial to the health of higher zzso The synthesis of zzso involves zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso Previously, a complementary DNA zzso for an zzso now termed zzso had been cloned from Atlantic zzso Here, we report on the cloning of two new zzso zzso a second zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso characterized for the first time in a zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso showed that the salmon zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with low activity towards zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with lower activity towards zzso zzso All three transcripts showed zzso expression in the zzso and liver, followed by the zzso zzso expression showed differential nutritional zzso zzso of zzso and particularly of zzso but not of zzso transcripts were significantly increased in liver of salmon fed vegetable oils zzso compared to fish fed fish oil zzso zzso expression showed a similar zzso zzso comparisons indicate that, in contrast to salmon and zebra fish, zzso fish species lack zzso which is consistent with their negligible ability to zzso zzso and to adapt to zzso dietary zzso compared to predominantly freshwater zzso Thus, the presence of zzso in salmon explains the ability of this species to zzso zzso and may provide a zzso tool to produce enhanced levels of zzso particularly zzso in transgenic zzso
