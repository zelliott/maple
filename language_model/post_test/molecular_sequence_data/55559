The expression of zzso zzso zzso including long zzso nuclear element 1 zzso or zzso and human zzso zzso accompanies zzso transformation and infection with viruses such as zzso The ability to zzso immunity safely against such zzso would facilitate the development of novel vaccines and zzso In this article, we address the safety and zzso of vaccination with these zzso We used zzso analysis and literature precedent to identify potential zzso zzso in humans and establish their zzso in zzso species to guide safety zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso open reading frame 2 induced strong zzso T cell responses without zzso tissue zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso zzso with human zzso open reading frame 2 zzso identity with zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso T cell responses to all zzso and zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso There were no adverse safety or pathological findings related to zzso These studies provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that immune responses can be induced safely against this class of zzso and pave the way for investigation of them as zzso or zzso zzso
