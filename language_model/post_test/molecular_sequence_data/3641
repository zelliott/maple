The three-dimensional structures of zzso repeat zzso proteins from five different families were previously predicted based on the crystal structure of the zzso zzso using an approach that combined zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment of zzso and several rational zzso The structural models have been produced based on very limited sequence zzso which, in general, cannot yield trustworthy zzso Recently, the protein structures from three of these five families have been zzso In this report we estimate the quality of the modeling approach by comparing the models with the zzso determined zzso The comparison suggests that the general architecture, zzso zzso zzso of side zzso and backbone zzso of the zzso structures can be predicted zzso On the other hand, the analysis revealed that, in some cases, it is difficult to predict correctly the twist of the overall zzso zzso Taking into consideration the conclusions from these zzso we identified a new family of bacterial zzso proteins and present its structural zzso The reliability of the zzso protein modeling suggests that it would be zzso to apply similar modeling approaches to other classes of zzso zzso
