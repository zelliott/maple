The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The structural gene consists of an open reading frame zzso of 1775 zzso coding for a protein of Mr zzso A second zzso zzso of zzso zzso which starts 148 zzso downstream of zzso encodes a zzso designated zzso C zzso of Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso whereas zzso releases only zzso from the same zzso Thus zzso is a typical zzso and zzso is an zzso Both zzso bind to zzso cellulose zzso but not to zzso The zzso sequences between zzso 114 and 931 of zzso and zzso were zzso as were zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This zzso sequence is reiterated elsewhere in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso in which the zzso sequence had been deleted, retained zzso activity, but did not exhibit cellulose zzso A hybrid gene in which the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was fused to the zzso coli pho zzso gene zzso mature alkaline zzso directed the synthesis of a fusion protein which exhibited alkaline zzso activity and bound to zzso
