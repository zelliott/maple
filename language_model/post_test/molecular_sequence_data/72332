The zzso resolution crystal structure of zzso green fluorescent protein and comparison of it with the recently determined structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso explains the dual wavelength zzso and zzso properties of the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso are caused by a change in the zzso state of the zzso The equilibrium between these states appears to be governed by a hydrogen bond network that permits zzso transfer between the zzso and neighboring side zzso The zzso neutral form of the zzso zzso absorbs at 395 zzso It is maintained by the zzso of zzso through zzso zzso and hydrogen bonding via a bound water zzso and zzso The zzso form of the zzso absorbing at 475 zzso is present in a minor fraction of the native zzso zzso donates its charge to the zzso by zzso abstraction through a hydrogen bond network, involving zzso and bound zzso Further stabilization of the zzso state of the zzso occurs through a zzso of the side chains of zzso and zzso zzso zzso shifts the ratio of the two zzso zzso by pumping a zzso relay from the neutral zzso excited state to zzso Loss of the zzso hydrogen bond and zzso of neutral zzso explains the slow return to the equilibrium zzso state of the zzso In the zzso structure, zzso hindrance by the extra zzso group zzso a hydrogen bonding network, which prevents zzso of zzso Therefore the zzso is permanently zzso causing only a zzso zzso zzso This new understanding of zzso zzso in green fluorescent protein should enable engineering of environmentally sensitive fluorescent indicators and zzso fluorescent markers of protein diffusion and trafficking in living zzso
