It was recently demonstrated that zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cause zzso sensory zzso type I zzso As a member of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the committed step of zzso zzso The zzso that are zzso to cause zzso sensory zzso type I reside in a highly zzso region of zzso that is predicted to be a zzso domain of zzso on the basis of alignments with other members of the zzso zzso zzso We found that the corresponding zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso zzso These zzso are dominant and decrease zzso zzso activity by 50% when the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso We also show that zzso zzso is an zzso small middle zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso proteins retain their ability to interact with zzso Modeling studies suggest that zzso zzso is likely to have a single active site that lies at the zzso small middle zzso interface and that the zzso in zzso reside near the zzso in zzso that is expected to form the zzso base with the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in this zzso and in a zzso zzso that is also predicted to be important for zzso zzso binding to zzso also zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso sensory zzso type zzso zzso in zzso
