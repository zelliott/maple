In zzso fields, colonization of the stalk by opportunistic zzso usually occurs after the zzso zzso zzso attacks the zzso zzso Plants respond to insect attack by inducing and accumulating a large set of defense zzso Two zzso of a barley zzso protein zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso by an in zzso zzso zzso properties have been described for a number of zzso zzso We report that a zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein is located in the zzso zzso and in the zzso space of zzso zzso The induction of zzso transcripts occurs in response to mechanical zzso zzso zzso damage, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of transcripts is late induced and is restricted to the site of the zzso Although the transcripts of zzso genes were strongly increased following insect attack, the protein itself did not show any effect on insect zzso rather, it altered zzso zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso These results suggest that, in the course of evolution, zzso genes were recruited by zzso due to their zzso zzso We zzso that zzso is able to induce zzso gene expression in response to zzso zzso feeding as a concerted plant response to the anticipated invasion by the zzso that typically penetrate the plant stalk after insect zzso
