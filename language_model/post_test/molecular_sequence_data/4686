The DNA sequence of zzso zzso corresponding to zzso map units of mouse zzso type 1 zzso was determined, completing the sequence of the zzso strain of zzso The length of the complete zzso zzso is zzso zzso consistent with previous experimental zzso The zzso map unit region encodes early region zzso proteins necessary for zzso replication as well as late region zzso and zzso structural and packaging zzso zzso comparison in this region with human zzso indicates broad similarities, including zzso preservation of all recognized open reading frames zzso with highest zzso acid identity occurring in the DNA zzso and zzso III zzso base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso in the region where VA zzso are found in the human zzso between zzso and zzso nor is it zzso anywhere in the entire zzso zzso The zzso zzso III lacks the zzso acid zzso motif which is involved in an association with zzso zzso Only one zzso sequence is found in an identified coding region in the entire zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso this zzso sequence is found in the zzso of the zzso fiber zzso
