The zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso occurs at zzso site rather than zzso site which is known as the preferential zzso The molecular structure of this zzso is observed as the distorted zzso by the CD zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso structures in solution evaluated by molecular dynamics calculations with zzso zzso distance restraints have the distorted form of the minor groove structure at zzso zzso These zzso offer the recognition mechanism model of the DNA base sequence by zzso
