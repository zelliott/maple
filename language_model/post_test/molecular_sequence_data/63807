We developed an algorithm, zzso that systematically maps zzso DNA regulatory motifs or motif combinations to sets of zzso zzso zzso whether the motifs are enriched in zzso zzso zzso predicted by our zzso algorithm, in the zzso sequences surrounding the zzso zzso analysis allows unbiased zzso of functional zzso to regulatory motifs and candidate zzso We used human zzso differentiation as a model system to statistically assess greater than 25,000 pairings of gene sets and motifs or motif zzso We assigned functional zzso to candidate regulatory motifs predicted previously and identified gene sets that are likely to be zzso via shared regulatory zzso zzso allows moving beyond the identification of putative regulatory motifs in zzso zzso toward understanding their biological zzso This approach is general and can be applied readily to any cell type, gene expression pattern or zzso of zzso
