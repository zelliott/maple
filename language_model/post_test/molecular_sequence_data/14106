In zzso the specific zzso characteristics of each segment are determined by the zzso genes that regulate the expression of downstream target zzso We used a zzso zzso procedure to isolate activated target genes of the zzso gene zzso zzso In addition, we constructed a set of zzso zzso that measures the regulatory contribution of individual zzso genes to a complex target gene expression zzso Using these zzso we demonstrate that zzso genes can regulate target gene expression at the start of zzso suggesting a previously unknown role for the zzso genes at this early zzso We also show that, in abdominal zzso the levels of expression for two target genes increase in response to high levels of zzso demonstrating that the normal zzso of zzso in these segments is zzso Finally, the DNA sequence of zzso for one of these genes predicts a protein that is similar to a human zzso involved in acute zzso zzso These results illustrate potentially general rules about the zzso control of target gene expression and suggest that zzso zzso can be used to isolate interesting zzso target zzso
