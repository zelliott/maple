zzso protein R zzso of human zzso virus type 1 is produced late in the virus life cycle and is assembled into the zzso through binding to the zzso zzso It is known to play a significant role early in the viral life cycle by zzso the nuclear import of the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso is also able to interact with zzso zzso and we show here that it zzso zzso of zzso zzso We have explored the possibility of using these properties in DNA zzso zzso We report that the zzso half of the protein zzso mediates DNA zzso in a variety of human and nonhuman cell lines with efficiencies comparable to those of the best-known zzso zzso Compared with zzso a standard zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso more zzso zzso complexes were able to reach the cell nucleus through a zzso zzso These observations possibly identify an alternate zzso for DNA zzso
