zzso was identified as a putative zzso zzso in the zzso database of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Its role in zzso stress was investigated by zzso analysis of zzso isolated from cultures that had been stressed with various zzso zzso Its specific involvement was confirmed by a considerable increase in the zzso transcript following induction with zzso The zzso end of the transcript was mapped by primer extension analysis and the promoter region was zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, the zzso zzso was zzso and the predicted molecular mass was zzso Using zzso as an electron zzso this zzso acts as a catalyst in zzso reduction and protects zzso DNA from zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso expression was induced as a cellular adaptation in response to the addition of zzso zzso The results obtained indicate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso system in zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that the only zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso is involved in the zzso Lastly, the presence of this zzso in the sequence confirms that zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso so far zzso
