A zzso G tract in zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was suspected of being responsible for the zzso zzso expression of zzso The region encompassing the zzso G tract was amplified using DNA from zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso grown under zzso conditions and under zzso conditions in the presence of bovine zzso zzso analysis of the amplification products revealed that regardless of the growth conditions, the zzso G tract in strain zzso contained eight zzso a situation that maintains the correct reading frame of the zzso Similarly, the zzso G tract in strain zzso contained eight zzso when the organisms were grown under zzso conditions in the presence of bovine zzso but when grown under zzso conditions, the zzso G tract contained nine zzso resulting in a frame shift and the introduction of a premature stop zzso It is concluded that the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso is due to a form of phase zzso
