The zzso zzso alcohol zzso gene zzso is under the control of two separate promoters zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso at the zzso and adult life zzso zzso A zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso isolated from a natural population contains a zzso zzso zzso element inserted 240 zzso upstream from the zzso (adult) zzso zzso start zzso zzso of zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso are reduced in zzso and at life stages where zzso is actively expressed and are affected in zzso by zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso genes have no effect on zzso expression in zzso zzso
