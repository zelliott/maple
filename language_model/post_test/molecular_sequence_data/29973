zzso structures at the zzso zzso and adjacent zzso region have been zzso by zzso in zzso cells at zzso level zzso The patterns of zzso protection and hypersensitivity in these zzso cells that allow initiation of zzso and DNA synthesis are quite different from those observed in isolated zzso that are zzso Whereas simple DNA protection by factors is found in zzso the pattern in zzso cells includes very strong zzso hypersensitive zzso Their arrangement suggests that the region exists as a higher order zzso complex in zzso which is disturbed during the preparation of zzso The pattern is also found to be disturbed in zzso cells when zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Since zzso origin binding sites and the zzso region have been shown previously to interact zzso the existence of a higher order structure involving both components provides a likely physical basis for the functional interaction of separate control zzso
