zzso play a vital role in the survival of insects and are used for chemical communication between members of the same species by their zzso zzso The selection and transportation of these zzso zzso by carrier proteins through the zzso zzso zzso in the antennae toward their membrane receptors remains the initial step for the signal zzso zzso A moderately abundant zzso zzso zzso protein present in zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is approximately 38% identical to a family of insect zzso zzso The backbone structure and dynamics of the zzso protein have been characterized using three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso relaxation and zzso exchange zzso The secondary structure, derived from characteristic patterns of zzso zzso between backbone zzso secondary chemical shifts, and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso constants, consists of a predominantly zzso zzso from zzso 1 to 10 and six zzso connected by four zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso The up-and-down arrangement of zzso is stabilized by two zzso bonds and zzso interactions between zzso zzso The backbone dynamics were characterized by the overall correlation time, order zzso and effective correlation times for internal zzso Overall, a good correlation between secondary structure and backbone dynamics was zzso The zzso relaxation parameters zzso and zzso and zzso zzso values of the six zzso could zzso fit the zzso zzso In agreement with their generalized order parameters zzso zzso zzso in zzso regions exhibited restricted motions on a zzso time zzso The stability of this highly zzso protein was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso
