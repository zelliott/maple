The current model of zzso repertoire development in sheep focuses on the zzso of a small number zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso It is believed that this limited zzso repertoire is then further diversified through zzso zzso zzso This process has been reported to introduce as many as 110 zzso zzso In contrast, our data have that indicated zzso zzso may diversify the zzso repertoire to a much lesser zzso We have identified 64 new zzso gene segments within the rearranged zzso zzso As a result, many of the unique zzso patterns thought to be the product of zzso zzso are actually zzso within the zzso We suggest that zzso zzso makes a much larger contribution, and zzso zzso makes a much smaller contribution to the generation of diversity within the sheep zzso repertoire than is currently zzso
