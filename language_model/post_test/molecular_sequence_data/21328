zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso between zzso zzso stages 6 and zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor that is essential for zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso analysis of zzso zzso we identified zzso genes zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso system, the expression of 79 genes was changed when zzso function was restored in the zzso zzso following induction by zzso zzso genes were analyzed using zzso zzso and three were identified as direct targets of zzso The genes zzso a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and an A1 zzso zzso zzso All three genes are expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed that zzso binds to all three target zzso with the preferential binding site containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that when zzso expression was silenced using small interfering zzso premature zzso and zzso programmed cell death occurred, resembling the zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso targeting signal and may zzso an zzso zzso in zzso The timing of zzso programmed cell death is critical for zzso development, and the zzso system may regulate that zzso
