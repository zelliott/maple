A zzso zzso DNA segment of the zzso zzso zzso containing 12 clustered zzso genes has been mapped and partially zzso The cluster maps at zzso 5-6 on the left arm of the third zzso in agreement with the previously determined location of a putative cluster encompassing the genes for the third zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso This cluster is the largest zzso gene cluster discovered to date and shows a number of surprising features that explain in part the genetic complexity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso are multiple copy genes and the presence of extensive similarity in their coding regions gives the first evidence for gene conversion in zzso zzso In addition, five genes in the cluster are zzso Four of these five have arisen by zzso The other genes in the cluster have a single zzso located at an unusual location for insect zzso zzso
