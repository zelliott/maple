Using insulin as a model protein for binding of zzso to zzso various mass zzso approaches and techniques were zzso Several different platinum zzso were observed, zzso addition of one or two zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis and fragmentation of the intact zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso the major binding site was assigned to zzso on the insulin B zzso In order to simplify the interpretation of the mass spectrum, the zzso bridges were zzso This led to the additional identification of zzso on the A chain as a binding site along with zzso on the B zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso followed by reduction led to the formation of five peptides with zzso zzso Identification of several of the binding sites was obtained using zzso laser zzso zzso and liquid zzso Upon comparing the zzso and bottom-up approaches, the suitability of the bottom-up approach for determining binding sites was questioned, as the release and possible zzso of zzso were demonstrated upon zzso zzso The associated advantages and disadvantages of zzso and zzso were also pointed zzso
