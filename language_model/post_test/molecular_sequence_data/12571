zzso of human zzso virus zzso DNA into the human zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso and therefore the IN protein is a suitable target for zzso zzso To find a potent zzso IN zzso we screened a zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso with the sequence zzso that zzso zzso zzso and integration with an zzso of 2 zzso The zzso is active on IN proteins from other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso virus, and zzso zzso leukemia virus, supporting the notion that a zzso region of IN is zzso The zzso was also tested in the disintegration zzso This zzso reaction can be carried out by the zzso core of IN alone, and the zzso zzso was found to inhibit this reaction, suggesting that the zzso acts at or near the zzso site of zzso Identification of an IN zzso inhibitor provides proof of concept for the approach, and, moreover, this zzso may be useful for zzso analysis of zzso
