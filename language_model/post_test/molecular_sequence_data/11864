The interaction of zzso zzso with human zzso zzso was investigated using truncated SK peptides prepared by gene cloning zzso zzso and zzso could activate zzso as efficiently as the authentic zzso zzso which had been zzso with zzso could also activate zzso zzso zzso and zzso at a concentration of one-tenth of zzso all failed to activate zzso However, the truncated SK peptides in complexes with zzso zzso could form zzso active virgin zzso that slowly converted to human zzso zzso after a lag period of 15 zzso zzso could not activate zzso No virgin zzso was detected when zzso was incubated with zzso zzso but the zzso in the complex was modified to zzso after reaction for 20 zzso zzso and zzso had no ability to transform zzso to virgin zzso or to zzso in zzso complex with zzso although they could bind to zzso The functions of five regions in the SK zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in interaction with zzso are zzso Region a is important in stabilizing the zzso of the SK zzso and region b is essential for zzso zzso Region c is required for induction of the zzso changes of zzso to virgin zzso zzso c and d are required for the conversion of zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of regions zzso zzso and e of SK is essential for a virgin zzso formation, and coordination of regions zzso zzso d and e is required for an effective zzso zzso zzso
