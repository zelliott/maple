Using the cloned zzso zzso zzso gene as zzso probe, a zzso designated zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and found to zzso a 200 zzso acid long protein most closely related to the zzso branch of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is zzso The zzso produced zzso gene product is shown to bind zzso A region of the zzso protein corresponding to but different from the zzso zzso of zzso proteins is also different from that of zzso proteins of different species but identical to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene product, a protein known to be required for zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso gene under control of the zzso zzso promoter is able to suppress the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a functional similarity of these zzso proteins from the two very zzso related zzso
