We zzso human and mouse full-length zzso of a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was designated zzso (the previously reported zzso was named zzso Both the human and the mouse zzso proteins deduced from their open reading frame sequences are composed of zzso zzso acids of approximately zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso between the human zzso and zzso between the mouse zzso and zzso and between the human zzso and the mouse zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using probe specific to human zzso or zzso showed that major transcripts were approximately zzso zzso in both the human zzso zzso The analysis also revealed different tissue distribution between zzso and zzso zzso was more highly expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso than zzso zzso was expressed throughout the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, but zzso expression was zzso The locus was mapped to human zzso zzso and mouse zzso 11, where a zzso between the two species has been zzso zzso can provide insights into understanding the roles of the zzso zzso in various zzso particularly with the development of zzso toxicity and diabetes zzso
