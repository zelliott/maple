We amplified and zzso the rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso zzso unit in zzso and used it as a zzso marker for the molecular monitoring of the patients during and after therapeutic zzso The method described is zzso rather than zzso more sensitive and less time-consuming than other conventional techniques for the detection of minimal residual zzso We propose zzso and quick procedures, from DNA extraction to Southern zzso that can be easily performed in any clinical laboratory and also applied to other kinds of zzso
