zzso zzso is a zzso on the zzso portion of mouse zzso zzso 1 that affects zzso in mouse and is zzso expressed by appearance of an open neural tube along the entire zzso axis of the zzso zzso zzso a member of the basic zzso family of zzso factors, is expressed in the developing neural tube in structures affected by the zzso zzso and has been regionally assigned to the zzso part of mouse zzso zzso Using a large panel of zzso animals from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso segregating zzso zzso we have determined that zzso maps very close to zzso with no zzso detected in 500 zzso animals zzso both map within a zzso segment defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso clones from wild type zzso and zzso zzso failed to identify sequence zzso associated with the zzso zzso Southern zzso of zzso DNA from zzso and zzso zzso failed to identify specific zzso at or near the zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso and zzso evaluation of zzso zzso expression indicated that both the levels and types of zzso zzso produced in zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These studies suggest that zzso and zzso are not zzso Nevertheless, zzso is the zzso 1 marker most tightly linked to zzso identified to date and can, therefore, be used as an excellent entry probe to clone the zzso zzso
