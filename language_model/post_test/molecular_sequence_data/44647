DNA sequence analysis of the gene zzso zzso 6 of the zzso complex zzso in human zzso was performed in 25 independent patients who suffer from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In 10 cases the well-known zzso zzso at zzso position zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, silent zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in individual zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were found in patients who present a typical clinical picture and course of zzso but lack any of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which replaces a moderately zzso zzso by a zzso zzso was observed in a single male patient and subsequently excluded in 175 independent zzso The zzso at zzso which replaces an zzso highly zzso zzso with a zzso was found in a zzso family with four affected members, the eldest carrying a zzso mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso None of 170 analyzed control subjects carried this zzso These findings provide evidence that several zzso zzso gene zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
