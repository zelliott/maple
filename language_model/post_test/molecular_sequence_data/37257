The first step in the zzso zzso degradation zzso in zzso zzso has been believed for more than a decade to be conversion of zzso to zzso We show here that zzso is actually converted to zzso which is subsequently reduced to zzso by zzso a protein that had previously been suggested to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso is immediately downstream of zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced in the presence of zzso A zzso strain lacking functional zzso has an impaired ability to remove zzso from the zzso In contrast, the zzso strain removes zzso from the medium at the same rate as does the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso a step necessary for degradation of zzso but not for degradation of zzso Based upon the known mechanisms of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso of zzso should produce zzso while zzso of zzso should produce zzso Thus, we proposed and verified zzso that zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso reduction of zzso to zzso
