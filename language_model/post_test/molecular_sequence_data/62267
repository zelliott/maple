In this work, the relationship between stability and propensity to zzso was zzso for a series of zzso zzso of the zzso integral membrane protein zzso zzso It was observed that there was a strong correlation between stability and folding zzso The most common zzso that promoted zzso were those which also zzso the zzso These results imply that by targeting unstable membrane proteins for degradation, cellular protein folding quality control can eliminate proteins that have a high intrinsic propensity to zzso into zzso zzso Moreover, the more rare class of zzso acid zzso that promote zzso without zzso stability may be particularly dangerous because the zzso proteins may evade the surveillance of cellular quality control zzso
