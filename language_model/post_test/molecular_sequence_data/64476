One of the major challenges in zzso research is the identification of the complete set of genes in a zzso zzso of expressed sequences zzso and zzso with zzso sequences have been used to characterize zzso However, the number of alignments far exceeds the likely number of genes in a zzso suggesting that, for many zzso two or more alignments can be joined through overlapping sequences to yield accurate gene zzso zzso zzso sequencing becomes less efficient in closing those alignment gaps due to its zzso zzso We sought to bridge these alignments through a novel approach: targeted zzso zzso Human expressed sequences from zzso version 124 were aligned with the zzso sequence from zzso build 24 using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and assembly software zzso Nine hundred zzso pairs of alignments were selected based on zzso clone information and/or their zzso to the same known zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing yielded sequences for zzso of those zzso These sequences helped characterize over 60 novel or otherwise incomplete genes in the recent zzso build zzso which included over 1 million additional zzso These results indicate that this integrated and targeted strategy, combining zzso prediction and experimental zzso sequencing, can efficiently generate the overlapping sequences and enable the full characterization of zzso Additional information about the zzso pairs, the zzso overlapping zzso tissue sources, and tissue profiles are available in a supplemental zzso
