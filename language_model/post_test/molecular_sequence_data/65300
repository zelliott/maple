A zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from wastewater collected from a textile dye works in Korea and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and zzso degrees C in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso It contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso A zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell within the radiation of the cluster zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso % to the type strains of recognized zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso and the type strains of its four zzso most closely related species, together with differential zzso properties, revealed that strain zzso could be distinguished from all recognized species of the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and genetic data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
