We have generated a set of zzso zzso in zzso protein 1 box B zzso the second domain of the zzso nuclear protein from the zzso in order to explore the influence of specific surface side chains on its function and zzso zzso zzso and zzso unfolding studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the folding zzso zzso to zzso junction and zzso DNA has been zzso to determine which zzso play an important role in DNA zzso We have identified several zzso that are more stable or bind more tightly to the junction than the zzso including the particular zzso side chain that is thought to zzso into the zzso Thus the interaction between zzso and zzso DNA zzso should exhibit differences from present models based on the structure of the complexes that have been solved to zzso
