First, the general structure and function of nuclear receptors zzso are described briefly to help our understanding of the mechanism of action of vitamin D zzso by the vitamin D zzso zzso a member of the zzso Then we discuss the zzso relationship zzso of vitamin D on the basis of zzso structures and the interaction of the zzso with the zzso The zzso of vitamin D side chain zzso is discussed extensively in terms of our active space group concept, which was derived from zzso analyses of the side chains of vitamin D zzso and from studies with zzso restricted zzso zzso The mobile area of the side chain of vitamin D can be grouped into five regions zzso G, zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso has been analyzed in terms of these spatial zzso The zzso of zzso interaction is discussed on the basis of the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso of various vitamin D zzso into the zzso binding pocket zzso of the zzso and functional analysis of zzso acids lining the zzso Finally, we discuss total zzso combining the results of the two approaches, and future aspects of zzso design of vitamin D zzso
