Although the formation of an zzso or partial unfolding of proteins has been suggested to be important for zzso zzso to form in zzso the exact mechanism involved remains zzso To obtain further insight into the development of zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso of intact zzso Although zzso formed an zzso at high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 10 zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso the zzso content was not high, indicating a low preference to do zzso The partly zzso zzso was converted with time into a highly ordered zzso with a zzso zzso as revealed by atomic force zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a concentration dependence with a maximum at approximately 20 and approximately zzso zzso respectively, slightly below the zzso at which these alcohols form dynamic zzso Focusing on the similarity of the effects of alcohol on proteins with those of sodium zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso on zzso zzso also induced zzso to form with a maximum at approximately 4 zzso slightly below the critical zzso zzso These results indicate that, with an increase in the concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso a delicate balance of decreasing zzso interactions and increasing polar interactions zzso zzso in and between peptides leads to the formation of ordered zzso with a zzso concentration zzso
