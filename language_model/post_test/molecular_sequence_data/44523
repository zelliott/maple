zzso zzso is a zzso bundle zzso sharing several biological properties with zzso By reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, human cancer cell lines of different zzso are shown to express two zzso amplification zzso a zzso band corresponding to the zzso zzso found in zzso and another of zzso zzso corresponding to an alternatively spliced zzso including a zzso alternative zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso of tumor cell lines expressing either one or both of the zzso zzso as evaluated by a zzso or by zzso indicating that zzso is not zzso However, zzso could be detected zzso in some tumor cells by zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso by the two zzso zzso differ in the signal zzso zzso we have analyzed the characteristics of these signal peptides and their possible role in controlling zzso The two zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, induced very low levels of zzso zzso However, substitution of the sequence zzso natural signal zzso with the one from zzso zzso chain in the zzso zzso results in a significantly higher zzso of biologically active zzso zzso upon zzso zzso A poor efficiency of natural signal peptides may represent one of the mechanisms involved in the control of zzso zzso
