A zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso which produced short chains of zzso spores on the tips of long zzso and formed zzso colonies with zzso zzso zzso was studied in detail to determine its zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso was grouped into the zzso zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data supported allocation of the strain to the zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso with minor amounts of zzso zzso and zzso the fatty acid profile contained major amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso profile contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso data, zzso and zzso properties and zzso zzso differentiated this strain from its closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso In addition, zzso zzso results showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso of zzso zzso
