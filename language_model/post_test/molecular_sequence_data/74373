zzso zzso is unique among zzso species in that it has two distinct types of sex zzso in two separate forms zzso and zzso Treatment with sex steroids can reverse its gender from female to male or male to zzso This phenomenon makes it a novel model for studying zzso zzso The zzso role of sex steroids in sex differentiation in zzso is yet zzso zzso To address this issue, we cloned the zzso of zzso types 8 zzso and 12 zzso zzso type 1 zzso and the zzso acute regulatory protein known as zzso in the zzso zzso Then, we measured the zzso levels of these genes during sex differentiation by real-time zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also measured by real-time zzso As a result, we detected transcripts of all such genes except for that of zzso in the indifferent zzso before the onset of sex zzso The expression of zzso occurred in indifferent zzso in both zzso and its transcript levels were much higher in the male zzso By contrast, the levels for zzso were much higher in the female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed no sexually zzso expression during zzso sex zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso has a major influence on zzso development and that zzso plays a similar role in zzso zzso However, the factors that zzso their expression remain to be zzso
