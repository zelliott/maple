We have cloned the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative gap junction proteins zzso to zzso zzso which constitute a new family of zzso proteins called zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso are highly zzso in zzso zzso insects and zzso pointing to their important zzso Both zzso and zzso are predicted to have four zzso regions, two zzso zzso one zzso loop and zzso N and C zzso Both the human and mouse zzso contain three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are closely zzso with zzso more zzso The human and mouse zzso zzso are zzso although zzso expressed in normal zzso Human zzso is a zzso zzso its mouse zzso zzso is also expressed in certain cell types in developing zzso In zzso evaluation of zzso expression predicts gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso The apparent conservation of zzso between species merits further zzso
