zzso molecules are essential for a wide range of biological and zzso functions, including zzso zzso cell interactions with the zzso zzso cell migration, proliferation and zzso zzso in cell zzso have been associated with pathological conditions such as zzso and neurodegenerative zzso We have identified a new zzso zzso of the zzso family, zzso The same protein was recently published under the name zzso and was suggested to be associated with zzso zzso Here we have expressed and zzso the zzso domain of this zzso in two zzso expression systems, zzso and zzso zzso A three step zzso protocol gave an over zzso pure zzso The zzso domain of zzso possesses several potential zzso and zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso modifications of zzso proteins and of the zzso zzso of membrane bound zzso It can influence both the activity and the stability of the zzso The zzso pattern has been shown to depend on the cell type where the protein is zzso We examined if differences in the zzso of this protein could be detected when it was expressed in the two commonly used zzso expression systems, zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso were zzso
