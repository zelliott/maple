The zzso mechanism for the regulation of zzso activity by zzso zzso and the role of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso was investigated by analyzing the kinetic properties of the zzso protein and two zzso zzso isolated from a zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein lacked the zzso zzso domain and retained high zzso activity along with both positive and negative regulation by zzso zzso The zzso zzso deletion removed in addition the region containing three consecutive zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited a significantly lower specific activity compared to CT or zzso zzso when expressed in either insect or zzso zzso however, zzso zzso activity was zzso to either stimulation or zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso accelerated CT activity by decreasing the zzso for zzso from zzso zzso in their absence to zzso zzso in their zzso The zzso for zzso was not affected by zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso was comparable to the activity of zzso CT in the absence of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso were comparable to those exhibited by the zzso zzso indicating that removal of zzso 231 through zzso did not have any additional influence on the zzso regulation of the zzso Thus, the region between zzso zzso and 312 was required to zzso zzso regulation on CT, and the association of zzso lipids with this region of the protein zzso zzso by increasing the affinity of the zzso for zzso
