zzso and zzso clones have been isolated for a new gene zzso expressed in mature zzso of zzso zzso represents a zzso or zzso gene containing 4 zzso 2 zzso start sites, and coding for a predicted protein of 340 zzso acids with no signal zzso and a coiled zzso structure of 39 zzso acids near the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is 38% identical to that of an early zzso gene zzso also from zzso
