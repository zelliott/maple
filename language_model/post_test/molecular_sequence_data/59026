The introduction of zzso sense and zzso gene zzso for zzso A zzso into tobacco plants caused the reduction of the zzso activity in the transgenic zzso In the transgenic plants, the cell walls of the zzso tissue in stems were brown and the molecular structure of zzso in the colored cell walls was dramatically different from that in the control zzso Analysis with different types of stain revealed that levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso units in zzso were depressed in the zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso content in colored tissue was lower than that in the normal zzso Our results indicate that zzso has important roles in the determination of the composition and the amount of zzso in tobacco zzso
