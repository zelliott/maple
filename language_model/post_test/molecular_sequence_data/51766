The primary structure of a novel zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso channel, designated zzso 4, has been revealed by cloning and sequencing the zzso The zzso 4 zzso shares high zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso 1, zzso 2 and zzso 3 zzso of the mouse zzso zzso channel, thus zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from cloned zzso of the zzso 4 zzso together with the zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso yields functional zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso 1 zzso channel exhibits high apparent affinities for zzso and low sensitivities to competitive zzso The zzso 4 zzso is thus distinct in functional properties from the zzso 1, zzso 2 and zzso 3 zzso and contributes further diversity of the zzso zzso zzso
