zzso zzso zzso contains an essential gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso Here, we isolated an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso that showed sensitivities to high temperature and to zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained an zzso nonsense zzso in its zzso zzso domain, yet in spite of the zzso a full-length protein was produced, suggesting a zzso termination zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene suppressed the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed hypersensitivity to zzso an zzso zzso suggesting a defective zzso zzso The zzso treated with zzso caused dramatic zzso changes and showed defects in cell wall integrity, as well as displayed synthetic growth zzso with the zzso zzso of genes involved in zzso and cell wall zzso The zzso exhibited different zzso from those of the disruption zzso of zzso zzso zzso and it showed normal zzso zzso as well as showed normal zzso zzso of small zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso reflect the integrated effects of the reduced availability of zzso and various zzso of the zzso zzso
