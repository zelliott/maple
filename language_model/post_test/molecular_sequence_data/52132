An approach utilizing the zzso chain reaction zzso was devised to clone members of a family of zzso zzso the alpha zzso of G proteins in the zzso zzso was extracted from the whole zzso of the mouse and from the organ of zzso or the lateral wall of the zzso zzso from the guinea pig zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso which was selectively amplified by zzso using zzso zzso corresponding to two zzso regions of the G protein coding zzso zzso products were cloned into a zzso for zzso The following seven zzso clones of particular interest were zzso three clones zzso coding for part of the zzso of a zzso G protein zzso one clone zzso coding for part of the zzso of an zzso G protein zzso and three clones zzso coding for part of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in the zzso of putative G proteins with zzso partly zzso by these zzso clones are briefly discussed and future studies are zzso
