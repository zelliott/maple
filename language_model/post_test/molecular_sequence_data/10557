zzso repression of the mouse vascular smooth muscle zzso gene in zzso and zzso is zzso in part, by the interaction of two zzso DNA binding activities with opposite strands of an essential zzso zzso zzso recognition element zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso One of these activities, previously designated vascular zzso zzso zzso factor 2 includes two distinct zzso zzso and zzso which specifically interact with the zzso strand of both the zzso and a related element in a protein coding zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso Sun, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of a mouse lung zzso library with a vascular zzso zzso zzso factor 2 recognition element has now resulted in the isolation of two distinct zzso clones that zzso zzso and zzso One of these proteins is identical to zzso a zzso protein previously implicated in both zzso zzso and DNA zzso The other is a related family member, presumably zzso Comparative band shift and zzso zzso analyses conducted with cellular zzso zzso and cloned zzso proteins zzso in zzso and in zzso establish identity of zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso This study implicates zzso and/or zzso in the control of vascular smooth muscle zzso gene zzso
