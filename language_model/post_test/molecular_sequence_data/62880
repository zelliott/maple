DNA sequence data from three nuclear zzso were collected from zzso zzso representing zzso globally distributed populations of the plant zzso fungus zzso zzso Gene zzso were constructed for the zzso and zzso zzso as well as for the previously characterized zzso locus zzso The zzso and zzso zzso showed greater potential for zzso studies than the zzso zzso Greater sequence diversity was found in the zzso zzso populations zzso East and Europe) than in the zzso zzso populations (North and South America and zzso The gene trees were rooted using zzso DNA sequences of zzso zzso the closest known relative to zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Based on the rooted trees, a tentative zzso history of these populations was zzso The Middle East appears to be the most likely center of origin, while European populations are more ancient than New World zzso A test for neutrality indicated that the zzso in the zzso locus could be under selection, while the other two sequence zzso were zzso
