zzso is a member of the zzso protein family that plays an indispensable role in zzso zzso particularly during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been reported, however, its function in bovine zzso tissue remains zzso This study aimed to reveal the functions of zzso and to determine whether zzso is a candidate gene in the regulation of zzso in zzso and to illustrate whether its zzso is regulated by alternative zzso and DNA zzso 

Here we report the molecular zzso alternative zzso pattern, expression and promoter zzso status of zzso The full-length coding region of zzso was zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso protein containing nine consensus regions of the DEAD box protein zzso zzso is expressed only in the zzso and zzso of adult zzso Two zzso zzso were identified and termed zzso zzso zzso and 703 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In male zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso are exclusively expressed in the zzso in the ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed significantly reduced zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso hybrids, with zzso arrest compared with cattle and zzso with normal zzso zzso The promoter zzso level of zzso in the zzso of zzso hybrids was significantly greater than in cattle and zzso zzso 

In the present study, zzso was isolated and zzso These data suggest that zzso functions in bovine zzso and that zzso of the gene in zzso were regulated by alternative zzso and promoter zzso
