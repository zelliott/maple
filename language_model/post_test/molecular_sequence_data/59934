Upon air zzso a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of carp zzso spontaneously formed the zzso pairing observed in the native zzso zzso characterization using zzso showed the presence of a defined secondary structure within this zzso The chemical shifts for most of the zzso zzso of the zzso and the protein are very similar, and the observed zzso contacts of the zzso strongly resemble those in the zzso A structure calculation of the zzso using zzso distance constraints indicates that the zzso zzso adopts the same zzso as formed within the native zzso The zzso zzso zzso of carp zzso is the first example of an independently folded stack of two zzso reinforced by two zzso zzso zzso Two key areas of the structure show a zzso of zzso zzso that may account for its exceptional zzso zzso
