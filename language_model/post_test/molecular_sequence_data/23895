To zzso the distribution and molecular features of zzso elements in a large collection of different zzso zzso clinical zzso with zzso zzso zzso To further characterize a zzso zzso 

Gene detection was carried out by zzso using zzso designed from established sequences or from sequences in this zzso From a zzso element zzso 60 zzso an 11 zzso zzso region including the zzso and zzso genes was zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was contained in a regular zzso zzso zzso zzso which was inserted into one of two previously described zzso zzso zzso 52 zzso or a zzso zzso zzso element, both flanked by the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso all of which carried the zzso zzso the zzso gene was part of a variable zzso zzso inserted into unique elements which contained the zzso gene approximately zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene and were not flanked by the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso of these zzso zzso only zzso zzso and a modified zzso in addition to zzso were detected by zzso in all zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were always zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in variable zzso In an zzso element, sequencing identified four new open reading frames downstream of the zzso zzso followed by three short sequences with zzso to sequences of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso gene is carried on different zzso genetic elements depending on whether the zzso are susceptible or resistant to zzso
