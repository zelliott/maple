zzso tuberculosis represents a severe threat to human health zzso zzso it is important to expand our knowledge of vital zzso zzso such as that zzso by fatty acid zzso type 2 zzso as well as to uncover novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which relies on a set of essential zzso including zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso tuberculosis zzso encodes four additional zzso zzso designated zzso whose functions have zzso not been characterized in zzso Of the four candidates, zzso was recently shown to be essential for the survival of zzso zzso zzso The present work was initiated by assessing the suitability of zzso zzso zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso activity to act as a surrogate system for expressing zzso directed to the zzso zzso zzso cells producing this targeted zzso zzso were essentially wild type for all of the chronicled zzso zzso including respiratory growth on zzso zzso zzso assembly and zzso acid zzso This indicated that within the framework of de zzso fatty acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso was able to act on shorter zzso zzso zzso than was previously proposed zzso during zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed as zzso proteins in the zzso strain, and zzso was found to complement the zzso zzso and contain high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso is also an essential, zzso functional zzso zzso albeit the latter's involvement in zzso zzso remains to be zzso
