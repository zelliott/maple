Bone zzso proteins zzso play critical roles in cellular zzso zzso and programmed cell death in multiple zzso An increasing body of recent evidence has suggested that classes of molecules collectively termed zzso zzso play important roles for the local regulation of zzso actions by binding zzso and zzso their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously reported as a gene of unknown function, zzso expressed in zzso zzso of the rat zzso Here, we show that zzso is abundantly expressed in the kidney and functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso binds directly to zzso and zzso the zzso induction of alkaline zzso in zzso zzso zzso also zzso formation of secondary axis and/or zzso when its zzso is injected to zzso zzso In the early stage of mouse zzso zzso is expressed in the first and second zzso arches and in zzso while in later stages the expression is confined to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the expression is further restricted to zzso zzso of zzso in a pattern similar to the zzso of zzso which has been shown to be important in the development of kidney and preservation of adult zzso functions under pathological zzso zzso we suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso that interacts with zzso in the developing and adult zzso
