A convenient zzso procedure for the synthesis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been developed from zzso zzso as starting material through three steps: synthesis of zzso zzso with zzso chemical reduction of the zzso group, and zzso with zzso The zzso zzso were then successfully zzso through the zzso with zzso acid to afford zzso zzso with an zzso group and zzso group as the zzso between the zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso were shown to be useful for zzso and zzso of the zzso interactions by an optical zzso based on surface zzso zzso
