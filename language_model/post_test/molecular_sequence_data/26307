Evidence is presented to support the notion that the 16 zzso zzso zzso called zzso is an essential zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso It is zzso with the other zzso of zzso in preparations either using zzso or zzso zzso It is zzso by zzso together with the other zzso zzso It is zzso not related to zzso zzso of higher molecular weight nor to some zzso zzso with similar apparent molecular weight between 16 and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IV of the zzso complex, the zzso zzso peripheral zzso of the oxygen evolving complex of zzso II, and the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and the zzso binding protein is determined by zzso degradation and zzso The two sequences are different and not identical to other characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso inhibit zzso of zzso to zzso treated zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso treated zzso and zzso zzso Thus the additional zzso zzso qualifies for a functional zzso of the zzso zzso
