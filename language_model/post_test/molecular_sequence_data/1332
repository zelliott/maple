An open reading frame, zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso The protein was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in solution, displays an apparent molecular mass of 76 zzso and a zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso Unlike previously studied bacterial zzso which are zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be a zzso in zzso The optimum temperature of the zzso is 65 degrees C and the optimum pH is zzso with a broad peak between pH zzso and zzso showing zzso of maximum zzso The zzso cannot be zzso by zzso or zzso acid treatment, nor it can be activated by a series of zzso metal zzso suggesting that it is a zzso as opposed to the initial prediction that it would be a zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso follows a sequential mechanism with zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 37 degrees zzso On the basis of the characterization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, plant zzso may represent a new, distinct class of zzso
