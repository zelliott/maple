Six new zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso in the course of a retrospective study of the role of zzso matching in the outcome of unrelated donor bone zzso zzso zzso confirmed that five of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent novel combinations of previously described sequence motifs in the variable regions of zzso the sixth zzso appears to result from a novel point zzso These data support previous observations which suggest that multiple mechanisms, including zzso exchange and zzso appear to be responsible for generating sequence diversity at the zzso zzso The extremely low zzso rate of zzso between the two laboratories which typed the samples, and the ability to predict the new sequences from probe zzso patterns, indicate that zzso is an accurate and efficient method for studying zzso at zzso
