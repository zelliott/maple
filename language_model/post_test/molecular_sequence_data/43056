A zzso chain zzso by the zzso 1-3 of the human zzso zzso coli zzso tumor zzso gene was expressed as a zzso binding fusion protein zzso in zzso coli to be used for zzso zzso It turned out, that the zzso fusion product of 60 zzso was deposited in bacterial inclusion bodies and, in addition, it was not retarded by an zzso affinity column, most probably due to an altered zzso of the zzso zzso For this reason, we established an alternative zzso zzso which took advantage of zzso followed by a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso method allowed us to obtain high yields of pure human zzso zzso zzso zzso The final yield of the pure zzso zzso chains was estimated to represent zzso of the amount of zzso zzso coli zzso subjected to the first cycle of zzso The zzso zzso molecules were successfully used for the development of specific zzso The zzso procedure described here represents a general zzso method which is valuable in cases where fusion proteins are deposited as inclusion bodies in bacteria, or if affinity zzso is precluded due to a zzso lack of zzso binding of the zzso zzso
