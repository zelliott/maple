zzso a mobile zzso in the nuclear zzso gene of zzso zzso was previously reported to contain two independent zzso zzso zzso We have found that both zzso zzso renamed zzso and zzso are group I zzso but with differing zzso zzso carries out the several reactions associated with zzso zzso carries out a zzso reaction at an internal processing site zzso These conclusions are based on the zzso properties of zzso transcribed in zzso zzso of the zzso pairing segment of zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso at the zzso Much of the zzso stem and all of the associated loop could be deleted without effect on zzso These results are accounted for by a secondary structure model, in which a long zzso pairing segment brings the zzso zzso site to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the smallest natural group I zzso yet reported and is the first example of a group I zzso whose zzso biological function is zzso We zzso that zzso zzso of the excised zzso zzso functions in the generation and expression of the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso
