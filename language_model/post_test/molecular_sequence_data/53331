The zzso structure zzso of zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso zzso was previously shown to be efficiently charged by zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso has a zzso structure at its zzso but mimics a zzso L-shaped fold, including an zzso loop containing the major identity zzso for zzso and a zzso zzso acid accepting zzso Here we describe an in zzso selection experiment aimed zzso to verify the zzso of the zzso identity set, zzso to zzso the impact of the zzso on zzso and zzso to investigate whether functional communication exists between the two zzso zzso and zzso acid accepting zzso zzso zzso were selected from a pool of 2 zzso zzso zzso molecules derived from the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop zzso and in the length zzso zzso and sequence of the zzso loop zzso After nine rounds of selection by zzso 42 have been zzso Among them, 17 zzso could be efficiently charged by zzso zzso Their sequence revealed strong conservation of the second and the third zzso zzso positions zzso zzso and the very zzso loop zzso zzso A large zzso of the other zzso of the loop was observed and no zzso sequence was zzso The selected molecules presented zzso zzso with loop zzso varying in size from 3-6 zzso and some sequence zzso but did neither reveal the zzso zzso All selected zzso are zzso times more efficiently zzso than the zzso zzso suggesting that the natural viral sequence has emerged from a combination of evolutionary pressures among which zzso was not zzso This is in line with the role of the zzso in viral zzso
