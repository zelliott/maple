An unusual zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso 29 is a structural component of the viral zzso and is required for the zzso packaging of zzso Here we report a model of secondary structure for this zzso zzso developed from a zzso analysis of the primary sequences of zzso zzso of related zzso zzso zzso related to zzso 29 were found to produce zzso zzso These zzso were analyzed by their ability to replace zzso 29 zzso in in zzso zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso with a probe complementary to zzso 29 zzso and by partial and complete sequence zzso These analyses revealed four quite different sequences ranging in length from 161 to 174 zzso The secondary structure deduced from these zzso in agreement with earlier zzso indicated that zzso zzso is organized into two zzso The larger zzso zzso I) is composed of zzso zzso and contains four zzso Three of these zzso appear to be organized into a central stem that is interrupted by two zzso zzso and the fourth zzso and zzso The smaller zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso and consists of two zzso zzso I and II are separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs readily in this zzso joining region, and this zzso allows the subsequent separation of the two zzso zzso The separated zzso I is fully active in DNA packaging in zzso The functional significance and biological role of zzso II are zzso The zzso secondary structure model provides a basis for further analysis of the role of this zzso in zzso zzso
