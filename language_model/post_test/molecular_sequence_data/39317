The Cape zzso Region is exceptionally zzso both for its area and latitude, and this diversity is highly zzso distributed among zzso The modern zzso is hypothesized to result largely from recent zzso zzso and it has long been speculated that particular zzso lineages zzso this burst of zzso Here, we employ molecular zzso data in combination with fossil zzso to estimate the minimum duration of Cape occupation by 14 unrelated putative zzso Estimates vary widely between lineages zzso zzso zzso and when compared with the estimated timing of onset of the modern zzso radiation, it is clear that many, but possibly not all, of these lineages zzso its zzso zzso comparisons of zzso with lineage age show that low species diversity of many of the putative zzso results from a lower rate of diversification than in dated Cape zzso In other putative zzso however, we cannot reject the possibility that they diversify at the same underlying rate as the zzso but have been present in the Cape for insufficient time to accumulate higher zzso Although the extremes in diversity of currently dated Cape lineages fall outside expectations under a constant underlying diversification rate, sampling of all Cape lineages would be required to reject this zzso zzso
