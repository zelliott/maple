zzso is a key harmful component of tobacco and zzso and the development of zzso cigarettes is of increasing importance in the zzso The objectives of this study are to isolate native zzso strains and evaluate their feasibility for nicotine reduction during the aging (or zzso of tobacco zzso A novel zzso strain was isolated and identified as zzso zzso zzso based on its zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso In submerged cultures, zzso zzso zzso could tolerate zzso zzso nicotine and completely degrade zzso zzso nicotine within 24 h at zzso and pH zzso The addition of zzso (1 zzso could improve nicotine degradation by zzso zzso zzso in submerged zzso After submerged zzso the cell suspension of zzso zzso zzso could be zzso to improve nicotine reduction in tobacco leaves during solid-state zzso The nicotine content of tobacco leaves decreased by as much as zzso after 7 days of solid-state zzso by zzso zzso zzso suggesting the industrial application potential of the native strain to enhance nicotine degradation during the aging of tobacco zzso
