The avian packaging cell line zzso produces particles which zzso cellular zzso Such zzso can be reverse transcribed by zzso zzso and integrated into the zzso of newly infected cells zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is not packaged because the packaging zzso region of the zzso is zzso The zzso also lacks the zzso primer binding site, which prevents efficient reverse zzso of randomly packaged zzso zzso Previous work from our laboratory suggested that the zzso zzso which allows packaging of cellular zzso mapped to the zzso but did not map to the zzso region of the gag gene zzso Anderson, zzso Lee, zzso zzso Levine, zzso zzso zzso zzso Shah, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Shank, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found, using zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus, that packaging of cellular zzso does not map to the gag zzso Rather, the propensity of zzso particles to package cellular zzso is a function of the high level of particle production in these cells and not of any specific viral structural zzso
