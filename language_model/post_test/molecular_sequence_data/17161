zzso is a zzso zzso that encodes zzso toxin and zzso zzso into the larger of the two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso lacks an zzso instead, its integration depends on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso During integration, zzso occurs between regions of zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Here, we define the elements on the zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso is a short sequence composed of one binding site for zzso and zzso spanning the site of zzso Together, zzso and zzso bind to two sites within zzso While one zzso binding site in zzso spans the core zzso region, the other site is approximately 80 zzso zzso Although integration occurs at the core zzso binding site in zzso the second site is required for zzso integration, suggesting it performs an architectural role in the integration zzso In zzso zzso reactions showed that zzso and zzso are capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, additional cellular processes such as DNA replication or Holliday junction resolution by a host zzso may contribute to integration in zzso
