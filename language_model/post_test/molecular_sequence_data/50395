zzso western zzso zzso like other zzso cannot be transmitted to host plants by mechanical zzso but requires an zzso zzso a feature that has zzso presented a serious obstacle to the study of such zzso In this paper we describe use of zzso to zzso hosts with beet western zzso virus without recourse to zzso zzso is a procedure for introducing a plant virus into a host via zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso which can efficiently transfer a portion of the zzso zzso to plant cells near a zzso The viral zzso must be inserted into the zzso in such a way that it can escape and begin autonomous zzso a requirement that has, so far, limited zzso to pathogens with a circular zzso We have cloned zzso corresponding to the complete beet western zzso virus zzso zzso between the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso termination zzso In one zzso a zzso zzso sequence was included so as to produce a transcript in zzso with a 3' zzso almost identical to natural viral zzso When zzso mechanically to host plants, the naked zzso DNA was not infectious but, when introduced into zzso and zzso to plants, both the construct with and without the zzso produced an zzso This approach should be zzso to virtually any plant virus with a linear zzso zzso zzso
