Whole copies of the zzso zzso genes from rice zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso fungus zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of the rice zzso were also retrieved from other plant zzso The 106 plant zzso analyzed were divided into 5 zzso A, B, C, D, and zzso The fungus zzso were classified into 3 zzso of which one formed a loose cluster with zzso E of the plant zzso Four domain motifs zzso II, III, zzso were identified in all zzso zzso II and III were split by zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso In plant zzso there were zzso zzso in total and zzso zzso per zzso zzso phase distribution was zzso for phase 0, zzso for phase 1, and zzso for phase 2 in plant zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso there were 37 zzso of phase 0 zzso phase 1 zzso and phase 2 zzso with zzso zzso per zzso The 5 zzso of plant zzso were divided into 3 basic gene structure zzso zzso positions and zzso were zzso among the zzso in the first 2 zzso The third lineage consisted of zzso of zzso zzso which also carried highly zzso zzso at different positions from other zzso zzso positions were not as highly zzso in fungus zzso as in plant zzso The zzso in the current zzso have been present since before the divergence of zzso from zzso The results obtained show that differential losses of zzso created gene diversity, which was followed by zzso and tandem zzso in plant zzso
