zzso zzso has remained the last unidentified zzso zzso zzso in the zzso assembly zzso of zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso cluster of zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for incorporation of zzso into the side chain of the zzso zzso zzso was identified as a new member of the zzso protein zzso which includes a diverse set of zzso catalyzing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso of zzso to the zzso group of zzso in the zzso precursor zzso zzso was not a zzso of zzso indicating that the presence of this zzso acid in the zzso of zzso zzso results from zzso of the zzso of zzso after its addition to the zzso zzso expression of the genes zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso led to production of stem peptides zzso by zzso instead of zzso providing evidence for the in zzso specificity and function of these zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso revealed that substitution of zzso by zzso is tolerated by the zzso activity of the zzso proteins both in the zzso and in the donor zzso The zzso zzso appears as an attractive target for the development of narrow spectrum antibiotics active against zzso zzso zzso
