In a zzso the function of an zzso acid at some position depends on the zzso acids at other zzso Here we demonstrate a functional interference between zzso zzso acids (at positions 50 and zzso of zzso When, in the context of zzso or zzso zzso zzso is paired to zzso or zzso and zzso is paired to zzso the resulting proteins efficiently discriminate among different DNA zzso In contrast, in the presence of the pair zzso both zzso show a reduced capability to discriminate among different DNA zzso zzso selection experiments performed in the context of the zzso zzso suggest that the presence of zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso These results may explain why the pair zzso is never found in natural zzso
