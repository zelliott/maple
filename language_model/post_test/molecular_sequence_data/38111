The zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the total zzso of the tumor cell line zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso can partially zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The majority of the zzso zzso protein in zzso coli was zzso in the inclusion zzso A minor fraction of the soluble zzso protein was concentrated as the source of the protein in the activity zzso zzso zzso displayed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three independent rabbit zzso against an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso fragment, and the full-length zzso zzso protein were prepared and zzso and these zzso recognized the 59 zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with these three zzso showed a consistent nuclear distribution of zzso excluding the zzso This nuclear zzso pattern was abolished if the zzso were incubated with specific zzso zzso whereas the zzso pattern was unaffected if the zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso results, a zzso zzso zzso also showed a nuclear zzso pattern excluding the zzso These results suggest that zzso is indeed a functional zzso of zzso coli zzso and is localized in the zzso of zzso zzso
