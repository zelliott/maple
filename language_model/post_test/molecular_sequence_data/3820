A plant expression cassette system was engineered to efficiently target proteins to the default zzso pathway, allowing the expression of DNA zzso in three frames as fusion proteins containing a synthetic tobacco zzso zzso signal zzso zzso with the advantage of producing the zzso proteins by zzso As one approach to develop a vaccine to zzso zzso coli zzso infection, the oral zzso of zzso zzso the structural zzso A of the zzso zzso expressed at high levels zzso of soluble zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso was demonstrated in zzso mice by the induction and detection of zzso zzso zzso
