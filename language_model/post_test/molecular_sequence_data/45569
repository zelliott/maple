Members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso family of zzso factors regulate zzso of genes involved in the function of many different cellular zzso zzso of zzso proteins is regulated by a complex interplay of zzso events that are still poorly zzso In this work, we take advantage of the high scanning speed of the linear zzso trap to develop a method to make a systematic characterization of zzso zzso The method is based on the simultaneous monitoring of all zzso peptides that can be detected by zzso and contain potential zzso zzso By this approach, we detected six zzso zzso sites by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in only one zzso a further site was also identified by performing zzso in zzso Using this approach, we have also characterized five zzso zzso sites in zzso protein expressed in zzso cell zzso Two of these zzso zzso sites in zzso have not been described zzso The simplicity and sensitivity of this technique, which can be applied to any potential zzso makes it particularly attractive for the systematic detection of zzso modifications of specific target proteins both in zzso and in zzso
