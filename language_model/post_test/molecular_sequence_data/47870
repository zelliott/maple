The zzso protein zzso is important for S phase entry and binds to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the zzso analysis of zzso organization and characterization of a novel gene product related to zzso named zzso The human zzso gene was found to be a highly interrupted gene of at least zzso zzso located on zzso 17 in close proximity to the zzso gene in a zzso zzso The predicted protein contains an zzso and six perfect zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso this protein interacts with zzso and deletion of the zzso zzso this zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso and its expression increased in zzso liver zzso zzso In addition, zzso was localized primarily in the zzso concentrated around the zzso Overall, our data indicate that although zzso shares strong structural zzso with zzso as well as having a similar ability to associate with zzso these proteins likely play distinct roles and target different zzso to the zzso zzso
