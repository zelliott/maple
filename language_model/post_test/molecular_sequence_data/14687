zzso zzso and inverse zzso zzso suitable for zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed to study the behavior of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and for further design of zzso zzso The target peptides were zzso on solid support and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which is known to form a stable complex with zzso zzso with zzso could be achieved under mild conditions and led to zzso with high zzso purity and specific zzso The biological activity of the zzso was evaluated in zzso by an zzso zzso turnover zzso zzso profile and zzso stability of the zzso were investigated by small animal PET in zzso zzso derived zzso presented very high kidney zzso negligible tissue distribution, fast blood zzso and poor stability in zzso zzso the inverse zzso zzso exhibited very high stability in blood, large diffusion in zzso reasonable kidney and liver zzso and slow blood zzso This zzso profile makes the zzso inverse zzso motif zzso suitable for further development of zzso and a promising lead to design zzso zzso against zzso
