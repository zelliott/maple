We investigated the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso system of zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the DNA region upstream of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of an open reading frame zzso of 304 zzso acids zzso a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso By using zzso a zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli from a zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso fusion was zzso higher in zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso as well as the zzso DNA region was zzso Located adjacent to zzso but transcribed in opposite direction, the beginning of an zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of a zzso fusion was also found to be activated by zzso Further, we present evidence for zzso at the zzso and the zzso level between the zzso zzso system and the zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
