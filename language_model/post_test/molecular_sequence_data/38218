We characterized short zzso elements zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Five families of these repeats distinguished by the presence of distinct zzso zzso shared zzso promoter and the central core zzso The putative active elements were reconstructed from the alignment of zzso repeats representing molecular fossils of sequences that amplified in the past and since then underwent multiple zzso Their mode of proliferation by zzso was indicated by the presence of: zzso internal zzso zzso zzso zzso simple sequence repeated zzso zzso direct zzso and zzso zzso recording the evolution of zzso The copy number of zzso in zzso zzso was estimated at about zzso they were highly divergent and apparently ceased to amplify before radiation of these zzso On the other hand, among almost half a million fossil elements present in zzso and zzso the youngest zzso could still be zzso zzso zzso terminate in sequence repeats of a few zzso similar to their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These three LINE elements fall into zzso distinct from that of zzso elements which, similar to their zzso zzso end in a zzso zzso We propose a model in which new zzso with distinct zzso are created at the zzso level due to template switching between LINE and zzso during reverse zzso The proposed mechanism suggests that such an adaptation to the changing amplification machinery facilitated the survival and prosperity of zzso over long evolutionary periods in different zzso
