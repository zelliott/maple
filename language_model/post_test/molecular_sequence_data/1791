zzso zzso growth factor zzso is initially zzso as a type I zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso of zzso yields zzso and zzso fragments zzso and zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso is zzso from the plasma membrane into the nucleus, where it interacts with the zzso zzso zzso Here we characterize the zzso acid zzso of the zzso domain of zzso on cell surface distribution and the interaction of zzso with zzso The zzso domain contains three characteristic clusters with charged zzso zzso Generation of various zzso of zzso showed that the arrangement of the charged zzso acids in the zzso domain regulates the distribution of zzso at the plasma membrane but does not regulate zzso processing and zzso of zzso Further, the charged zzso acids are also required for zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso domain of zzso is a zzso zzso
