zzso zzso syndromes zzso are frequently caused by zzso of the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene leading to a reduced expression of the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Two recent observations have linked two different zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter to a clinical zzso zzso zzso are regulatory sequence elements of zzso promoters that zzso zzso expression of several zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on a novel point zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso promoter in a German zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso levels in the patient's muscle indicated significantly impaired zzso zzso We provide additional evidence of a zzso role for this zzso using the zzso promoter zzso driving a zzso gene zzso in rat skeletal zzso We show that zzso gene expression is significantly reduced by the zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct sequencing revealed maternal inheritance of the zzso zzso promoter zzso together with paternal inheritance of a zzso zzso zzso zzso encompassing the promoter and the first two zzso of the zzso gene in the index zzso In conclusion, we provide genetic and functional evidence that a zzso of the zzso zzso promoter zzso causes zzso due to the reduction of gene expression in skeletal zzso Moreover, this is the first report of a zzso zzso affecting an zzso zzso This type of zzso may be missed in standard screening techniques of zzso zzso
