The complement protein zzso zzso by two genes zzso and zzso on zzso zzso is the most zzso among the zzso III gene zzso We investigated the molecular basis of C4 zzso in a Finnish woman with systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso was present at low zzso in zzso zzso patient zzso but no zzso protein was zzso This zzso in C4 expression was specific in that synthesis of two other complement proteins was zzso Analysis of zzso DNA showed that the zzso had both deleted and zzso C4 zzso Each of her zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene inherited from the mother, a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso gene inherited from the father, all contained an identical zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso in zzso 29, providing the first zzso proof of the zzso zzso This zzso has been previously found only in zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso junction is spliced accurately, this zzso zzso generates a premature stop at zzso 3 in zzso zzso These truncated zzso and zzso gene products were confirmed through zzso and sequence zzso Among the possible genetic mechanisms that produce identical zzso is both zzso the most likely is a zzso in zzso followed by a gene conversion to generate the zzso zzso zzso
