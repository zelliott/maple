The zzso coli zzso zzso gene is carried by zzso The terminal repeats of zzso are composed of zzso zzso however, neither repeat is a complete zzso In order to determine how this seemingly defective zzso could zzso zzso were generated within zzso to determine the regions essential for zzso The left terminal repeat region was found to be zzso but the right terminal repeat area was demonstrated to be crucial for zzso Within the right terminal repeat area is an open reading frame zzso capable of zzso a 159 zzso acid zzso which was shown by zzso zzso analysis to be required for zzso This protein may be the zzso of zzso A pair of 11 zzso repeat sequences zzso the zzso was also pair of 11 zzso repeat sequences zzso the zzso was also found to be zzso The right 11 zzso repeat is part of the left zzso terminal zzso and the left 11 zzso repeat is located about 300 zzso upstream from the right zzso terminal sequence located within the right terminal repeat zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso is a functional zzso and that the sequence including this pair of 11 zzso sequences plus the intervening sequence is a zzso element which may be responsible for zzso zzso
