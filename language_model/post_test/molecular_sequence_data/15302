zzso zzso proteins mediate linkage of zzso zzso to plasma membrane in many zzso zzso activity is regulated in part by zzso at a zzso zzso but the identity of zzso zzso is unknown in zzso and incompletely defined in other zzso zzso Our studies show that zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Mass zzso analysis indicates zzso is abundant at the zzso plasma membrane and zzso studies show zzso enrichment at the plasma membrane near zzso In zzso zzso specificity analyses characterize zzso as a zzso zzso whose optimal zzso sequence resembles the zzso site, including unusual preference for zzso at zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso and protein was comparable to reported zzso zzso ROCK and zzso but unlike them zzso displayed preferential specificity for zzso compared to traditional zzso zzso zzso Two genetic approaches demonstrate a role for zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso knockout mice have zzso reduction in zzso zzso The findings on zzso and specificity argue that zzso is a direct zzso zzso The knockout mice have normal zzso cell development but notably zzso migration and polarization in response to zzso are zzso These functional zzso fit the current understanding of the role of zzso zzso in regulating cortical zzso Thus, these studies identify a new zzso zzso of importance in zzso and confirm the role of zzso zzso in regulating cell shape and zzso
