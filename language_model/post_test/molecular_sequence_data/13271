We characterized 12 zzso of zzso zzso with various levels of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso patterns, zzso zzso zzso DNA restriction patterns by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns, zzso protein zzso profiles, and DNA restriction zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso and zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso were related on the basis of zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso but they had two slightly different zzso zzso one unique to strains for which the zzso of zzso is high zzso zzso and one unique to strains for which the zzso of zzso is low zzso to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso fingerprints were identical for the seven zzso however, the zzso fingerprints were zzso An eighth zzso zzso isolate with high-level resistance to zzso was not related to the other seven zzso by typing data but was a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Spanish zzso The zzso profiles and fingerprints of zzso zzso and zzso were identical to those of the Spanish clone zzso An additional zzso zzso isolate with high-level resistance to zzso had unique typing profiles and was unrelated to the zzso zzso zzso zzso but was related on the basis of genetic typing methods to a second zzso zzso isolate that was zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had different zzso profiles and fingerprints for zzso but the fingerprints for zzso and zzso were the zzso
