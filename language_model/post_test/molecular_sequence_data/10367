Several new zzso locus zzso have been discovered in South American zzso By contrast, analysis of the zzso class I zzso of North American native populations has revealed few new zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso locus is evolving rapidly in South American zzso Here we describe the zzso locus zzso present in individuals from a Central American tribe, the zzso of zzso Using a zzso typing technique that separates zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso followed by direct sequencing, we determined the zzso zzso from eight zzso Two of the zzso zzso present in the zzso have been previously described in other South American zzso zzso one zzso has been characterized in a zzso We characterized two new zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso differed from zzso by only a single zzso substitution in zzso zzso This substitution resulted in an zzso acid replacement of zzso by zzso at zzso 156 in the alpha 2 zzso Such a change may affect the repertoire of peptides that are bound by this zzso zzso differed significantly from other zzso zzso in that it is the result of an unusually large zzso zzso event of minimally 216 zzso This zzso results in an zzso that is part zzso and part zzso Thus, more dramatic zzso events may also play a role in the rapid evolution of the zzso locus in zzso
