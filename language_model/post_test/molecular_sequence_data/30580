Two zzso proteins zzso and zzso were deduced from the zzso sequence analyses of the zzso clones derived from a bovine zzso zzso term zzso These proteins resembled bovine zzso but were different from the reported bovine zzso zzso or zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of these clones showed zzso identity with bovine zzso and zzso with bovine growth zzso The two new clones show 62 and zzso overall zzso with each other at the levels of zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso proteins isolated from zzso zzso and rat share 7 common zzso acid zzso Five of the 7 zzso are zzso by other members of the family such as growth hormones, suggesting that they may be essential for the common structural features of the gene zzso The other 2 zzso are uniquely zzso in zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicting their indispensable roles in binding to the specific zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso are shown to be expressed stage specifically and predominantly in zzso bovine zzso
