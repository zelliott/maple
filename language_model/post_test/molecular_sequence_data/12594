Each G zzso zzso recognizes only a distinct subset of the many structurally closely related G proteins expressed within a zzso How this selectively is achieved at a molecular level is not well zzso particularly since no specific zzso contact sites between a zzso and its zzso G zzso have been zzso In this study, we demonstrate that a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso can specifically recognize the zzso 5 zzso of alpha zzso of the zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso involved in this interaction are predicted to be located on one side of an zzso zzso region present at the junction between the third zzso loop and the sixth zzso zzso zzso studies with hybrid zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso showed that the zzso contact site identified in this study is essential for zzso specificity and zzso zzso
