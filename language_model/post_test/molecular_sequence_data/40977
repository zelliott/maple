zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso that are well known to be involved in the zzso zzso reaction of fruits and vegetables with different zzso zzso Both zzso have some common zzso but each also has its specific zzso In our zzso study, the zzso acid sequence of grape zzso zzso was used for the construction of models employing zzso modeling method based on the X-ray structure of zzso zzso zzso from pea zzso zzso whereas the model of grape zzso zzso was obtained directly from the available X-ray structure zzso zzso zzso zzso of common zzso of these two zzso was subsequently zzso It was found that zzso and zzso exhibited high affinity with both zzso even though zzso and zzso have different binding pockets regarding the size and the key zzso acids involved in zzso zzso binding modes of zzso with both zzso were also zzso The calculated zzso interaction energy of zzso acid related compounds shows high zzso suggesting specificity and potential use as common inhibitor to grape zzso zzso and zzso zzso
