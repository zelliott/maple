The bipolar zzso forms without zzso naturally in female zzso and by experimental manipulation in zzso zzso is a recently discovered protein complex required for zzso zzso generation within the zzso in zzso zzso cultured zzso Five zzso of zzso have been identified so far, but neither their organization within the complex nor their role in developing organisms is zzso In this study, we report a new zzso zzso wee zzso component zzso zzso directly interacts with another zzso zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso depletion in cultured cells, especially without functional zzso causes severe defects in zzso zzso We found that a zzso deletion zzso is viable but female sterile and shows only a mild impact on zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso showed robust zzso assembly of the zzso zzso but frequent zzso zzso For the first time, this study establishes the role of an zzso zzso in developing organisms and provides an insight into the architecture of the zzso
