zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso in all organisms that zzso zzso This zzso is specified as a zzso zzso by an zzso secondary structure, which is located immediately 3' of the zzso in the reading frame of zzso genes in zzso bacteria, whereas it is located in the 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso zzso The location and the structure of a similar zzso signal in zzso has so far not been zzso Seven zzso were identified for the zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso and by zzso zzso Their size could be correlated with open reading frames possessing internal zzso zzso from the total zzso zzso One of the open reading zzso that of the zzso zzso of a zzso possesses two zzso zzso and appears to code for a zzso with two zzso zzso A strongly zzso zzso element was identified that is exclusively linked to zzso zzso It is located in the 3' untranslated region in six of the zzso and in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso This element, which is present in the 3' zzso region of two zzso zzso from zzso zzso is proposed to act in decoding of the zzso with zzso
