We describe a complex imprinted locus in zzso zzso that encodes two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein with a zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso zzso the former being closely related to a protein from zzso major virus, the zzso zzso zzso These motifs allow prediction of zzso function as a zzso The zzso zzso gene is expressed zzso but the entire coding sequence and zzso zzso island zzso a second zzso zzso that is transcribed from the zzso strand with a different transcript size and pattern of zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso is expressed only from the paternal zzso zzso with this expression pattern, in the brain the zzso zzso zzso island is completely zzso on the paternal zzso but zzso on the maternal zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso and fetal zzso demonstrates a zzso zzso imprint with zzso paternal germ zzso Recent findings indicate that zzso is part of the zzso regulated imprinted domain affected in zzso syndrome patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are novel imprinted genes that may be associated with some of the clinical features of the zzso zzso zzso
