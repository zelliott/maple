zzso acid zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso code for the key zzso zzso involved in the zzso of long chain zzso fatty acids in zzso zzso shares close sequence zzso to zzso and zzso but the function of its gene product remains zzso Alternative transcripts zzso generated by alternative zzso zzso are increasingly recognized as an important mechanism enabling a single gene to code for multiple gene zzso We report the first AT of a zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso Aided by zzso Finder, we identified putative coding regions of eight AT for zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition we identified a zzso zzso length transcript zzso that has a termination zzso within zzso zzso The expression of each AT was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso and in differentiated and zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso AT are expressed in 12 zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso increases and decreases in expression changes in response to human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in primates and under zzso control in human cells, are a putative zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso
