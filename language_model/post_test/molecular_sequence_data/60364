The zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso which is required for male zzso To identify zzso elements in zzso we have cloned and characterized two zzso zzso zzso one by zzso from the closely related zzso species zzso zzso zzso and the other, starting with a zzso identified expressed sequence tag, from the zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall sequence identities of the predicted gene products with zzso are only 57% for zzso which is considerably lower than has been found for most zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso However, zzso zzso are found throughout both zzso and like zzso both have putative zzso signal zzso zzso produces a larger zzso transcript zzso and a smaller transcript of unknown function zzso both are present essentially only in zzso By contrast, zzso appears to produce only one transcript, corresponding to zzso it is enriched in males but present also in zzso zzso of zzso transcribed from zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso animals to develop into partially fertile zzso zzso a zzso construct as a zzso under control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso heavy chain promoter caused strong zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Introduction of a similar zzso construct into zzso zzso caused only very weak, if any, zzso We conclude that in spite of considerable divergence the zzso gene is likely to be a functional zzso of zzso while the function of the zzso related zzso gene remains zzso
