The low density zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of a family of structurally related cell surface receptors that mediate the zzso of multiple zzso in zzso zzso Its zzso domain consists of seven zzso zzso repeats, each approximately 40 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso repeats occur in other members of the LDL zzso zzso gene family and in a number of functionally unrelated zzso As a first step toward an understanding of the structure and function of LB repeats, we have expressed the zzso zzso repeat zzso of the human zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and have determined its zzso zzso zzso folding of zzso yielded a single zzso which contained three zzso zzso This zzso reacted with a zzso zzso zzso zzso made to zzso in the native zzso suggesting that zzso was correctly zzso zzso was resistant to zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso consistent with a tightly folded zzso zzso bond connections were established using two separate zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso K yielded an 8 zzso acid zzso with a single zzso bond which connected zzso and zzso In the second approach, zzso bonds were zzso reduced with zzso and the resulting zzso zzso zzso with zzso An analysis of peptides which contained two zzso zzso derived from a single reduced zzso bond, showed that zzso and zzso were zzso and confirmed the presence of a zzso bond between zzso and zzso We zzso that the remaining zzso bond bridges zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
