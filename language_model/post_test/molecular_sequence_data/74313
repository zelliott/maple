zzso and zzso are required for development and disease resistance in zzso In many cases, zzso and zzso regulate the resistance zzso defense signaling zzso zzso is the first identified zzso R protein in wheat and is required for resistance to the leaf rust zzso The zzso signaling pathways require the wheat zzso of zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of the zzso signaling networks remain zzso Here I present the DNA and protein sequences of zzso and zzso and demonstrate for the first time a direct zzso interaction between zzso
