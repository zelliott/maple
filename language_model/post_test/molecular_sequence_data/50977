Under the influence of zzso hormone zzso zzso from zzso cells, zzso maturation is finally triggered by zzso factor zzso which consists of a zzso of the zzso gene product of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two species of zzso B clones were isolated from a zzso library constructed from mature goldfish zzso zzso comparisons revealed that these two clones are highly zzso zzso and were found to be similar to zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso against zzso zzso goldfish zzso B and the zzso sequence of zzso we examined the levels of zzso B and zzso proteins during goldfish zzso maturation induced in zzso by 17 zzso 20 zzso (17 zzso 20 zzso a natural zzso in zzso zzso zzso was found in immature zzso extracts and did not remarkably change during zzso zzso zzso B was not detected in immature zzso extracts and appeared when zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso B that appeared during zzso maturation was zzso with zzso indicating its de zzso zzso Introduction of zzso zzso zzso B into immature zzso extracts induced zzso zzso zzso Although the possibility that immature goldfish zzso contain an zzso zzso B is not completely zzso these results strongly suggest that 17 zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso B, which in turn activates zzso zzso forming active zzso
