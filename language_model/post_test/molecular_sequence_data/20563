In 2007, an outbreak of acute zzso conjunctivitis zzso occurred in zzso In order to identify the zzso of this outbreak, 57 eye zzso zzso were collected from 57 zzso patients, and detected for zzso human zzso 70 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes by using zzso or zzso zzso The results showed that 38 were positive for zzso the positive rate was zzso but none was positive for zzso and zzso showing that this outbreak was caused by zzso 9 viral zzso were obtained from 57 clinical specimens by using viral isolation method, and all were identified as zzso by molecular typing zzso All 9 zzso zzso were performed by zzso sequencing, the results showed that except for strain zzso the zzso at zzso acid level and zzso acid level among other 8 zzso were relatively low, and the zzso were more than zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid between strain zzso and other 8 zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of 9 zzso revealed that they represented the zzso 4 and zzso 5 in Group I, showed that this outbreak was caused by at least 2 viral transmission zzso Comparing to zzso region of zzso frequently used before, zzso region was considered as the most rigorous target for molecular epidemiology study of zzso To enhance the research of zzso and molecular epidemiology of zzso and to know the genetic zzso and molecular evolution of zzso are most important to prevent and control the outbreaks of zzso in zzso
