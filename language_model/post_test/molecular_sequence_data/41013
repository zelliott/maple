In the current study, the putative zzso for zzso toxin of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed as zzso fusion protein in the zzso of zzso zzso The fusion protein was zzso from the bacterial extracts by combination of immobilized zzso affinity and gel zzso zzso Then, it was zzso by zzso and the generated zzso zzso zzso was further zzso by zzso zzso zzso the native toxin zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso function when injected in zzso This result indicates that the production of functional zzso zzso might be an alternative to provide this basic and valuable tool for study, as well as for further understanding such complex zzso system, including its correlation with the central nervous system and local tissue zzso
