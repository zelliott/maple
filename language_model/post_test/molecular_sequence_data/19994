zzso zzso factor zzso highly zzso in all zzso cells, is a low molecular mass of zzso zzso which plays a key role in modulating the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were isolated from cotton zzso zzso fiber zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein with 139 zzso zzso zzso zzso is 819 zzso in length and encodes a protein of 139 zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein with 143 zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and encodes a protein of 141 zzso zzso The molecular evolutionary relationship of these genes was analyzed by means of zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the plant zzso genes are highly zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso is mainly expressed in zzso On the other hand, it seems that zzso and zzso have no tissue zzso zzso levels of different zzso genes may vary considerably in the same cell type, suggesting that they might be involved in regulating tissue development of cotton and the each zzso zzso may diverge to form the functional difference from the other zzso during zzso
