In the three-dimensional structure of a rice class I zzso zzso determined recently, a loop structure zzso zzso is located at the end of the zzso zzso and is thus suggested to be involved in zzso zzso In order to test this zzso deletion of the loop II region from the zzso domain of zzso and replacement of zzso in loop II with Ala were carried zzso The loop II deletion and the zzso zzso increased zzso activity not only towards zzso but also towards zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for zzso values determined for zzso zzso The two zzso shifted the splitting positions in zzso to the reducing end side, but the shift was less intensive in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the reaction time course indicated that sugar zzso affinity at the zzso zzso was reduced from zzso zzso to zzso zzso by loop II zzso zzso affinity at the zzso zzso might enhance the release of product fragments, resulting in higher turnover and higher zzso zzso Thus, we concluded that loop II is involved in sugar zzso binding at the zzso zzso but that zzso itself appears to contribute only partly to sugar zzso interaction at the zzso
