Among various environmental factors, temperature is a major regulator affecting plant growth, development and fruit zzso zzso is the most cultivated fruit plant throughout the world, and grapes are used for wine production and human zzso The molecular mechanisms involved in zzso tolerance to high temperature, especially at the fruit level, are poorly zzso To better characterize the sensitivity of berries to the zzso high temperature conditions were locally applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso by this treatment, were identified and further zzso The expression profile of zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso accumulated upon heat zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso coli showed that it encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso expression zzso showed that the heat stress factor zzso zzso the promoter of zzso in a heat zzso zzso Taken together, our results highlight the intrinsic capacity of grape berries to perceive heat stress and to initiate zzso responses, suggesting that zzso may play a signaling role in these zzso
