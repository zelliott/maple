The water zzso of zzso was successfully decreased by zzso with increasing amounts of zzso in the reaction zzso The initial zzso ratios of zzso zzso acid zzso in the reaction zzso were 0, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso were thus referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrees ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the effective zzso degrees, determined by zzso of the zzso zzso consumed during the reaction, were 0, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso the different zzso zzso zzso zzso in 25 zzso of zzso M zzso buffer zzso zzso containing 50 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between 60 and zzso of the zzso zzso bounds were broken in less than 1 zzso Moreover, increasing the zzso degree only resulted in a weak slowing on the zzso degradation zzso
