With the aim of characterizing specific zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso small colony zzso type, the zzso agent of contagious bovine zzso a gene zzso a major zzso protein of 72 zzso named zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The expressed protein was of the same apparent molecular mass as that produced by the parent zzso The predicted molecular mass of zzso based on the zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso zzso significantly lower than the apparent molecular mass of zzso or zzso zzso on zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence revealed a typical zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso attachment site and a zzso structure domain in the leader sequence at the zzso end of the zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso and its surface location was confirmed by zzso treatment of whole zzso An zzso gene zzso a zzso with some similarity to zzso was found on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not on that of zzso zzso The zzso gene was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SC zzso zzso against zzso zzso reacted strongly with zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso bovine group 7 strain zzso but not with other members of the zzso zzso or closely related zzso Cows zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso SC developed a zzso response against zzso within 35 zzso zzso is a specific zzso membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso SC with potential for use in development of diagnostic zzso It seems to belong to a family of zzso of the zzso zzso
