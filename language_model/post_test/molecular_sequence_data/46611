The cell wall is a fundamental component in the response of plants to environmental zzso To directly assess the role of the cell wall we have increased the expression and activity of a cell wall associated zzso zzso an zzso involved in zzso cell wall zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso development, but greatly increased the zzso rate under high salt or zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso showed that transgenic seeds were able to retain more water available for zzso than zzso zzso zzso calculations indicated that this could be due to a lower mean pore size in the walls of transgenic zzso zzso the higher capacity of transgenic seeds in retaining water could result in higher zzso rates in conditions where the availability of water is zzso
