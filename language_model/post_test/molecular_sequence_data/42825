zzso and its zzso zzso B were isolated from the plant zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of rabbit zzso induced by zzso acid and zzso without affecting that by zzso or zzso while zzso zzso had no any zzso zzso zzso B inhibited selectively and zzso zzso zzso and zzso release in rabbit zzso without affecting those induced by zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso B also inhibited the zzso zzso induced by zzso which was reported to be a collagen zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso snake zzso The zzso of zzso inhibited by zzso B could be recovered after washing the zzso zzso B also selectively suppressed the zzso B2 formation caused by zzso but not those by zzso acid and zzso Similarly, the formation of zzso zzso caused by collagen was also suppressed by zzso B, while that of zzso or zzso was not zzso In the presence of zzso zzso B also decreased zzso zzso zzso to zzso It is concluded that zzso B may be an zzso of collagen zzso in zzso zzso
