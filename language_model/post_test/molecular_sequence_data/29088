Two separate zzso zzso from the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified and zzso One of the zzso is a zzso protein and is the first zzso zzso zzso zzso to be zzso The other is a zzso zzso which is also zzso but possesses both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso uses zzso A as one of its zzso and in zzso coli, for example, it has been implicated in the metabolism of zzso However, no growth of zzso zzso was observed using minimal medium with zzso as the sole carbon source, and both zzso and zzso zzso were produced irrespective of whether zzso was included in the growth zzso The data are discussed with respect to the evolutionary relationships between the known zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
