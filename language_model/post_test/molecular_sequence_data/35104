zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from naturally infected zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae in zzso The full zzso sequences of zzso were determined, zzso and compared to those of other zzso The zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso and had an overall G + C content of zzso zzso analysis predicted 158 open reading frames zzso of 150 zzso or greater that showed minimal zzso Two inhibitor of zzso zzso and six zzso repeated zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso The unique zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso that was not previously reported in zzso The gene content and arrangement in zzso had the highest similarity with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and their shared zzso genes were zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained four zzso repeat regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso that accounted for zzso of the zzso The zzso positions of the four zzso zzso regions were zzso among those of zzso and zzso The gene parity plot, percent identity of the gene zzso and a zzso analysis suggested that these three viruses are closely related not only to each other but also to the same virus strains rather than different virus zzso
