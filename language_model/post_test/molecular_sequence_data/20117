Although zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso are known to be responsible for zzso syndrome zzso and zzso hearing loss associated with enlarged zzso aqueduct zzso also known as zzso a large percentage of patients with this zzso lack zzso in the zzso coding region in one or both zzso We have identified and characterized a key zzso regulatory element in the zzso promoter that binds zzso a zzso zzso of zzso In nine patients with zzso or zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso in this regulatory element interferes with zzso binding and completely zzso zzso zzso zzso We have also identified six patients with zzso in zzso that compromise its ability to activate zzso zzso In one family, the EVA zzso zzso in a zzso mode in the affected individual who carries single zzso in both zzso and zzso This finding is consistent with our observation that EVA occurs in the zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso These results support a novel zzso model for the molecular zzso of zzso and zzso EVA that involves zzso and its zzso regulatory zzso
