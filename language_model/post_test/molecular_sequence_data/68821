The degradation of zzso zzso a negative regulator controlling the proliferation of the zzso stem cell, by zzso present in human zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was completely zzso in human plasma with a zzso of 80 zzso leading exclusively to the formation of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was insensitive to classical zzso zzso including zzso but sensitive to zzso zzso The degradation was completely blocked by specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showing that the first step of the zzso was indeed due to zzso In zzso zzso the zzso proceeded at only zzso of the zzso rate, whereas addition of 20 zzso zzso led to the recovery of the initial rate observed with normal zzso zzso of zzso by commercial rabbit lung zzso generated the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso In fact the formation of zzso was observed when zzso was incubated in human plasma in the presence of zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the first limiting step of zzso degradation in human zzso The second step seems to be under the control of a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
