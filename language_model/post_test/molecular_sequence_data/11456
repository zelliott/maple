zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso thereby distinguishing zzso as unique among zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso systems produced a protein capable of zzso zzso however, this zzso did not metabolize zzso in a manner consistent with zzso zzso of zzso zzso parameters resulted in significantly increased zzso activities and further emphasized differences between zzso and the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso coli expression of zzso generated a protein that possessed zzso zzso indistinguishable from those of zzso and provided a system in which the zzso of zzso zzso zzso could be examined via zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expressed in zzso coli revealed that substitution of zzso with Val at position zzso converted zzso into a highly active and specific zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited decreased zzso zzso and 16 zzso activities, in accordance with decreases in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, replacement of zzso with Val or zzso resulted in much greater changes in zzso than zzso zzso Thus, the combination of zzso zzso techniques, zzso zzso and zzso zzso has revealed zzso to be an important zzso zzso in canine liver and has identified several zzso acid zzso that alter zzso metabolism by zzso
