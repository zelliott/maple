zzso zzso virus expressing the zzso virus zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso was used to study the basis of zzso zzso immunity against the closely related zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso mice primed with zzso developed neither circulating zzso nor zzso zzso T cells specific for zzso yet they resisted a normally lethal zzso zzso zzso cells from such mice gave a zzso response to zzso in zzso that was zzso by zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to predicted zzso sites common to the envelope zzso precursor zzso of zzso and that of zzso were used to map the specificity of the zzso response to an zzso located between zzso acids zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Several zzso zzso clones specific for the zzso zzso were isolated and found to produce gamma zzso in response to both the zzso and zzso One of these zzso zzso was selected for further zzso zzso zzso zzso target cells, and when zzso transferred to zzso mice, it was capable of zzso both a zzso delayed hypersensitivity reaction and resistance to lethal zzso zzso These collective findings zzso for the first time, that zzso T cells can play a major role in zzso zzso zzso
