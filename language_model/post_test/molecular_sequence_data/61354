Thus far, only one major form of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified, zzso and extensively zzso This zzso zzso has been hypothesized to be responsible for most of the maintenance as well as the de zzso zzso activities occurring in the zzso cells of zzso We now report the discovery of another abundant species of zzso zzso in various types of human cell lines and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso this zzso zzso results from alternative zzso of the primary transcript from the zzso zzso which incorporates zzso an additional 48 zzso between zzso 4 and zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso sequence is derived from the first, or the most upstream, copy of a set of seven different zzso repeats located in zzso zzso The ratios of expression of this zzso to the expression of the previously known, shorter zzso zzso species, as estimated by zzso reverse zzso analysis, range from two-thirds to zzso This alternative zzso scheme of the zzso transcript seems to be zzso in the higher zzso We suggest that the originally described and the recently discovered forms of zzso zzso be named zzso and zzso zzso The evolutionary and biological implications of this finding are discussed in relation to the cellular functions of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
