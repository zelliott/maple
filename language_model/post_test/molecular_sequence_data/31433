To investigate the regulation of zzso metabolism at the zzso level in zzso zzso we cloned and characterized zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), which zzso the primary zzso involved in zzso zzso We examined their expression profiles in different zzso and during different zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was zzso zzso in length with a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso was zzso zzso long, with an zzso of zzso zzso High expression levels of both genes were observed in the zzso and the zzso muscle, as compared to the zzso zzso or visceral mass, which zzso well with the ability to store zzso The regulation of both genes was correlated with zzso content via zzso and in zzso zzso and was dependent upon the stage of the zzso cycle zzso stage, maturation stage, ripeness zzso Thus, it appears that the expression of zzso and zzso is driven by the zzso cycle of the zzso reflecting the central role played by zzso in energy storage and zzso development in zzso zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso can be used as useful molecular markers for identifying the stages of zzso metabolism and reproduction in zzso zzso
