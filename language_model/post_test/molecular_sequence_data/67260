By using rational design, zzso fragments zzso that mimic zzso zzso were zzso A zzso with zzso zzso capability was grafted into different zzso regions of a fully human zzso zzso zzso presentation of the zzso was zzso by using zzso display and zzso zzso Select zzso and fragments containing two grafted peptides were zzso for their ability to stimulate the zzso zzso in zzso Several candidates demonstrated zzso activity in an in zzso zzso zzso signaling reporter zzso including zzso which was estimated to be zzso to zzso zzso additionally was able to effectively stimulate zzso production in normal zzso These rationally designed zzso zzso may provide a therapeutic intervention for zzso while avoiding the potential generation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, this study demonstrates a method by which short-lived linear peptides with binding activity may be converted to more stable and potent zzso capable of zzso cell surface zzso
