The asexual spore or zzso plays a critical role in the life cycle of many zzso zzso However, the process of zzso zzso remains surprisingly zzso To better understand this process at the molecular level we characterized the zzso zzso zzso gene which is uniquely transcribed in zzso cultures and whose transcript is significantly enriched in mature zzso zzso is a member of a novel family of zzso genes of unknown function with zzso to plant zzso zzso defense zzso We demonstrate by Northern analysis that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso repression is dependent on the presence of protein zzso zzso Western analysis indicates that the zzso protein is absent from zzso but is highly expressed during the first zzso of zzso and is zzso into the zzso zzso of the zzso gene seemingly results in delayed zzso slow growth, abnormal zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, further analysis shows that the zzso zzso is the result of zzso zzso repression of the zzso zzso marker used to disrupt the zzso zzso This is the first time that repression of a zzso marker zzso zzso has been reported in zzso zzso a finding that may well be of significance in the analysis and interpretation of zzso zzso in this zzso
