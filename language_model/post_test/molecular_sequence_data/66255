The changes in bacterial communities associated with the marine sponge zzso zzso on transfer to aquaculture were studied using zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso was maintained alive in zzso and closed zzso aquaculture systems for 2 years and 1 year, zzso The bacterial communities associated with wild and zzso zzso as well as the surrounding water, were assessed using zzso zzso gene clone library analysis and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso richness and diversity were measured using zzso computer software, and clone libraries were compared using zzso zzso analysis revealed that the diversity of the bacterial community of zzso zzso increased when sponges were maintained in aquaculture and that bacterial communities associated with wild and zzso zzso zzso were markedly different than those of the corresponding surrounding zzso zzso libraries of bacterial zzso zzso from sponges confirmed that the bacterial communities changed during zzso These communities were significantly different than those of seawater and aquarium zzso The diversity of bacterial communities associated with zzso zzso increased significantly in zzso Our work shows that it is important to monitor changes in bacterial communities when examining the feasibility of growing sponges in aquaculture systems because these communities may zzso This could have implications for the health of sponges or for the production of zzso compounds by sponges in cases where these compounds are produced by symbiotic bacteria rather than by the sponges zzso
