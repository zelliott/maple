We developed a DNA zzso specialized for detection of known base substitution zzso in zzso DNA causing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso episodes zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso fibers zzso A set of zzso sharing a given zzso sequence with a single base substitution near the middle of the sequence was zzso zzso zzso DNA targets were amplified from sample zzso containing 31 potential zzso and/or zzso zzso by a multiplex zzso zzso zzso parameters for the DNA zzso zzso were accordingly zzso Seven clinically confirmed patients with zzso 5 patients with zzso 1 suspected zzso case and 25 healthy controls were tested using the DNA zzso For discriminating of zzso and zzso point zzso in zzso a diagnostic factor based on the ratio between the zzso signals from the reference and test targets with each probe was zzso The results showed that all the cases with zzso had a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso patients, four cases were found to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso and one case was a zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the healthy controls carried the potential zzso The results of the DNA zzso were completely consistent with those by DNA zzso Thus, the DNA zzso would potentially become a valuable tool in clinical specific screening of the zzso point zzso associated with zzso and/or zzso zzso
