The effects of zzso on the synthesis and zzso of zzso E zzso a zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso were studied with a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso which expresses a zzso zzso in protein zzso Under normal culture conditions the zzso zzso cells cannot add zzso zzso to zzso zzso is the first sugar of zzso zzso zzso attached to the zzso This zzso zzso is rapidly corrected when zzso is added to the culture zzso These cells also require external sources of zzso for the addition of this sugar to zzso and other zzso A bovine zzso zzso expression zzso for human zzso and the human zzso zzso gene were zzso into zzso cells, and zzso cell clones resistant to zzso were selected and used in the present zzso The structure and zzso of zzso in these cells were examined by zzso and one- and two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso The zzso rate, and extent of zzso of zzso were unaffected by zzso zzso In the presence of both zzso and zzso multiple zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells as a result of variation in the extent of zzso zzso zzso was dependent on the addition of zzso as well as zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting that addition of zzso to the nascent zzso chains was required for the addition of zzso zzso
