To establish the significance of cell wall zzso in grain filling of rice zzso zzso zzso we cloned a zzso for a cell wall zzso from developing grains of zzso The zzso designated zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 577 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed typical features of the cell wall zzso including a zzso motif and a zzso zzso site, and shared zzso and zzso identity with zzso cell wall zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in roots, in zzso and zzso and in zzso During the course of grain filling in the zzso zzso transcript is zzso only in the very early stage of their development, zzso d after zzso when the cell wall zzso activity is the highest and the increase in zzso length is zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso revealed that zzso is expressed zzso in the vascular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its surrounding cells, and is expressed zzso in the zzso projection and zzso zzso These results suggest that, during the early stage of zzso development, zzso is important for zzso a carbon source to developing zzso zzso by zzso unloaded zzso in the zzso
