zzso transport of zzso hormones from the cell body to the plasma membrane for zzso zzso is important for zzso function, but how it is achieved is zzso Here we uncover a mechanism in which the zzso tail of zzso zzso E zzso found in zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso to control transport of these zzso to the release site in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tail in live cells significantly reduced the zzso and distance of zzso and zzso zzso movement into the cell zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso tail zzso with zzso which, in turn, recruited zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tail inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso tail interaction with zzso zzso 3 plays an important role in the transport of zzso zzso for zzso zzso
