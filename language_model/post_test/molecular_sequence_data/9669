The interaction of zzso with a short zzso structure zzso requires two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural basis for zzso recognition by these zzso was studied using a genetic system in zzso zzso Within each of the two zzso we identified several zzso that severely impair interaction with the zzso zzso zzso that alter zzso specificity were also isolated, suggesting the identity of specific contacts between zzso zzso zzso acids and zzso within the zzso zzso Our data indicate that both zzso participate in a joint interaction with the zzso and that each domain uses a different surface to contact the zzso The constraints provided by these genetic data and previous zzso studies have enabled us to propose a three-dimensional model of zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso
