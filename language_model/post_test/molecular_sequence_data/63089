zzso zzso is a zzso agent that is primarily activated in the liver by zzso zzso zzso and then transported to the tumor via blood zzso To prevent deleterious secondary effects, zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso consists of expressing zzso in tumor cells before zzso zzso Given the relatively low affinity of zzso for zzso the aim of our work was to modify zzso to increase its zzso efficiency zzso to metabolize zzso into zzso zzso A molecular model of zzso was built, and four zzso in close contact with the zzso were subjected to zzso zzso zzso exhibiting a particularly low zzso to zzso the zzso acids exclusively present in the zzso zzso recognition sequences were zzso in human zzso All zzso zzso zzso 26) were expressed in zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluated using zzso as zzso Five zzso exhibited a zzso to zzso higher zzso efficiency than zzso zzso A double zzso zzso the two most effective zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso zzso dynamic simulations of several zzso were found to be consistent with the observed modifications in zzso zzso Finally, expression of the zzso zzso double zzso contrary to zzso zzso allowed switching of a resistant human head and neck cancer cell line zzso into a sensitive cell line toward zzso Thus, we were able to obtain a new efficient zzso zzso able to metabolize zzso an important step in the zzso strategy for human cancer zzso
