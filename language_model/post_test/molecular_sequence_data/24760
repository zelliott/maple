zzso zzso is the mechanism by which zzso zzso genes are assembled by three basic steps: zzso processing of broken DNA ends, and zzso In this process of zzso the broken DNA molecules excised from different zzso gene zzso are often joined to generate zzso zzso The zzso zzso process contributes to the zzso between zzso zzso genes and zzso leading to the zzso transformation of zzso The alpha and delta chain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus at zzso zzso is also a region where several types of zzso zzso occur in zzso zzso In the process of analyzing zzso alpha zzso in a patient with adult zzso leukemia zzso carrying a zzso at zzso zzso we found novel complex zzso in the zzso zzso On the one hand, the zzso gene is joined to the zzso zzso signal sequence of the zzso zzso and, on the other hand, the zzso gene is joined to the zzso zzso signal sequence through head-to-head zzso These zzso products or hybrid zzso originated through an inversion of about zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso DNA stretch contains a normal zzso zzso These findings are the first direct demonstration that successive zzso with hybrid zzso occur on the same zzso in the human zzso alpha zzso
