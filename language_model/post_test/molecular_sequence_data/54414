zzso channels play an important role in setting the resting membrane potential and modulating membrane zzso A common feature of several zzso channels is that they are regulated by zzso Yet, the mechanism by which cholesterol affects channel function is zzso We recently showed that the cholesterol sensitivity of zzso channels depends on several zzso zzso Here we show that this zzso loop is part of a regulatory site that also includes zzso in the zzso the zzso and the connecting segment between the zzso and the inner zzso zzso Together, these zzso form a zzso belt that surrounds the pore of the channel close to its interface with the zzso domain, and zzso the cholesterol sensitivity of the zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso in this cluster are correlated with zzso located in the most flexible region of the zzso the major zzso gate of zzso zzso that the importance of these zzso extends beyond their effect on the channel's cholesterol zzso We suggest that the zzso of the cholesterol sensitivity belt are critical for channel zzso
