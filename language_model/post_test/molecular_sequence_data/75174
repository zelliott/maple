The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are required for the zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and are under coordinate zzso zzso By deletion analysis and the use of zzso as a promoter probe zzso we located a single promoter region for the zzso zzso upstream of zzso zzso zzso studies, together with reverse zzso zzso demonstrated that this promoter must be activated in the presence of an zzso zzso for effective zzso of the zzso In addition, the zzso initiation site was located 64 base pairs upstream of the zzso initiation zzso and sequences upstream of zzso were required for promoter zzso The zzso promoter was compared with other positively regulated zzso promoters to identify possible consensus zzso
