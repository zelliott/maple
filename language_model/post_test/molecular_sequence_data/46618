A zzso zzso zzso from human serum zzso P component was characterized by taking advantage of two important features of zzso zzso the low sample consumption and the possibility of doing zzso binding zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso were carried out with zzso immobilized on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subsequently was used to characterize zzso and its fragments with respect to zzso zzso We find that an intact zzso zzso makes the zzso part of zzso relatively resistant to zzso zzso This protection is lost upon zzso Also, the zzso of zzso is involved in zzso binding while the zzso part of the zzso has no appreciable binding zzso The zzso presented here make it feasible to perform zzso studies even on the small amounts of zzso that are typically available when working with zzso from natural zzso
