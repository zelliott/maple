We have zzso and characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which is distinctly different from the previously characterized zzso zzso The level of induction of zzso by zzso in the male zzso is nearly zzso as against a marginal induction in the female zzso suggesting that it may be a male zzso zzso zzso shows a close resemblance to zzso zzso (the major zzso zzso with respect to zzso migration zzso molecular mass of 50 zzso and zzso zzso although it exhibits a distinct zzso pH zzso zzso vs zzso for zzso zzso fingerprint pattern, and zzso acid zzso Further, the zzso sequence analysis shows over zzso zzso identity zzso out of zzso between zzso and zzso suggesting that it is a close relative of the zzso zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso experiments show that zzso can metabolize a wide range of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and vitamin zzso exclusively in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as electron zzso zzso is translated as a zzso zzso which is transported into zzso under in zzso conditions and processed into a mature zzso zzso These results provide conclusive evidence for the occurrence of a zzso zzso belonging to the zzso gene family in rat liver zzso
