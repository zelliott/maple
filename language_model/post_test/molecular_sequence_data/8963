zzso binding to zzso zzso can provide a broad range of zzso to existing influenza zzso and may also prevent the propagation of potential pandemic viruses by fighting against emerging zzso Here we propose a zzso framework to study structural binding patterns and detailed molecular mechanisms of viral surface zzso zzso zzso binding with a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso We used rigorous zzso zzso zzso methods to calculate the zzso binding zzso with an zzso underlying zzso simulation time of several zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso We achieved a high accuracy in the validation of our zzso protocol against a series of known binding affinities for this complex system, with zzso errors on zzso We then introduced what to our knowledge are novel zzso into the zzso region to further study the binding zzso We found that the stacking interaction between zzso in zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso is crucial to the zzso zzso A single zzso of either zzso or zzso can cause a binding affinity decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso to an zzso increase in the zzso constant zzso Moreover, for group 1 zzso zzso (which include both the zzso zzso flu and the H5N1 bird zzso the relative binding affinities change only slightly zzso zzso when zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso mutate to conservative zzso acids of similar size, which explains the broad zzso capability of zzso such as zzso and zzso Finally, we found that the zzso network between zzso (in zzso and zzso (in zzso is important for preserving the strong binding of zzso against group 1 zzso whereas the lack of such hydrogen bonds with zzso in most group 2 zzso may be responsible for the escape of zzso zzso These large-scale simulations may provide new insight into the zzso binding mechanism at the atomic level, which could be essential for designing zzso vaccines for zzso
