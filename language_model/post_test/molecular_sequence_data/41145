A zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil sampled in zzso The isolate formed pale to moderate zzso brown colonies and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and exhibited zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The allocation of the isolate to the zzso zzso was supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso with minor amounts of zzso and zzso major amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a polar zzso profile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiated the isolate from its closest zzso The zzso and zzso tests allowed the differentiation of strain zzso from members of the zzso zzso Thus, strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
