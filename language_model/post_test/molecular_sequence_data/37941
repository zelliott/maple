zzso zzso proteins belong to the high mobility group zzso of small zzso nuclear zzso and function as architectural factors to mediate structural changes in zzso The zzso family consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso As zzso have complicated the zzso analysis of zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso II zzso library was screened with an zzso probe to identify and characterize the authentic zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is zzso long and contains four protein coding zzso and two additional zzso zzso part of the zzso untranslated zzso zzso confirms that an alternative zzso site within zzso 3 results in the two protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso extension experiments revealed that at least three zzso start sites exist in the zzso end of the zzso It has been well established that the expression of both zzso and zzso is readily zzso throughout zzso Unlike zzso whose expression is restricted to zzso a Northern zzso analysis showed low-level expression of zzso in adult mouse zzso Similarly, when zzso from newborn animals were zzso zzso expression was readily detected at a level of intensity intermediate between that found in zzso and zzso zzso the gene structure and expression pattern will provide important insights into the zzso function of zzso
