Three natural zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso the major form in human liver, namely zzso zzso and zzso have been expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were functionally expressed in zzso zzso yielding proteins with an zzso maximum at zzso zzso in the zzso difference zzso Some zzso activities and zzso binding properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been zzso no striking difference was found, showing that the two point zzso between their zzso sequences zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are replaced by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso have no significant effect on the functional properties of these two zzso By contrast, zzso zzso which differs from zzso zzso by a zzso deletion zzso replacing zzso was produced as a zzso form, as revealed by an zzso maximum at zzso zzso and was not zzso zzso This suggests that the deletion prevents the correct folding of the zzso The results of this study show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two roughly zzso functionally active zzso of zzso zzso but that zzso zzso is a zzso unstable gene product that could arise from an alternative zzso zzso This could contribute to the large variations reported for zzso zzso a typical zzso zzso activity, in human zzso
