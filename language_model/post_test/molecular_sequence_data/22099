zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso typically have lowered activity on zzso starch relative to their counterparts with zzso Thus, consideration of starch recognition by zzso is a key factor in understanding zzso starch zzso To this end, we have dissected the modular structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein comprises an zzso family 13 zzso module followed in order by two zzso of unknown function, a family 26 zzso zzso and a family 25 zzso zzso Here we present a comprehensive zzso analysis of starch and zzso recognition by zzso and zzso using zzso methods, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results reveal that the two zzso bind zzso particularly those containing zzso zzso with different affinities but have similar abilities to bind zzso zzso zzso these zzso appear to recognize the same binding sites in zzso zzso The enhanced affinity of the tandem zzso for zzso starch is suggested to be the main biological advantage for this zzso to contain two zzso zzso studies of the native and zzso forms of zzso and zzso show a structurally zzso mode of zzso recognition but through zzso zzso zzso of these zzso structures with other zzso zzso structures reveals a generally zzso mode of starch zzso
