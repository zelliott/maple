Genome segments of the zzso disease virus zzso zzso and zzso Venezuela that zzso among other products, zzso protein zzso were amplified using zzso and the products were cloned and zzso The alignment of up to 11 zzso sequences revealed six silent zzso changes a well as six changes that cause zzso acid zzso in zzso protein zzso at positions 45, 83, zzso zzso 170 and zzso The zzso of three zzso sequences consisted of seven silent exchanges and zzso acid changes at positions 85 and zzso on zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of cloned zzso zzso was performed to examine the nature of the sequence zzso As no difference was found among five zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso copied the DNA zzso The sequence zzso observed with both virus zzso is, therefore, consistent with the zzso structure of zzso disease zzso Furthermore, zzso acid changes at a number of sites have been found to be involved in the formation or zzso of zzso zzso The novel aspect of this study is the ability to estimate, by cloning of zzso products, the number of virus zzso possibly varying in zzso that are able to zzso Seven zzso of zzso Venezuela were zzso Some are of particular interest because they exhibit a change at zzso zzso 145 that causes the replacement of zzso possibly essential for virus attachment to cells, by zzso
