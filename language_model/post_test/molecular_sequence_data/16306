zzso regions for protein export were selected from zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of different signals obtained was higher than expected on the basis of known exported proteins in zzso zzso Most of the selected regions showed the characteristics of typical signal zzso including a basic zzso region followed by a zzso core and a potential zzso zzso zzso The zzso regions were functionally interchangeable between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso regions, the nature of the host cells, and the mature parts of the reporter proteins contributed to the amounts of protein zzso
