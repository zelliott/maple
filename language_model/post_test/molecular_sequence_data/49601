zzso was originally isolated as an zzso zzso clone whose product was normally found at focal zzso In this study, we found that zzso accumulated in the nucleus in response to zzso such as zzso Other focal zzso proteins including zzso the most zzso to zzso remained in the zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso and zzso halves of zzso contributed to its nuclear zzso in a positive and negative manner, zzso After the finding that zzso B zzso an inhibitor of nuclear export signal zzso caused zzso to be retained in the nucleus, zzso was demonstrated to harbor zzso in the zzso which was sensitive to zzso thereby regulating the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso consisted of a zzso stretch and two zzso with a limited similarity to zzso zzso In the nucleus, zzso was suggested to participate in the gene expression of zzso Using dominant negative zzso we found that zzso was actually involved in zzso zzso gene expression upon zzso zzso zzso was thus proposed as a focal zzso protein with the novel aspect of shuttling between focal zzso and the nucleus through an zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaling directly to the zzso
