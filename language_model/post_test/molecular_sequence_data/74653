zzso sequencing is a powerful technique for obtaining the reference sequence information of multiple zzso Its use can be dramatically expanded to rapidly identify zzso variations, which can be linked with zzso to obtain biological zzso We explored these potential applications using the emerging next-generation sequencing platform zzso Genome zzso and the zzso model zzso zzso zzso Combining sequencing with experimental zzso we first improved the accuracy of the published sequence of the zzso zzso reference strain zzso then obtained sequences of multiple related laboratory strains and different zzso of each zzso This provides a framework for comparing the divergence between different laboratory strains and between their individual zzso We also demonstrated the power of zzso sequencing by using its results to predict a zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso of a common laboratory strain, which we verified zzso Finally, we examined the molecular nature of spontaneously generated zzso that suppress the growth zzso caused by deletion of the stringent response zzso zzso Using zzso sequencing, we rapidly mapped these zzso zzso to two small zzso of zzso Interestingly, stable zzso strains had zzso in both zzso with each zzso alone partially zzso the zzso growth zzso This supports an intriguing zzso interaction module that is not easily identifiable through traditional zzso zzso We conclude that zzso sequencing can drastically accelerate the identification of zzso zzso and complex genetic zzso and it can be applied as a standard tool to investigate the genetic traits of model zzso
