zzso zzso diseases may be induced by zzso of the target tissue by zzso T cells with specificity for self zzso As disease progresses, T cells of other zzso appear in the zzso Traffic of zzso zzso T cells to target zzso has not been zzso although many studies have shown zzso of activated or memory T zzso We have used a novel experimental system to track zzso T cells to the central nervous system zzso in zzso transgenic mice with zzso transferred experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were equivalent in number to zzso zzso basic protein zzso T cells at disease zzso Furthermore, zzso T cells retained a zzso zzso and did not transcribe zzso zzso in contrast to zzso T zzso These findings demonstrate that the T cell pool in the zzso of animals with zzso disease contains potential recruits from the time of disease zzso and that T cells require more than an inflammatory milieu for their induction to the zzso zzso
