zzso DNA persists in infected cells as a nuclear zzso causing zzso zzso in many zzso including zzso The viral protein zzso is required for both replication and zzso to facilitate this zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso at two zzso zzso zzso of one of these sites zzso zzso zzso replication of the zzso Using mass zzso and zzso sequencing, we have mapped additional zzso sites in zzso peptides to positions which lie primarily in the zzso zzso hinge region of zzso zzso of the major sites zzso transformation in the absence of viral zzso and only has a minor effect on transformation when the zzso are zzso zzso of the major zzso sites combined with one additional change at a newly discovered site zzso zzso blocks zzso Transformation can be restored by mutating this zzso to zzso acid, mimicking a zzso zzso acid, suggesting that zzso is key to the zzso Transformation by the zzso zzso can also be rescued by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrating a loss of function by the zzso protein and not a toxic zzso In transient zzso zzso site zzso of zzso protein were normal for all viral functions tested, including zzso zzso zzso and repression (by the overlapping zzso zzso protein zzso and surprisingly, viral zzso zzso promoter zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso to high levels, stable replication was zzso suggesting that a function of zzso required for zzso retention is regulated by zzso
