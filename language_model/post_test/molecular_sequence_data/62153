zzso signal zzso pathways play a major role in the response of bacteria to external zzso These pathways are initiated by large collection of zzso zzso zzso containing a sensor domain that perceives the environmental signal followed by an zzso domain that triggers a zzso zzso Previous zzso analyses identified 11 major families of zzso zzso by comparing signature motifs within the zzso zzso Here we describe a new family with zzso to zzso zzso zzso an zzso first discovered by the presence of a zzso sensor domain involved in light zzso Members of this sensor zzso family differ from most others by the absence of a recognizable F box and the presence of several uniquely zzso zzso including a zzso in the N box and a zzso acid sequence in the zzso box, which we have used to define the family zzso At least 81 members were identified in a variety of zzso and zzso with a significant enrichment in the zzso zzso Several representatives were shown to have zzso activity in zzso supporting their proposed participation in zzso One or more zzso related to signal zzso were evident zzso to the zzso domain, including zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this family has multiple roles in environmental zzso The discovery of the zzso family further extends the diversity within the zzso zzso and expands the importance of zzso signaling in zzso
