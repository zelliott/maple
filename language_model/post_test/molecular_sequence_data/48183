The zzso upstream regions of the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso to zzso and of the zzso (or zzso zzso which is critical for zzso development, invasive growth, and zzso are almost zzso and the genes are zzso to a large zzso Besides representing the largest zzso promoters identified to date, these regions are of particular interest from both a functional and an evolutionary point of zzso zzso of the genes indeed seems to be dependent on numerous zzso factors which integrate the information of a complex network of signaling zzso while the very limited sequence differences between them should allow the study of promoter evolution on a molecular zzso To investigate the zzso regulation, we compared the zzso levels zzso by the zzso and zzso promoters under various growth zzso Our data show that zzso of both genes responded similarly to most environmental signals but also indicated significant divergence in some zzso We identified distinct areas within the promoters that show specific responses to the zzso effect of zzso zzso (or zzso zzso or zzso and zzso as well as to carbon zzso zzso We also identified the zzso repressive effect as the absence of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso
