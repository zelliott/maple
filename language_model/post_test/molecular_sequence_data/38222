Recent studies indicate that a fraction of the information contained in an zzso acid sequence may be sufficient for specifying a native protein zzso An earlier zzso experiment conducted on bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso 58 zzso suggested that if cumulative zzso have additive effects on protein stability, a native protein structure could be built from zzso sequences that contained many zzso zzso distributed throughout the zzso To test this hypothesis, we designed and produced six zzso zzso containing from 21 to 29 zzso zzso We found that the melting temperature of zzso containing up to 27 zzso zzso zzso % of the total number of zzso could be predicted quite well by the sum of the change in melting temperature for the single zzso Additionally, these same zzso folded into a zzso structure, as judged by their cooperative zzso zzso zzso and zzso multiple quantum correlation zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing 22 zzso zzso was further shown by zzso and zzso to fold into a structure very similar to that of native zzso and to be a functional zzso zzso These results provide insight into the extent to which native protein structure and function can be achieved with a highly simplified zzso acid zzso
