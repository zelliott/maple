zzso nitrogen is required for the optimal growth and development of plants, while numerous zzso and zzso factors that consume soil nitrogen frequently create a nitrogen limitation growth zzso To cope with this, plants have evolved a suite of zzso responses to nitrogen zzso However, the molecular mechanism governing the zzso of plants to nitrogen limitation is totally unknown because no reported zzso defines this zzso Here we isolated an zzso zzso zzso zzso limitation zzso and identified the zzso gene as an essential component in this molecular zzso zzso with insufficient zzso nitrogen zzso or zzso the zzso zzso failed to develop the essential zzso responses to nitrogen zzso but zzso much earlier and more rapidly than did the wild zzso Under other stress conditions including low zzso zzso drought and high temperature, the zzso zzso did not show this early zzso zzso but closely resembled the wild type in growth and zzso zzso cloning of zzso revealed that this gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a deletion zzso which does not code for the zzso domain in the zzso zzso The zzso protein is localized to the nuclear zzso where this protein interacts with the zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso In the zzso zzso the deletion of the zzso domain from zzso altered its zzso zzso disrupted the interaction between zzso and zzso and caused the early zzso zzso induced by low zzso zzso All the results indicate that zzso is a positive regulator for the development of the zzso of zzso to nitrogen zzso
