To assess the roles of the zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso in a series of patients with zzso giant cell zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso and 102 ethnically matched controls from the zzso region zzso zzso were zzso The following single zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso differences in zzso and zzso zzso were observed for the zzso zzso between zzso negative patients and zzso zzso interaction between zzso zzso with zzso showed a significant interaction zzso zzso zzso and carriage of the zzso zzso in the absence of zzso resulted in a zzso risk of developing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, a significant increase in the frequency of the zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso negative zzso patients compared to the controls zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were observed for the zzso zzso in both zzso patients and zzso 

Our results suggest an association with zzso gene zzso that is dependent on zzso zzso in zzso susceptible zzso These data indicate an interaction between zzso and zzso that contributes to pronounced disease zzso
