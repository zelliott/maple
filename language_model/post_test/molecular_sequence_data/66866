zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso critical for processes ranging from zzso development to cancer zzso Although zzso with specific molecular and functional properties have been characterized in zzso and chicken, the organization of zzso gene throughout zzso and its potential to generate multiple zzso are not well zzso Here, we study the zzso of zzso the organization of its zzso and its zzso processing in zzso and zzso 

A single zzso of zzso and the related zzso was found in zzso zzso Gene zzso probably occurred in zzso after the zzso zzso leading to the evolution of zzso with distinct zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso is zzso in their functional zzso but not in their zzso regions, with the absence of zzso site in zzso zzso zzso of mouse and human zzso genes revealed the existence of multiple combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso transcripts suggesting a complex regulation of their zzso Four alternatively spliced coding zzso (13, 14, 16, and 31), previously described in zzso are highly zzso in zzso zzso elements known to regulate alternative zzso were found in zzso alternative zzso of zzso or in the zzso zzso In contrast, other reported human zzso zzso were restricted to Homo zzso and, in some cases, other zzso Several of these zzso zzso may zzso to zzso zzso The inclusion of zzso alternative zzso was examined by zzso in mouse and human brain during zzso zzso of zzso 14 and 16 peaked at the end of embryonic life, whereas inclusion of zzso 13 increased steadily until zzso Study of various zzso showed that inclusion of these zzso also occurred, independently from each other, in a zzso zzso 

The alternative coding zzso 13, 14, 16, and 31 are highly zzso in zzso and their inclusion in zzso is tightly but independently zzso These zzso may therefore be crucial for zzso function in specific zzso or during zzso zzso pathological zzso of the expression of zzso and of its zzso could lead to abnormal cellular zzso
