A zzso chain reaction zzso method was developed for the rapid detection of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Three zzso the Chinese zzso isolate zzso the Japanese commercial beer isolate zzso and the Japanese zzso isolate zzso which were zzso classified as belonging to zzso zzso were used in this zzso After sequencing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso and the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these sequences were compared with published zzso A zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso was then constructed based on the zzso variable region of zzso zzso The specificity of zzso using the zzso zzso specific primer zzso and the universal primer zzso was examined using five zzso zzso zzso the three zzso described above and two strains from culture collection, zzso zzso and zzso zzso A variety of zzso zzso acid bacteria, including 71 zzso strains and 13 zzso zzso were also included in this zzso No zzso product was obtained from any DNA with the exception of the five zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso specific primer zzso was highly zzso The detection limit for zzso zzso in beer was 63 zzso zzso of zzso
