There is increasing interest in the role of zzso targeting specific membrane proteins in neurological and other zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso is known in a few diseases, usually when candidate cell surface proteins have been zzso zzso for identifying new zzso have mainly resulted in the identification of zzso to zzso zzso which are often very useful as diagnostic markers for disease but unlikely to be directly involved in disease zzso because they are not accessible to circulating zzso To identify cell surface zzso we developed a zzso membrane zzso isolation and zzso zzso First, a cell line is identified that zzso with patient zzso but not with control zzso Second, intact cells are exposed to zzso to allow the binding of zzso zzso to their cell surface zzso After washing off zzso serum zzso the cells are zzso and immune complexes are zzso Third, the bound surface zzso is identified by mass zzso As a model system we used a muscle cell line, zzso that zzso expresses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso from patients with a zzso of the zzso disease zzso zzso in which patients have zzso against zzso zzso was robustly detected as the only membrane protein in zzso from all three patient samples tested and not from the three zzso zzso control samples processed in zzso Of note, however, there were many zzso proteins found in the zzso from both patients and controls, suggesting that these were zzso zzso from cell zzso The zzso membrane zzso isolation and identification technique should be of value for the detection of highly relevant zzso targets in the growing number of suspected zzso zzso zzso The approach would also be very suitable for the analysis of human or experimental zzso zzso
