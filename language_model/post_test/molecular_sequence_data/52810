The plant hormone zzso zzso activates zzso zzso We have isolated three zzso zzso from cucumber, two zzso zzso and zzso containing the complete open reading frame zzso and one partial zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso were induced during the emergence of zzso from seed zzso After zzso zzso their zzso accumulated in the zzso part of the zzso much more than in the zzso part, and later in zzso region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly accumulated in response to zzso although the zzso of the former zzso zzso by zzso application was much greater than that of the zzso zzso did not show an apparent change by zzso treatment in our zzso In zzso zzso zzso the transition zone between zzso and root zzso was due to downward zzso zzso On the other hand, vertically zzso zzso of cucumber do not curve in the early stage of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was more than that in vertically zzso ones during zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso distribution of zzso zzso was detected in the transition zone in in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene product may be involved in the gravity response during early development of zzso
