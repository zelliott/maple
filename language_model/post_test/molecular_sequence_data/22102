Type III zzso machinery zzso composed of a needle, a zzso body, and a zzso zzso delivers a subset of zzso into host zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso compartment involved in zzso the transit of various zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis and pull-down zzso revealed zzso to be localized beneath the zzso via interaction with zzso and zzso zzso body zzso zzso is also capable of interacting with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the transit of zzso the needle zzso zzso zzso for determining needle zzso and several zzso zzso and functional analyses of the zzso zzso region, which is highly zzso in the zzso family, indicate that some of the zzso zzso are crucial for needle formation via interactions with zzso Thus, zzso plays a central role as the zzso component in zzso zzso zzso
