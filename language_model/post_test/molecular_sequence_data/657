zzso kills 2 million children worldwide each year, yet an zzso agent is not found in approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have all been found in human and animal zzso Modern technologies, especially deep sequencing, allow zzso zzso screening of clinical samples such as stool for new infectious agents associated with human zzso 

A pool of 141 pediatric zzso samples that were previously found to be negative for known zzso viruses was subjected to zzso From a total of zzso sequence reads, a collection of zzso reads zzso related to zzso virus were assembled and found to comprise zzso of a novel zzso zzso The complete zzso was subsequently cloned and found to share zzso zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso The low level of sequence identity suggests a novel zzso zzso which we have designated zzso zzso screening of zzso stool specimens from both symptomatic and zzso individuals revealed a second positive case of zzso infection, which was subsequently found to be from the index zzso zzso old zzso 

We report the discovery of human zzso 1, a member of a novel zzso zzso in stool from two infants from Northern zzso Further characterization and zzso studies will be required to establish whether zzso are significant causes of human zzso
