We have cloned a novel zzso protein zzso zzso which is highly related zzso within the zzso domain to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Northern blots demonstrate that zzso zzso is distributed widely among zzso and is expressed at the highest levels in zzso heart, and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in liver and zzso Two zzso zzso 10 and zzso zzso pairs in size are seen in a number of cell lines, including zzso and breast cancer zzso An zzso generated to a zzso zzso fusion protein detects a zzso protein in these cell lines, and a similarly sized protein when the cloned zzso is zzso expressed in zzso 7 zzso zzso of the zzso expressed zzso protein and incubation with zzso demonstrate that it is capable of zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso protein zzso also zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The gene corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso zzso was isolated by zzso chain reaction screening of a zzso zzso human zzso zzso Using this zzso zzso clone as a probe, the zzso gene was located on zzso a possible location for a human zzso zzso a gene associated with zzso muscle disease, as well as a region associated with genetically acquired mental zzso
