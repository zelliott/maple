The bacterial capsule is a recognized zzso factor in zzso zzso It likely works as an zzso barrier by minimizing complement deposition on the bacterial zzso With the continual rise of bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple zzso there is an increasing need for novel zzso In the zzso pathway, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso system, whose main components consist of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso The ability to regulate capsule zzso has been shown to be vital for zzso because different stages of infection require a shift in capsule zzso making the zzso proteins suitable as drug zzso Here, we review the role of regulatory proteins focusing on zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso coli and discuss their suitability as targets in zzso drug zzso
