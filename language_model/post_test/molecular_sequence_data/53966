A specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso has recently been causing zzso of zzso in Southeast Asia, Japan, and North zzso To examine whether the new zzso strains possess characteristics that may exacerbate outbreaks, we compared zzso zzso zzso strains with zzso strains using strains isolated from individuals with zzso zzso at Kansai Airport zzso Station, Osaka, zzso All 24 zzso strains possessed a common zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso with 10 open reading frames zzso The gene organization of zzso was similar to that of zzso a zzso zzso previously described in zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso from the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso which formed a zzso plaque on an indicator zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso DNA, and the zzso DNA obtained by treatment of the zzso with DNA zzso was identical to that of zzso when analyzed by zzso gel zzso after zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso major coat protein was found in zzso of zzso Our results showed that zzso is a zzso form of zzso Among the zzso found in the zzso zzso the sequence of zzso had no significant zzso to those of any proteins in zzso zzso was located on a region corresponding to the distinctive region of zzso and its zzso content was apparently lower than that of the remaining DNA sequence of zzso By colony zzso zzso was detected only in zzso strains isolated since 1996 and was not found in zzso strains isolated before 1996 and clinical zzso zzso strains other than those of zzso zzso Thus, this study shows that zzso is exclusively associated with recent zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene can be a useful genetic marker for the identification of the recently widespread zzso strains of zzso zzso
