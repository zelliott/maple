The zzso gene is required for establishing polarity in early zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso mothers show defects in segregation of zzso zzso and in positioning of the early zzso zzso We report here that the zzso protein is zzso distributed at the periphery of the zzso and zzso dividing zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso distribution is roughly the zzso of zzso another protein required for establishing embryonic polarity in zzso zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso and zzso in other par zzso reveals that zzso activity is required for proper zzso of zzso and that zzso is required for proper zzso of zzso In addition, the distribution of the zzso protein zzso with differences in zzso zzso orientation and suggests a mechanism by which zzso contributes to control of zzso zzso
