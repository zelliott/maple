We have determined the DNA sequence of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso coli isolate zzso zzso of zzso 128 zzso which was recently demonstrated to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Agents zzso zzso zzso Compared with the zzso gene of zzso coli zzso 55 zzso changes were zzso Three of these resulted in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing two of these zzso zzso and zzso was isolated and fused in frame to the residual 3' coding region of zzso in a zzso to yield a zzso zzso gene zzso After introduction into zzso coli zzso this zzso gene does not increase the zzso zzso of the resulting zzso strain in a dominance test, while the zzso gene zzso The zzso concentration necessary to inhibit by zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso isolated from zzso coli zzso is above 2,000 zzso An identical result was found for zzso zzso in zzso from the zzso gene product and the zzso zzso gene zzso This is more than a zzso increase compared with the zzso determined for zzso from zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso per zzso No indications for the involvement of the zzso gene or for zzso in zzso zzso were zzso
