zzso by zzso zzso DNA zzso leads to the degradation of specific zzso fragments on DNA sequencing zzso This reaction can be prevented by zzso It is also inhibited by a high concentration of zzso only the zzso complementary to the next base in the template is an effective zzso suggesting the formation of a stable zzso complex despite the absence of a 3' zzso group on the zzso The use of zzso a genetically modified zzso DNA zzso that lacks zzso activity, and zzso rather than zzso to eliminate discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Richardson, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86, zzso generates bands of uniform intensity on a DNA sequencing zzso Uniform band zzso simplify the analysis of a DNA zzso particularly with automated zzso For example, when zzso DNA is zzso directly, zzso sequences are readily detected because their bands have half the intensity of zzso zzso A procedure for automated DNA sequencing is described that exploits the zzso A single reaction with a single labeled primer is carried out using four different ratios of zzso to zzso after gel zzso in a single lane, the sequence is determined by the relative intensity of each zzso
