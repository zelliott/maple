A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a Chinese hot zzso zzso of the strain were zzso zzso slightly curved zzso Growth occurred between 55 and 70 zzso zzso about 60 zzso and at pH zzso zzso about pH zzso zzso was the only tested carbon source that supported the growth of the strain in pure zzso In zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the isolate could zzso saturated zzso fatty acids with zzso carbon zzso and also zzso fatty acids such as zzso zzso The strain was unable to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso as electron zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the strain was affiliated to the family zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso evidence, it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
