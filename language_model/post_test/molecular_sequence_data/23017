zzso comprise a family of zzso peptides sharing a highly zzso zzso zzso Here we report that the entire chicken zzso encodes three zzso namely zzso to zzso which are densely clustered within a zzso distance at the zzso end of zzso zzso Each zzso gene adopts a zzso zzso structure, typical for a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and a group of zzso related zzso zzso known as zzso zzso proteins are likely to originate from a common ancestral gene prior to the separation of birds from zzso whereas other classic zzso zzso may have been duplicated from the primordial gene for zzso zzso proteins after zzso and birds are zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso mature zzso displayed potent and zzso activities against a range of zzso and zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso with minimum zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso for most zzso zzso and zzso also showed zzso with 50% killing of zzso zzso or zzso cells in the range of zzso zzso In addition, two zzso demonstrated a strong positive zzso in binding zzso zzso resulting in nearly complete zzso of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso are clearly among the most potent zzso that have been zzso Their broad spectrum and zzso zzso activities, coupled with their potent zzso activity, make zzso excellent candidates for novel zzso and zzso zzso
