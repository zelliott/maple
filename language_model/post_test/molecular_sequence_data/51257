A zzso associated protein was zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso last zzso larvae of the pink zzso zzso zzso This protein zzso approximately zzso zzso was given the name zzso zzso protein zzso It is composed of one zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso increased dramatically in the zzso of zzso larvae from zzso in zzso zzso phase to zzso in early zzso zzso phase reaching a level of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of total proteins in the zzso of active feeding zzso zzso zzso and MD larvae were zzso zzso zzso and 118 zzso respectively, while those in the fat body of the same larvae were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso a drop in the concentration of fat body proteins coincided with a corresponding increase in zzso zzso which suggests an active release of protein from the fat body into the zzso during the development of zzso A partial zzso acid sequence of zzso showed the first 15 zzso acids starting from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
