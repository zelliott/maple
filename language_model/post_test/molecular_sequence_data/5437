Cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene led to the identification and isolation of zzso and zzso sequences that zzso to the first zzso binding fold of zzso DNA sequence analysis of these clones showed that the zzso sequences corresponded to zzso zzso 9 and its zzso zzso zzso with two segments of zzso zzso The zzso sequence appeared to have been transcribed from the opposite direction of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso sequences into a zzso location distinct from that of the zzso zzso Based on zzso intensity and complexity of the restriction fragments, it was estimated that there were at least 10 copies of the zzso zzso zzso 9 sequences in the human zzso Furthermore, when DNA segments adjacent to the zzso site were used in zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis, multiple copies were also zzso The overall similarity between these zzso zzso zzso sequences suggested that they were derived from a single zzso event and subsequent sequence zzso The amplification unit appeared to be greater than 30 zzso Physical mapping studies including in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso showed that multiple copies of these amplified sequences (with and without the zzso zzso 9 zzso were dispersed throughout the zzso These findings provide insight into the structure and evolution of the human zzso
