Our previous published data indicated that the two zzso strains zzso and zzso which were isolated from the root zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso Province, China, might be novel species of the zzso zzso Their exact zzso position was determined in the present study by using zzso zzso Comparative analysis of nearly full-length zzso zzso gene sequences showed that these strains belonged to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the closest zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso confirmed their distinct position, showing low similarity with respect to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso % similarity respectively), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso % zzso respectively), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso % zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso % zzso zzso The zzso zzso values between strain zzso and strain zzso were zzso zzso showing that they belong to the same zzso The zzso zzso values of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso respectively, clearly indicating that strain zzso represents a novel zzso A series of zzso and zzso tests and comparison of cellular fatty acids indicated that the novel group of zzso was distinct from previously described zzso zzso we propose that strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
