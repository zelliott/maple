zzso muscle expresses at least three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no studies have examined the potential regulation of zzso zzso by zzso the zzso predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and highly regulated by zzso zzso zzso were zzso with empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells had higher rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but lower rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso that operates through an zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso These effects were reversed when zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso in adult skeletal muscle, the zzso anterior muscles of mice were injected with zzso or zzso zzso zzso followed by intramuscular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso was determined 14 days zzso zzso of zzso resulted in higher zzso rates of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Muscles zzso zzso showed a trend for lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly lower total zzso levels zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso increases zzso zzso zzso and decreases zzso and zzso zzso zzso partially by affecting levels of zzso zzso expression in skeletal zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso of stress zzso such as zzso are negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso in peripheral zzso
