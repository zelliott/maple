The zzso locus of the green zzso zzso zzso which we mapped to the long arm of zzso 8, provides a good experimental system for the study of zzso Most zzso that zzso resistance to the toxic ammonium analog zzso are in zzso and a high proportion of spontaneous zzso are caused by zzso zzso Among the 15 such events that we have characterized at the molecular level, 9 were associated with insertions of the zzso zzso 2 with a small zzso zzso and 1 with the zzso zzso We found that zzso is apparently a zzso zzso with terminal zzso repeats that are much longer and more complex than previously zzso A zzso of zzso yielded a zzso thought to be important for zzso zzso Other zzso in zzso were caused by two mobile elements that have not been described zzso The sequence of one, which we propose to call the Bill element, indicates that it probably zzso by way of a DNA intermediate and requires functions that it does not zzso The sequence of the other and zzso analysis indicates that it derives from a miniature zzso or zzso which we propose to call zzso zzso zzso of zzso
