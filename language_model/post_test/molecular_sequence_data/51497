zzso B viruses zzso replicate their DNA zzso by reverse zzso of an zzso zzso Efforts to examine the zzso mechanism for viral DNA synthesis have been hampered by the failure to zzso the reverse zzso from zzso and to express the zzso in zzso systems in an zzso active zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso of a zzso zzso in an in zzso translation reaction exhibits reverse zzso zzso Furthermore, our results show that the zzso acts as a primer for DNA synthesis and remains zzso linked to nascent DNA, a feature that is not known to exist in any other zzso DNA zzso zzso of DNA synthesis requires viral zzso but occurs independently of other viral zzso The ability to express the zzso reverse zzso in an zzso active form will allow detailed zzso and functional analyses of this complex zzso and may facilitate the identification of zzso required for zzso zzso
