zzso preferences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been investigated by using a systematic combination of zzso distance constraints and molecular mechanics zzso These zzso share a common zzso core but differ in the number or placement of zzso acid zzso attached to the zzso Placement of the zzso acid zzso is shown to influence the preferred core zzso The origin of these effects is zzso to be zzso interactions of the zzso acid zzso with other remote zzso In the case of zzso hydrogen bonds between the internal zzso acid and an zzso group on zzso are zzso In the case of zzso a zzso network between the terminal and internal zzso acids is suggested to play a zzso
