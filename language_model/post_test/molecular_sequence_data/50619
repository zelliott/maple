The zzso acid sequences of four major zzso proteins of African horse sickness virus zzso 4, zzso have been compared with those of zzso virus of zzso zzso zzso disease virus of zzso and the zzso relationships zzso Complete zzso sequence analysis of three zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and their zzso products, zzso zzso and zzso together with previously published data for zzso zzso et zzso 1991), have revealed that of the four zzso proteins the zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso Some zzso of the aligned zzso and zzso zzso zzso acids are identical with those of zzso This compares to an identity of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the zzso proteins zzso of the aligned zzso acids are identical between zzso and zzso while they share zzso zzso acid zzso with the aligned zzso protein of zzso By contrast, the zzso proteins of the three viruses share only zzso identical zzso zzso Various other comparative analyses of the proteins indicate that the zzso species of the three zzso are zzso Unlike zzso the other outer zzso zzso zzso is more zzso among the three zzso On zzso the zzso of zzso has some zzso identical zzso acids with that of zzso and zzso Between zzso and zzso zzso of the aligned sequences are zzso
