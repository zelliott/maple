In addition to the universally expressed and highly zzso class zzso zzso the major zzso complex zzso of zzso zzso includes class zzso genes that are characterized by restricted expression and low levels of sequence zzso The functional importance of class zzso genes as well as their actual function has long been zzso zzso analyses have suggested that there are no zzso relationships among class zzso zzso of zzso belonging to different orders, suggesting that these zzso have evolved independently since the zzso zzso zzso Here, we present evidence of zzso evolution at the molecular sequence level in the putative zzso regions zzso of human and mouse class zzso zzso So far, there are few if any convincing examples of zzso evolution at the zzso acid sequence level, and such evolution is believed to be likely to occur only as a result of strong positive zzso Because the present case involves the functionally important zzso and because the zzso and zzso molecules are known to bind similar zzso this study represents both a convincing case of zzso convergence and evidence that zzso class zzso zzso although not zzso may evolve similar functions zzso
