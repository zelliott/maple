The zzso gene follows a complex and highly regulated pattern of expression throughout T cell zzso This expression is governed by different regulatory elements that have been partly identified, including a promoter, a zzso zzso and a zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso zzso a combination of these elements is specifically expressed in mature zzso T cells of transgenic mice, but not in zzso double positive zzso The proportion of zzso zzso T cells was constant within a given transgenic line, but varied greatly from one line to zzso We demonstrate that this pattern of expression is due to integration of the zzso within or in the vicinity of zzso zzso This zzso zzso demonstrated with a short zzso zzso has not been observed with larger ones containing additional regulatory zzso suggesting that the zzso gene contains a locus control zzso Such zzso effects must be taken into consideration when developing transgenic models or gene transfer zzso because they can result in the absence of zzso expression in a zzso of target zzso Finally, the combination of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and promoter provides an interesting tool to selectively express genes of interest in mature zzso T cells of transgenic mice and for the development of gene therapy zzso
