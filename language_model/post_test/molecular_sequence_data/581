zzso zzso is one of the leading marine pathogens that can zzso a wide range of cultured marine zzso In this study, the zzso cluster was cloned from zzso a zzso zzso zzso strain isolated from diseased zzso zzso and zzso were found to be involved in resistance against zzso and zzso zzso which positively regulate the expression of zzso zzso zzso regulates its own expression and the expression of the zzso zzso most likely by interacting with a zzso operator site that zzso the putative promoter of zzso zzso The repressive effect of zzso on zzso could be relieved by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the presence of each of which enhanced zzso from zzso zzso of the regulated expression of zzso by introducing into zzso a zzso that zzso zzso affected growth under stress conditions, zzso production, and bacterial zzso In addition, zzso analyses identified a zzso active zzso zzso (named zzso which exhibits full zzso activity but is impaired in its ability to interact with the zzso zzso of zzso produced the same kind of but moderately stronger effect on zzso compared to that produced by zzso of the zzso zzso
