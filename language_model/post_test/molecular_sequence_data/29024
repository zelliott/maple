DNA charge transport chemistry is found to provide a sensitive method for probing zzso changes in DNA structure and zzso zzso Here we describe the development of an zzso zzso of protein binding to zzso zzso based upon the detection of associated zzso in DNA base zzso Gold zzso surfaces that were modified with loosely packed DNA duplexes, zzso zzso to a zzso zzso and containing the binding site of the test zzso were zzso zzso transport through DNA as a function of protein binding was then zzso zzso zzso in current is seen in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso as well as with zzso zzso When restriction zzso zzso zzso binds to its zzso target, little zzso zzso occurs and little diminution in current flow is zzso zzso the zzso of restriction by zzso of its zzso target is also easily monitored zzso This approach should be generally zzso to zzso zzso interactions and reactions on zzso
