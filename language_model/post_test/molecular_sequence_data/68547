zzso receptors constitute a huge family of structurally related G zzso zzso with up to a thousand members zzso We have shown previously that genes belonging to this family were expressed in the male germ line from both dog and zzso The functional significance of this unexpected site of expression was further investigated in the present zzso We demonstrate that a few dog genes representative of various zzso of zzso receptors are expressed essentially in zzso with little or no expression in zzso zzso Other randomly selected members of the family show the expected site of zzso restricted to the zzso zzso zzso were generated against the deduced zzso acid sequence of the most abundantly expressed zzso zzso gene in dog zzso The zzso serum was able to detect the gene product zzso zzso in late round and zzso zzso as well as in the zzso zzso that characterizes the maturation of dog zzso cells, and on the tail zzso of mature zzso Western zzso further confirmed the presence of a zzso zzso protein in the membrane of mature zzso zzso zzso , these results demonstrate that the main expression site of a subset of the large zzso zzso gene family is not zzso zzso but zzso This expression zzso with the presence of the corresponding protein during zzso cell zzso and on mature zzso zzso The pattern of expression is consistent with a role as sensor for unidentified chemicals possibly involved in the control of zzso zzso zzso migration, and/or zzso
