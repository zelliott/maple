About 38% of primary zzso long terminal repeats zzso contain an zzso zzso zzso prime or zzso prime or zzso termed the most frequent naturally occurring length zzso zzso The zzso binds several zzso factors and might affect zzso replication and disease progression in infected zzso However, its relevance for zzso zzso and for zzso replication in primary cells is zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effect of the zzso on zzso prime or zzso zzso activity in various cell zzso zzso viral promoter activity was studied in primary cells in the context of the integrated zzso using both single cycle zzso with zzso zzso reporter viruses and zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the presence, absence, or zzso of the zzso prime or zzso prime or minute motif has little effect on viral promoter activity in T cell lines, peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, all zzso zzso zzso showed efficient induction upon stimulation with zzso and/or zzso and zzso with comparable efficiency in a human T cell line and in zzso Thus, the zzso does not significantly affect zzso zzso prime or zzso zzso activity and viral replication in primary cells, suggesting that this common sequence variation has little impact on the clinical course of zzso zzso
