The duality of zzso zzso is well-established in relatively modern zzso In primitive zzso such as zzso and zzso however, only a single zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso the objective of this study was to clarify the duality of zzso particularly the presence of zzso in primitive zzso We attempted to obtain a zzso zzso the beta zzso of zzso from Japanese zzso zzso zzso as a representative primitive zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify zzso zzso prepared from immature male Japanese zzso zzso and the obtained zzso products were zzso and zzso A zzso zzso primer was designed based on a highly zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the cloned zzso products confirmed the presence of the predicted complete coding region as well as the zzso and 3' untranslated zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from these clones showed high zzso to goldfish zzso zzso whereas the identity between Japanese zzso zzso and zzso was lower zzso zzso analysis confirmed that Japanese zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso These results provide a definitive proof of the presence of two types of zzso zzso and zzso in Japanese zzso as has been shown in other zzso The duality of zzso is zzso for zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the transcripts of Japanese zzso zzso and zzso to be 1200 and 750 zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed in immature fish, while zzso gene was expressed in zzso males and zzso zzso suggesting that two zzso are zzso expressed at different sexual stages and may play separate roles in the zzso process in Japanese zzso
