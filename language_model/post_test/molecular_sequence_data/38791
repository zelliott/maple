Genes showing differential expression related to the early zzso phase of the cell cycle during synchronized zzso growth of the toxic zzso zzso zzso were identified and characterized by differential display zzso The determination in our previous work that toxin production in zzso is relegated to a narrow time frame in early zzso led to the hypothesis that zzso zzso or zzso genes during this zzso of the cell cycle might be related to toxin zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso was zzso while zzso and zzso were zzso during the early zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences with about 90 and zzso similarity to those zzso by several zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The partial zzso sequence also contained three zzso binding motifs characteristic of all zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso acid sequence with zzso similarity to those of two zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso zzso This study documents the potential of applying zzso to the identification of genes that are related to zzso processes or cell cycle events in zzso under conditions where small sample volumes represent an experimental zzso The identification of an additional 21 genes with various cell zzso zzso patterns also provides evidence for the importance of zzso or zzso regulation in zzso contrary to previous reports suggesting the possibility that zzso mechanisms are the primary means of zzso regulation in this group of zzso
