There has been considerable interest in pursuing zzso as a putative therapeutic target for overcoming depressed calcium handling in human heart zzso Studies predominantly done in mice have shown that zzso is a key regulator of zzso zzso calcium cycling and cardiac zzso However, mice differ significantly from humans in how they regulate zzso whereas rabbits better zzso human cardiac function and calcium zzso To investigate zzso role in the rabbit heart, transgenic rabbits that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso skeletal muscles were zzso zzso expressing high levels of zzso were not viable due to severe skeletal muscle zzso the onset of cardiac pathology and early zzso A viable transgenic line exhibited a zzso increase in zzso protein levels in the zzso These animals showed isolated zzso of cardiac pathology, but cardiac function as well as the response to zzso stimulation were zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the transgenic hearts had the expected reduced affinity for zzso The data show that zzso transgenic rabbits differ markedly in zzso from analogous transgenic mice in that rabbits are quite sensitive to zzso in zzso zzso zzso a relatively narrow window of zzso expression results in significant morbidity and early zzso
