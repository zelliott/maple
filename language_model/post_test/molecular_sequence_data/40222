The zzso zzso of zzso and oxidized zzso of zzso zzso zzso repeat units zzso was sampled over 40 zzso via molecular dynamic zzso zzso The energetic and structural consequences of zzso binding to zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso zzso properties of analyzed pairs, zzso and zzso steps occurring in central zzso repeat unit were estimated by means of advanced quantum chemistry zzso including not only zzso corrections, electron correlation contributions but also zzso zzso zzso These data along with bases pair and base step parameters zzso allow for zzso of consequences of zzso and/or zzso binding to zzso repeat zzso zzso of zzso in central zzso zzso zzso is the source of high zzso if compared to zzso zzso The origin of this property comes from significantly zzso of zzso interactions introduced by zzso The increased stability observed for zzso interactions are accumulated and characterizes also zzso and zzso The observed changes in the zzso interactions originate from structural zzso imposed by zzso binding to zzso and oxidized zzso zzso First and most direct consequence of zzso binding to oxidized zzso repeat unit is zzso of zzso correlations if compared to zzso zzso This in turn leads to large differences in zzso overlapping in oxidized zzso Thus, oxidized zzso zzso double strands are sensitive to interactions with protein zzso and numerous structural and energetic changes are imposed on base pairs forming zzso
