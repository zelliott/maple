We have cloned and determined the zzso sequence of the gene zzso specifying the large (110 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding factor zzso which binds selectively in zzso to zzso zzso DNA and contains a minus zzso zzso motor zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows no sequence zzso with known molecular motors, although a consensus zzso binding site is zzso The zzso gene is essential for viability of zzso and is identical to zzso in which a conditional zzso leads to a zzso in zzso segregation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in this issue of The Journal of Cell zzso The combined in zzso and in zzso evidence indicate that zzso is a key component of the budding zzso zzso
