We zzso four zzso zzso from the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso previously characterized as one of the few animals to have a zzso zzso zzso The sequence data indicate that three of these zzso zzso circles are zzso zzso long, zzso fragments derived from fragments of the other zzso This pattern is consistent with the operation of zzso zzso a process generally considered absent in animal zzso We also report that many of the duplicated genes contain deleterious zzso ones likely to render the gene zzso gene conversion does not appear to be zzso the different gene zzso The proposed zzso copies are clustered on particular circles, whereas copies that are likely to code functional gene products are clustered on zzso
