The sea zzso is an important model zzso for investigating the evolutionary origins of zzso As more zzso zzso sequences are zzso evolutionary zzso biologists are becoming increasingly able to identify putative gene regulatory elements across the breadth of the zzso zzso The identification of these regions makes it possible to address how changes at the zzso level have led to changes in zzso gene regulatory networks and ultimately to the evolution of zzso zzso Comparative zzso approaches using sea zzso have already predicted a number of such regulatory elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these sequences and other similar elements requires efficient reporter zzso in zzso In this report, we describe the development of a transient zzso method for zzso zzso Focusing on zzso zzso elements zzso we use this method to investigate their functional conservation across the zzso zzso We find instances of both functional conservation and zzso functional evolution of zzso across zzso zzso the utility of functionally testing zzso zzso in their host zzso
