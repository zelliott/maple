zzso zzso or zzso is a dynamic zzso modification that cycles on and off zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso modification shares a complex relationship with zzso as both modifications are capable of mutually zzso the occupation of each other on the same or nearby zzso acid zzso In addition to diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, zzso appears to play a significant role in cell growth and cell cycle zzso although the precise mechanisms are still not well zzso A recent study also found that all four core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are modified with zzso although no specific sites on zzso were zzso Here, we describe that zzso zzso a protein highly zzso during zzso is modified with zzso Several zzso zzso were used to validate that zzso is modified with zzso Mass zzso analysis identified zzso 32 as a novel zzso zzso zzso was detected at higher levels on zzso during zzso than zzso which zzso correlated with zzso Furthermore, increased zzso was observed to reduce zzso zzso at zzso 10, zzso 28, and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso the zzso responsible for removing zzso hindered the transition from zzso to M phase of the cell cycle, displaying a zzso similar to preventing zzso zzso on zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso regulates zzso zzso on zzso providing a zzso switch that zzso the zzso transition of the cell zzso
