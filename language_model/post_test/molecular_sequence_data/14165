We developed the first set of zzso markers for the passion fruit, zzso zzso to provide tools for further study of its genetic diversity and to support current conservation and genetic zzso 

We used a zzso library approach to isolate and characterize 25 new molecular zzso Seven primer pairs successfully amplified zzso zzso regions, with an average of five zzso per zzso The mean values of expected and observed levels of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso markers identified in this study may be valuable tools for population genetic studies, and this set of markers also may be useful in the design of a genetic conservation strategy, mating system, and zzso zzso
