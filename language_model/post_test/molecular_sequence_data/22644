zzso zzso zzso is involved in the last step of zzso zzso zzso by reducing the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generates a distinct zzso product, zzso zzso whereas animal zzso produce zzso zzso although it has high zzso acid sequence similarities to the other animal zzso To zzso the structural basis for the different reaction zzso we have determined the three-dimensional structures of zzso alone and zzso with zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso The overall folding of the zzso the binding site for the zzso zzso and the positions of active site zzso were quite similar to the mouse and the human zzso However, significant differences were found in the zzso binding region of the zzso In comparison to the mouse zzso complex, the zzso in the zzso is rotated about 180 degrees around the active site and bound between two aromatic side chains of zzso and zzso so that its zzso ring is shifted to the opposite side, but its side chain position is not zzso The swiveled zzso binding results in the conversion of the side chain zzso exposing the opposite face for hydride transfer from zzso The different zzso binding mode within the zzso zzso architecture presents a novel strategy of switching the reaction zzso in the same protein zzso
