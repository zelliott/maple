To substantiate and extend the zzso model of zzso C virus zzso we made a zzso comparison in the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences for multiple zzso clones of the zzso region, which derived from each blood sample taken from five patients of zzso II or zzso III infection at different zzso zzso zzso among the clones was generally zzso The zzso however, changed temporally and appeared to be significantly lowered after zzso zzso The zzso fluctuation involved selection of particular zzso acids at particular positions, which had represented only a minor fraction or had been absent in the previous zzso Evolution of defective viruses was featured by most of the cases, the proportion of which also zzso temporally and was extremely high at a certain stage in one of the zzso A comparison was also made among the clones from different stages of each patient and revealed highly divergent zzso An extreme case of zzso III infection showed sequence differences well beyond those among zzso and geographically different zzso of zzso I or zzso II, which were defined by the same calculation of available sequence zzso These features of zzso zzso suggest that the virus could circulate as an extremely zzso population including defective viruses and that this zzso lends itself to selection pressures including zzso therapy and host immune zzso Our results also indicate an absolute need of population based approach in zzso zzso
