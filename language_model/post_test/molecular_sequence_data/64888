We report the combined use of zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso experiments and molecular dynamics zzso simulations to investigate zzso zzso of the prion protein zzso repeat zzso zzso was used for the first time to probe the distance, as a function of temperature and zzso between a donor zzso zzso and an zzso zzso group attached to the zzso in seven model peptides containing one to three repeats of the second zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and one and two human zzso consensus zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso were made by replacing other zzso with zzso As previous work has shown zzso repeats do not adopt a single preferred stable zzso the zzso values are averages reflecting zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso and derived average zzso zzso were obtained directly from MD simulation of the zzso zzso zzso The results show excellent agreement between the zzso and MD zzso zzso and demonstrate the remarkable sensitivity and zzso of the zzso method in this first-time use for a set of zzso zzso Based on the results, we propose a model involving zzso or zzso zzso interactions to explain the zzso zzso degrees zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on distance, with zzso zzso i + 4 or zzso zzso i + 4 zzso in sequence being more stable than zzso zzso i + 6 or zzso zzso i + 6 zzso The model has peptides adopting loosely folded zzso with zzso distances very much less than estimates for fully extended zzso for example, approximately 16 zzso 33, approximately 21 zzso 69, and approximately 22 zzso 106 A for 1-3 zzso and approximately 14 zzso 25 and approximately 19 zzso 54 A for 1-2 zzso zzso The study demonstrates the usefulness of combining zzso with MD, a combination reported only once zzso zzso zzso of the zzso distribution of flexible peptides by simulation can assist in designing and interpreting experiments using zzso intensity methods, and indicating how zzso or zzso methods might be zzso
