In the vast number of random zzso experiments that have targeted protein zzso single zzso acid zzso that increase the apparent melting temperature zzso of the zzso more than 1 to 2 degrees C are rare and often require the creation of a large library of zzso zzso Here we present a case where a single beneficial zzso zzso of a hemp zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso origin zzso produced a 6 degrees C increase in zzso and a zzso increase in the zzso at 45 degrees C without compromising the zzso zzso zzso This success was based on a variation of sequence alignment strategy where a zzso zzso acid sequence is matched with the sequences of its zzso counterparts that have established zzso zzso Altogether, two-thirds of the nine targeted single zzso acid zzso were found to have effects either on the zzso or on the zzso activity of the zzso evidence of a high success rate of zzso without the creation of a large gene library and subsequent screening of zzso Combination of zzso with another beneficial zzso zzso resulted in at least a twofold increase in specific activity while preserving the improved zzso zzso To understand the structural basis for the increased zzso stability or activity, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso By structure analysis and zzso methods, zzso zzso was found to be the driving force for the increased stability with zzso
