In plants many aspects of cell shape regulation are controlled by zzso zzso The zzso complex has been recognized as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso in genes zzso components of the zzso complex lead to cell shape defects in several cell types, including zzso zzso pavement cells and zzso zzso We show here that zzso in the zzso zzso gene cause a similar range of zzso The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso of zzso which in animals is known to act as one regulator of the zzso complex zzso As an zzso zzso is present in the zzso zzso but no WAVE zzso has yet been found, the existence of a related regulation zzso was zzso Our finding that zzso encodes a putative regulator of the zzso complex, zzso combined with the zzso similarity between zzso and zzso zzso provides evidence that the zzso complex is indeed regulated by the above mentioned zzso in zzso
