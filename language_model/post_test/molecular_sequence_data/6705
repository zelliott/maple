zzso receptors zzso recognize zzso bound within the relatively zzso structural framework of major zzso complex zzso class I or class II molecules but can discriminate between closely related zzso zzso The structural basis for the specificity of zzso complex formation by the zzso and zzso complexes was examined for zzso basic protein zzso zzso clones restricted by different zzso zzso zzso features of this system allowed a model for positioning of the zzso on zzso complexes to be developed: zzso The zzso zzso that presented the zzso zzso zzso differed only at a few zzso positions of the DR beta zzso zzso zzso recognition of a zzso zzso on the zzso portion of the DR beta chain zzso DR beta zzso was important in determining the zzso zzso zzso The zzso variable region zzso alpha zzso gene segment was used by all of the zzso zzso zzso V beta usage was more diverse but correlated with the zzso zzso with the zzso DR beta zzso zzso Two clones with zzso zzso alpha chains but different zzso beta chains had a different zzso restriction but a similar zzso zzso The difference in zzso restriction between these zzso clones appeared due to recognition of a cluster of zzso DR zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso therefore appeared to be positioned on the zzso complex such that the zzso beta chain contacted the zzso DR zzso zzso while the zzso zzso alpha chain contacted the zzso DR alpha zzso
