To study a family with zzso zzso of zzso blood group system, and to review safety issues in relation with clinical zzso 

The molecular basis for the blood type was studied with zzso zzso zzso chain zzso specific primer zzso and DNA sequencing, zzso clone and zzso analysis in one blood donor whose zzso blood group were difficulty typed and her zzso The zzso analysis was carried out by biological analysis software to investigate the change of structure and function of zzso influenced by the change zzso zzso A retrospective survey was carried out to investigate what is the actual position that the donor blood was used in the clinical zzso 

Three members from the family were found to have a zzso zzso A substitution of zzso C by T at position zzso in zzso 7 was discovered, which resulted in replacement of zzso acid zzso to zzso Review of clinical record suggested that there has been no significant zzso association with past three blood zzso 

A zzso zzso of the zzso gene probably zzso the zzso zzso Further research is needed for understanding the clinical significance of this zzso in the blood zzso
