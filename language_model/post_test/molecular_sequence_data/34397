In zzso zzso allergy, about zzso of detected in zzso double zzso to yellow jacket and zzso zzso is ascribed to specific zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, for the detection of zzso different zzso zzso and methods are zzso The most suitable one still has to be zzso 

zzso patients with confirmed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso values of zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients showed zzso zzso to both yellow jacket and zzso zzso 22 were zzso zzso positive and served as zzso zzso of zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on system A, and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso on system zzso Further, a reference standard for zzso evaluation was zzso zzso zzso was assumed when at least 4 of the 6 test results were zzso 

According to the defined reference standard, zzso zzso double positive patients exhibited zzso Using system A, comparison with the reference standard revealed sensitivity and specificity values of 96 and zzso respectively, for zzso 100 and zzso respectively, for zzso and 96 and zzso respectively, for zzso Using system B, sensitivity and specificity was 98 and zzso respectively, for zzso 62 and zzso respectively, for zzso and 96 and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso of the 3 test zzso obtained with system A showed strong correlations zzso zzso zzso whereas results with system B showed lower correlations zzso zzso zzso 

All 3 test zzso used with system A are suitable for zzso detection in zzso zzso zzso With system B, only zzso seems to be a reliable zzso
