Members of the zzso zzso go-go zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso and Elk are widely expressed in the nervous system, but their neural functions in zzso remain largely zzso The zzso properties of channels from the zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso and based on their characteristic features and expression patterns, zzso channels have been associated with native currents in the zzso Little is known about the properties of channels from the Elk zzso We have identified a mouse zzso zzso that encodes a predicted zzso with zzso zzso acid identity to zzso Elk but only 40 and zzso identity with mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be expressed at high levels only in brain zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso reveals large, transient zzso of current at the onset of zzso Like zzso zzso zzso currents activate relatively quickly, but they lack the zzso zzso shift characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso currents are insensitive to zzso a class III zzso compound that blocks the Human zzso Gene zzso channel and its counterpart in native zzso zzso zzso channels exhibit inward zzso because of a fast zzso zzso zzso but the slower rate of zzso and the faster rate of zzso results in less inward zzso than that observed in zzso zzso This characterization of zzso currents should aid in identification of native counterparts to the Elk zzso of channels in the nervous zzso
