Many zzso factors are demonstrated as being zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso insect cell lines, but rarely in the original zzso For the first time, we demonstrate the zzso modification of the zzso zzso gene (a zzso control gene involved in the eye zzso products in the quail zzso zzso In conjunction with a systematic zzso F treatment, we used wheat germ zzso zzso zzso in zzso labeling with bovine zzso and labeling of cultured zzso with zzso zzso forms of zzso proteins were found in the nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins produced in the zzso zzso were able to bind a DNA target, as well as to the zzso zzso The zzso may, however, zzso protein zzso mainly with other factors involved in the zzso zzso zzso of products released after reductive alkaline treatment of the proteins clearly demonstrates that zzso is directly linked to zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso primary sequence allowed us to determine potential zzso attachment zzso Most of these expected zzso sites appear to be located on the two DNA binding zzso and on the zzso zzso domain, while experimental evidence taken from zzso proteins experiment points in favor of a main zzso on the zzso zzso
