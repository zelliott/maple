A number of zzso precursor proteins of bacteria, zzso and plant zzso stand out by a zzso twin zzso sequence motif in their signal zzso Many of these precursor proteins are zzso in a completely folded zzso by specific twin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are high molecular mass complexes consisting of two types of membrane zzso a zzso zzso zzso and usually one or two zzso membrane zzso called zzso and zzso zzso has previously been shown to be involved in the recognition of twin zzso signal zzso We have performed an extensive zzso zzso analysis of the zzso coli zzso protein under resting and zzso zzso This strategy allowed us to map the recognition site for twin zzso signal peptides to the zzso zzso region and first zzso loop of zzso In addition, discrete contact sites between zzso zzso and zzso were zzso We discuss a tentative model of how a twin zzso signal sequence might be zzso in the zzso zzso
