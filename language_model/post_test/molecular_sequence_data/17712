The crystal and molecular structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso space group, with a zzso zzso b zzso zzso and c zzso zzso zzso In the solid state, the zzso of the zzso is characterized by the presence of two type zzso zzso Thus the zzso assumes a left-handed zzso zzso the left sense being due to the D zzso of the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso are located in the zzso + 1) position of the first zzso and in the zzso + 2) position of the second zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso molecules are linked head to tail by hydrogen zzso zzso hydrogen bonds are also formed between molecules related by a twofold screw zzso This gives rise to a typical mode of packing characterized by infinite zzso zzso similar to the packing found in other zzso that adopt a zzso zzso
