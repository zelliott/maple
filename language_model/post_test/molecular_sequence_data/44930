A strong promoter of the transition to flowering in zzso is zzso by zzso zzso has been cloned and shown to zzso a protein containing two zzso zzso and a WW protein interaction zzso This suggests that zzso functions in the zzso regulation of transcripts involved in the flowering zzso The zzso transcript is alternatively spliced with only one form zzso the entire zzso zzso Plants carrying the zzso gene fused to the strong zzso zzso promoter zzso earlier, and the ratio and abundance of the different zzso transcripts were zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a component of a zzso cascade involved in the control of flowering zzso
