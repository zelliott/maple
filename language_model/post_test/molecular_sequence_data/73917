zzso zzso of zzso with relatively selective binding affinities for specific zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were administered zzso to zzso rats to determine the zzso zzso zzso involved in regulation of acid zzso zzso by either zzso (24 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (5 zzso and in regulation of zzso release zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso and zzso acid zzso to zzso levels but inhibited zzso zzso to just zzso of zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited acid zzso similarly to zzso indicating that zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso receptors accounts for acid zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 10 and 100 zzso inhibited acid zzso zzso by zzso and by zzso but only the highest dose administered zzso zzso blocked by half the acid response to zzso zzso and zzso were significantly less zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also blocked zzso zzso release, whereas zzso and zzso were zzso None of the zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso receptors is the principal zzso zzso for zzso zzso of gastric acid zzso zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso and of zzso zzso zzso
