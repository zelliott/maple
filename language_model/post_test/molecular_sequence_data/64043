zzso zzso transfer of a zzso group from zzso zzso specifically to zzso 1939 of zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli to yield zzso We determined the crystal structure of zzso at zzso A zzso The protein is organized into three structural zzso The zzso domain contains sequence zzso to the zzso zzso motif and displays a zzso beta barrel architecture characteristic of an zzso binding zzso The central domain contains a zzso cluster coordinated by four zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain displays the typical zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso lies in a motif different from that in DNA zzso zzso The zzso potential surface reveals a predominately positively charged area that covers the zzso surface of the first two zzso and suggests an zzso binding zzso The zzso cluster may be involved in the correct folding of the protein or may have a role in zzso zzso
