The effect of zzso binding to zzso was monitored by zzso of zzso including zzso fluorescence, circular zzso zzso infrared zzso zzso and differential scanning zzso These experimental studies were compared with molecular dynamics zzso on the structures of the zzso and zzso forms of cod zzso The zzso CD zzso show that removal of calcium results in a decrease in the zzso content of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions are very much affected by zzso removal and are indicative of significant zzso of secondary zzso The zzso of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso all show changes with temperature, pointing to a lowering of protein stability upon zzso zzso These results are consistent with the structures obtained for both the zzso and zzso proteins after 200 zzso of zzso molecular dynamics simulations which show a decrease in the secondary structure upon zzso zzso
