Using a zzso zzso probe, we have isolated and characterized two zzso clones from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two different proteins that are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso differs from zzso and zzso clones of wheat in that a sequence coding for 20 zzso acid zzso is zzso repeated 4 zzso These two zzso clones zzso to two genes named zzso and zzso zzso of several zzso clones showed that both genes are zzso The zzso start site was determined for both genes by zzso zzso The site of zzso is variable and there is no obvious consensus sequence for zzso at the 3' ends of the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso is present only in nearly dry and dry seeds, whereas the corresponding to zzso appears in immature seeds and is maximum in dry zzso No expression of either gene could be detected in zzso zzso or floral zzso zzso of both genes could be detected in immature seeds when the zzso were incubated with zzso acid zzso demonstrating that both genes are zzso zzso However, examination of the zzso upstream region does not reveal any extensive zzso suggesting that regulation of the two genes zzso In zzso zzso with a zzso probe demonstrated that the expression of this gene is essentially located in the zzso zzso of the zzso and axis of the dry seed as well as in the zzso and outer layers of the zzso in the zzso zzso
