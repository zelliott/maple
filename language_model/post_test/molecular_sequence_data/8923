zzso in the human zzso zzso are implicated in zzso diseases, zzso zzso and zzso An efficient and simple mechanism for zzso deleterious zzso DNA zzso zzso has zzso remained zzso Here, we report that a zzso zzso sequence from the zzso zzso the zzso component of the human zzso P zzso appended to a zzso zzso directs the import of the zzso zzso fusion transcript into human zzso The methodology is effective for both zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The zzso import zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer of this hybrid zzso into the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso for zzso zzso such as the zzso of human zzso zzso protein zzso zzso contain regulatory sequences in their zzso region zzso that zzso zzso to the zzso outer zzso which is zzso to aid in protein zzso after zzso We show that for some zzso zzso such as zzso a zzso zzso sequence is not required for zzso import, whereas for corrective zzso zzso appending the zzso zzso sequence was essential for efficient zzso zzso into zzso In zzso functional defects in zzso zzso zzso translation and cell zzso were reversed in two human disease zzso Thus, this study indicates that a wide range of zzso can be targeted to zzso by appending a targeting sequence that interacts with zzso with or without a zzso zzso zzso providing an zzso general approach for overcoming zzso genetic zzso
