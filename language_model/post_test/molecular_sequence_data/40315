Four zzso zzso in Lake zzso zzso Republic of the zzso were sampled in March 2007 to investigate the zzso distribution, and potential zzso role of zzso zzso We used zzso in zzso zzso with zzso deposition microscopic counts zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso of signature genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso for marine zzso group zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso ranged from 1 to zzso of total zzso zzso counts with zzso zzso at the zzso transition zone zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso community revealed a higher level of richness of zzso zzso zzso gene sequences (21 of the 28 operational zzso units zzso identified zzso over zzso ones (7 zzso zzso affiliated with the kingdom zzso were mainly recovered from the zzso water compartment and mostly grouped into zzso lineages zzso and zzso In turn, zzso zzso were recovered throughout the sampled zzso waters zzso to zzso zzso with clear zzso segregation along the transition from zzso to zzso water zzso Thus, whereas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were mainly assigned to the zzso zzso group, the zzso from the zzso transition and above belonged to zzso groups zzso and zzso two lineages containing most of the zzso representatives known so zzso The zzso vertical distribution of both zzso and nitrate zzso and the copy numbers of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes suggest the potential implication of zzso in zzso processes occurring in the zzso waters of the zzso
