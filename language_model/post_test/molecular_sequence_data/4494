zzso zzso is an important mechanism for regulation of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of several zzso by a number of different zzso and this may contribute to the toxic effects of zzso on cells, particularly zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso II on protein zzso contains an zzso zzso which might hypothetically be involved in mediation or zzso of zzso of protein zzso We have studied the ability of zzso peptides to zzso the effects of zzso using zzso of a zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso A as a model zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased the activity of the zzso zzso of protein zzso A by zzso A synthetic zzso zzso which zzso part of zzso II on the protein zzso family was partially able to prevent the zzso zzso Similar effects were not observed with two other zzso in which zzso had been replaced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso completely prevented the zzso effect of 50 zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso did not have this zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be equivalent in their ability to prevent the zzso zzso These data support the notion that binding of zzso to zzso may play a role in the mediation and/or zzso of zzso zzso
