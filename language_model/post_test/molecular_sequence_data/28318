zzso mapping by Southern analysis of DNA from zzso cell hybrids is often unsuccessful when only zzso zzso are zzso zzso is a putative zzso zzso that is zzso related to the zzso virus 40 large tumor zzso By using the zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso we have identified zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of human and mouse DNA fragments amplified with these zzso revealed length differences that allowed us to identify the human zzso Application of this technique to DNA from zzso zzso cell hybrids and cell lines derived from them by zzso gene transfer allowed us to map zzso to the zzso part of the long arm of zzso zzso
