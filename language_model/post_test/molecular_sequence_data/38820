zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso factors, is required for development of the zzso and is implicated in the zzso of zzso hormone zzso In this report we describe a novel gene product, zzso that selectively interacts with zzso and the closely related zzso factor, zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that contains seven zzso repeats near the zzso zzso and a putative nuclear zzso signal and does not contain other recognizable zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso manner with the highest zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso specifically binds to zzso and zzso with high affinity both in zzso and in zzso zzso has much lower affinity or no zzso affinity for other zzso zzso An expression zzso for a zzso of zzso containing the zzso domain was shown to reduce expression of zzso reporter zzso The ability of the zzso domain of zzso to alter reporter gene activity as well as the zzso expression and the specificity of zzso binding to zzso factors suggest a possible role in modulating the zzso activity of specific zzso zzso
