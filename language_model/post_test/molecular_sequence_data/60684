zzso is one of the most common zzso and can be found in a localized and a systemic zzso The precursor protein is an zzso light chain which as zzso in both localized and systemic zzso shows the same pattern of fragmentation and changes of primary zzso In this work it is shown that that there is a difference between localized and systemic zzso in respect to accompanying giant cells which constantly are found associated with zzso deposits in localized zzso In addition, giant cells were found together with zzso deposits in zzso zzso of some cases of systemic zzso Based on these findings and electron microscopic studies, it is discussed whether the giant cells actively participate in zzso zzso formation by zzso and modification of the precursor protein or the giant cells are part of a foreign body zzso Included in this work are two new cases of localized lung zzso I) and zzso zzso I) zzso
