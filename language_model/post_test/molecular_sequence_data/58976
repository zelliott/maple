In zzso cells, zzso zzso of the zzso family function as regulators at defined steps of zzso transport in zzso and zzso Here we report on the isolation and characterization of two genes zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso members of the zzso family exhibiting zzso sequence zzso Whereas the disruption of one of the two genes was zzso neutral, the disruption of both zzso and zzso led to zzso zzso of zzso zzso or of a short-lived zzso in a zzso zzso background led to a massive zzso of zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso and defects in zzso protein zzso Similar zzso were observed in a zzso zzso zzso at 30 zzso after shift to the zzso zzso According to zzso zzso a significant part of zzso appeared to be located in zzso membrane zzso In accordance with this, indirect zzso using zzso zzso zzso gave a zzso zzso similar to that observed with zzso zzso From the zzso zzso observed in zzso and zzso zzso it seems likely that the two zzso are involved in zzso transport or in the formation of transport zzso at the most zzso zzso zzso
