Studies with the zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown that the zzso zzso or an zzso closely associated with it, can retain and degrade membrane proteins zzso The observation that only three zzso zzso and zzso of the six zzso beta gamma delta zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are susceptible to zzso implies that structural features within the zzso proteins mark them for zzso The zzso beta chain is zzso in the zzso zzso and, in this study, we have started to define the zzso of the protein that make it susceptible to zzso The experiments show that the zzso anchor and short zzso zzso tail of the protein contain a dominant zzso of zzso When these zzso were removed from the beta chain, the protein became resistant to zzso Even though the resulting zzso of the beta chain lacked a zzso anchor, it was not zzso by cells and was retained in the zzso zzso We conclude that retention in the zzso zzso alone does not lead to zzso The results suggest that structural features within the membrane anchor of the protein zzso the beta chain to zzso This was confirmed by replacing the membrane anchor of the zzso 2 zzso zzso a protein that was stable within the zzso pathway, with that of the zzso beta zzso The unmodified zzso zzso was transported efficiently to the surface of cells, and an zzso zzso construct was zzso zzso into the culture zzso When the membrane anchor of the zzso zzso was replaced with that of the zzso beta chain, the zzso was unable to reach the zzso apparatus and was zzso zzso
