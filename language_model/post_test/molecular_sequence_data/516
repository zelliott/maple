zzso and zzso cells have the regulated zzso zzso zzso in which precursor proteins undergo zzso processing by zzso zzso zzso 1/3 or 2 to generate zzso zzso Although motifs for zzso processing have been described zzso where zzso zzso 0, 2, 4, or zzso actual processing sites cannot be predicted from zzso acid sequences zzso We hypothesized that discovery of zzso peptides would be facilitated by zzso identifying signal zzso zzso sites and processing zzso However, in zzso and in zzso zzso degradation, which is widely recognized in zzso often zzso processing site zzso To obtain sequence information about peptides generated in the zzso on a large scale, we applied a brief zzso stimulus (2 zzso to cultured zzso cells and analyzed peptides released into zzso using zzso Of note, zzso of the 400 identified peptides arose from 19 precursor proteins known to be processed in the zzso including nine zzso hormone and zzso zzso seven zzso zzso and three processing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In total, zzso peptides were zzso enough to predict processing sites in that they have signal sequence zzso sites, PC consensus sites, or zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso sites identified here were previously proved to be generated by zzso Thus, our approach helps to predict processing sites of zzso precursor proteins and will zzso the identification of unknown zzso peptides hidden in precursor zzso
