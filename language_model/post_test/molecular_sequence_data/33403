zzso of cell lines is the prerequisite for all in zzso research, but literature on the stability of protein expression over passages is zzso zzso of specific stability zzso zzso and zzso may not provide full information on this zzso It was the aim of the study to test protein level fluctuations in a human zzso fluid stem cell line from passages 5, 7, 11, and zzso While zzso cell cycle, zzso rate, and 10 markers for characterization of the cell line remained unchanged zzso out at passages 5 and zzso cell volume was increased at passage zzso zzso protein fluctuations were observed for zzso zzso guidance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso channel, and zzso at passages 5, 7, 11, and zzso zzso the use of this zzso zzso screen, checking protein stability for the characterization of cell lines in addition to corresponding published zzso is proposed, in particular when experiments are run over several zzso
