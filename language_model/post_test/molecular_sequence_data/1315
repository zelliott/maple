zzso an accessory gene product of zzso is incorporated into cells when added to the culture zzso Via such function zzso has been shown to zzso a protein into cells that is expressed as a zzso protein with zzso The domain required for protein zzso however, remained to be zzso Here we identified a sequence encompassing zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso that enables nuclear trafficking of zzso When chemically zzso zzso was added to the culture medium of human zzso blood zzso zzso cells, most cells became positive for the incorporated zzso Furthermore, zzso proteins zzso with the zzso were efficiently zzso and transported to regions corresponding to the zzso zzso of zzso protein was observed within a few hours after addition of the zzso independent of cellular zzso Although it is well known that zzso zzso has a zzso activity, zzso was more active than zzso zzso for trafficking proteins into zzso Taking together with results from zzso analysis revealing that more than zzso of zzso cells were positive for zzso zzso after treatment of zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso zzso zzso directly into the zzso
