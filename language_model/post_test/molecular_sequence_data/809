zzso zzso virus zzso is a zzso virus that causes an zzso syndrome in the domestic zzso For viral entry and infection, fusion between the virus and the cell membrane is the critical process and this process is zzso by an envelope zzso zzso We have identified fusion zzso peptides from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the original sequences using zzso motifs revealed the interactive zzso of zzso Comparative analysis of zzso peptides derived from four zzso strains demonstrated that the interactive surface of the zzso zzso zzso peptides provides the highest affinity of all the zzso strains zzso
