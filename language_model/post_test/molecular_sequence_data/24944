zzso zzso and zzso studies have established a new function for an zzso zzso zzso guiding and inserting a copper zzso into the active site of a target zzso Studies of these new proteins have revealed a fundamental aspect of copper zzso namely the vast zzso of the zzso for copper zzso This finding framed the zzso energetic, and structural aspects of zzso copper trafficking zzso One hallmark of the copper zzso is the similarity of the protein fold between the zzso and its target zzso The surface zzso presented by each partner, however, are quite different, and some initial findings concerning the zzso of these zzso have led to zzso zzso The copper zzso appear to lower the zzso barrier for metal transfer into specific zzso zzso The manner in which they facilitate metal zzso appears to involve a zzso of the metal donor and zzso sites in close proximity to one zzso Although the intimate mechanism is still open, it appears that a low zzso barrier for metal transfer is achieved by a network of zzso zzso and hydrogen bonding interactions in the vicinity of the zzso site zzso
