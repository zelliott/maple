The problem of identifying downstream targets of zzso zzso remains a challenge despite technological advances in zzso and zzso A recent approach involves the generation of zzso zzso that can uniquely use zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso design, zzso of several protein zzso zzso members have been zzso robust and general methods are needed, however, for altering the zzso specificity of the remaining zzso in the zzso Here we demonstrate the application of a new zzso display technique for direct functional selection to the identification of a zzso zzso zzso with the ability to use zzso Our method zzso in five rounds of selection, a zzso identical to the best zzso zzso zzso found to zzso In addition, we isolate from a larger library of zzso zzso a zzso clone capable of using many different zzso zzso This approach to engineering zzso zzso combined with others, will facilitate the mapping of zzso targets of any zzso in the zzso
