zzso zzso zzso and its wild relatives harbor genetic diversity that yields zzso variation in fruit chemistry that could be exploited to identify genes regulating their synthesis and zzso zzso for example, are essential in plant and animal nutrition, and are the visual indicators of zzso for many zzso including zzso Whereas zzso synthesis is well zzso factors regulating flux through the zzso are poorly understood at the molecular zzso To exploit the impact of tomato genetic diversity on zzso zzso zzso zzso lines were used as a source of defined natural variation and as a resource for the identification of candidate regulatory zzso zzso fruits were analyzed for numerous fruit zzso and zzso profiles generated using a 12,000 zzso zzso zzso analysis between zzso content and gene expression profiles revealed zzso zzso zzso To narrow the pool, zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed 38 zzso One candidate for impact on zzso and zzso zzso was functionally zzso zzso revealing that it indeed influences zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso by zzso enhanced both zzso and zzso levels during fruit zzso demonstrating an important role for zzso in zzso zzso the zzso and zzso synthesis zzso
