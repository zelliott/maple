We have zzso the activity of the negative element in the late 3' untranslated region of the zzso human zzso type 1 zzso zzso in a panel of zzso cells, of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity was cell line zzso zzso of the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have been shown previously to interact specifically with the zzso negative zzso element revealed that low levels of the zzso protein in the zzso fraction correlated with high zzso activity of the zzso element, whereas cell lines displaying low zzso activity contained high levels of zzso in the zzso These results suggested that the zzso protein has a positive effect on zzso late gene zzso
