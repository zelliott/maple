zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso the formation of a number of protein complexes that are important in cell signaling and zzso zzso The zzso domain is recognized by short zzso zzso motifs which adopt left-handed zzso zzso on zzso In order to examine molecular zzso of the zzso zzso interaction, an zzso zzso zzso was developed to observe binding of zzso to zzso zzso of growth factor zzso binding protein 2 zzso The zzso makes use of zzso zzso fusion proteins of zzso and fragments of zzso immobilized onto zzso of standard zzso zzso zzso zzso binding is monitored zzso and the measured zzso is zzso to zzso zzso The interactions is specific for the zzso portion of the fusion zzso and zzso binds zzso to zzso fragments containing an zzso zzso Competitive binding zzso with a synthetic zzso which zzso the zzso region of zzso yielded results that are consistent with previous zzso zzso was examined in the presence of a number of peptides containing the consensus sequence zzso in the presence of zzso activity zzso and in the presence of plant zzso that lack the zzso binding zzso zzso suggest that the specificity of the zzso interaction is zzso
