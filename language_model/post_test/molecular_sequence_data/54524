zzso zzso virus zzso zzso lacks the characteristic zzso zzso motifs that are essential for various steps of the zzso replication cycle, such as zzso packaging, reverse transcription, zzso integration, and viral zzso Instead, it contains three zzso boxes zzso zzso in its C zzso that zzso represent a functional zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso system, with zzso zzso zzso packaging and structural protein translation, to analyze the effects of deletion and various substitution zzso within each zzso box on particle release, zzso protein zzso zzso packaging, DNA content, zzso particle zzso and zzso zzso The degree of viral particle release by all zzso was similar to that of the wild zzso Only minimal effects on Pol zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso activity, and zzso viral zzso packaging were zzso In contrast, zzso DNA content and zzso were drastically reduced for all deletion zzso and were zzso for all zzso substitution zzso Furthermore, zzso box I zzso had significant changes in particle zzso and zzso box II zzso lacked the typical nuclear zzso pattern of zzso zzso Finally, it could be shown that zzso boxes I and III, but not zzso box II, can functionally complement each zzso It therefore appears that, similar to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso boxes are important for zzso zzso zzso reverse transcription, and zzso zzso as well as for particle zzso
