zzso analysis of bovine zzso fluid proteins during early pregnancy has the potential to expose protein species indicative of both the overall health of the zzso environment and fetal zzso zzso In this study, we examined the differential abundance of bovine zzso fluid proteins zzso zzso zzso from naturally conceived, in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear transfer zzso zzso at days 45 and 90 of zzso In day 45 zzso fluid zzso samples, an zzso cluster of low molecular weight ( approximately zzso zzso low zzso (between zzso and zzso pH zzso protein species was increased in three of four zzso samples zzso increase in protein spot volumes compared to zzso These proteins were identified as zzso of the bovine zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso mass fingerprint and zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso recognition protein and zzso (or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso were also significantly increased in the corresponding zzso zzso In two of four zzso zzso samples, a zzso increase in zzso protein spot volumes were zzso No zzso abundance levels of individual protein species were observed in zzso fluid samples, or in day 90 zzso zzso zzso Identification of unique protein species present in the normal bovine zzso zzso at day 45 is also zzso
