The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso mediates the growth and differentiation of zzso and zzso from bone zzso zzso and regulates biological functions expressed by mature cells of these zzso In order to isolate a bovine zzso zzso a zzso library, generated from the zzso bovine T cell line, was screened with a human zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone was isolated with an insert of zzso zzso that would zzso a protein of 143 zzso zzso with a predicted zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibits a high degree of sequence zzso with mouse and human zzso at both the zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid sequences from the three species indicates that the bovine zzso precursor contains a putative 17 zzso acid signal zzso zzso of which would yield a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was inserted into a zzso expression zzso and zzso into zzso monkey kidney zzso zzso active bovine zzso was zzso as judged by a bovine bone zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso was zzso active in both human and mouse bone zzso proliferation zzso In contrast, human zzso was zzso active on bovine but not zzso mouse bone zzso cells and mouse zzso was only active on zzso bone zzso zzso
