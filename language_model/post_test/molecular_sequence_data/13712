zzso exchange in zzso is thought to be zzso and insensitive to the membrane zzso This basic concept has been challenged by recent reports of zzso currents in the turtle colon zzso zzso and Dawson, 1992, zzso To determine the zzso of zzso zzso we used the zzso patch clamp technique combined with zzso zzso of zzso pH zzso In zzso zzso which were found by zzso to express the zzso zzso of the zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso exchange caused a zzso zzso and activated an outward zzso whereas forward zzso zzso exchange produced a zzso zzso and reduced a zzso outward zzso The currents mirrored the changes in zzso were strictly dependent on the presence of a zzso zzso and were zzso blocked by zzso However, the currents were seemingly not carried by the zzso zzso itself, but were instead due to a shift in the zzso dependence of a zzso zzso zzso This was supported by zzso of the reversal potential zzso of tail zzso which identified zzso zzso as the charge zzso During zzso exchange, zzso changed along with the measured changes in zzso (by zzso zzso Moreover, the current and zzso exchange could be zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso blocked the currents without altering zzso zzso In Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, which lack the zzso zzso zzso exchange produced zzso changes that were not accompanied by zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in zzso cells zzso with either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso indicating that exchange through these zzso is zzso In all the zzso tested, the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso changes were independent of the holding zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso In cells endowed with a zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso of zzso exchange can zzso a zzso zzso zzso The currents reported in turtle colon might be due to a similar zzso between the zzso and a zzso zzso
