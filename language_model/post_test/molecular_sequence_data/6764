zzso tracts are widespread in zzso zzso and have the potential to form a number of unusual structures including zzso Two such zzso which could form zzso with each other but not with themselves, were cloned into a zzso at separate zzso Upon lowering the zzso zzso open circular and relaxed zzso molecules formed a number of novel structures that were observed on zzso gels and directly by electron zzso In open circles a stable join was formed between the two zzso tracts giving rise to molecules resembling zzso zzso and zzso which collectively are termed zzso The structure was stable at pH 8 and contains a zzso region that was sensitive to zzso zzso Thus, there is no apparent zzso impediment to the formation of zzso zzso in circular zzso These structures may be important for gene regulation and zzso zzso
