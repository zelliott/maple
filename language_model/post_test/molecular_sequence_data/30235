An zzso synthetic promoter was constructed with zzso which zzso to two regions of the promoter of the human zzso gene zzso that interact zzso with nuclear zzso zzso we cloned a direct repeat sequence that was necessary for zzso regulation and that zzso with a 55 zzso nuclear zzso zzso to the direct repeat we introduced a 45 zzso long zzso located at zzso in the native zzso promoter that zzso zzso with an 80 zzso nuclear zzso zzso after zzso of these plasmids showed that the direct repeat is necessary for zzso control and the zzso zzso by itself has no effect on zzso activity while in conjunction with the direct repeat it decreased the zzso and zzso zzso activity of the reporter promoter in human zzso
