zzso zzso is one of the zzso bacteria important in industrial zzso zzso Some of the surface components of this zzso are probably involved in adaptation to their zzso environment and in zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized zzso the gene coding for the major outer membrane protein from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein has 382 zzso acids and a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso forms an zzso structure of about 120 zzso that zzso into the zzso (40 zzso by heating in the presence of sodium zzso zzso The degree of identity of zzso zzso acid sequence to zzso from zzso was only zzso Nevertheless, multiple alignments of this sequence with those from several zzso zzso showed several important features zzso in the zzso zzso surface zzso such as the approximate locations of 16 zzso beta zzso eight zzso including a large external zzso loop, and eight turns which allowed us to propose a putative zzso zzso zzso structure for the zzso These results together with the previously known capacity of zzso to form zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso strongly support its role as a zzso in this zzso zzso zzso Some characteristics of the zzso zzso such as the presence of a putative zzso loop with an estimated zzso point of zzso allow us to speculate that this can be the result of an adaptation of the zzso zzso zzso to prevent free movement of zzso across its outer zzso
