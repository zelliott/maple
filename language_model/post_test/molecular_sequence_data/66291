The zzso repeat zzso a zzso structural motif of class I viral fusion zzso is responsible for the formation of a zzso bundle structure during the envelope fusion zzso The insect zzso F protein is a newly found zzso virus envelope fusion protein which possesses common features to class I fusion zzso such as zzso zzso and the presence of an zzso open fusion zzso and multiple zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Similar to many zzso viral fusion zzso a zzso zzso zzso motif is predicted in this zzso region zzso to the fusion zzso in zzso F zzso To facilitate our understanding of the functional role of this zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso F protein zzso processing, and viral zzso key zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso expression system, we demonstrated that all zzso F proteins incorporated into zzso virus, indicating that zzso zzso did not affect zzso trafficking of zzso zzso zzso zzso was not affected by any of the zzso zzso however, the zzso bridging and zzso zzso patterns were partly zzso Single zzso in zzso showed that the three zzso zzso were critical for F zzso and the rescue of zzso zzso Our results support the view that the zzso zzso zzso domain is important to safeguard the proper zzso zzso and zzso of zzso F zzso
