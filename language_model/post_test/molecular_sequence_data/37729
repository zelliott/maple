Members of the nuclear zzso zzso are thought to activate zzso by recruitment of one or more recently identified zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that both zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso and steroid zzso zzso zzso are required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso integrated reporter genes by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso To examine zzso interactions between nuclear receptors and specific zzso in living cells, these proteins were zzso with zzso zzso and yellow zzso zzso of the green fluorescent zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso from the zzso to the zzso indicated interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso or its zzso domain exhibited rapid zzso zzso to zzso nuclear zzso interaction zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain, unlike zzso also exhibited some zzso interaction with zzso in zzso cells that was abolished by the zzso zzso tamoxifen or zzso zzso of zzso by tamoxifen but not zzso could be reversed by zzso whereas zzso zzso could not be inhibited by either zzso indicating that zzso effects can show varying degrees of zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso activities of the zzso and zzso require concurrent or sequential recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
