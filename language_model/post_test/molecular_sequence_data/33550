zzso zzso zzso with high expression of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso Comparative zzso sequencing analysis revealed that all of these zzso have a zzso in the zzso zzso The disruption of zzso by genetic engineering also resulted in increased expression of zzso zzso extension and gel mobility shift analyses showed that the zzso protein binds directly to the promoter region of zzso Our results indicate that the transition state regulator zzso together with zzso and zzso zzso regulates zzso production in zzso zzso
