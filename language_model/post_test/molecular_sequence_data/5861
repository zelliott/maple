zzso zzso repeat zzso sequence often appears in zzso zzso including zzso protein and zzso zzso Its expansion is associated with six genetic disorders in zzso To identify novel zzso genes expressed in mouse brain, a brain zzso library was screened using an zzso zzso Eight clones were novel mouse genes and they were zzso on both zzso The size of the cloned DNA ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The number of the zzso repeats in the clones ranged from 6 to zzso The zzso of the clones were analyzed for open reading frames and the zzso sequences were used for a zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso one zzso shared 13 consecutive identical zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso zzso zzso identity in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso region of rat zzso common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All the 8 clones were originated from mouse DNA as judged by Southern zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso The expression of the clones in mouse brain was addressed by zzso and 4 clones showed specific zzso
