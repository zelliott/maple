The zzso zzso zzso viruses belonging to the zzso family, have a high genetic zzso due to the absence of the efficient zzso and post zzso repair activities associated with the zzso zzso In the present work, we studied the genetic and the zzso zzso of ECHO virus types 11 zzso and 30 zzso which are the most isolated zzso zzso in clinical and environmental zzso We established on the 3' end of the zzso zzso consensus sequences of E11 and zzso by alignment of 67 E11 and 247 zzso published sequences in zzso Our results of sequences comparison showed that the majority of the zzso sites are situated on the third zzso of the zzso These zzso were without consequence on the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso Thus, E11 and zzso have a high genetic zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso but a relative zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso zzso between E11 and zzso was obtained by the alignment of the corresponding zzso acids sequences relative to the zzso part of the zzso zzso Two discriminating parts were zzso probably representing zzso sites for zzso zzso
