It has been shown recently that two zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso type E zzso gene closely related to that of zzso zzso type zzso In this study, we show that this gene is located on a large zzso in the two zzso zzso zzso strains and is absent in 18 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the 230 zzso upstream and the zzso zzso downstream of the zzso coding sequence are not present in either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest a zzso gene transfer from zzso zzso E to originally zzso zzso zzso zzso
