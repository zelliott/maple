During a zzso two hybrid screen of a zzso zzso library using the zzso protein zzso as zzso we isolated a full-length zzso zzso a novel zzso protein zzso zzso The protein is composed of 162 zzso acids and contains four consensus zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso DNA using zzso specific for the zzso sequence resulted in the isolation of a gene zzso a different zzso protein of 162 zzso acids zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso Southern zzso analysis confirmed the presence of two closely related genes in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed at the same stages of development as zzso zzso In addition, both novel proteins bind zzso and interact with zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso
