In this paper, we describe the characterization of zzso a novel zzso protein related to zzso that functions as an upstream zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, stimulation of the zzso zzso signaling zzso with either zzso or zzso growth factor zzso resulted in the zzso of an zzso zzso fusion protein to the cell membrane and induced the formation of zzso and zzso In contrast to full-length zzso expression of the zzso zzso domain as a zzso fusion protein zzso induced zzso zzso including stress fiber formation in zzso cells, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso indicating that it was zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was strongly enhanced in zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso domain while zzso formation, membrane zzso and stress fiber formation could be inhibited by the zzso of the zzso domain with dominant negative zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso This indicated that zzso acts upstream of the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso In zzso zzso specifically zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting a direct role for zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The ability of zzso to both stimulate zzso zzso and bind to zzso zzso suggests a role for zzso in regulating cell shape, zzso and zzso
