The movement of zzso across plasma zzso is modulated by facilitated zzso zzso zzso These proteins are the products of two closely related zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso zzso By zzso library screening and zzso artificial zzso zzso sequencing, we have determined the structure of the mouse zzso zzso The gene is zzso zzso in zzso contains 24 zzso and has 2 distinct zzso zzso the zzso of the gene is the zzso promoter that regulates zzso of zzso and zzso The second promoter, termed zzso is present in zzso 13 and regulates zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the activity of a zzso zzso promoter construct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso relative light units zzso zzso and a zzso zzso promoter construct zzso (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso above that in zzso zzso Interestingly, only the zzso promoter contained consensus sequences for zzso and deletion of these elements abolished zzso zzso zzso the zzso of culture medium from 300 to 600 zzso zzso with zzso caused a significant increase (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso promoter activity but had no effect on the zzso zzso A zzso zzso was identified in zzso and is suggested to be responsible for zzso this zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were increased in zzso mice compared with control animals, indicating that the activities of both promoters are likely to be elevated during prolonged zzso
