zzso zzso zzso the first committed step of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso This zzso zzso is an inviting target for the control of a number of diseases, because the zzso involved in this cycle have been identified in many pathogens including zzso zzso and zzso 

As part of a zzso of rational drug design the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its complex with zzso and a zzso zzso have been solved to zzso A resolution using X-ray zzso Each zzso comprises two zzso one of which adopts a folding pattern highly reminiscent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso between zzso observed in the three-dimensional structure, involving zzso towards the C zzso implies that zzso assembly involves considerable flexibility in this part of the zzso 

zzso zzso analysis together with the pattern of sequence conservation has led to the identification of both the zzso and metal binding sites and implicates the zzso end of the TIM barrel as the active site, which is consistent with studies of other zzso with this zzso Two zzso regions of the zzso chain lie close to the active site, one of which includes a critical zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso similarities between zzso zzso and both zzso zzso and zzso belonging to the zzso zzso suggest possible relationships in aspects of the zzso
