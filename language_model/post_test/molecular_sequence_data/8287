Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed from their respective zzso in zzso coli as zzso zzso in which a portion of the zzso membrane anchor sequence was replaced with a modified sequence derived from zzso zzso For zzso and zzso removal of the extraneous zzso sequence allowed the successful expression of zzso that were zzso in its zzso The levels of expression varied from 180 to 1500 zzso of culture and the addition of zzso acid to the culture media increased the amount of zzso zzso zzso for several of these zzso zzso to zzso The zzso properties of the modified human zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli were zzso with previously published data for several marker zzso including zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso the formation of 16 zzso The rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of 17 zzso and 16 zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso at rates that were similar to or greater than that of zzso zzso This work has identified important factors required for the high-level expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The availability of these zzso will facilitate detailed kinetic zzso for known and yet to be identified zzso
