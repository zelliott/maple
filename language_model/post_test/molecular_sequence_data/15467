During studies of moderately zzso strains of zzso from zzso soda lakes, we found a novel group of bacteria related to zzso zzso with salt zzso at zzso g zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso gene sequences of strains from soda lakes in zzso Egypt and zzso revealed separation of the group of new zzso from other zzso species, including the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the new zzso form a homogeneous group at the species level, but at the same time are distinct from related species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The new zzso are considered to be strains of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the novel species are zzso a and zzso of the zzso series with zzso and derivatives zzso together with small amounts of lycopene and zzso Gas zzso are formed by most of the zzso particularly in media containing zzso extract zzso g zzso and zzso zzso g zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirmed the assignment of the strains to the zzso zzso and in particular the close relationship to zzso zzso The novel species zzso zzso is found in soda lakes separated by great geographical distances and is an zzso and zzso zzso that zzso salt zzso up to zzso g zzso zzso
