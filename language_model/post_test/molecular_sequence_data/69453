A unique group of large zzso viruses that zzso a zzso green zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from freshwater sources in zzso These viruses contain a linear zzso DNA zzso zzso with hairpin zzso A physical map was constructed for the zzso DNA of zzso zzso virus isolated in zzso zzso 1) by zzso gel zzso of restriction zzso The zzso sequences around both zzso of the zzso DNA revealed the presence of zzso terminal repeats zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso to the zzso unique sequence elements of 10 to 20 zzso were directly repeated 20 to 30 times in tandem zzso Several copies of these repeat elements were deleted in virus zzso that were occasionally generated from Chlorella cells that were in a putative zzso carrier zzso These repeats might represent a hot spot of zzso in the zzso zzso
