The identification of the zzso III zzso site in the 3' end of the zzso zzso inhibitor 1 zzso gene and a simple method to identify the zzso III zzso rapidly in the zzso gene using zzso is zzso The zzso III restriction site was identified by restriction site mapping and sequence analysis from a zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA was isolated from individual human zzso cords and a zzso zzso of the human zzso gene was amplified by zzso zzso of the zzso products were zzso with zzso III and analyzed by zzso gel zzso The presence of two fragments, zzso and zzso zzso was identified, and they were designated as zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso method is considerably less time consuming than the conventional DNA zzso using Southern zzso zzso To ensure that this new method identified the same zzso zzso as previously identified by zzso III restriction zzso length zzso zzso samples were simultaneously zzso by zzso and Southern zzso zzso Both methods identified the same zzso III zzso in all the samples, confirming the reliability of this new zzso method for the rapid identification of the zzso III zzso in the human zzso zzso
