The zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso sequences were zzso The zzso gene encodes a specific zzso zzso and the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso The genes have overlapping coding regions, and Northern zzso zzso analysis indicated an zzso zzso The translation of the second zzso zzso was strongly dependent on the translation of the first zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso by zzso and the zzso molecules appear to be zzso and zzso When zzso and zzso were added together, a zzso repression was zzso The regulation of expression was at the level of transcription, and we propose that a zzso zzso control mechanism similar to the one suggested for the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso was reduced when zzso served as the sole nitrogen zzso Under these conditions, the level of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced more than zzso The zzso zzso level was completely zzso in a zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso Although the regulation of the expression of the zzso zzso was found to be affected by the nitrogen source, it was normal in a zzso zzso zzso This result suggests the existence of different zzso pathways for repression of the zzso of the zzso zzso and the induction of zzso zzso
