The zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (32 zzso and zzso (35 zzso were previously zzso Here we present results of the analysis of gene expression of these viruses at different time points after infection of the host cell, zzso zzso and of the mapping of zzso start zzso zzso of both zzso starts simultaneously at multiple sites spread over the total length of the zzso and from both zzso The earliest time point when viral transcripts could be detected in cells was 30 zzso after zzso At this time point all the viral zzso except one, were zzso Many genes were clustered and appeared to be transcribed as zzso zzso Although the coat zzso gene was initially also transcribed as a zzso messenger, an abundant zzso transcript of this gene was detected 2 to 3 h after infection, just before assembly of viral zzso The expression of a single zzso adjacent to the coat protein zzso was zzso at the late phase of infection, suggesting that it might be involved in specific processing and zzso of the coat protein zzso Start sites of 13 transcripts from the zzso zzso have been mapped by primer extension, and promoter sequences have been zzso Similar to host zzso these viral promoters all contain potential binding sites for the zzso zzso factors zzso binding protein and zzso factor zzso In addition, most of them contain a zzso consensus element, suggesting the involvement of alternative zzso zzso
