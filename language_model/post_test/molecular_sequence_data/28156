The zzso of the integral membrane protein Cai zzso A immunity zzso which is required to protect producing cells from the zzso zzso A, was zzso using zzso to alkaline zzso The properties of these fusion proteins support the model for Cai zzso previously proposed on theoretical zzso The protein was found to contain four zzso sequences and its zzso and zzso regions were found to be directed towards the zzso zzso zzso and sequence comparisons between zzso zzso zzso B immunity zzso and zzso zzso N immunity zzso were carried out to determine the functional regions of zzso The possible roles of the various regions of Cai in its protective function and in its zzso organization are zzso
