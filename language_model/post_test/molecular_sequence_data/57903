The protein zzso zzso zzso bond formation in the zzso of zzso zzso It has only two zzso zzso that are separated in the sequence by two other zzso and are shown to form a zzso bond zzso Chemical modification studies demonstrate that only one of the zzso zzso has an accessible zzso group in the reduced zzso zzso and kinetic characterization of zzso exchange between zzso and zzso showed that the zzso zzso bond was zzso more zzso than a normal protein zzso Similarly, the mixed zzso between the accessible zzso zzso and zzso was zzso more zzso than zzso The overall equilibrium constant for zzso zzso bond formation from zzso was only 8 zzso zzso zzso These properties indicate that zzso zzso is a potent zzso and zzso suited for generating protein zzso zzso zzso bonds generally increase the zzso of folded zzso when the folded zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso bond of zzso was so unstable in the folded state that its stability increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso when the protein zzso This implies that the zzso bond zzso the folded zzso of zzso This was confirmed by demonstrating that the reduced protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso more stable than that with the zzso zzso
