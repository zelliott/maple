The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso G has been cloned in zzso coli zzso alpha zzso via zzso or zzso and then transferred into zzso zzso zzso via zzso with substantial amplification of the expressed zzso The gene has the information for the synthesis of a 255 zzso acid zzso the zzso terminal region of which has the characteristic features of a signal zzso The primary structure as deduced from zzso sequencing confirms that previously determined by chemical methods except for the occurrence of an zzso instead of zzso at position 1 and an additional Ala immediately downstream of zzso
