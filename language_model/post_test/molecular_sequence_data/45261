The correct zzso of germ cells during zzso is a fundamental step in life that ensures the existence of the next zzso Although different species display various cellular modes of generating germ cells, the product of the zzso gene proves to be a reliable marker of primordial germ cells in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, I report the isolation of the zzso zzso from the red flour zzso zzso zzso named zzso and describe its zzso its zzso zzso and its expression pattern during early zzso Unlike in zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso distributed in the egg, zzso zzso gradually accumulates at the zzso egg pole during zzso zzso Shortly before zzso zzso zzso marks a group of zzso cells at the zzso zzso In the germ zzso a zzso group of zzso cells zzso to the growth zone at the zzso end of the zzso These zzso cells likely represent the primordial germ cells that have not been described in zzso prior to zzso zzso At the beginning of germ growth, a small band of zzso cells starts to migrate along the zzso side of the growth zzso zzso zzso zzso during further germ band zzso In contrast to zzso zzso transcripts cannot be detected in the germ cells within the zzso zzso after zzso is zzso
