The zzso zzso form of zzso zzso results from zzso in zzso a protein required for zzso zzso modification that is also a component of the zzso zzso We have previously found that expression of an internal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso patient zzso 

Here, we have generated zzso mouse cell lines expressing the most frequent zzso found in zzso patients, zzso and study the effect of expressing the zzso zzso or zzso zzso on zzso activity by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression by zzso Point zzso in zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso increases zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso levels, and leads to recovery of zzso zzso Point zzso in zzso zzso known to be highly zzso and crucial for the zzso activity of zzso abolished the effect of the zzso Recovery of zzso activity and increase in zzso levels were found when the zzso zzso zzso from bacteria was introduced into the zzso Moreover, zzso stability was also rescued by zzso of the zzso zzso 

These data indicate that zzso zzso either from a zzso zzso or as a zzso can reduces the zzso effects of zzso zzso and could form the basis of a novel therapeutic zzso
