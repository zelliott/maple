The correlation between zzso zzso an index of zzso zzso zzso with large-scale deletion zzso DNA zzso was investigated in a zzso study with a total of 50 zzso samples from zzso men, including 25 zzso donor as the control group and 25 zzso zzso patients as the case zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed according to World Health Organization zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of the seminal plasma and zzso were measured by zzso zzso A long-range zzso chain reaction zzso method was used for the analysis of multiple large-scale zzso deletions based in two areas of zzso The results showed that mean concentration of zzso in seminal plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of AT men was higher than in zzso patients, but the differences were not statistically zzso The products of zzso analysis showed multiple deletions of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso in both AT and control zzso Multiple deletions were also observed in zzso of AT patients and zzso of the control zzso Moreover, zzso level of the zzso in deleted zzso samples group was significantly higher than in zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicated a positive correlation between increased zzso levels and large-scale zzso deletions in human zzso It is suggested that zzso or other zzso stress factors might be zzso elements in zzso damage, effect on zzso zzso and zzso resulting in decline of fertility in zzso
