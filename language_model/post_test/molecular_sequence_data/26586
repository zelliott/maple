zzso were first identified in zzso systems in zzso Although numerous zzso were found and described since then, many aspects of their function and interactions remained zzso zzso zzso show different sorting pattern in zzso As one example, zzso is present in developing zzso but it is replaced by zzso in mature zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso contribute differently to the establishment of the functional features of the zzso zzso zzso We developed a method for the efficient zzso of zzso and zzso as zzso proteins using bacterial expression system and investigated their interactions with zzso We found that both zzso bind zzso zzso however, the binding of zzso was much stronger than that of zzso zzso and zzso modestly affected zzso assembly zzso in an opposite zzso zzso with the higher affinity of zzso it inhibited zzso filament zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso to other previously studied zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence the zzso zzso zzso This is a unique feature of zzso since so far it is the only known zzso supporting the activity of the zzso complex, indicating that zzso may zzso and work simultaneously with zzso complex in zzso zzso
