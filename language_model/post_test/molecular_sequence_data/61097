In the past few years a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which releases zzso from starch and zzso has been cloned and characterized from red algae and zzso zzso evidence indicates that the zzso degradation of starch and zzso also occurs in other zzso The present review focuses on the zzso and molecular aspects of eight known zzso zzso and their genes from red algae and zzso While the zzso acid sequence identity is zzso among the zzso zzso zzso from each of the zzso groups, the identity between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is only zzso zzso database searches disclosed that the zzso zzso have a clear identity of zzso with zzso of zzso zzso family 31, thus for the first time linking zzso from the class of zzso with that of zzso The alignment of zzso and zzso revealed seven zzso regions, three of which have been reported to be involved in zzso and zzso binding in zzso The shared zzso and inhibitor specificity and sequence similarity of zzso zzso with zzso suggest that related structural elements are involved in the two different zzso zzso
