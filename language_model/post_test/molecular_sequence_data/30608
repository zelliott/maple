The broad host range zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso protein zzso which is involved in the initiation of zzso replication by an zzso rolling zzso zzso was zzso in an zzso coli expression system and the protein was zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso protein showed that translation starts from the first zzso zzso which is preceded by an zzso zzso site zzso zzso protein has in zzso zzso and zzso activities on the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso protein binds to a DNA region that includes three direct repeats of 11 zzso zzso of replication of zzso could start by a zzso specific zzso introduced on the zzso coding zzso However, as a striking difference with other zzso zzso the zzso generated by zzso lies 86 zzso upstream from its binding zzso To explain the action of zzso at a distance, complex structures of the zzso zzso are zzso
