Four zzso of zzso salt zzso zzso have been zzso from the zzso of cells of zzso zzso strain zzso The four proteins were designated zzso A, B, C, and zzso They zzso from zzso zzso liquid zzso columns at zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso zzso They are zzso similar, except that the zzso of zzso D is about zzso lower than those of the other three zzso All four proteins consist of one or two zzso The peptides have molecular weights of 42,000 and 38,000 and are designated alpha and zzso zzso The approximate native molecular weights of zzso A, B, C, and D are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The native proteins are probably zzso the four zzso are the array of possible zzso combinations alpha 3, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 1 beta 2, and beta 3 for A, B, C, and D, zzso The two zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso A (all alpha zzso react in Western blots zzso only with proteins containing the alpha zzso such zzso raised against zzso D (all beta zzso react only with proteins containing the beta zzso The zzso acid compositions of the two peptides zzso This is the first report of a zzso that makes four zzso zzso
