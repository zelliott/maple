We have cloned a novel protein zzso from human zzso and named it zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso that contains a zzso zzso domain and double zzso zzso separated by a short zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso domain was a hybrid between those in zzso and zzso protein zzso indicating that zzso belongs to the zzso of the mixed lineage zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso was most similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Fan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 202, zzso which belong to the same zzso of the zzso zzso However, besides the zzso zzso domain and double zzso zzso there was no significant zzso with known zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso and exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed most strongly in the zzso with a pattern that differs from other zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso indicating the association of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The expressed zzso was detected primarily in the membrane zzso suggesting that zzso interacts with other cellular components in zzso
