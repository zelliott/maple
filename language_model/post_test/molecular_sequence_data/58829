zzso zzso from rat liver exists as large molecular weight zzso composed of at least four different zzso zzso two zzso of 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two associated proteins of 39 zzso and 41 zzso zzso and zzso The four proteins have remarkably similar zzso acid sequences and form a relatively large group of zzso zzso zzso however, have extra regions of 40 to 50 zzso acid zzso totally dissimilar to sequences of the zzso zzso and thus form a zzso zzso suppress the zzso activity of zzso They are very likely to be zzso zzso The relative amounts of the zzso of the four components vary with the zzso hence composition and properties of zzso zzso would also zzso Future studies on the physiology and pathology of zzso are critical in zzso of zzso of some types of zzso
