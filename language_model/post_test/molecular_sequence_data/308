In developing zzso the zzso zzso factor family regulates batteries of downstream genes to diversify serially repeated zzso Given zzso zzso bind a wider array of DNA binding sites in zzso than are regulated by the full-length protein in zzso regions outside the zzso must aid DNA site zzso Indeed, we find affinity for disparate DNA sequences varies less than zzso for the zzso isolated from the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso whereas for the full-length protein zzso affinity differs by more than zzso The rank order of preferred DNA sequences also zzso further demonstrating distinct DNA binding zzso The increased specificity of zzso can be partially attributed to the zzso region, which lies adjacent to the zzso and directly impacts binding zzso Each of three segments within zzso zzso zzso zzso the six zzso acids immediately zzso to this zzso and the eight zzso acids abutting the zzso zzso contribute to DNA zzso Combination of these regions zzso zzso DNA binding to further enhance zzso zzso the presence of the zzso motif in zzso zzso DNA binding only to zzso zzso binding sites, potentially functioning in zzso to prevent zzso zzso from binding and zzso zzso target zzso However, removal of the surrounding region allows the zzso motif to also inhibit binding to zzso recognition zzso Despite a modular domain design for zzso zzso these results suggest that multiple zzso protein regions form a network of regulatory interactions that coordinate zzso and zzso zzso Since most zzso regions are not zzso between zzso family members, these regulatory interactions have the potential to diversify binding by the highly zzso zzso zzso
