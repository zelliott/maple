When the zzso gene is zzso zzso zzso cells become unable to react appropriately to a delay in DNA zzso Instead of zzso the cell cycle to allow completion of DNA zzso they proceed zzso towards zzso and attempt to segregate the still zzso zzso As a result, the genetic material zzso zzso and the zzso assume a zzso catastrophe zzso characterized by torn zzso zzso zzso cells and scattered zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso can be suppressed by zzso of either the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso alpha or of a novel protein called zzso zzso The latter bears significant zzso to the core of the human zzso escort zzso which belongs to a family of factors necessary to the zzso zzso of proteins like zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso is chemically inhibited with zzso (a zzso derived from orange zzso wild type zzso zzso cells become insensitive to an S phase zzso in a manner strongly reminiscent of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso in wild type cells zzso the failing checkpoint zzso We propose that there is a strong correlation between the zzso zzso zzso phase checkpoint function, and zzso events in zzso zzso
