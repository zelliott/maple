zzso colony zzso was employed to evaluate the results obtained by different zzso methods for detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains tested for zzso zzso production by zzso and zzso not previously tested for zzso zzso production were examined for presence of the genes zzso for zzso zzso A, B, C and E by using three corresponding DNA zzso The zzso zzso A probe also detected zzso zzso E gene because of zzso zzso The optimal sensitivity plate method showed the best accordance between the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso detected zzso to zzso zzso zzso producers without zzso zzso The zzso gel double diffusion test and the reversed passive latex zzso test showed rather poor accordance with the zzso zzso All 17 strains of different zzso investigated were negative in zzso with all three DNA zzso
