A novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a salt mine in zzso zzso zzso The strain was moderately zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Growth occurred with zzso % zzso zzso zzso % zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and at zzso degrees C zzso 25 degrees zzso The major zzso acid constituents of the cell wall were zzso and zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso was the zzso respiratory zzso with zzso present in minor zzso The polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain zzso was most closely related to the type strains of the nine recognized species of the zzso zzso The sequence similarities between the isolate and the type strains of members of this zzso were in the range of zzso zzso which indicated that strain zzso is a representative of a novel species within the zzso zzso Together with the zzso characteristics and zzso differences, these results support the proposal of a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
