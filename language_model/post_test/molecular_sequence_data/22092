In the zzso zzso zzso the divergent zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso are zzso by an zzso redundant pair of zzso zzso The zzso genes are among the first to be activated in the zzso and are critical for the zzso of the zzso stage zzso zzso and E zzso precursor zzso We have previously shown that the binding site recognized by zzso is a zzso zzso site that is not expected from the resemblance of its single zzso zinc finger to those of other known zzso factors, which recognize the consensus zzso To date, no zzso zinc fingers have been described outside of zzso zzso In order to understand the evolution of these zzso factors, and the evolution of gene networks that specify early cell fates in zzso we have identified zzso sequence zzso in the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso zzso encodes two zzso genes similar to zzso zzso we find evidence for seven distinct zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso unexpectedly, the coding regions of all zzso genes appear to lack zzso We report that the zzso zzso have similar expression in their respective zzso We further show that the zzso zzso zzso and at least five of the seven zzso zzso zzso can fully complement the embryonic lethal zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso function and expression have been zzso over tens of millions of years of evolution, and that there may be a mechanism that selects against the acquisition of zzso in these zzso
