The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso form one zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso group of zzso protein zzso The zzso were first identified by their zzso in response to a variety of zzso stresses and their ability to zzso the zzso zzso domain of the zzso factor zzso One approach to study the function of the zzso has included in zzso gene zzso of each of the three zzso zzso zzso loss of either zzso or zzso alone appears to have no serious consequences, their combined knockout is embryonic zzso In contrast, the loss of zzso is not embryonic zzso but rather protects the adult brain from zzso zzso This latter example has generated considerable enthusiasm with zzso considered an appropriate target for the treatment of diseases in which zzso death should be prevented zzso stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's zzso More recently, these gene knockout animals have been used to demonstrate that zzso could provide a suitable target for the protection against obesity and diabetes and that zzso may act as zzso zzso zzso effort is being directed to the development of chemical zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso or of the zzso themselves zzso zzso a direct inhibitor of zzso zzso These most commonly used zzso have demonstrated efficacy for use in zzso with the successful intervention to decrease brain damage in animal models zzso or to zzso some of the symptoms of arthritis in other animal models zzso Alternative zzso zzso of zzso are now also in zzso The possible identification of zzso zzso rather than direct zzso competitors could lead to zzso of unprecedented specificity and zzso
