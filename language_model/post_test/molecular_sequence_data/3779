The zzso bear is a white phase of the North American black bear that occurs in low to moderate frequency on British Columbia's zzso To investigate the genetic uniqueness of populations containing the white phase, and to ascertain levels of gene flow among zzso we surveyed 10 highly zzso zzso zzso zzso from trapped bear zzso A total of 216 unique bear zzso 18 of which were white, was sampled among 12 zzso Island zzso where zzso are most zzso show approximately zzso less diversity than mainland zzso and the island richest in white bears zzso exhibited substantial genetic isolation, with a mean zzso zzso of zzso with other zzso Among all zzso zzso for the molecular zzso underlying the zzso difference zzso was zzso which falls into the 95th zzso of the distribution of zzso values among zzso zzso suggestive of greater differentiation for coat zzso than expected under zzso zzso sequences confirm that zzso bears are part of a coastal or western lineage of black bears whose existence predates the Wisconsin zzso but zzso variation gave no evidence of past population zzso We conclude that zzso was established and is maintained in populations by a combination of genetic isolation and somewhat reduced population sizes in insular habitat, with the possible contribution of selective pressure and/or zzso zzso
