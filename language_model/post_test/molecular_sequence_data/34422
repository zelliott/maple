zzso is one of the chemicals often added to wastewater to control hydrogen zzso production by zzso bacteria zzso While the effect of nitrate in various zzso pure cultures is well zzso the effect observed in mixed microbial communities is not zzso This study investigates the response of mixed zzso communities to zzso by examining the changes in activity and community composition of zzso wastewater zzso over a 10-day period with 10 zzso zzso nitrate zzso zzso were enriched in zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure decreased zzso zzso within 4 zzso and zzso consumption within 10 days, but it did not fully eliminate zzso production in the zzso The effect of nitrate on zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso disappeared while zzso and zzso persisted in the zzso zzso exposure also led to the rapid proliferation of zzso bacteria within the zzso and increased the zzso zzso zzso consumption began within 2 h of nitrate exposure and gradually increased in rate over zzso zzso of the nitrate zzso zzso and the diversity of nitrate zzso genes zzso and zzso also increased zzso Our results demonstrate that some zzso presumably those able to tolerate or zzso zzso will persist in zzso wastewater zzso despite continuous exposure to high levels of zzso zzso is therefore unlikely to provide lasting hydrogen zzso suppression in wastewater zzso harboring zzso or zzso zzso
