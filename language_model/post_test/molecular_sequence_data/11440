zzso zzso by arbitrarily primed zzso was used to analyze the genetic zzso among 59 zzso zzso stocks representing the three zzso zzso subspecies isolated from various hosts and different countries in zzso 14 zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso characters which were used for zzso and zzso analysis and to perform zzso tests exploring the linkage zzso in the zzso There was good zzso between arbitrarily primed zzso zzso and zzso data previously collected for many of the same strains zzso However, the arbitrarily primed zzso typing was more discerning than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis using arbitrarily primed zzso markers did not confirm zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as separate subspecies, but zzso zzso zzso group I was zzso confirming this group as suitable for the subspecies zzso With this exception, there were no clear lineages among the sample, other than zzso of East African stocks and zzso of West African zzso Some features of the zzso analysis suggested that the population structure was not strictly zzso though zzso tests showed linkage zzso even in the absence of repeated zzso While zzso appear stable enough for tracking in applied studies, sexuality will impact at the evolutionary time scale, and may be more frequent under some ecological zzso The arbitrarily primed zzso approach should be an effective and simple approach to follow zzso and to zzso the role of sexuality in zzso zzso zzso
