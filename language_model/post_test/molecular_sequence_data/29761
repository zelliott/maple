zzso channels are believed to zzso the rapidly recovering cardiac transient outward current zzso zzso However, zzso expressed zzso channels fail to fully zzso the native zzso zzso channel interacting proteins zzso have been shown to zzso zzso channel zzso To determine the potential involvement of zzso in the rapidly recovering zzso we cloned three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the ferret zzso Based upon zzso data suggesting the presence of a potential zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells but absence in zzso zzso we zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that while all zzso zzso produced a fourfold acceleration of recovery zzso compared to zzso expressed alone, only zzso produced large zzso shifts in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as seen for the native rapidly recovering zzso Analysis of zzso and protein expression of the three zzso zzso in ferret zzso showed that zzso was most abundant and was expressed in a zzso zzso the rapidly recovering zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at very low zzso The zzso expression distribution suggests that zzso zzso are involved in zzso of the rapidly recovering zzso however, additional regulatory factors are also likely to be involved in generating the native zzso
