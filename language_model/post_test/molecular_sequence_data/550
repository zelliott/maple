zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging, zzso and lax skin, joint zzso and a general zzso zzso zzso zzso includes a family of clinically overlapping conditions with confusing zzso generally requiring molecular analyses for definitive zzso Six genes are currently known to mutate to yield one of these related zzso We zzso a cohort of typical zzso patients from a zzso isolate within eastern zzso zzso mapping with zzso zzso zzso excluded all six known zzso and instead identified a single zzso region near the zzso of zzso 17, shared zzso by state by all zzso affected individuals from the zzso A putative zzso zzso was identified by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the zzso The single zzso change leads to a zzso zzso adjacent to a zzso junction in the gene zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso analysis predicted a zzso effect of the zzso on zzso donor site zzso zzso of the associated zzso was confirmed in zzso from blood zzso of affected zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso skipping leads to deletion of the zzso functional zzso region and an obligatory downstream zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso of the genetic zzso in zzso is zzso given that a similar clinical zzso has been documented for zzso carriers of another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results support a significant role for zzso in normal zzso
