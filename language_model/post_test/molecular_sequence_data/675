zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe the directed evolution and characterization of zzso zzso of serum zzso zzso that express in an active and soluble manner in zzso zzso These zzso were obtained by combining family zzso and zzso zzso the limited diversity of accessible, cloned zzso genes was zzso by zzso the zzso reaction with zzso zzso zzso to zzso that comprise the consensus or appear in the predicted ancestors of the zzso zzso We screened the resulting libraries for zzso zzso activity while ensuring that the selected zzso retained the zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso The availability of highly stable, zzso zzso that is free of all other serum components enabled us to explore unknown zzso features of zzso including its binding to HDL zzso the effect of HDL on zzso stability and zzso activity, and ex zzso tests of its zzso zzso Overall, it appears that zzso possesses properties very similar to those of zzso the zzso zzso activity is selectively zzso by binding to zzso with a zzso increase in its zzso zzso also exhibits potentially zzso functions, although at levels lower than those of zzso
