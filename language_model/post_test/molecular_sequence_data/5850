Multiple zzso in a locus zzso a zzso sodium channel have been predicted for zzso resistance in zzso Previously we reported a zzso associated with zzso resistance, zzso to zzso in domain II zzso segment zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sodium channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of additional resistance zzso zzso to this zzso in the zzso locus has uncovered a G to A transition leading to a Val to Met zzso at zzso acid position zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso is found only in a unique resistant zzso but not in two susceptible and a distinct resistant zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso of this finding in the evolution and mechanisms of zzso resistance are zzso
