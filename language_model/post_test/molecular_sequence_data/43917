Three zzso zzso were previously detected in zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso two zzso zzso zzso alpha A and zzso alpha B that zzso zzso of 453 and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acids exhibit an unusual divergence of zzso This is the highest divergence ever observed between zzso from the same zzso The expression of the two genes is zzso zzso We did not detect any zzso of the zzso alpha A gene in dormant zzso and during the first 30 zzso of development even though the zzso A protein is already present in the early stage of zzso In contrast, the zzso alpha B gene is continuously transcribed during the zzso cycle and the expression profile of the protein follows the ones of its zzso
