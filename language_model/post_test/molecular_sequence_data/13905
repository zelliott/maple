zzso has made tremendous progress through the recent identification of widespread zzso in tumor zzso zzso as zzso zzso Several genes causing zzso instability have already been zzso This was considerably facilitated by the knowledge of zzso DNA mismatch repair genes in bacteria and zzso zzso the human genes are also tightly linked to DNA mismatch zzso In addition, recent research showed that there must be zzso zzso that might also cause the zzso of zzso zzso zzso instability has also provided a model for the proposed existence of zzso zzso by giving an explanation as to how the high number of zzso observed in zzso cells might zzso This review focuses on these genes and our current knowledge of their role in zzso and/or tumor zzso In addition, the occurrence of zzso instability in a large variety of tumors is reviewed in zzso
