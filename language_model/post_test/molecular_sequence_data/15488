Four strains of zzso zzso zzso isolated from the human mouth were characterized using a variety of zzso and zzso zzso The strains were found to comprise a homogeneous group and zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed them to be distinct from but related to a loose cluster of zzso species including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate these zzso zzso zzso is zzso and produces zzso zzso and zzso acids and minor amounts of zzso acid as end products of zzso The zzso content of the DNA of the type strain is 46 zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
