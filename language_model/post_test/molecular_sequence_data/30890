zzso a zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is one of the most potent zzso zzso The zzso zzso has previously been cloned and has been expressed in zzso but the resulting zzso protein was found to be produced in the zzso form, which is known to have an at least 10 times lower affinity for zzso than the naturally occurring zzso zzso Here we describe the in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso With both zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurred at the zzso site zzso and rendered the protein zzso and biologically indistinguishable from natural zzso However, zzso zzso had an over zzso lower apparent zzso value for zzso zzso than bovine zzso Further differences in the zzso properties of zzso and bovine zzso were observed when synthetic peptides were tested as zzso Moreover, a synthetic zzso corresponding to the 9 zzso zzso of zzso (which include zzso was zzso by zzso zzso with a similar apparent zzso value as full length zzso indicating that structural zzso residing in the immediate vicinity of zzso are sufficient for zzso to zzso
