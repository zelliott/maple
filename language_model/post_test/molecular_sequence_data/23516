zzso is emerging as a model zzso for the study of zzso development and zzso and its effectiveness in forward zzso should prove equal to that of zzso Here, we identify by zzso cloning a gene responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae have zzso zzso cells but lack strongly positive and zzso cells, suggesting loss of fully differentiated zzso The region surrounding the zzso locus is zzso to human zzso but a zzso clone covering the zzso locus contained zzso located at zzso including zzso zzso zzso P consists of zzso zzso acids and shares approximately zzso identity with zzso P zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso deletion in zzso 13, which causes a zzso and zzso of the zzso We detected zzso P transcripts in zzso zzso and zzso skin zzso on zzso and an alternatively spliced form in the zzso zzso or zzso The mouse p is similarly expressed in zzso but not alternatively zzso This is the first isolation of zzso zzso the functional mechanism of action of which has not yet been zzso even in zzso Further investigation of the functions of P proteins and the regulation of their expression will provide new insight into body color determination and gene zzso
