DNA zzso is essential for zzso development, zzso zzso and zzso yet zzso zzso patterns are one of the most common features of transformed zzso One of the proposed causes for these defects in the zzso machinery is zzso of one or more of the three known zzso active DNA zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso yet there are clearly examples in which zzso is minimal or zzso but global zzso anomalies zzso An alternative mechanism which could give rise to global zzso errors is the improper expression of one or more of the zzso during the cell zzso To begin to study the latter possibility we examined the expression of the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso during the cell cycle of normal and transformed zzso We found that zzso and zzso levels were significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels were less sensitive to cell cycle zzso and were maintained at a slightly higher level in tumor lines compared to normal cell zzso zzso activity zzso revealed a similar decrease in the overall zzso capacity of the cells during zzso and again revealed that a tumor cell line maintained a higher zzso capacity during arrest than a normal cell zzso These results reveal a new level of control exerted over the cellular DNA zzso machinery, the loss of which provides an alternative mechanism for the genesis of the zzso zzso patterns observed in tumor zzso
