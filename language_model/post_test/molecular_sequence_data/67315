A bacterial community with strong cellulose zzso paper zzso and zzso zzso degradation ability was isolated from the coastal marine zzso They were isolated under zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The library of zzso zzso gene clones revealed a total of 16 operational zzso units after 50 clones were zzso Sixty percent of the clones were most related to the type strain of zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene identity around zzso All of them showed extremely low sequence similarities and were novel at least in species zzso The gene clone libraries of zzso zzso family 48 showed low gene and zzso acid sequence similarities around zzso The results indicated that the cellulose degradation systems in the specific environment have not been well zzso The enrichment could disrupt zzso within zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso activity of the community was comparable to that of zzso zzso The main zzso products were ethanol, zzso acid and zzso zzso This work identified a novel microbial resource with a potential in zzso conversion and zzso zzso
