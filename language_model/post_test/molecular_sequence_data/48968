The zzso capsule is the primary zzso factor with systemic zzso requiring full expression of the capsule but with capability to zzso the capsule in order to zzso The zzso zzso zzso is composed of a number of genes that are involved in zzso synthesis and zzso zzso in zzso synthesis genes may allow discrimination between zzso zzso whereas absence of genes for either synthesis or transport imply that the zzso is zzso Although mechanisms such as zzso zzso and acquisition of zzso sequences have been demonstrated to be involved in regulation of zzso zzso few studies have addressed the mechanisms of zzso expression in carrier zzso Following a community-based intervention zzso for an outbreak of zzso disease, we collected zzso carrier zzso from the intervention area and control zzso We undertook genetic analysis of the zzso zzso and the mechanisms of zzso regulation, together with an investigation of the potential of zzso genes to identify the zzso of zzso zzso Use of the zzso gene allowed the discrimination of zzso zzso zzso zzso into B, C, zzso and Y with a zzso gene zzso permitting the characterization of a further 6 zzso whose capsules contained zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident in only 4 of 13 zzso B zzso and the zzso sequence zzso was found in 2 of 36 zzso zzso Of 51 zzso zzso 25 zzso were shown to be zzso zzso There was a higher percentage of zzso zzso zzso amongst zzso strains obtained from those sampled in zzso schools than those sampled at intervention zzso The zzso zzso warrant further investigation of their zzso organization since such zzso strains may be important in zzso natural protection against invasive zzso We found that after mass zzso zzso zzso occurs zzso with zzso zzso zzso This as implications for assessment of the benefits of mass zzso and vaccination zzso for outbreak zzso Previously expressed concerns of increased risk due to removal of protective zzso may have been zzso
