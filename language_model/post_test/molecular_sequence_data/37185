In order to study zzso zzso evolution in the zzso zzso in which only one zzso zzso virus zzso has been described to date, we screened additional species from the three different zzso of African zzso monkeys for zzso zzso Blood was obtained from 13 West African zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed in 5 of 10 zzso zzso 1 of 2 zzso zzso and 0 of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of partial pol sequences revealed that the new zzso were more closely related to each other than to the other zzso and especially did not cluster with the previously described zzso from zzso zzso This study presents evidence that the three zzso of African zzso monkeys are naturally infected with an zzso and indicates also that there was no zzso between virus and hosts at the level of the zzso zzso
