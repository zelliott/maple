It is now well established that zzso C zzso zzso translation is driven by an Internal zzso zzso Site zzso resulting in zzso zzso Such a mechanism usually occurs with the help of zzso Associated zzso zzso Moreover, an important zzso feature is likely zzso from the model of classical zzso zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso zzso highly structured 3' zzso called the zzso zzso This could bind several cellular factors and zzso the translation zzso at least in zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso proteins have been proposed to be potential zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso protein zzso However, contradictions still exist as to the role of zzso its ability to bind both the zzso zzso and the zzso region leads to the hypothesis that it could positively zzso zzso translation in the presence of the X zzso zzso of zzso and zzso studies of X zzso sequences led us to discredit zzso as protagonist of zzso region stimulation on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, competition zzso of X zzso in trans on zzso translation demonstrate the involvement of at least two stimulating factors and led to the conclusion that this mechanism is more complex than initially zzso Although we did not identify these factors, it is no longer doubtful that there is effectively a stimulating functional interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso region in zzso
