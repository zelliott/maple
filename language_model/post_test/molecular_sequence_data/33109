The availability of complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso B strain zzso and reverse zzso has allowed the discovery of several novel zzso Here, we have explored the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a vaccine candidate, based on investigation of gene sequence conservation and the zzso response zzso after zzso in zzso This zzso was previously identified by a zzso approach as an outer membrane zzso unique to the zzso zzso The zzso gene was present in all 37 zzso zzso analyzed in this zzso Based on zzso acid sequence identity, 16 unique sequences were identified which clustered into three zzso with identities ranging from 92 to zzso with one cluster represented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso after zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produced in mice against zzso zzso reacted with a range of zzso strains in zzso zzso and western zzso Using flow zzso it was also shown that zzso zzso bound to the surface of the zzso zzso strain and activated complement zzso Moreover, zzso against zzso zzso zzso killing of zzso strains from both sequence zzso and zzso passive protection against zzso zzso in infant zzso According to our results, zzso represents a promising candidate to be included in a vaccine to prevent zzso zzso
