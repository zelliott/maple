The small zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the formation of coat protein I zzso zzso zzso Upon recruitment to the donor zzso membrane by interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is exchanged for zzso zzso then zzso from zzso and together with other zzso membrane zzso it recruits zzso the zzso coat protein complex of zzso I zzso from the zzso In this process, zzso was shown to specifically interact with the zzso beta and zzso zzso through its switch I region, and with zzso Here, we mapped the interaction of the zzso switch I region to the trunk zzso of beta and zzso zzso zzso at position 167 in the zzso zzso of zzso revealed a novel interaction with zzso via a putative zzso domain of zzso Thus, zzso is linked to the zzso through multiple zzso with zzso zzso These interactions are located within the core, zzso domain of zzso indicating an organizational similarity between the zzso I coat and zzso zzso zzso
