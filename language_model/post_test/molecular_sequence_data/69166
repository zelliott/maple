The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso associated with B and T cell zzso receptors contain a common zzso acid motif consisting of two precisely spaced zzso sequences (where X zzso to a variable zzso zzso of a single copy of this motif zzso to initiate B or T cell zzso The bovine zzso virus zzso is a B cell zzso zzso which causes a zzso proliferation of B zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso possesses two overlapping copies of the zzso motif which could participate in the induction of B cell zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso domain of the zzso membrane protein 2A zzso of the zzso virus zzso contains a single copy of the zzso motif which could play a critical role in B cell zzso To determine whether these two zzso zzso zzso are endowed with zzso functions, we constructed zzso proteins by replacing the zzso tail of zzso with that of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso We show here that, once separately expressed in B or T cell lines, these zzso are capable of triggering both calcium responses and zzso production when zzso with an zzso to zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso we demonstrated unequivocally that this zzso function may be accounted for by the zzso motifs they zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
