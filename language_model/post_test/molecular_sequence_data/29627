We recently identified zzso T cells that are zzso to zzso I zzso and that promote zzso zzso production in patients with zzso syndrome zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso beta chains of zzso T cells were examined in 8 zzso including 5 patients with zzso and 3 healthy subjects, using zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis combined with in zzso stimulation of peripheral blood T cells with zzso zzso The zzso zzso segments that expanded zzso after stimulation with zzso varied among responders, but the zzso and zzso segments were commonly detected in 6 and 4 zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso region 3 sequence of zzso T cells revealed limited diversity, and all zzso zzso had an zzso acid motif of zzso or minor zzso The zzso zzso had another zzso zzso Surprisingly, an identical zzso zzso chain was used by zzso T cells in 3 patients with zzso There was no apparent difference in the zzso usage between zzso patients and healthy zzso Some of the zzso zzso with the zzso motif detected by zzso analysis were also used by zzso zzso zzso clones responsive to an zzso zzso containing the major zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso T cells from the peripheral blood zzso cell cultures significantly inhibited in zzso zzso zzso production in response to zzso Our results indicate preferential usage of zzso chains by zzso T zzso These zzso chains can be reasonable targets for zzso zzso for patients with zzso
