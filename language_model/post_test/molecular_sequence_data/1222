A panel of rabies virus zzso zzso endemic within zzso between 1988 and 1992 have been typed by zzso zzso zzso zzso into two dominant zzso The first associated with the domestic dog zzso zzso and the second associated with a range of wildlife zzso Using zzso coding sequence data, we have applied molecular zzso techniques to the same panel of 35 zzso rabies virus zzso from throughout zzso in an attempt to compare both techniques and to further investigate the zzso species relationships within this African zzso The results confirm that there are indeed two major groups and that these are related primarily to zzso The zzso zzso appeared more zzso diverse and was more commonly isolated in the southeast of the country, with the zzso group dominating the north of the zzso In addition, molecular zzso identified further groupings within both zzso and a small number of zzso which were not classified by zzso zzso could be assigned to a zzso During the study period (4 zzso there appeared to be little sequence variation within groups suggesting that distinct lineages persisted throughout the study and that there appears to be little evolutionary pressure on the zzso coding region of the viral zzso
