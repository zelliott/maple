A zzso zzso from ginger zzso zzso zzso peptides and proteins with zzso at the zzso zzso The unusual specificity for zzso makes zzso an attractive tool for protein sequencing and identification of zzso folded zzso in zzso The zzso is a 221 zzso acid zzso possessing two zzso zzso chains zzso zzso by zzso at zzso and zzso The availability of the sequence of these zzso chains afforded the opportunity to observe their structure and impact on protein zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso to a resolution of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso free R zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso folding into two distinct zzso of roughly equal size which are divided by a zzso The observed zzso zzso chains zzso the total zzso zzso participate in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the proteins together via hydrogen bonds to the zzso zzso without intervening ordered water zzso The putative zzso binding pocket (the zzso recognition zzso was identified by zzso of the zzso structure with structures of four previously determined zzso zzso The particular zzso zzso acids forming the zzso pocket of zzso zzso Met, and zzso are similar to those found in the zzso binding pockets of the unrelated zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, there is no zzso three-dimensional arrangement of these zzso between the three zzso zzso no zzso binding zzso Thus, the particular zzso acids found at zzso are consistent with a binding pocket for a zzso with the zzso characteristics and charge distribution of zzso zzso exclusion is also a mechanism for selectivity compared to the zzso binding pocket of zzso The zzso binding pocket of zzso greatly restricts the size of the side chain which could be bound because of the occurrence of a zzso in place of the corresponding zzso in zzso In light of the nature of the binding pocket, the specificity of zzso for zzso over other small zzso zzso acids may be attributed to a direct effect of zzso on the zzso zzso backbone zzso
