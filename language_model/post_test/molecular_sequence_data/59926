From a library of sequences binding zzso to nuclear zzso zzso attachment regions, zzso a zzso of about 300 zzso in length zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso sequence was found in more than ten zzso of zzso 19 containing elements similar to genes of the zzso zzso No sequences of this group were found on other human zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso and sequences for another seven zzso were found in zzso A comparative analysis of zzso and the zzso sequences is zzso Based on the sequence of the zzso zzso 19 zzso a hypothetical model of the domain structure of a zzso zzso region was constructed and the mutual arrangement of zzso and genes of zzso family was zzso The zzso were located zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso unit of the zzso family may coincide with zzso zzso containing these zzso
