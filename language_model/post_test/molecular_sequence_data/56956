Three families of zzso repetitive DNA from zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Data obtained from in zzso zzso indicate that these families are located mainly in the zzso zzso The zzso family zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and along most of the long arm of the same zzso The zzso family is located in all the remaining zzso of the zzso while the third family, zzso is restricted to the more zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons between one cloned repeating unit from each DNA family showed some significant regions of zzso between the zzso We discuss the sequence relationships between the three DNA families and the significance of our data in relation to models of zzso evolution, emphasizing the concepts of zzso and the differentiation of the zzso zzso We also examine the possible role that zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso plays in the distribution and homogenization of zzso DNA zzso
