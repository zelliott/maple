Different zzso time steps in zzso and zzso simulations of protein and zzso acid systems are tested with the zzso zzso Born using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Born with simple zzso zzso The simulation stability and energy conservation is investigated in relation to the agreement with the zzso zzso It is found that very close agreement between generalized Born methods and the zzso theory based on the commonly used sharp molecular surface definition results in energy drift and simulation artifacts in molecular dynamics simulation protocols with standard zzso time zzso New parameters are proposed for the zzso method, which maintains very good agreement with the zzso theory while providing energy conservation and stable simulations at time steps of 1 to zzso zzso
