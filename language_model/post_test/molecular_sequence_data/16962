The zzso gene encodes an zzso expressed in zzso that zzso an zzso zzso hormone, zzso which suppresses bone zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso We demonstrate that zzso D zzso the, active zzso vitamin D zzso decreases zzso zzso in the rat zzso cell line, zzso as well as in mouse zzso zzso construct analysis of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso cells localized the repressive effect of zzso to the zzso to zzso zzso region, and gel mobility shift experiments revealed that zzso treatment of the cells diminished the binding of a nuclear zzso to a stretch of 17 zzso from zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Either zzso of a zzso vitamin D zzso zzso or deletion of this sequence of 17 zzso base pairs abolished the repressive effect of zzso by attenuating zzso promoter activity, indicating that this region mediates the zzso response and is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and DNA affinity zzso show that an unidentified 110 zzso nuclear protein binds to the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso neither binds to the zzso region of the zzso promoter nor directly influences the association of the 110 zzso zzso we conclude that zzso indirectly decreases zzso expression via zzso repression (or zzso of this novel zzso Thus, we have identified a zzso required for zzso gene zzso that zzso in negative feedback control of zzso expression and thereby zzso the actions of zzso
