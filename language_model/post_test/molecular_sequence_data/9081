With the completion of the human zzso zzso biomedical sciences have entered in the zzso era, mainly due to zzso zzso techniques and the recent application of mass zzso to zzso zzso However, there is still a time lag between these technological advances and their application in the clinical zzso Our work is designed to build bridges between zzso zzso and clinical zzso zzso extracts were obtained from fresh frozen normal lung and zzso cell lung cancer zzso We applied a zzso enrichment followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were zzso We assessed protein patterns on these samples, showing dozens of differential markers between normal and tumor zzso Gene zzso and zzso analyses identified signaling pathways altered on tumor zzso We have identified two zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso expressed between normal lung and zzso cell lung zzso These potential zzso were validated using western zzso and zzso The application of zzso zzso analyses in clinical samples allowed us to identify new potential zzso and therapeutic targets in zzso cell lung zzso
