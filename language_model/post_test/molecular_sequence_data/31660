The zzso fungus zzso zzso is an important agricultural pathogen affecting a wide range of cultivated zzso Since World War II, chemical zzso have been the go-to method for agricultural pathogen zzso However, the potential adverse environmental and health effects of these chemicals have led to an increasing demand for alternative methods of pathogen control, including biological control zzso In this study, we identified a bacterial isolate with strong zzso activity against zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence for this isolate identified it as a novel strain of zzso zzso Culture media from this isolate were harvested and zzso using zzso exchange and gel zzso zzso The fraction exhibiting the highest level of zzso activity was identified, and its sequence determined by zzso tandem mass zzso had significant similarity to zzso This zzso protein was zzso expressed in zzso coli, and screened for zzso activity against zzso zzso This zzso protein demonstrated clear zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso
