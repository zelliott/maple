A new zzso of binding zzso zzso with specificity for a broad range of polar zzso acids has been identified by sequence comparison, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso analysis has shown that zzso from this new zzso are widely distributed in zzso bacteria, including, in addition to the above, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ABC zzso of polar zzso acids can be divided into two groups: those with narrow zzso specificity and the newly identified zzso with broad zzso zzso The binding and inner membrane proteins from zzso with a broad zzso specificity are larger by approximately zzso than those with a narrow zzso zzso Multiple alignment of the inner membrane proteins from all zzso polar zzso acid zzso indicates there is an zzso zzso region that may be involved in zzso zzso A zzso zzso or zzso at zzso 30 of this region is changed to zzso in zzso zzso zzso 53 also has a strong correlation with the charge on the transported zzso with basic zzso acid zzso replacing an zzso zzso acid at this position with a zzso charged zzso zzso The general zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso which will transport zzso as well as basic and zzso zzso zzso juxtaposes two zzso at zzso 52 and 53 of the zzso zzso zzso
