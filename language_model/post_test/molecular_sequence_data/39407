As the principal components of the developing tooth zzso zzso zzso play a significant role in tooth zzso formation and zzso In order to zzso the structure and function of zzso in the evolution of zzso we have selected the zzso zzso as a zzso model zzso Here we report the first complete zzso zzso sequence available as of yet and document unique features of zzso zzso and zzso zzso electron zzso documented randomly oriented zzso zzso zzso during the zzso phase compared with organized zzso crystal patterns at comparable stages in zzso zzso of zzso amplified products revealed a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso containing 877 zzso with a zzso zzso coding sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the newly discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence with the published zzso zzso zzso and snake zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso On Western blots one major protein with a molecular weight of 24 zzso and two minor proteins with molecular weights of 28 and zzso zzso respectively, were detected based on the zzso of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a moderate sequence zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso A significant zzso was the deletion of the zzso zzso sequence from zzso 3 in the mouse sequence resulting in a conversion to a zzso region in zzso Together, these findings identified a novel zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional implications for the evolution of zzso and zzso in zzso
