zzso cell nuclear factor zzso a nuclear orphan zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso development, was highly expressed with two transcripts zzso and zzso zzso in mouse zzso and with only one transcript zzso zzso slightly expressed in brain, liver, and zzso The zzso transcript was restricted to round zzso at stages zzso and VIII of the zzso zzso The present report demonstrated its expression in zzso as well, but at a very low zzso Northern zzso analysis showed two zzso a common zzso transcript and a unique zzso zzso The expression levels of both zzso transcripts in zzso were zzso by zzso as observed in zzso animals and aged zzso zzso zzso against zzso protein were zzso Western zzso analysis showed the presence of only one band in total protein extracts from either mouse zzso or zzso It indicated that the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the same protein as in zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso and in zzso zzso showed that its expression was in the principal cell abundant in the corpus zzso It implies that some zzso gene expressions located at the corpus principal cells might be controlled by zzso
