zzso is a genetic disorder presenting with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type I is associated with female infertility, whereas type II presents without additional zzso zzso it remains unknown whether zzso type I results from a zzso in a single gene or from a zzso gene zzso Previous zzso and linkage analyses have assigned a zzso locus to zzso in a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso In this report, we describe the molecular and physical characterization of the zzso zzso in a zzso patient with a zzso zzso Eight zzso located around and within the zzso zzso were mapped relative to the zzso zzso 5 zzso spanning the zzso zzso were zzso Thirteen zzso and zzso were localized on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 2 zzso spanning the zzso to the Human zzso zzso Library and the Human zzso 3 zzso zzso Library resulted in the identification of 12 zzso and 50 zzso respectively, allowing the construction of a detailed zzso and zzso physical zzso A refined zzso to the zzso 3 candidate zzso cellular zzso proteins 1 and 2 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained on this physical zzso Furthermore, a zzso and zzso zzso encompassing the zzso was zzso zzso zzso 10 and zzso zzso 10 crossing the zzso have sizes of 110 and 45 zzso zzso The isolation of coding sequences in these clones and in the rest of the zzso will greatly facilitate further efforts toward zzso cloning of the zzso involved in zzso
