The zzso coli zzso zzso is zzso in response to iron zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it for attachment to the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We further found that zzso can form a specific complex with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso bait pulled down zzso from zzso coli zzso whereas zzso zzso bait could pull down zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to a mixture of zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso product with a molecular mass of zzso zzso suggesting a complex zzso of one zzso zzso and four zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso activity was also zzso zzso of a zzso excess of zzso to an zzso zzso mixture resulted in a zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso was also found to zzso the zzso signal between zzso donor zzso and zzso zzso By following the zzso decrease in the magnitude of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding behavior was found to be zzso suggesting the presence of both low- and zzso binding zzso The zzso interaction was also directly measured by zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso The resulting binding zzso fit well to a model describing two binding sites, supporting our zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso resulting in an enhancement of zzso zzso
