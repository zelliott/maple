The surface of the zzso zzso zzso is poorly understood but critical for its interactions with the environment and with zzso We show here that six genes zzso zzso and zzso together with the previously cloned zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins predicted to act in surface zzso thereby affecting disease zzso zzso zzso and sexual zzso zzso in all six genes cause resistance to the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso and most of these zzso also affect bacterial zzso and zzso formation by zzso species, demonstrating that both infection and zzso formation depend on interaction with complex surface zzso A new bacterial interaction, involving zzso zzso by a strain of zzso zzso reveals diversity in the surface properties of these zzso Another biological zzso recognition of zzso by males during zzso also found to be impaired in zzso of all six zzso An important common feature is that all are expressed most strongly in zzso cells, rather than in the main zzso zzso indicating that zzso cells play the major role in zzso surface coat and consequently in determining environmental zzso To test for possible redundancies in gene action, the 15 double zzso for this set of genes were constructed and zzso but no synthetic zzso were zzso zzso of the six genes shows that each has distinctive properties, suggesting that they do not act in a linear zzso
