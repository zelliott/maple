In order to facilitate studies of zzso growth zzso zzso expression during the zzso development of zzso and zzso zzso in the pig model, we have isolated several zzso clones corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of two zzso fragments zzso 2 and zzso 3) revealed an open reading frame zzso in order a putative 25 zzso acid zzso zzso leader zzso the mature zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso and a 35 zzso zzso extension zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is identical to human and bovine zzso but differs from that of rat and mouse at three and four zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso extension peptides are also highly zzso among these zzso Northern analysis using zzso 3 as a probe revealed multiple zzso zzso (including species of zzso zzso and 1200 zzso in zzso in zzso of pregnant zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso were found at early pregnancy, when increased levels of zzso tissue zzso were also zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein were considerably lower than that observed for zzso at the same time zzso Thus, zzso production of zzso appears to be especially significant during early pregnancy in the pig when zzso growth, elevated zzso in zzso zzso and rapid embryonic development are zzso
