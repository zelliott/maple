zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the synthesis of zzso a potent zzso of vascular smooth muscle contraction and zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso and may be intimately involved in the zzso of zzso zzso and immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones revealed that zzso zzso the zzso mouse zzso zzso are dispersed over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso junctions established that the mouse zzso gene zzso is zzso by 13 zzso ranging in size from 53 zzso zzso to 315 zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis and zzso in zzso zzso suggested that the gene is a zzso zzso located on zzso 6 near the zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso An alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso transcript, lacking the zzso zzso zzso has been detected in normal mouse zzso zzso protection and zzso zzso identified at least five major zzso start sites clustered within 31 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso start site is not preceded by a zzso box, suggesting zzso can be initiated in a zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the expression of zzso is controlled by a short zzso positive regulatory sequence and several upstream repressive zzso zzso studies further demonstrated that zzso and zzso exerted zzso and repressive, respectively, effects on the zzso These studies provide the genetic tools and information for zzso research in mice, which should zzso understanding of the genetic contribution of zzso in normal physiology as well as in disease zzso
