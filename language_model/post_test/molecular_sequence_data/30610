zzso and chemical zzso were used to investigate the binding sites of zzso protein zzso and the zzso complex zzso on zzso coli 23 S zzso zzso complexes were formed with an zzso zzso zzso most of zzso I and II or with 23 S zzso and they were investigated by an zzso method and a reverse zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the two protein zzso bind at adjacent sites within a small zzso zzso The zzso binding region zzso with those of the modified zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso and is constrained structurally by a zzso junction while the zzso site is zzso on an adjacent internal zzso The secondary structure of the whole region was determined in detail by the zzso sequence comparison method, and the results for the zzso binding region, together with the experimental data, were used in a computer graphics approach to build a partial zzso zzso structural zzso The model provides insight into the topography of the zzso binding zzso It also provides a structural rationale for the mutually zzso binding of protein zzso with the antibiotics zzso and zzso and with the zzso protein zzso
