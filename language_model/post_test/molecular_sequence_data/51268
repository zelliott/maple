In early zzso development, the proper assembly of zzso into zzso is crucial for embryonic cells to adhere and to migrate on the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms by which such a process occurs in zzso are poorly zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appear first at the zzso zzso They form a zzso zzso on the zzso surface of animal cells facing the zzso Using competition and zzso experiments with zzso zzso fragments and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that at least three zzso sites are essential for assembly of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Two sites, the zzso sequence and the synergistic domain in the 10th type III zzso are both involved in zzso zzso A third site that spans the 9th type I and 1st type III zzso sequences is also likely to participate in zzso zzso
