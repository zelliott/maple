The consumption of tobacco and alcohol has been implicated in the development of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes is common in zzso In this study, the authors evaluated the effects of tobacco and alcohol on zzso gene zzso of cells in cells from the mouth and throat of physically healthy individuals and patients with zzso 

The study participants were divided into 3 groups, including a group of 37 healthy nonsmokers and zzso a group of 22 healthy smokers and/or drinkers and a group of 31 patients with zzso 

zzso of zzso was detected in cells obtained from mouth and throat zzso zzso fluid samples from 3 of 37 healthy individuals zzso who did not drink or smoke, from 15 of 22 healthy smokers and/or drinkers zzso and from 15 of 31 patients zzso with zzso Among 31 patients with zzso 20 patients zzso had zzso zzso gene in their tumor zzso With the use of zzso as a reference, the ratio of zzso zzso to zzso was calculated as an index of the percentage of cells with zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cells from zzso zzso fluid samples that had zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso for patients with zzso and from zzso to zzso for healthy zzso zzso The zzso index of tumor cells with zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso 

The results suggest that zzso gene zzso can be induced by chronic smoking and drinking and may play a role in the very early stages of zzso in zzso
