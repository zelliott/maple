We recently identified a region within the zzso zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 579 to zzso which is essential for zzso of transport activity by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further define zzso of zzso regulation, six zzso zzso located in potential recognition sequences for zzso zzso or adjacent to, this region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were altered either independently or in various combinations using zzso zzso Wild type and zzso zzso zzso with the influenza virus zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso for functional zzso Of the individual zzso zzso only zzso at zzso or zzso affected sensitivity to zzso an zzso of zzso zzso although partial zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso By contrast, simultaneous zzso of both these zzso completely abolished zzso zzso of zzso without greatly affecting zzso transport zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso labeled in zzso with zzso revealed several zzso under zzso zzso zzso was increased approximately zzso in one of these peptides following zzso treatment, and this change was eliminated by zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso is also required for the effect of zzso even though this zzso does not become zzso upon zzso of zzso
