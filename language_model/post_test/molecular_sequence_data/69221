We have studied the action of an zzso zzso complex of two zzso zzso 130 zzso and low molecular weight protein zzso 8 zzso and the action of a zzso fraction containing zzso with excess zzso on calcium influx into zzso and zzso cells as well as on zzso release from zzso Both preparations considerably activate calcium influx and stimulate zzso release from zzso zzso of both preparations with zzso against a 14 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso inhibit induced calcium influx and enhance induced zzso zzso
