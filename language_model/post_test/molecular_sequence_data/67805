zzso zzso is an important biological process for both zzso and zzso Several zzso methods mainly rely on utilizing various types of complementary features to design accurate zzso for predicting zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso terms are increasing zzso in predicting protein zzso However, the number of used GO terms is often very zzso For example, there are zzso GO terms used in the prediction method zzso zzso for zzso zzso This study proposes a novel approach to identify a small set of m top-ranked GO terms served as the only type of input features to design a support zzso machine zzso based method zzso to predict zzso zzso proteins in both zzso and zzso To evaluate the zzso method, two existing methods and their used zzso are adopted for performance zzso The zzso method using zzso GO terms yields an independent test accuracy of zzso on zzso zzso much better than the existing method zzso zzso which uses zzso of zzso and short zzso secondary structure, and zzso properties as input features of a random forest zzso Furthermore, when applying to zzso bacterial zzso the zzso with zzso GO terms has a test accuracy of zzso superior to zzso zzso which uses zzso with several feature types, zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso properties and the position specific weighting zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso proteins in a GO database indicates the percentage of the zzso zzso proteins zzso by GO is larger than that of classical zzso proteins in both zzso and zzso Of the m top-ranked GO features, the zzso GO terms are all zzso by such zzso locations as zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the method zzso is easily implemented and its web tool of prediction is available at zzso
