All influenza viral zzso zzso of both type A and B viruses have only one universally zzso sequence located between zzso acids zzso A zzso zzso against this region has been previously reported to provide broad zzso against all nine zzso of influenza A zzso yet its zzso effect against influenza B viral zzso remained zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso provides a broad zzso against various strains of influenza B viruses of both Victoria and zzso genetic zzso Moreover, the growth and zzso zzso activity of two drug resistant influenza B strains zzso and zzso are also inhibited by the zzso even though these two zzso are zzso zzso to the universal zzso zzso these data suggest that this unique, zzso linear sequence in viral zzso is exposed sufficiently to allow access by zzso zzso during the course of zzso it could represent a potential target for zzso agents and zzso immune responses against diverse strains of type B influenza zzso
