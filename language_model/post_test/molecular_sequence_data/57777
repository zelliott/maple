zzso firing patterns are an intrinsic property of some zzso and have an important function in information zzso In some cells, low zzso calcium channels have been proposed to zzso a zzso potential that regulates zzso The sequence of a rat brain calcium channel alpha 1 zzso zzso was zzso Although it is structurally related to high zzso calcium channels, the zzso channel zzso activated at negative membrane zzso required a strong zzso to zzso and was highly sensitive to block by zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso is expressed in regions throughout the central nervous zzso The zzso properties of the zzso current are consistent with a type of low zzso calcium channel that requires membrane zzso for zzso activity, which suggests that zzso may be involved in the zzso of firing zzso
