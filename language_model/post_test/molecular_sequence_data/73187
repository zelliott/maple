A zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and its secondary structure investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso to the hairpin loop end of the proposed secondary structure of the zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso gel zzso indicates that the zzso zzso zzso exists predominantly as a zzso at a 1 zzso strand zzso Four zzso are found in the zzso hydrogen region of the zzso zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso zzso at this zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso of the zzso hydrogen region of the zzso zzso spectrum gives results consistent with a model of the secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso having a three zzso hairpin loop and two zzso stems separated by a single zzso zzso
