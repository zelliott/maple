DNA zzso could be a useful tool for plant zzso Of particular importance is the ability to identify unknown plant material, such as from customs zzso of illegally collected zzso Mexican zzso are an example of a threatened group, under pressure because of wild collection for the zzso trade and private zzso Mexican zzso also provide a zzso and geographically coherent group with which to test DNA zzso Here, we sample the zzso zzso for zzso species of zzso including approximately zzso of Mexican species and test the utility of the zzso region for zzso zzso We find that the zzso DNA zzso can be used to identify uniquely zzso of species zzso and zzso of species of particular conservation zzso However, this is far below the desired rate of zzso and there are significant issues for zzso amplification because of the zzso of primer zzso Additionally, we test the nuclear ITS regions for the cactus zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed higher rates of variation for ITS zzso unique for zzso zzso but a much lower zzso success, encountering significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso the use of this marker in this zzso We conclude that the zzso region should provide useful information as a DNA zzso for zzso if the problems with zzso can be zzso but zzso alone is not sufficiently variable to achieve zzso zzso Additional complementary regions should be investigated as ITS is shown to be zzso
