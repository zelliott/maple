The zzso zzso and molecular characteristics of Turkish sheep encephalitis zzso virus, strain zzso were compared with other members of the zzso encephalitis zzso virus zzso zzso zzso with defined specificity for the zzso envelope zzso distinguished zzso virus from zzso ill zzso western or far eastern zzso zzso and zzso virus in indirect zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso virus, which produces an zzso disease in zzso resembled zzso virus in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso data of all the structural genes of zzso virus compared with other zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso virus is a distinct member in the zzso virus zzso The data are consistent with the conclusion that zzso virus has evolved by a separate evolutionary zzso as compared with the close zzso relatives, western European, far eastern zzso viruses and zzso zzso By aligning the zzso zzso acids in the viral envelope zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we have also identified zzso zzso motifs for the zzso encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue zzso viruses of the zzso zzso These zzso have important implications for the evolution, zzso and diagnosis of zzso
