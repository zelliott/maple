We have sought to determine the influence of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso produce different zzso patterns with DNA in which the zzso group has been removed from zzso added to zzso or both, as well as on a designed DNA zzso containing a few defined zzso zzso Although each drug zzso DNA primarily at zzso and zzso sites, the zzso at these sites is frequently found to be stronger with zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso in most cases the zzso at secondary sites, in particular at zzso steps, is significantly reduced or even abolished with zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso plays a significant role in the recognition of preferred zzso sequences and confirm the view that both secondary structure and interaction with zzso are involved in determining zzso zzso of DNA by zzso
