zzso movement of beet zzso zzso requires four structural proteins and a zzso protein zzso that is a zzso zzso movement zzso Here we demonstrate that either virus infection or zzso zzso results in association of zzso with the rough zzso zzso The zzso protein possesses a zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain that is localized on the zzso face of the zzso zzso In the infected cells, zzso forms a zzso bridge via a zzso zzso located near the zzso N zzso zzso analyses indicated that each of the zzso zzso as well as protein zzso is essential for zzso function in virus zzso
