Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with approximate molecular masses of 28 and zzso respectively, were isolated from the zzso fluid of the common sea zzso zzso zzso Both of zzso and zzso were regarded as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso since they preferably zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso and zzso and rapidly decreased the zzso of sodium zzso solution in the initial phase of zzso zzso pH and temperature of the two zzso were similarly observed at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso that caused a half zzso of the two zzso during zzso incubation was also similar to each other, zzso zzso However, zzso requirement and activity toward zzso zzso of the two zzso were significantly different from each zzso zzso zzso showed practically no activity in the absence of zzso and the zzso activity at zzso zzso higher than zzso M, whereas zzso showed zzso of zzso activity despite the absence of zzso and the zzso activity at around zzso M zzso zzso hardly zzso zzso smaller than zzso while zzso could degrade zzso larger than zzso producing zzso and zzso (an open chain form of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso and internal zzso sequences of zzso and zzso indicated that both of the two zzso belong to zzso zzso family zzso
