zzso a member of the zzso gene family, acts as a cell zzso zzso through binding to cell surface zzso zzso expression has previously been shown to increase substantially following transforming growth factor beta zzso and bone zzso protein zzso As these molecules are indispensable for cardiac development, we sought to clone the chicken zzso of zzso and evaluate its zzso expression pattern during heart zzso We show by Northern analysis, whole mount and section in zzso zzso experiments that zzso is predominantly expressed in the developing zzso of the zzso zzso as well as in the zzso and zzso of the zzso tract and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression continues into fetal development where zzso is seen predominantly in the valve leaflets and supporting zzso zzso
