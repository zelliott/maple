Crystal structure of the complex between zzso zzso and the second domain of the zzso zzso turkey egg white zzso inhibitor zzso has been determined at zzso zzso A zzso zzso from the first domain has been zzso with the zzso zzso of the structure led to an zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso exhibits the zzso zzso fold with a central zzso and a short zzso zzso zzso The zzso carbon of the zzso site prefers zzso zzso The zzso site loop geometry of the inhibitor is complementary to the surface and charge of the binding site in zzso
