zzso zzso containing one to six zzso in their zzso chains have been isolated from zzso of the brine shrimp zzso zzso The structures of these zzso were identified by zzso analysis, partial acid zzso zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were characterized as novel zzso Because zzso contains a certain series of zzso zzso which differ from the core sugar sequences reported thus far, we tentatively designated the zzso characterized as zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited a hybrid structure of zzso and zzso sugar zzso Two novel zzso were characterized from the brine shrimp zzso zzso one was composed of zzso and a branching zzso attached to zzso zzso and the other was composed of zzso with an additional zzso zzso attached to the branching zzso
