zzso complexes prepared from pig small zzso are highly enriched in several zzso brush border zzso including zzso N and zzso indicating that they reside in a zzso environment in zzso In the present work zzso an animal zzso lacking a zzso signal zzso for membrane zzso was discovered in these complexes as well, and in zzso zzso brush border zzso and zzso formed distinct soluble high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso electron zzso showed that zzso is indeed an zzso brush border zzso we also localized zzso throughout the cell, mainly associated with zzso structures, including small zzso and to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso zzso showing about half the amount of zzso to be in the zzso zzso the rest being associated with zzso zzso zzso A direct association between the zzso and zzso N was evidenced by a zzso along zzso in double zzso labeling and by the ability of an zzso to zzso to zzso zzso N and zzso Furthermore, zzso was released from zzso zzso zzso as well as from zzso zzso by a brief wash with 100 zzso zzso confirming its zzso zzso zzso is therefore zzso by a zzso pathway, and the brush border zzso represent a novel class of natural zzso for a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso by association with zzso structures prior to its zzso zzso but once zzso association with brush border zzso prevents it from being released from the zzso into the zzso zzso
