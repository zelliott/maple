zzso zzso is zzso in all known zzso zzso and the zzso beta zzso in zzso coli causes profound zzso of zzso synthesis and zzso Based on the properties of this zzso it had previously been proposed that zzso zzso lies close to the site of zzso Two approaches were used to study this zzso zzso First, zzso were zzso Only zzso and zzso were zzso the zzso zzso involved a zzso zzso zzso zzso is found at the equivalent position in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Second, all 20 natural zzso acids were placed at position zzso by zzso and zzso properties of the zzso were zzso The results showed that only a limited set of zzso supported significant growth or zzso activity, and that many of the zzso impacted severely on zzso X-ray structure analysis of the bovine zzso has revealed that zzso zzso lies only zzso A from zzso zzso which has been proposed to act as zzso zzso The results reported here emphasize that, in this discrete region of the zzso site, specific zzso constraints on structure are critical for zzso
