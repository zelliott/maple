zzso is a common infectious disease of the zzso zzso and generates large losses in the dairy zzso By means of zzso cloning and functional analysis techniques, we here show that zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso can possibly mediate zzso to zzso through zzso zzso the whole zzso of cows zzso zzso that were susceptible or resistant to zzso in the zzso families revealed that susceptible cows had a relatively long stretch of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso untranslated region of zzso The zzso embryonic zinc zzso zzso zzso factor, which was previously identified as a factor controlling zzso resistance in the same zzso families, bound the C stretch of zzso The susceptible type of zzso with a zzso stretch containing 13 zzso zzso and the longer C stretch of zzso together enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso in response to zzso zzso invasion of zzso zzso cells, whereas treatment with zzso a known zzso of zzso rescued zzso Cows carrying the zzso combination of zzso might be more susceptible to zzso as the result of impaired zzso Our results suggest that zzso could control innate immunity in zzso and serve as a potential tool for preventing zzso
