zzso zzso gene zzso was previously shown to have undergone zzso and zzso evolution related to zzso efficiency in several zzso groups that have evolved zzso zzso including zzso and some zzso zzso gene zzso thought to be linked to diet have also been recorded in some zzso Of all zzso bats have evolved the most diverse dietary zzso mainly including zzso and zzso Here we zzso zzso and analyzed zzso gene sequences from a range of bat species to determine whether their dietary adaptation is mirrored by molecular zzso We found that seven zzso members of the families zzso and zzso possessed two or more zzso and we also detected three zzso zzso zzso gene trees based on both zzso and maximum likelihood methods supported independent zzso events in these two zzso zzso tests revealed that zzso gene zzso have undergone episodes of positive selection indicative of functional zzso and zzso tests revealed strong zzso evolution in the zzso zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso that function in zzso in some zzso the bat zzso sequences were found to be characterized by relatively high zzso points, a feature previously suggested to promote defense against viruses via the breakdown of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings point to an zzso diversification of zzso in these two bat families, although we find no clear evidence that this was driven by zzso Future experimental zzso are needed to resolve the functions of these zzso in zzso
