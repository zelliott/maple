Since zzso cells zzso are known to zzso various zzso and zzso factors, an agent that promotes seeding or zzso of zzso may have potential therapeutic value against vascular smooth muscle cell zzso zzso For the above purpose, we have found that zzso growth factor zzso fulfills such zzso However, the local zzso system has not yet zzso zzso we investigated zzso zzso production and its specific zzso zzso in vascular zzso Our results revealed the expressions of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso of rat assessed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also detected in human zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells and zzso of both rat and human produce and zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso Of importance, the existence of local zzso system zzso and zzso was also observed in zzso in intact abdominal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Overall, this study demonstrated that zzso is expressed and zzso from zzso cells and zzso of both rat and human in zzso as well as in zzso Since zzso has characteristics of an zzso growth factor, locally zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso may have a role in vascular functions in zzso zzso
