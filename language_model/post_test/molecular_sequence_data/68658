A high affinity zzso for zzso B2 receptors was prepared by zzso an activated zzso of zzso acid to the zzso zzso nitrogen of the potent B2 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso zzso zzso bound to a homogeneous set of sites in guinea pig zzso zzso with an equilibrium zzso constant of 15 zzso and a zzso binding density of 193 zzso zzso Competition studies with a number of zzso peptides indicated that the zzso specifically labeled B2 receptors in the zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso 140 will be a useful tool for future studies of B2 zzso
