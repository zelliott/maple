The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso The gene was cloned by zzso of an zzso zzso in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso DNA zzso was zzso The sequence possessed a single open reading frame, corresponding to a zzso zzso acid zzso The sequence of this putative protein has been compared to the proteins of zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, chicken and zzso The analysis revealed remarkable zzso between zzso zzso while for other proteins zzso was limited to defined zzso
