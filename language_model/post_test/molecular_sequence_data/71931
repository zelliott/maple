The zzso fungus zzso zzso contains an zzso of 433 base pairs in the genes zzso nuclear small zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure analyses of the insert reveal characteristics indicative of a Group I zzso including elements zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, the sequences of these zzso regions zzso significantly from recognized consensus sequences for Group I zzso zzso analysis, based on 79 zzso positions from the zzso core sequences of 93 Group I zzso identified 17 zzso similar to that of zzso zzso This zzso which includes zzso from zzso diverse organisms, cannot readily be classified in any previously recognized major group of Group I zzso We propose the creation of a new group, zzso to accommodate these zzso and discuss the evolutionary relationships between group zzso and other major groups of Group I zzso
