We have recently isolated immune response genes of the major zzso B complex of the chicken (the zzso beta zzso by zzso in low stringency with an zzso class II beta chain zzso After reviewing the main results zzso we present a detailed analysis of the region zzso the first gene zzso zzso beta zzso By Southern zzso analysis with zzso zzso we demonstrate the presence of another related zzso beta gene 10 zzso on the 3' side of zzso beta III, the zzso beta V zzso Moreover, retrospective analysis of the zzso clones initially isolated with the zzso beta probe, using a chicken class I probe that we isolated by zzso walking from the zzso beta zzso indicates that the zzso beta III gene is closely linked on its zzso side to a class I zzso zzso
