The identification of zzso peptides zzso zzso T cell responses is crucial for the design of a zzso zzso in zzso disease zzso To date, several zzso peptides have been identified to be active in zzso In the present study, we investigated the recognition profile of zzso zzso peptides in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell lines were generated from zzso zzso and zzso for both proliferation and zzso production in response to 21 peptides from wheat zzso and zzso zzso and zzso A magnitude analysis of the zzso responses was performed to assess the hierarchy of zzso zzso zzso 12 of the 14 patients recognized a different array of zzso All zzso zzso peptides mapped the zzso zzso region, thus confirming the relevance of the known zzso zzso although it was recognized by only 50% of the zzso By contrast, zzso peptides were collectively recognized by the great majority (11 of 14, zzso of CD zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing only one copy of zzso and zzso zzso was as potent as zzso in stimulating zzso T cell zzso A zzso from zzso zzso although structurally related to the zzso zzso is a distinct zzso and was active in 5 out of 14 zzso In conclusion, these results showed that there is a substantial zzso in zzso T cell responses to zzso and highlighted the relevance of zzso and zzso peptides for CD zzso Our findings indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the most active zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso
