The zzso complex is in higher zzso shown to be important for the zzso of zzso The zzso system in fish is believed to be similar to that in higher zzso and the zzso chains could therefore be an important marker for identification of zzso in zzso Here, we report the zzso and corresponding gene sequence of Atlantic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso expression pattern of zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Important structural characteristics defining the zzso genes seemed to be zzso in the zzso zzso zzso such as a signal zzso an zzso region, a zzso zzso having a zzso charged zzso and an zzso bearing zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso included two zzso presumably involved in zzso zzso and the zzso motif important for zzso A spliced zzso of zzso was identified, lacking the zzso but with the zzso motif zzso The real time zzso analysis revealed a highly similar expression pattern of the zzso genes and the zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the functional relationship between the zzso and the zzso genes are preserved in zzso
