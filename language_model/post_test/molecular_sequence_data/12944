zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso group of zzso acid to form zzso acid, a precursor to zzso A zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was isolated from developing seeds of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with a molecular mass of 32 zzso The zzso was expressed in developing seeds of transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso expression zzso zzso acid was present at the zzso position of zzso from transgenic plants but was absent from that position of seed oil extracted from control zzso zzso was present in the transgenic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid composition did not affect the total zzso acid zzso These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso to alter the zzso composition of transgenic seed oils and also represent a necessary step toward increasing the zzso acid content of zzso zzso
