zzso zzso produces several zzso zzso including zzso zzso toxin B zzso B), also known as zzso zzso zzso B and zzso zzso Several reports suggest that zzso B contributes to the zzso associated with zzso zzso however, little is known about its zzso zzso sequence data revealed the presence, upstream of the zzso zzso of a zzso designated zzso that was predicted to zzso a zzso similar to previously described positive regulatory zzso The putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso consisted of 280 zzso acids and had a predicted molecular weight of zzso To assess the potential role of zzso in the production of zzso B, the zzso gene was zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which resulted in markedly decreased zzso B production, as determined both by zzso and zzso activity on zzso zzso However, the production of other zzso products, including zzso O, zzso and zzso was not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with an intact zzso gene copy in zzso zzso zzso could restore zzso B production and confirmed that the zzso gene product is involved in the production of zzso zzso
