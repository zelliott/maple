The zzso tumor cell zzso protein 1 or zzso is a membrane zzso protein enriched in zzso and nuclear zzso We previously showed that its zzso zzso stimulates the zzso activity of the molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also contains a large zzso zzso extension composed of two zzso repeats or zzso zzso for which the zzso is zzso Here we describe the cloning of the human zzso zzso and its interaction with zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The interaction was initially identified in a zzso screening and further confirmed in zzso by dot zzso native zzso and zzso zzso The second zzso domain of zzso zzso was found to be sufficient for binding to ACT, both in zzso and in zzso Single zzso zzso at two strictly zzso zzso significantly zzso or totally zzso abolished the interaction with zzso zzso binds to human ACT with an intrinsic affinity equal to zzso zzso zzso of ACT with nearly zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso results in an apparent loss of ACT zzso activity toward zzso zzso analysis indicates that the formation of the zzso zzso complex zzso is significantly delayed in the presence of zzso with no change on the zzso efficiency of the zzso This work demonstrates for the first time that the zzso domain of zzso mediates stable and high affinity zzso zzso
