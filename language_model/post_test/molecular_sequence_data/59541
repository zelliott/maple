zzso of the zzso zzso were used to study parameters affecting gene expression in cultured cells and transgenic zzso A zzso zzso protein containing a nuclear transport signal was shown to inhibit expression of a reporter gene by interacting with zzso operator zzso In cultured cells, operator zzso operator placement and induction parameters were all shown to be important for obtaining tight repression of a reporter gene followed by high level expression upon zzso zzso levels were also dependent on the reporter zzso with the zzso gene yielding higher induction levels than the zzso zzso zzso In transgenic animals, the zzso zzso was not detected in the zzso mouse strain until the animal was exposed to a zzso zzso After zzso treatment, expression of zzso zzso was detected in the brain, heart, zzso lung and zzso In the zzso transgenic mouse strain, expression of zzso zzso was detected without zzso treatment in the zzso liver, zzso and zzso zzso experiments with double transgenic animals containing both zzso and zzso zzso showed a decrease in zzso expression compared to the zzso animals in both tissue extracts and transgenic fetal primary cultures, although zzso induction was not achieved in these animals or primary zzso The zzso and challenges of the system for regulation of gene expression are zzso
