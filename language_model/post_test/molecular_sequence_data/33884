zzso peptides are bacterial secondary zzso that zzso inhibit protein synthesis in zzso bacteria and zzso zzso Recently, our laboratory and others reported that this class of zzso zzso natural products is derived from zzso zzso zzso that undergo a cascade of zzso modifications to produce zzso complex zzso zzso Here, we report the gene cluster responsible for production of the zzso factor Tu zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and its zzso expression in the model host zzso zzso zzso harbors an unusual zzso zzso that may increase zzso rigidity of the zzso and impart reduced zzso costs of target zzso zzso feeding and gene knockout were employed in the engineered zzso zzso strain to identify the zzso zzso zzso as the zzso involved in zzso transformation of zzso 8 to zzso through a predicted tandem double zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso to zzso via zzso gene replacement resulted in a zzso and zzso drop in zzso activity, zzso This report of genetic manipulation of a zzso zzso zzso sets the stage for further genetic examination of structure activity relationships in the zzso targeting class of zzso zzso
