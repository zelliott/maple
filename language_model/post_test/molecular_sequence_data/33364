The rugged nature of the zzso structural free energy landscape allows cellular zzso to respond to environmental conditions or fluctuating levels of zzso molecules by undergoing dynamic zzso changes that switch on or off activities such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso must also temporally control incompatible activities and rapidly complete their life cycle before being targeted by cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso must switch between translation and zzso and untranslated zzso zzso must control other activities such as zzso editing or zzso Unlike well characterized zzso in cellular zzso the control of infectious zzso activities by altering the zzso of functional zzso zzso has only recently been zzso In this review, we will present some of these molecular zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relating how these dynamic regions were discovered, the activities that might be zzso and what factors or conditions might cause a switch between zzso
