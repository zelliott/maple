The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene promoter was determined up to zzso zzso zzso to the major zzso start zzso The base composition of the zzso upstream sequence revealed a very A + zzso profile zzso G + zzso leading to many putative hairpin zzso The functional organization of the zzso zzso zzso promoter was investigated by zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments obtained by the sequential removal of sequences upstream of the translation start zzso were fused to the zzso coli zzso gene and the resulting plasmids were used to transform the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso reporter gene was observed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso when using the zzso zzso or 1 zzso upstream of the zzso coding zzso In contrast no zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed the integration of zzso DNA in the zzso DNA of zzso zzso and the presence of free copies of the transformation zzso which could be rescued in zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso machinery of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may differ significantly from that of zzso but that enough conservation exists within the lower zzso to allow a zzso expression of a reporter gene in an zzso zzso
