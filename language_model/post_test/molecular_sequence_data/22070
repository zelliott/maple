zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso zzso and is targeted by the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the use of a selection system based on directed evolution to select zzso zzso of zzso Using this system, the rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction, was introduced into an zzso zzso coli strain, zzso and zzso were selected on minimal medium by functional zzso Three zzso with high zzso resistance were identified in three independent zzso selection zzso Each zzso contained a zzso transition within the zzso coding zzso causing a change of zzso to zzso zzso in the protein zzso zzso resistance zzso indicated a zzso increase in zzso resistance of zzso coli expressing the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso was decreased about zzso and zzso respectively, compared to zzso zzso Analysis based on a kinetic model demonstrates that the zzso zzso has a high zzso resistance while retaining relatively high zzso efficiency at low zzso zzso A mathematical model derived from the zzso equation was used to characterize the effect of expression level and selection conditions on kinetic zzso and zzso variation of the zzso This prediction suggests that the expression level is an important aspect of the selection zzso Furthermore, zzso resistance of the zzso zzso was confirmed in transgenic tobacco zzso zzso demonstrating the potential for using the zzso zzso in transgenic zzso
