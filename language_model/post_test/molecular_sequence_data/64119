We have applied a genetic system for analyzing zzso in zzso coli to zzso zzso an zzso with an astonishingly high resistance to zzso and zzso zzso Taking advantage of the conservation of the zzso of zzso zzso among most zzso we derived again in zzso zzso the zzso system that we developed in zzso coli to monitor base zzso defining 33 base change zzso at 22 different base zzso We zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso in zzso zzso derived spontaneously in zzso and zzso zzso backgrounds and after treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are the same as those found for zzso coli and other zzso There are prominent base substitution hotspots in zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In several cases these are at different points in each zzso even though the DNA sequences surrounding the hotspots and their corresponding sites are very similar in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In one case the hotspots occur at the same site in both zzso
