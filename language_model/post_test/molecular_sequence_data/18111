zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain two zzso species, namely zzso and zzso By sequence determination, we show that zzso is identical to the previously zzso zzso except for two zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the relative amounts of these two zzso zzso vary during leaf development: in zzso leaves the zzso zzso only represents zzso of total zzso zzso during development and zzso it increases to reach zzso in zzso leaves, and it then decreases to zzso in zzso zzso
