Type I zzso zzso systems are comprised of two zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso of DNA, and the restriction zzso zzso zzso responsible for DNA zzso Both zzso share a number of zzso An engineered zzso system, zzso based on the zzso domain of the specificity zzso of zzso was constructed that zzso the symmetrical sequence zzso and is active as a zzso Here, we investigate the restriction zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso assembly of the zzso zzso Finally, using zzso zzso scattering and selective zzso we present a zzso structural model of the zzso and locate the motor zzso within the zzso zzso We show that the zzso linkage between the two target recognition zzso of the specificity zzso is not required for zzso assembly or zzso activity, and discuss the implications for the evolution of Type I zzso
