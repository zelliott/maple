The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso lacking zzso counterparts is a key component of the zzso binding site of zzso region zzso of the zzso positioned at the exit zzso Here, we determined the zzso zzso neighboring zzso on the human zzso zzso using zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso at designed zzso The protein was zzso to zzso zzso in specific zzso complexes, in which the zzso zzso was located at positions zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso with various specific zzso agents followed by identification of the resulting modified zzso made it possible to map the zzso to zzso zzso This zzso contains the motif zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso zzso Analysis of X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that this motif is not implicated in the zzso zzso zzso its involvement in translation process in a zzso zzso zzso of the results obtained with data on positioning of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso lead us to suggest that this motif is involved in interaction with both the zzso region of zzso and the initiation factor zzso specific for zzso providing new insights into molecular mechanisms of translation in zzso
