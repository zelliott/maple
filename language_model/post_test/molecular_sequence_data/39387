zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is unique as it is the only member of the zzso family that is involved in the cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso by virtue of forming a zzso complex with membrane type 1 zzso zzso zzso on the cell zzso zzso is similar in structure to zzso but is unable to support the zzso of the zzso Several reports have highlighted the importance of the zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso complex; however, very little is known about the role of the extended AB loop of zzso in this mechanism even though it has been shown to interact with zzso In this study we show by zzso and kinetic analysis that it is possible to transfer the zzso binding affinity of the zzso AB loop to zzso but that its transplantation into zzso does not zzso the inhibitor with zzso zzso zzso However, transfer of both the AB loop and zzso domain of zzso to zzso generates a zzso that can activate zzso and so demonstrates that both these regions of zzso are important for the zzso zzso
