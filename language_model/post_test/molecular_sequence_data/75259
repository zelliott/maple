zzso DNA clones containing the human and zzso genes coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso were zzso The human zzso gene is approximately equal to 12 zzso long and comprised of five zzso A leader zzso zzso contains the zzso region and most of the zzso defining the signal zzso zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso Two zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is 321 base pairs zzso long and codes for four zzso of the leader zzso and zzso zzso of the mature zzso and zzso zzso is 231 zzso long and encodes zzso zzso zzso TM is 123 zzso long and codes for the single zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso C is a large zzso zzso zzso virtually the entire zzso domain zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene has a similar organization with zzso boundaries essentially identical to the human zzso zzso conservation of zzso sequences between species in both zzso and zzso zzso regions equivalent to that among zzso zzso suggests that zzso and human genes may be regulated in a similar zzso The probable relationship of the individual zzso zzso to functional and structural protein zzso is zzso
