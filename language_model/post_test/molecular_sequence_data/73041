The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso resistant to the zzso zzso This zzso zzso with substitution of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso in which the zzso has much lower affinity than the zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 in zzso coli and its zzso to approximately zzso zzso allow demonstration that the zzso does have both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, we reported that zzso of an active site zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso coli zzso leads to gain of zzso zzso zzso activity in that zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso at the equivalent site, zzso To test the prediction that a zzso zzso predicts zzso zzso while an zzso zzso predicts both zzso and zzso zzso activity, the zzso zzso protein of zzso was constructed and zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso showed complete loss of the ability to couple zzso but retained zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso substitution on the active site zzso in zzso zzso is thus a molecular indicator of both the ability to make zzso and intrinsic resistance to the zzso class of zzso zzso
