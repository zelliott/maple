zzso analysis of zzso cell hybrids derived from T cells carrying a zzso zzso zzso from a patient with zzso zzso and T cell leukemia indicates that the zzso on zzso 14 is zzso to the zzso locus and to the zzso zzso while the zzso on zzso 7 involves the T cell zzso beta chain locus immediately zzso to J beta zzso on zzso zzso The separation of V beta and C beta observed in zzso cell hybrids defined the orientation of the T cell zzso beta chain locus on zzso 7 where the V beta genes are zzso and the C beta genes are zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was revealed as being an inversion with zzso of the zzso band of zzso zzso The importance of the zzso region in the zzso process is zzso
