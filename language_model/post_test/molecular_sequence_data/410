The zinc zzso regulator zzso is a zzso zzso protein involved in the maintenance of bacterial zinc zzso Up to now, regulation of zinc zzso by zzso is poorly understood in zzso zzso 

We constructed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso expression analysis disclosed a set of 154 zzso genes of zzso zzso upon exposure to zinc rich zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso was subsequently used to validate the zzso zzso Based on the 154 zzso zzso predicted regulatory zzso motifs were used to screen for potential direct zzso targets including three putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso reporter fusion analysis verified that zzso greatly zzso the promoter activity of the above three zzso The subsequent zzso mobility shift zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso protein was able to bind to the promoter regions of the above three zzso The zzso I zzso was used to identify the zzso binding sites for the above three zzso zzso the zzso box sequence as predicted previously in zzso The primer extension zzso was further used to determine the zzso start sites for the above three zzso and to zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding sites overlapped the zzso sequence of its target zzso which was consistent with the previous observation that zzso binding would block the entry of the zzso zzso to repress the zzso of its target zzso 

zzso as a zzso directly controls the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by employing a zzso mechanism of zzso DNA association as observed in zzso zzso contributes to zinc zzso in zzso zzso likely through zzso repression of the zzso zinc zzso system zzso and two alternative zzso proteins zzso and zzso
