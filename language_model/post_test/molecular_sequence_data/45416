To determine the prevalent zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso present in the domestic cat population of zzso 

Blood samples were collected from 41 zzso zzso positive cats from four cities across zzso Following DNA zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to amplify the variable zzso region of the envelope zzso zzso zzso were assessed by direct sequencing of zzso products and comparison with previously reported zzso zzso zzso analysis allowed zzso of the Australian sequences into the appropriate zzso 

Of the 41 zzso samples, 40 were found to cluster with previously reported zzso A zzso whilst the remaining sample grouped within zzso zzso 

zzso A was found to be the zzso zzso zzso present in Australia, although zzso B was also zzso These results broaden our knowledge of the genetic diversity of zzso and the associated implications for zzso diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
