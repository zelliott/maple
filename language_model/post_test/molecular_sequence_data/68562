The zzso chain reaction zzso is a new diagnostic technique for the detection of zzso zzso however, it currently provides only qualitative zzso The aim of this study was to adapt zzso for the accurate zzso of zzso zzso in clinical zzso For this purpose, we designed a standard zzso which was zzso to sequences at the zzso end of the zzso B3 zzso zzso but contained a zzso zzso which created a novel internal restriction zzso zzso zzso of this standard template zzso were mixed with a fixed concentration of zzso B3 zzso zzso The viral and standard templates were reversed transcribed to zzso and zzso by zzso and a comparison of the radioactive zzso products was zzso Since the templates were both present in a single reaction tube and zzso for the same zzso the ratio of products remained zzso throughout the amplification zzso By this approach, a zzso in viral zzso was clearly zzso Moreover, we were able to accurately zzso as few as 15 50% tissue culture infectious doses, which reflects common clinical viral zzso This study lays the foundation for zzso of zzso zzso in clinical specimens and establishes a technique that can readily be applied to the diagnosis of zzso zzso
