A major in zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso shows zzso zzso between the zzso and the membrane zzso The mechanism of the zzso was studied with zzso zzso and various zzso zzso was found to bind to pure zzso zzso as well as to the synaptic zzso zzso Although the interaction of zzso with the latter was zzso zzso by protein zzso C showed no significant effect on the binding to the zzso zzso However, when zzso was included in the zzso the association became zzso A synthetic zzso domain zzso showed a similar zzso interaction with the zzso charged zzso zzso but not zzso inhibited zzso of zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso seems to bind to the zzso through two binding sites: the zzso zzso zzso and the basic zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso of this domain lowers its affinity to zzso and makes the whole zzso strongly zzso charged, which causes its zzso from the zzso
