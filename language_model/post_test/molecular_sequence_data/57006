A total of 25 DNA markers located on the long arm of human zzso 2 have been mapped by zzso in zzso zzso This region includes the locus for zzso syndrome, type I zzso recently found to result, at least in some cases, from zzso of the zzso zzso We have established that the zzso location of the zzso gene is within band zzso We also show that three markers in the zzso zzso region, including the zzso zzso are deleted in a patient with zzso features of zzso associated with a de zzso deletion zzso The improved physical map of this region should facilitate linkage mapping and zzso cloning of zzso on zzso zzso
