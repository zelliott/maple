The zzso of zzso provides a unique organ for the study of zzso development in a zzso zzso Unlike zzso B cells, B cells in the chicken develop in a single wave of zzso beginning with the commitment of zzso cells to the B cell lineage between days 10 and 15 of zzso By day 18 of zzso all zzso zzso cells capable of differentiation along the B cell lineage have migrated to the zzso of zzso Following migration to the zzso these zzso zzso enter exponential growth and begin to populate each of the zzso zzso zzso Between day 18 of zzso and 2-4 weeks of age, B cells undergo a stage of zzso zzso By the end of this period, chickens are able to mount primary immune responses against virtually all zzso In addition, by this time sufficient numbers of B cells have migrated from the zzso to peripheral zzso zzso so that the B cell immune system can be maintained even if the bird is zzso zzso of zzso after 4 weeks of age has no long-term effects on the development and maintenance of the B cell immune system in adult zzso Because of the central nature of the surface zzso zzso to B cell development in zzso the chicken zzso gene locus has been zzso studied during avian B cell zzso The chicken zzso locus is a particular interest because it has only one V region capable of zzso zzso of the zzso gene is not dependent on the zzso zzso B cell zzso rearrange their zzso gene between days zzso of zzso prior to migration to the zzso zzso gene zzso occurs by a zzso mechanism in which a precise joining of the zzso zzso signal sequences leads to a circular zzso zzso During this deletion it appears that single zzso bases are added to both the V and J coding zzso zzso zzso joining occurs at zzso Most zzso B cells appear to rearrange only a single zzso zzso The high frequency of zzso zzso observed in avian B cell lines appears to result from the selective amplification of cells with productive zzso zzso during zzso development between days 12 and 18 of zzso To create an zzso repertoire, chickens must diversify the coding sequence of this single functional V gene segment during zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
