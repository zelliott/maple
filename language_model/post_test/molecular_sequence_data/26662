Avian zzso virus zzso infection in Taiwan Country chickens zzso was investigated by using gene zzso virus isolation, and sequence zzso The blood samples of 61 zzso flocks at market ages from a slaughter house were screened for zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction to investigate the zzso infection zzso The zzso coats from three breeder and four commercial chicken flocks were zzso with zzso cells to isolate the zzso The full zzso DNA zzso of two zzso zzso were zzso zzso and compared with reference zzso zzso The gene detection results showed that 60 and 43 of the 61 flocks were infected with zzso A of zzso zzso and zzso J of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolation results showed that five zzso and two zzso were isolated from those seven zzso zzso The full sequences of the zzso showed that isolate zzso possessed a zzso virus 1 zzso coding region and an zzso zzso region zzso and was similar to ordinary zzso However, zzso was zzso The zzso of this isolate displayed high identity to zzso counterpart sequence and its zzso was different from all zzso This unique zzso is common in zzso
