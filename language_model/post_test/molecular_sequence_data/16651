To look for evidence of zzso infection, we isolated 107 zzso zzso clones from zzso specimens taken from both parents and four zzso We compared the sequences of two zzso genes zzso and zzso from these clones with those of 131 unrelated strains from patients living in different geographic zzso zzso relationships within the family were determined by analyzing zzso variation at both zzso and building zzso trees and by using zzso sequence zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso trees showed East Asian and African zzso All samples from family members showed natural mixed zzso zzso zzso found in some strains isolated from the children and parents, but not in the strains isolated from unrelated patients, demonstrated that strains have circulated within the zzso Several mechanisms, such as point zzso zzso zzso and introduction of foreign zzso zzso were shown to enhance strain diversity within the zzso
