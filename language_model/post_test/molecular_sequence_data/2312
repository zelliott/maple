We generated viral zzso to test the hypothesis that the major zzso on zzso DNA that is zzso for zzso DNA integration is the zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso normally present in circular molecules formed by joining the two zzso of linear zzso zzso zzso viral zzso were built which carried a zzso marker and an extra copy of the zzso junction from a cloned circular zzso The junction sequence in each case was positioned such that its use during integration would lead to an easily zzso zzso integrated zzso zzso Analysis of DNA from cells infected with the virus zzso showed that the introduced junction sequence is used at least zzso less efficiently than the natural sequences at the ends of the zzso This suggests that a linear or more exotic DNA intermediate is most likely the true precursor for the integration zzso
