The cell attachment activity of zzso has been ascribed to an zzso zzso sequence near the zzso zzso To verify the importance of the zzso sequence for cell zzso we created zzso and zzso zzso zzso and also deleted either the zzso B zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso binding zzso These zzso were expressed as fusion zzso zzso using zzso affinity zzso and zzso for cell zzso zzso cells bound equally well to zzso delta zzso and to delta zzso but binding to zzso and zzso was inhibited by more than zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso sequence of zzso is the most important cell recognition site and that neither the zzso B nor zzso zzso contribute significantly to the cell adhesive activity of zzso
