zzso monitoring of the free zzso concentration in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an important but still zzso experimental zzso We have shown that a zzso zzso zzso can be addressed to defined zzso compartments by adding the appropriate targeting zzso By engineering a new zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso retained in the zzso zzso via interaction of its zzso with the zzso resident protein zzso we show here that, after zzso the zzso zzso is rapidly zzso up to zzso of zzso 100 zzso thus consuming most of the reporter zzso An estimate of the zzso zzso concentration was obtained using zzso a well-known zzso surrogate which elicits a significantly slower rate of zzso zzso Under conditions in which the rate and extent of zzso zzso in the zzso closely zzso those of zzso the zzso mean zzso zzso concentration zzso was approximately 2 zzso zzso stimulation causes, in a few seconds, a zzso decrease of the zzso whereas specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leads to an approximately zzso drop in a few zzso
