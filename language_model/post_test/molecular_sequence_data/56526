zzso of zzso coding for the zzso La (or zzso were isolated from a library made from rat zzso A comparison of the rat La zzso zzso from zzso 38 to zzso for rat La zzso with the sequences known for human and bovine La protein resulted in the identification of zzso zzso The zzso seem to be the result of zzso of zzso sequences during zzso In addition to these variations, we observed that rat La zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso Finally, a zzso search resulted in the identification of a DNA sequence originally termed as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which represents the C zzso of mouse zzso zzso
