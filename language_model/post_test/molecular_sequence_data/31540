Rice sheath zzso caused by the zzso fungus zzso zzso is one of the most devastating and intractable diseases of rice, leading to a significant reduction in rice productivity zzso In this article, in order to examine sheath blight resistance, we report the generation of transgenic rice lines zzso the rice zzso zzso 4 zzso gene in a green zzso manner which breaks down zzso acid zzso the zzso factor zzso by zzso zzso plants showed higher zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso than zzso control plants, which was zzso by zzso zzso and sodium zzso gel zzso zzso zzso rice leaves were more tolerant than control rice leaves to zzso zzso zzso plants showed a higher level of expression of other zzso genes in response to pathogen zzso More importantly, transgenic plants exhibited significantly enhanced durable resistance to zzso The zzso of zzso in rice did not show any zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our findings indicate that rice zzso can be zzso effectively in plant genetic manipulation for sheath blight resistance, and possibly for resistance to other diseases caused by zzso zzso especially those that zzso zzso This is the first report of the expression of zzso genes in rice in a green zzso manner for sheath blight zzso
