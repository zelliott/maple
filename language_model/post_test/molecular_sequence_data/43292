Recently, we have shown that a zzso zzso device coupled to an zzso zzso triple zzso mass zzso through a zzso interface represents a powerful zzso system for the zzso conclusive and sensitive identification of proteins separated by gel zzso Here we report on the successful zzso of the same device to an zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso and on the comparative evaluation of the performance of the triple zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso trap mass zzso system, using a zzso digest of a zzso bovine serum zzso sample, we achieved limits of detection in the single mass zzso zzso and tandem zzso mode, respectively, of 400 zzso (if 20 zzso of solution at a concentration of 20 zzso was zzso The system was also successfully used to identify six zzso proteins isolated from a single zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso For the detection of zzso zzso zzso both systems showed comparable sensitivity, whereas the zzso system showed superior performance with zzso zzso zzso
