zzso constitute a class of small proteins that inhibit zzso zzso by binding to the zzso zzso also referred to as zzso zzso zzso to other zzso that bind to a series of zzso via their zzso domain, the recognition site of zzso contains a zzso sequence that ensures its specificity towards zzso In this article, a three-dimensional model of zzso is proposed using zzso modeling and large-scale molecular dynamics zzso The zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso are analyzed and compared to those of zzso that exhibit similar specificity towards zzso The zzso zzso following the zzso sequence of the binding domain is shown to play a crucial role in the biological activity and the specificity of zzso Our results suggest that this zzso anchors to the binding pocket of the zzso of zzso rather than to those of the zzso zzso
