We examined the utility for zzso reconstruction of the second internal transcribed zzso zzso lying between the nuclear zzso gene and the gene for large zzso zzso zzso using sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We aligned and analyzed 13 sequences from zzso and 11 new sequences from diverse species of zzso zzso of the secondary structure of the zzso the zzso transcript folding pattern required for transcript processing into functional zzso units, revealed the zzso of sequence conservation common to all the zzso that then allowed alignment of all the zzso The zzso tree, though including only a sparse representation of the enormous zzso diversity, zzso generally with the consensus of all prior zzso zzso using eight other nuclear and zzso gene zzso where species representation is greater, as in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso representatives, it zzso zzso The paradigm zzso secondary structure presented can now be used to assess the zzso more zzso since its base pairing pattern makes alignment of sequences zzso In addition, it shows that these insects share the zzso secondary structure characteristics of the other major animal groups as well as the green line of zzso zzso The relatively short zzso zzso zzso region seems ideal for reconstructing evolutionary relationships at the levels of species, zzso and perhaps even zzso
