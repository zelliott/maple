In zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene is involved in maintaining the balance between the stem cells in the central zone of the stem zzso zzso and the determined cells at its zzso However, zzso has not been previously characterized in other zzso Using the direct amplification of zzso DNA, we obtained a full-length zzso zzso from canola plants zzso zzso and also three zzso fragments from rape zzso zzso canola zzso zzso and false zzso zzso zzso which corresponded to the zzso domain and a part of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the full-size zzso zzso from zzso zzso were similar by 81 and zzso to the zzso gene from zzso in the case of shorter gene fragments, the similarity was as high as zzso and zzso zzso By their primary structure, the zzso genes in the zzso considerably differ from its putative structural zzso beyond this zzso
