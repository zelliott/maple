The zzso of different preparations of zzso zzso the major form of zzso zzso found in the liver zzso of zzso zzso was checked by zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso In zzso all the preparations migrated as a single protein band of molecular mass 49 zzso The zzso mobility of this band corresponded to that of the major zzso band in the zzso of zzso zzso A single zzso sequence zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of the zzso form of zzso zzso was revealed by zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso focusing of zzso homogeneous zzso zzso was conducted in zzso gel in an zzso zzso pH 5-8 zzso under zzso conditions zzso M zzso Under these conditions zzso zzso was resolved into six zzso in the pH range zzso The data obtained reflect the zzso of this form of zzso zzso The existence of different zzso points cannot have been due to different protein zzso because zzso conditions were used, but seem to reflect different primary structures of the zzso zzso
