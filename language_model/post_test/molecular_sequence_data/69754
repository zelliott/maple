Two zzso zzso oxidized zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso have been isolated from whole tobacco leaves by conventional zzso on zzso The zzso points of zzso and zzso at 10 degrees C were found to be zzso and zzso zzso When the primary structures were zzso a zzso within both zzso and zzso was zzso By appropriate zzso arrangements the zzso sequences of two zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso All four sequences contain 99 zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ in one position, where zzso in zzso is replaced by Pro in zzso and zzso differ in three positions, where zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are replaced by Ala, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso generally differs from zzso zzso in three positions, where zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are replaced by Ala, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso of oxidized tobacco zzso and zzso have been characterized with an zzso position at around 340 zzso The presence of one extra zzso zzso in zzso results in a weak increase of the zzso intensity in conjunction with a slight zzso of the maximum zzso
