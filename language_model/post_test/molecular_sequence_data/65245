zzso against the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be zzso by zzso T zzso Six zzso targeted by zzso T cells from zzso zzso cattle of different major zzso complex zzso zzso have been identified, raising the prospect of developing a zzso zzso To facilitate further dissection of the specificity of protective zzso zzso responses and to assist in the assessment of responses to zzso we set out to identify the zzso recognized in these zzso zzso zzso and their zzso restriction zzso Nine zzso in six zzso zzso zzso together with their respective zzso restriction zzso were successfully zzso Five of the zzso zzso were found to be restricted by products of previously described zzso and four were restricted by four novel restriction zzso zzso of zzso zzso responses to five of the zzso in groups of cattle carrying the defined restriction elements and zzso with live zzso demonstrated that, with one exception, the zzso were consistently recognized by animals of the respective zzso The analysis of responses was extended to animals zzso with multiple zzso delivered in separate vaccine zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were detected in 19 of 24 zzso zzso All zzso cattle mounted responses specific for zzso for which they carried an identified restriction zzso By contrast, only 8 of 19 zzso cattle displayed a response to zzso for which they did not carry an identified restriction zzso These data demonstrate that the identified zzso are inherently dominant in animals with the corresponding zzso zzso
