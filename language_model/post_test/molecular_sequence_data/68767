We report a novel method for detecting zzso zzso zzso by combining the techniques of in zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso (in zzso zzso zzso The technique could detect low zzso signals and distinguish different levels of gene zzso We examined the expression of the functional markers of activated zzso T zzso zzso A, and zzso in human zzso from in zzso zzso The amplification products were found in the cells and the zzso with the distribution critically affected by the zzso zzso zzso The specificity of amplification was confirmed by zzso analysis and Southern zzso We conclude that the in zzso zzso zzso technique offers a sensitive method of measuring the frequency of zzso cells and has significant research and clinical zzso
