zzso of zzso with the zzso acid sequence of human zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso identified a predicted gene product of unknown function on zzso clone zzso zzso on zzso band zzso as a zzso zzso The transcript, entitled zzso was cloned from an expressed sequence tag clone that contained the entire open reading frame of the transcript zzso a protein of 395 zzso zzso Analysis of the protein sequence reveal that zzso contains a signal zzso and seven zzso zzso which is a hallmark of zzso receptors zzso zzso displays zzso to zzso zzso gene 1 zzso zzso sequence zzso and to several family C zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Both zzso and zzso have short zzso zzso zzso zzso that contrast the very long zzso characterizing the receptors currently assigned to family zzso However, our results strongly indicate that zzso and zzso form a new zzso of family C characterized by short zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in peripheral and central zzso with highest abundance in zzso zzso and zzso This zzso expression pattern is markedly different from that of zzso which shows a slightly more restricted expression pattern with highest abundance in lung zzso
