The interactions of zzso small zzso zzso with four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been investigated by circular and infrared zzso zzso electron zzso and fluorescence, zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The main results obtained are the zzso zzso zzso complexes are formed by the association of one zzso acid zzso with approximately two zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso are observed between zzso when the zzso ratio p is less than zzso and a clearance effect is observed when p is higher than zzso zzso The zzso sites of the zzso on zzso molecules are the negative zzso groups through zzso interactions with the terminal zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso adopt an zzso zzso with their axis parallel to the membrane zzso The zzso part of the zzso alpha zzso can penetrate the outer zzso leaflet down to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups are not involved in the interactions between zzso molecules and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso atom mobility around the zzso bond is strongly reduced whereas that of zzso groups is progressively weakened when going up from zzso to zzso Finally, using modeling and energy calculations a model of possible zzso zzso complexes is zzso
