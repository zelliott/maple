zzso zzso was zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which grew zzso at 90 degrees C in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso had an optimal temperature of 90 degrees C and its molecular mass was estimated to be 600 zzso It consisted of 4 zzso with molecular masses of 70, 60, 29 and 15 zzso While the zzso activity was resistant to most zzso zzso the activity was reduced by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the 70 zzso zzso was similar to those of zzso zzso of zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso have a zzso zzso in their zzso
