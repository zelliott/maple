zzso factor zzso of zzso serves a dual function during zzso and early development: this zinc finger protein binds to the internal promoter element of the 5 S zzso zzso genes and acts as a positive zzso zzso zzso the protein functions in 5 S zzso zzso The central four zinc fingers zzso of the zzso protein have been shown to bind 5 S zzso with comparable or higher affinity than the full-length zzso The role of finger seven in binding affinity has been examined by deletion zzso A zzso protein binds 5 S zzso with about a zzso reduction in binding zzso compared to zzso The effect of zzso competitor DNA on binding affinities of the zinc finger peptides was examined and found to have a significant effect on the measured affinities of these peptides for full-length and truncated versions of 5 S zzso The interaction of zzso with full-length 5 S zzso was far more sensitive to zzso competitor concentration than was the zzso S zzso interaction, suggesting that finger seven contributes to both affinity and specificity in this zzso zzso In order to map zinc finger binding sites on the 5 S zzso zzso we generated truncated versions of the zzso and tested these molecules for their binding affinities with zzso and zzso Previous studies showed that a 75 zzso long zzso zzso loop A, zzso II, zzso zzso region E and zzso IV, bound zzso with high zzso zzso and amplification binding zzso zzso have now been used to generate smaller zzso binding zzso We find that a 55 zzso long zzso zzso loop A, zzso zzso region E and zzso IV, but lacking zzso II, retains high affinity for zzso These data are consistent with the proposal that fingers 4-6 bind this central core of 5 S zzso and that finger seven binds the zzso II zzso
