Throughout development, cells zzso feedback zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling as an important means to direct cellular zzso In zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso activity is tightly regulated by a complex array of zzso zzso involving an assortment of zzso zzso One zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso functions during zzso in a negative feedback loop to directly zzso zzso zzso zzso contains both zzso repeats zzso and an zzso zzso domain, two of the most prevalent motifs found within zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activity during eye development and use this role to identify zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso in directing zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we isolated zzso zzso in the zzso zzso affecting its ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization of these zzso indicated that they represent two functionally distinct zzso Class I zzso directly diminish zzso affinity for zzso while class II zzso disrupt zzso zzso zzso thereby indirectly affecting its ability to associate with and inhibit the zzso All class I zzso map to the first and second zzso of zzso suggesting a primary role for these two repeats in specifying association with and zzso of zzso zzso our analysis implicates zzso 160 of the second zzso in regulating zzso zzso
