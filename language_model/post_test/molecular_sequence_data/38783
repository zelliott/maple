The zzso zzso blood group system is the most complex of the known human blood group zzso The expression of its zzso is controlled by a zzso genetic system consisting of zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Over the past decade, there has been a rapid advance in knowledge of the zzso molecular biology, and zzso of the zzso genes and zzso The primary structures of D and zzso zzso have become well understood and the molecular genetic basis of a vast array of zzso zzso has been zzso The identification of various molecular defects associated with zzso zzso syndrome zzso the nature of the zzso zzso and modifier zzso The observed zzso spectrum defines a basic set of components essential for zzso complex assembly in the zzso zzso The resulting molecular information, combined with new experimental tools, is helping to dissect the fine structure of zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso The discovery of novel zzso zzso in primitive organisms and in zzso zzso opens new avenues of research beyond the scope of zzso and zzso zzso This review provides an update on the zzso family in zzso zzso zzso diversity, and disease zzso
