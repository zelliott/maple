The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso the cell surface expression of zzso through a zzso zzso First, zzso connects the zzso tail of zzso with zzso protein complexes zzso thereby inducing the formation of zzso zzso pits that rapidly zzso the viral zzso Second, zzso targets zzso zzso molecules for zzso Here we show that zzso accomplishes this second task by acting as a zzso between zzso and the beta zzso of zzso zzso in zzso A sequence encompassing a critical zzso zzso located nearby but distinct from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is responsible for zzso recruitment and for zzso to zzso A novel class of zzso sorting zzso based on zzso zzso is thus revealed, and zzso is identified as its downstream zzso
