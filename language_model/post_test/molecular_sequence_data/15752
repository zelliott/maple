zzso of zzso gene therapy zzso for human trials remains a major hurdle in advancing cures for a number of otherwise incurable zzso We describe a system based on a zzso transformed insect cell lines harboring helper genes required for zzso zzso Integrated genes remain silent until the cell is infected with a single zzso expression zzso zzso The induction of expression results from a combination of the amplification of integrated resident genes (up to 1,200 copies per zzso and the enhancement of the expression zzso by the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso by zzso The integration cassette incorporates an zzso binding target sequence from zzso zzso zzso multiple nuclear zzso virus, a zzso region 2 zzso A zzso loop is initiated by one of the induced zzso zzso boosting the amplification of the integrated zzso The system was tested for the coordinated expression of 7 proteins required to package zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso The described arrangement provided high levels of zzso and Cap zzso thus improving zzso yield by zzso as compared with the previously described zzso production zzso
