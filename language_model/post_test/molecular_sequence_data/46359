A novel zzso zzso was predicted based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas it has the different zzso zzso such as zzso membrane protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso membrane protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso it might be warranted to zzso the zzso to zzso zzso membrane protein zzso where letter zzso zzso to zzso Both zzso analysis and zzso zzso clearly support that the zzso zzso belongs to a new group of general bacterial zzso The zzso zzso protein with its signal sequence was zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso The mature zzso was shown to insert into outer membrane as a zzso The zzso zzso isolated from the outer zzso was studied employing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The far zzso CD spectrum of zzso was essentially identical to that of zzso zzso zzso The near zzso CD spectrum of zzso was weaker and zzso than that of zzso The zzso single-channel zzso was 180 zzso 20 zzso in zzso M zzso and was lower than that of the zzso zzso As was shown by zzso and zzso zzso membrane experiments, the zzso zzso were less zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso differed in the zzso transition temperature by about zzso The three-dimensional structural models of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated and the zzso and zzso interactions stabilizing the zzso were zzso The difference in the zzso stability of zzso and zzso zzso was established to correlate with the difference in zzso polar zzso
