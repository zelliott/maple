The mouse remains the animal of choice in transgenic experiments, creating a need for methods of evaluating the physiology of genetically modified zzso We have established and characterized two zzso models of zzso hypertension known as the zzso one clip and zzso one clip zzso The appropriate size of the clip zzso needed to induce high blood pressure was determined to be zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso induced a high percentage of zzso zzso and clips with a zzso opening did not produce zzso Four weeks after zzso zzso one clip zzso mice exhibited blood pressure approximately 20 zzso zzso higher than their zzso zzso After a similar period, this increase reached almost 35 zzso zzso in the zzso one clip zzso Depending on the model, mice develop either zzso or zzso zzso Both models are characterized by the development of cardiovascular zzso
