An zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso (now designated zzso zzso is highly specific for zzso linkage in the zzso type zzso at pH zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of several zzso regions, including zzso acid and zzso acid, bears striking similarities to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso Active site determination of the zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells was performed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso altered the drastic decrease of specific activities with Man alpha zzso and zzso as zzso and shifted the optimal pH of the zzso zzso From the present results, zzso is probably in the zzso zzso form, whereas one of four zzso acid zzso probably zzso is the zzso zzso form according to the zzso of a plausible mechanism for zzso zzso It is assumed that three zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso are probably binding sites of zzso
