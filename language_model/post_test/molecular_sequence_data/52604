The impact of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso infection on zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by differential display reverse zzso zzso zzso A zzso expressed gene tag zzso was used to isolate and identify a single zzso clone from a library prepared from zzso peripheral zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso was employed to clone a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end of the zzso DNA sequencing identified an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence revealed the eight zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso box protein zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso induced by virus zzso zzso showed zzso zzso acid similarity to human zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso expressed in various pig zzso while in zzso zzso higher expression was observed in several zzso persistent for zzso These data indicate the association of zzso zzso replication with zzso host cell zzso zzso gene zzso Finally, the zzso zzso gene was localized on zzso zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso via zzso cell panel and radiation hybrid zzso mapping zzso
