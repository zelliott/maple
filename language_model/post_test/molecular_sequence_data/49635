zzso zzso cell zzso lack zzso I zzso activity and do not zzso complex or hybrid zzso The origins of six independent zzso zzso are shown to reside in the coding region of the zzso zzso proving that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso One zzso has zzso gene transcripts of reduced size, whereas the others possess transcripts of approximately normal size and amount containing a unique zzso or transition zzso that leads to a premature stop zzso in the zzso gene coding zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a line used to generate minimally zzso membrane zzso for X-ray zzso is a G zzso that leads to a nonsense zzso after zzso acid zzso The zzso line from the zzso and in laboratory stocks, a line used widely for diverse purposes, possesses a C zzso in the zzso gene coding zzso causing a frame shift and producing a stable, truncated approximately zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were confirmed by sequencing zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso were reverted by zzso zzso and shown to zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso activity on zzso zzso Surprisingly, three zzso gene zzso changes previously reported in zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not detected in this zzso These zzso zzso provide a novel cohort for investigating the effects on zzso trafficking and kin recognition of deletion zzso of zzso expressed at zzso rather than zzso zzso
