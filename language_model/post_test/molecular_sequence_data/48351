The entry of zzso into their target cells is complex at many zzso zzso entry proceeds by a succession of interactions between viral envelope zzso and molecules on the cell zzso The process is divided into distinct steps: attachment to the cell surface, interaction with a specific entry zzso zzso of the particle zzso and cell zzso and membrane zzso Several viral envelope zzso are involved in one or several of these zzso The most zzso entry zzso in the zzso family zzso zzso are involved in membrane zzso Around this functional core, zzso have a variety of zzso binding zzso which interact with cell surface proteins often from different zzso This interaction activates and controls the actual fusion zzso zzso with cellular receptors and between viral zzso have to be tightly coordinated and regulated to guarantee successful zzso Although additional entry receptors for zzso continue to be identified, the molecular interactions between viral zzso remain mostly zzso This chapter will review our current understanding of the molecular interactions that occur during zzso entry from attachment to zzso zzso emphasis will be placed on zzso representation of zzso binding as a trigger of fusion during zzso zzso virus zzso
