zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consecutive zzso reactions of zzso zzso zzso with five molecules of zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso which constitutes the side chain of zzso We have previously reported the X-ray structure of zzso from zzso zzso which is composed entirely of zzso joined by connecting zzso and is arranged with nine core zzso around a large central cavity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Liang, zzso zzso and Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 279, zzso zzso and zzso are located on top of the active site close to where zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produce zzso indicating that the zzso larger zzso interfere with the zzso chain zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso a larger amount of zzso than the zzso zzso In the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso is pushed away by zzso thereby creating more space between those two large zzso acids to accommodate the zzso zzso A large zzso zzso at the bottom of the zzso active site serves as the zzso and determines the final product chain zzso The substitution of zzso with a small Ala, thereby removing the zzso led to the synthesis of a zzso product larger than that produced by the zzso zzso On the basis of the structure, we have zzso zzso the large zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso to Ala underneath the zzso The products of the zzso zzso reach zzso beyond the largest chain length generated by all known zzso Further modifications of the zzso reaction conditions, including new zzso zzso may allow the preparation of zzso weight zzso products resembling the rubber zzso
