zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene by its zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been investigated by two zzso methods that exploit the anomalous mobility of bent DNA in tight gel zzso A minor bend is induced by zzso and a very strong zzso centered at its upstream zzso site, is induced by zzso Despite binding to different DNA sequences on the zzso zzso gene and the previously analyzed zzso zzso zzso generates nearly identical zzso in each zzso zzso assembled zzso factor complexes bend the zzso zzso gene in the same net direction as does zzso zzso
