Earlier studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface acts as a zzso for zzso zzso virus zzso We have recently shown that bovine zzso zzso a small part of the milk protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso infection, probably by blocking the entry of the zzso The human zzso zzso which shares zzso sequence similarity with zzso zzso displayed much lower zzso zzso In the present study, a set of zzso and linear human and bovine zzso derivatives were constructed to investigate the relation between their affinity to HS and zzso zzso zzso and their zzso activity against zzso and zzso The zzso zzso proteins and several of the zzso derivatives exhibited similar affinity for zzso but the zzso proteins possess a much higher zzso activity than the smaller zzso Our zzso relationship studies on the zzso zzso confirmed that affinity for zzso that was correlated to the net positive charge, is an important factor, but does not well predict the zzso zzso zzso parameters such as zzso molecular size, spatial distribution of charged and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso structure of zzso also seem to be important factors to govern zzso activity against zzso
