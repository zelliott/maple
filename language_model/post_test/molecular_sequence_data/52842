zzso proteins are zzso zzso that play important roles in zzso transport and cell zzso We report here the characterization of a new human zzso zzso zzso zzso The composite zzso sequence is zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso It has high zzso zzso zzso with the mouse zzso zzso zzso indicating that it is the human zzso of the mouse zzso zzso has all of the structural characteristics required to function as a zzso zzso Unlike the mouse gene which is zzso zzso zzso expression appears to be tissue zzso It is widely expressed in fetal zzso abundantly expressed in adult zzso bone zzso and zzso and is expressed at low levels in heart, zzso and zzso The zzso gene is mapped to human zzso 5, band zzso spans approximately zzso of zzso DNA, and contains 19 zzso zzso maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in zzso zzso characterized by a deletion of zzso however, we detected no zzso of zzso in zzso zzso disorders with loss of zzso The description of this human zzso protein may provide a better understanding of the diversity of this large family of zzso
