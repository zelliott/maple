Nuclear zzso of zzso zzso assigned to zzso group zzso are zzso and lack zzso zzso activity and the characteristic spectral zzso of zzso a and zzso The corresponding gene was cloned by zzso zzso and identified as reading frame zzso on zzso zzso This gene was named zzso The zzso gene product is a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a putative zzso zzso targeting sequence and predicted zzso zzso Respiratory chain carriers other than zzso a and zzso and the zzso complex are present at near zzso levels in zzso zzso indicating that the zzso specifically affect zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is normal whereas zzso is barely detected among labeled zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not require zzso function, and a zzso zzso zzso did not suppress the respiratory zzso in the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso does not impair zzso or translation of the zzso Western analysis of zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso of the zzso gene greatly reduces the steady state amounts of zzso 2 and results in variable decreases in other zzso of zzso zzso A gene fusion expressing a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso integral membrane zzso These results indicate zzso to be a new member of a group of zzso proteins that function at a late stage of the zzso zzso assembly zzso
