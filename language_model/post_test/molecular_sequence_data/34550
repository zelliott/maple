zzso zzso is a large, diverse complex of species that cause zzso diseases of many economically important zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso in three zzso lineages within the Latin American zzso of zzso zzso are zzso to cacao zzso zzso sweet potato zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We paired testers of opposite mating type from zzso of these lineages to find zzso zzso Two zzso groups corresponded to the sweet potato and zzso zzso zzso The cacao lineage contained two zzso groups, corresponding to two genetic zzso centered in western Ecuador and zzso zzso Six zzso from cacao that were not members of the cacao lineage and were not zzso to cacao in an earlier study also were zzso with members of the two cacao zzso zzso Some pairings between testers from different lineages or zzso yielded zzso from which a few abnormal progeny could be recovered, typical of zzso zzso These progeny showed abnormal segregation of the zzso gene and zzso zzso showing that they were indeed the result of zzso zzso of the sweet zzso zzso and zzso lineages were indistinguishable zzso except for the presence or absence of a zzso zzso zzso state and minor differences in size of zzso bases and zzso and zzso zzso zzso originally was described from sweet zzso We describe the cacao pathogen as a new species, zzso zzso and we raise the zzso pathogen from a form to species zzso zzso
