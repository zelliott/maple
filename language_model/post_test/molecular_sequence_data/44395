The analysis of zzso zzso sequences from various zzso has allowed the categorization of the zzso into discrete zzso zzso sequences of their zzso zzso were compared in this study to investigate the evolutionary relationships between zzso zzso The functionally distinct class III zzso appear to be more closely related to zzso zzso involved in zzso than to other plant zzso The ordering of other plant zzso into additional classes mainly relied on the presence of auxiliary zzso a zzso domain and a zzso zzso the main zzso zzso The results of our zzso analyses showed that classes I and IV form discrete and zzso zzso groups derived from a common ancestral sequence that predates the divergence of zzso and zzso In contrast, other sequences included in classes zzso and II, lacking one or both types of auxiliary zzso were zzso within class I zzso indicating that they have a zzso zzso According to zzso analyses and the calculation of evolutionary rates, these zzso probably arose from different class I lineages by relatively recent deletion zzso The occurrence of such evolutionary trends in cultivated plants and their potential involvement in zzso interactions are zzso
