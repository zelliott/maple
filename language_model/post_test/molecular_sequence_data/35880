Using zzso affinity zzso on a synthetic compound zzso zzso column, three distinct zzso proteins have been identified in human zzso The molecular mass of these three distinct proteins was estimated to be 10, zzso 17 zzso respectively, by zzso gel zzso in the presence of zzso The partial zzso acid sequence revealed these proteins have zzso structures and high zzso to the predicted zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso have been considered as probably having roles in the control of cell zzso but the existence of these two proteins in zzso suggests that they have other zzso functions related to the zzso zzso zzso
