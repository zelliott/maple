Six individual peptides of the major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso were zzso zzso injection of zzso 6 into mice prolonged the survival of zzso zzso or zzso skin zzso on zzso zzso and zzso mice, zzso This was specific, as control skin zzso from zzso zzso or zzso zzso donors, respectively, were rejected at the same time in both control and zzso zzso The optimal doses for zzso 6, which is from the alpha 2 domain, were zzso The test system was the zzso of proliferation in zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was specific, as proliferation in response to third-party zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso Of the six peptides of zzso tested, potent zzso cells were induced by peptides 2 zzso 1 zzso and 5 and 6 zzso 2 zzso The greatest zzso activity was obtained by giving zzso 2 to mice that had already been zzso against zzso by injecting zzso zzso Under the same conditions, injecting zzso 2 did not induce any zzso T zzso In contrast, specific zzso zzso zzso were induced when cells from primed mice were incubated for 4 days with heated zzso cells from zzso zzso The data suggest that peptides from zzso class I molecules activate precursors of zzso T cells, but not of zzso and this may explain their ability to prolong skin zzso zzso
