Group A zzso zzso causes a wide variety of human diseases, and at the same time, zzso can also circulate without producing symptoms, similar to its close zzso relative, group G zzso zzso We previously identified, by zzso zzso the zzso invasion locus zzso zzso is a zzso regulated locus which is activated by the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso system zzso Here we characterize the DNA promoter region necessary for zzso zzso This site is composed of two direct repeats of 10 zzso separated by a zzso of 11 zzso Fusion of this site to zzso allowed us to systematically introduce zzso zzso in the repeats region and to assess the relative contribution of various positions to promoter zzso We then developed an zzso giving different weights to these positions, and performed a zzso zzso search which was validated by zzso zzso We identified 13 zzso mostly zzso zzso that are directly under the control of zzso Having developed the ability to zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso prompted us to search for zzso and zzso strains that sense and produce zzso While the majority of zzso strains lost zzso all zzso strains examined still possess the locus and approximately zzso are able to respond to zzso added zzso By triggering the zzso circle using a minute concentration of synthetic zzso we identified zzso and zzso strains that are capable of sensing and naturally producing zzso and showed that zzso can be sensed across these zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be involved in colonization and establishment of zzso zzso zzso
