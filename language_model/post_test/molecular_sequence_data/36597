A zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso expression library of zzso zzso and showing restricted specificity at the DNA level zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been previously zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicated that it had notable similarity to zzso Further characterization using in zzso zzso has localized the zzso in the muscle of the adult zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso recognized a zzso zzso in zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso The same zzso also recognized zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using the rabbit zzso revealed the presence of the zzso in the adult muscle tissue and in the zzso the same zzso inhibited the binding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso toward zzso B of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and also to zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso data, structural location, competitive zzso and zzso we conclude that zzso is related to zzso or a similar zzso zzso
