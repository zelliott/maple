The development of zzso retinal cell architecture is highly zzso in all zzso zzso that a common fundamental molecular mechanism is involved in the generation of the organized zzso However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of retinal development are not fully zzso Here we have identified the zzso zzso of prune and show that it is expressed in both zzso and differentiated retinal zzso during zzso Interestingly, these spatial and zzso expression patterns coincide with the expression of prune binding partners, the zzso family zzso zzso of prune in retinal precursor cells significantly increases the ratio of zzso zzso cells as observed by zzso of zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso However, a zzso form of prune that has replacement of four zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso essential for zzso activity, does not exhibit zzso zzso Our observations suggest that zzso prune may regulate zzso zzso through zzso regulation of zzso family zzso
