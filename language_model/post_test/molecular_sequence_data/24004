zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are cardiac hormones zzso and zzso by the zzso cells of the zzso They exert potent actions on body fluid zzso Since various body zzso including the heart are under high zzso stress during water and food deprivation in the desert zzso we intended to perform molecular biological and zzso studies of zzso in the heart of the zzso camel zzso zzso Initially, we isolated zzso zzso zzso from the atrium and zzso from the atrium and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso mature zzso deduced from the zzso zzso was identical to that of human and pig zzso but the putative mature zzso was more diverse and was most similar to pig zzso zzso zzso Thus, we used zzso raised against human zzso that did not zzso with pig zzso in the subsequent zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells are most concentrated in the right atrium, to a lesser extent in the left atrium, and almost absent in the left zzso The zzso cells are scattered zzso in each region and are characterized by the presence of zzso zzso deposits around the zzso The left atrium comprises some ramifications of zzso cells zzso zzso some of which also contained zzso zzso At the electron microscopic level, zzso cells possessed zzso zzso primarily in the zzso zone and a well-developed zzso zzso The present study is the first comprehensive report dealing with the molecular cloning and zzso zzso of zzso in the heart of a desert dwelling zzso
