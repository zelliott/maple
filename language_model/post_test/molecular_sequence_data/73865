alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and are important in the maintenance of zzso in a wide variety of animal zzso Previous studies have shown that in mice zzso zzso evolution of alpha zzso is characterized by gene amplification, zzso concerted evolution, and rapid zzso of zzso acid zzso The latter occurs primarily in the zzso center, which is the region of the alpha zzso zzso that determines the zzso specificity for target zzso The zzso zzso within the zzso center, which is zzso in so-called zzso alpha zzso and an zzso acid other than zzso in zzso alpha zzso is a primary zzso of inhibitor zzso In the present study, we find that the expression of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is zzso within zzso species, zzso among individuals or zzso zzso This is in striking contrast to zzso that zzso zzso alpha zzso whose zzso are relatively zzso The zzso variations in zzso expression represent zzso in the structure of the alpha zzso gene zzso The results, taken together with previously described aspects of alpha zzso evolution, indicate that the dissimilar levels of zzso exhibited by zzso and zzso alpha zzso which likely have distinct zzso functions, may reflect different levels of selective zzso The significance of this finding to the evolution of gene families is zzso
