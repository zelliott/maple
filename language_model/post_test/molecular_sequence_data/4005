We recently reported the finding of zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso and G zzso zzso viruses circulating among injecting drug users in the region of zzso in northwestern zzso Here, we report the characterization of near full-length zzso sequences of nine of these viruses zzso zzso zzso and two of zzso G zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that six zzso viruses share an identical mosaic structure, with two zzso zzso zzso a B zzso segment zzso most of zzso zzso and the external portion of zzso zzso with the remaining portions of the zzso being of zzso G, thus mimicking a zzso zzso zzso The seventh zzso zzso virus exhibits zzso in zzso zzso with the other zzso viruses but contains additional B zzso segments in gag and zzso In zzso trees of complete zzso and of the B zzso segment of zzso all seven zzso viruses group in a zzso zzso G zzso portions of the zzso viruses group zzso with the newly derived zzso G zzso viruses of zzso in zzso analysis, which points to the locally circulating G zzso strain as parental of the zzso These results allow us to define a new zzso circulating zzso form zzso the first reported to originate in Western zzso
