The sequence of a zzso zzso region from human zzso 6 zzso B zzso strain zzso is described zzso zzso number zzso zzso of protein zzso for zzso predicted gene products revealed zzso zzso of six proteins zzso both in genetic context and zzso acid sequence throughout the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These include proteins involved in viral DNA zzso packaging and zzso zzso and zzso proteins of undefined zzso The close evolutionary relationship of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso was confirmed by identification of several protein sequences zzso only by these zzso including zzso of the zzso early zzso family and a series of zzso open reading frames predicted to zzso zzso zzso zzso of essential zzso replication zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso from the zzso replication zzso each zzso contains a region of zzso small open reading zzso The evolution of this region and its potential use in the development of a viral zzso system are zzso
