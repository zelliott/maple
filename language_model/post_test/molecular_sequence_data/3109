zzso are a zzso of zzso zzso proteins which interact with zzso The primary structure of zzso I, III, zzso VIII and zzso contain a region enriched in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso towards the zzso end while zzso II, V and VI possess zzso regions somewhat zzso to the zzso These zzso sequences are believed to be the signals for rapid zzso zzso zzso I is known to be zzso by zzso near its zzso region suggesting that its zzso region might be a possible zzso recognition zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso V and zzso in rat lung zzso suggest that these proteins are resistant to zzso by zzso zzso V was found to be stable to intrinsic lung zzso in the presence of either zzso or zzso while zzso zzso was found to be partially zzso by intrinsic lung zzso in the presence of zzso Eight of the 10 known zzso zzso also contain a zzso sequence that is zzso related to the zzso motif which is a known signal that targets protein for zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso may be regulated by limited zzso most likely at their zzso end, while most, if not all, of them might be zzso by the zzso zzso
