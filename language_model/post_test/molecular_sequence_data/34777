Our paper describes the first zzso zzso for determining protein structures de zzso solely from experimental zzso We show how the global nature of a certain kind of zzso data provides quantifiable zzso benefits, allowing us to zzso our zzso as running in zzso zzso While our zzso uses zzso data as zzso it is the first zzso zzso to zzso high-resolution structures de zzso using any zzso data, from either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for protein structure determination are needed, because zzso the process is expensive and zzso For example, an area of intense research in zzso methodology is automated assignment of nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso in which structure determination sits in a tight zzso zzso of zzso These zzso are very zzso and typically require a large zzso Thus, zzso for protein structure determination that are known to run in zzso time and provide guarantees on solution accuracy are likely to have great impact in the zzso zzso stemming from a technique called zzso geometry zzso do come with zzso guarantees, but the zzso of these problem zzso implies that in the worst case these techniques cannot run in zzso zzso We are able to avoid the zzso by zzso some mild assumptions about the protein being zzso zzso the use of residual zzso zzso zzso instead of a dense network of zzso and zzso novel zzso and zzso that exploit the zzso geometry of zzso and zzso drawing on a variety of computer science, zzso zzso and zzso algebra zzso In our algorithm, zzso data, which gives global restraints on the orientation of zzso bond zzso is used in conjunction with very sparse zzso data to obtain a zzso zzso for protein structure zzso An zzso of our zzso has been applied to 6 different real biological zzso data sets recorded for 3 zzso Our zzso is zzso precise, zzso and uses much less zzso data to produce results that are as good or better than previous approaches in terms of accuracy of the zzso structure as well as running zzso In practice approaches such as restrained molecular dynamics and simulated zzso which lack both zzso precision and guarantees on running time and solution quality, are commonly zzso Our results show that by using a different zzso of the data, an zzso that is zzso time and that has guarantees about solution quality can be zzso We believe that our techniques can be extended and generalized for other zzso problems such as computing zzso zzso and the structure of zzso acids from experimental zzso
