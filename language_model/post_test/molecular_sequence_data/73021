zzso zzso channels generate the zzso inward current that is critical for the initiation and zzso of action zzso To study the roles of zzso channels in zzso zzso we have begun the molecular analysis of zzso channels in zzso zzso We have isolated zzso that zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso which we have named zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame that predicts a protein of zzso zzso zzso which is highly similar to other members of the zzso channel zzso gene zzso zzso protection zzso carried out on various zzso zzso indicated that zzso is expressed predominantly in the nervous zzso All of the zzso zzso tested were negative with the exceptions that low levels of expression were observed in zzso and zzso probably due to the presence of small numbers of zzso within these tissue zzso Southern zzso zzso at reduced stringency indicated that the zzso of zzso contains more than one zzso channel zzso zzso
