The zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso that have been detected in a wide variety of cell zzso In skeletal muscle cells, zzso proteins interact with members of the zzso family of zzso zzso to zzso activate gene zzso Similar interactions with tissue or zzso zzso may also zzso zzso function in other cell zzso In order to screen for such zzso we have used a zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso This approach has identified a novel protein expressed in the early zzso that binds to zzso and zzso The zzso interacting zzso zzso zzso protein binds to the zzso zzso region of the zzso proteins but does not bind to the related zzso zzso protein serum response zzso In the early zzso zzso expression zzso at the zzso stage within the mature zzso and is subsequently restricted to the zzso zzso In functional zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and we show that this repression is zzso by direct binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Thus, we propose that zzso acts as a zzso recruiting a specific zzso to zzso zzso zzso
