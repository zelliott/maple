zzso zzso channels belonging to the recently discovered zzso family of genes have been found in several human zzso including zzso and central and peripheral zzso We describe here the molecular cloning of a zzso zzso a novel human zzso zzso channel zzso that is principally expressed in the small zzso and has been called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein is similar to the recently identified zzso channel zzso and is relatively close to the acid sensing zzso channels zzso (79 and zzso zzso acid identity, zzso zzso are activated by zzso zzso and probably participate in sensory zzso to zzso linked to tissue zzso zzso is not activated by lowering the external pH but zzso zzso can be introduced and reveal when expressed in zzso zzso an important zzso channel activity which is blocked by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest the existence of a still unknown zzso zzso for zzso zzso an zzso zzso The presence of this new zzso zzso channel in human small zzso probably has interesting zzso as well as zzso implications that remain to be zzso The large zzso of this channel by point zzso may be associated with a zzso behavior as previously observed for channels expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene has been mapped on the zzso region of the human zzso
