zzso C virus zzso replicates its zzso in a zzso replication complex, composed of viral zzso replicating zzso and altered cellular zzso We describe here zzso zzso that allow the direct zzso of functional zzso replication zzso zzso zzso selected from a library of zzso random insertions in the coding sequence of zzso protein zzso zzso allowed the identification of two sites near the zzso C zzso that tolerated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso at these locations were only moderately impaired for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fusion protein could be demonstrated by zzso indicating that the zzso was retained during zzso replication and did not interfere with zzso zzso zzso More importantly, expression levels were robust enough to allow direct zzso of the fusion protein by zzso zzso zzso appeared as brightly zzso zzso structures in the zzso By zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso proteins and nascent viral zzso indicating that the zzso structures, identified as zzso zzso by electron zzso represent functional zzso replication zzso These findings reveal an unexpected flexibility of the zzso domain of zzso and provide tools for studying the formation and turnover of zzso replication complexes in living zzso
