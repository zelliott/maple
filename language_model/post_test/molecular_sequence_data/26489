zzso biological processes usually require precise definition of zzso and 3' zzso zzso ends obtained by in zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso are often zzso in length and zzso An efficient strategy to overcome these drawbacks consists of inserting an zzso with known boundaries in between two zzso usually a zzso zzso and a 3' zzso delta virus zzso that cleave off the desired zzso In practice, folding of the three zzso challenges each other, potentially preventing thorough zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso relies on a sequence of zzso belonging to the central zzso making it more sensitive than the usual 3' zzso delta virus zzso The intrinsic stability of the central zzso may thus prevent correct processing of the full zzso Here, we present a method in which incorporation of a full-length zzso zzso with a specific zzso interaction prevents alternative folding with the zzso capping zzso zzso and enables complete zzso in the course of the zzso This strategy may be zzso for in zzso zzso of any highly structured zzso
