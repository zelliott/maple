The recent cloning of multiple zzso receptors has moved our understanding of these receptors from a conceptual one zzso zzso to one based on zzso unique cellular zzso The zzso and pharmacological properties of these receptors can now be studied in detail by expression of a single zzso in cells normally devoid of zzso zzso By zzso zzso the relationship between the structures of these receptors and their function is now being zzso for each zzso zzso zzso These functions include the binding of catecholamines and other zzso G protein zzso and functional zzso
