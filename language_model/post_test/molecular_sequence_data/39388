The zzso response zzso protein zzso also known as zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso regulates the zzso expression of a battery of genes crucial for the adaptation of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso is regulated at multiple levels, including zzso zzso zzso protein can be detected in both the zzso and nucleus under zzso conditions, although it accumulates exclusively in the nucleus or zzso when subjected to zzso or zzso challenges, zzso Using zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso the protein zzso that determine its zzso zzso were identified and zzso We found that zzso nuclear import is regulated by a nuclear zzso zzso However, under zzso conditions, nuclear export of zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso nuclear export sequence zzso located in the N zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso protein that accumulated in the nucleus under zzso conditions but remained a target for zzso nuclear zzso More importantly, a putative auxiliary export domain zzso to the zzso was zzso zzso of the auxiliary export domain alone is sufficient to abolish the nuclear export of zzso induced by zzso By using zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso interacts with zzso but not with a zzso protein deficient in zzso Our findings provide insight into how zzso trafficking of zzso is regulated by changes in zzso zzso
