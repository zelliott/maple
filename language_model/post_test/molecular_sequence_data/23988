zzso acid binding proteins zzso are members of a zzso of zzso proteins and occur zzso in zzso and zzso This study was designed to clone and characterize the zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso were designed according to zzso zzso gene sequence to amplify partial zzso of zzso gene from chicken zzso zzso and the full length of the gene was cloned by zzso and zzso Analysis of sequence showed that the zzso of the chicken zzso gene was 74 and zzso zzso with zzso and human zzso zzso zzso The similarity was 77, 28, and zzso at the predicted zzso acid level with human zzso human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis indicated that the chicken zzso zzso similar to that of the zzso is only expressed in fat zzso This is the first report to identify and characterize zzso gene in the zzso
