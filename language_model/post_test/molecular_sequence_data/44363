zzso zzso an zzso involved in zzso degradation by zzso zzso 86, had been identified as a class zzso zzso zzso iron zzso based on its zzso and zzso properties zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso components of the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso was localized approximately 15 zzso downstream of zzso zzso of both genes was detected in a zzso zzso zzso In the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso component zzso zzso zzso zzso putative binding sites for a zzso zzso center, for zzso zzso zzso and for zzso were zzso The arrangement of these zzso binding sites is zzso in all known class zzso zzso A zzso of zzso confirmed the similarity of zzso to other class zzso zzso The zzso component zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors the zzso zzso acid motifs proposed to bind the zzso zzso cluster and the zzso zzso In contrast to known class zzso zzso zzso which are composed of differing zzso zzso is a zzso which is typical for class zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso indeed revealed that zzso is more related to class zzso than to class zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso consists of a class zzso zzso and a class zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso may be composed of modular elements having different zzso zzso
