A part of zzso zzso genes harbor an zzso at one zzso 3' to the zzso so that removal of the zzso is an essential processing step for zzso zzso While some zzso zzso have important roles in modification of certain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso has not been tested zzso This is partly because most of the zzso zzso have multiple genes zzso an zzso zzso Here, we examined whether the zzso of zzso zzso six copies of which are scattered on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is essential for growth or translation of the zzso in zzso We devised a procedure to remove all of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso with marker zzso containing both positive and negative zzso Using this zzso we removed all the zzso from the six zzso zzso and found that the zzso strain grew normally and expressed zzso in an amount similar to that of the zzso zzso Neither incorporation of zzso zzso acids into a zzso fraction nor the major protein pattern on zzso gel were affected by complete removal of the zzso while expression levels of some proteins were marginally zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso for growth and bulk translation of the zzso This raises the possibility that some mechanism other than selective pressure from zzso efficiency maintains the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso
