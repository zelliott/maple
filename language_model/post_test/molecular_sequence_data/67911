zzso zzso are zzso zzso but opportunistic infections of some strains of the organisms cause severe diseases such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso encephalitis in zzso In this study, we identified a gene zzso iron zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and characterized zzso and functional properties of the zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with those of previously reported zzso zzso zzso from other zzso zzso showed that zzso shared common zzso zzso and motifs that are zzso in zzso The zzso length of the zzso gene was zzso zzso consisting of five zzso interrupted by four zzso The zzso zzso showed similar zzso characteristics with its native zzso and shared typical zzso properties with other characterized zzso including molecular structure, broad pH zzso and sensitivity to hydrogen zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso localized in the zzso of the zzso zzso and expression level of the zzso were significantly increased under zzso stressed zzso These results collectively suggest that zzso may play essential roles in the survival of the zzso not only by protecting itself from zzso zzso stress but also by detoxifying zzso killing of the zzso by host immune zzso zzso
