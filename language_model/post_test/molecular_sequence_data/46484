zzso zzso editing zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso share a significant degree of sequence zzso However, zzso experiments have reported that zzso and zzso differ in their functional roles during the zzso editing zzso In this study, we zzso that dissimilar roles for zzso and zzso proteins arise from their different zzso zzso To test our hypothesis at sequence level, we plotted theoretical zzso zzso for zzso zzso and their binding partner zzso The plots showed a lower zzso point for zzso compared to that for zzso as well as more relative zzso and acidity for binding partner proteins of zzso and zzso at net charge zero, zzso At structure level, based on the available high resolution structure of zzso zzso domain and strong sequence similarity between zzso and other zzso we built the zzso model of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso approach, we calculated the zzso potential zzso of zzso structure and zzso zzso zzso and zzso coordinates differed in their zzso zzso zzso A wider negative patch on the surface of zzso suggests differential affinity for another protein compared to zzso In contrast, a larger positive patch on the zzso surface predicts its differential affinity and/or specificity for its zzso zzso zzso we employed in zzso zzso scanning and identified the zzso zzso contributing to the long-range zzso energy of zzso We predict that two structurally zzso zzso of zzso not previously reported in the literature, also recognize their zzso zzso Our results provide important information about the zzso properties of zzso editing zzso that could contribute to the zzso step of zzso zzso
