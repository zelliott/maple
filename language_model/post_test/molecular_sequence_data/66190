zzso is a zzso protein with zzso activity in zzso and zzso neural zzso We report here that zzso is an zzso zzso protein and that its zzso activity is dependent on the binding of zzso to its zzso zzso zzso zzso At first, we found that at least a portion of the zzso zzso zzso appeared to bind zzso because the zzso zzso solution was zzso with green and had a sharp zzso peak at 402 zzso The addition of zzso zzso extensively increased the amount of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso a zzso lacking the zzso domain, could not bind zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso that bound zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than that of the zzso zzso in either primary cultured zzso or zzso cells, suggesting that the activity of zzso depends on zzso The zzso activity of zzso was enhanced by the binding of zzso IX, but neither zzso IX nor zzso IX zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference significantly decreased cell survival in zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso possibly contains zzso The experiment with zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso detected in the culture medium of zzso cells was associated with zzso because it was not retained on a zzso column at zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso protein that shows signal zzso activity by zzso The present findings may shed new light on the function of zzso zzso zzso
