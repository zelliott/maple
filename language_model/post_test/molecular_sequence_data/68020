We have developed a continuous zzso zzso gel zzso system in which small amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso are continuously zzso from one-dimensional zzso gel columns in either native or zzso zzso Depending on the zzso parameters proteins are separated according to their size and/or net zzso The system is based on a simple modification of the zzso II zzso unit from zzso zzso The apparatus is connected zzso to a zzso liquid zzso allowing accurate delivery of the zzso zzso and direct analysis of the separated samples by zzso zzso The high resolution of the apparatus allows the zzso of individual zzso even from complex zzso in only one step, with overall zzso of approximately zzso In addition to standard proteins the system has been applied to the zzso of the zzso and thus highly zzso zzso I and II from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso character of these zzso has hindered their zzso by other conventional zzso zzso zzso were collected directly into a buffer suitable for zzso zzso and automated zzso acid sequence zzso The internal zzso acid sequences determined could all be found in the DNA sequence recently reported by Santana et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby confirming the expression of such an zzso
