Numerous zzso data have documented that chronic infection by zzso C virus zzso is a major risk factor for the development of zzso zzso zzso But the molecular mechanism underlying these strong zzso associations between zzso and zzso has not be zzso We observed the changes of zzso in zzso to investigate the association of zzso with zzso 

We used competitive and quantitative zzso chain reaction and zzso chain termination method to compare zzso zzso and sequences of the zzso region of zzso region of four zzso from the zzso and surrounding zzso liver zzso in tow zzso positive zzso 

The copy numbers of zzso were 1 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso wet weight of zzso and 8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso wet weight of zzso liver zzso from zzso and zzso The sequence differences between zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso liver were two and five zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences were changed in one and two site in each zzso 

These findings may suggest the possible zzso role of zzso in zzso of zzso but complete sequence analysis of zzso including multiple zzso in the same patient, should be performed in many zzso
