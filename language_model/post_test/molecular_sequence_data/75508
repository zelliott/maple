The primary structure of the zzso form of horse liver zzso zzso has been determined, utilizing zzso analyses and zzso with other zzso zzso The zzso exhibits zzso zzso in size similar to that for the corresponding human zzso zzso the longest form having 500 zzso zzso was identified as a contaminant of the zzso All four pairs within a set of zzso zzso can now be zzso including the same two species zzso zzso and zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso revealing characteristic differences although zzso and other segments of presumed functional importance are zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are clearly different zzso exchanges in the horse zzso 160 exchanges in the human zzso and the zzso forms are more zzso zzso exchanges of 500 zzso than the zzso ones zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso also differ between the two zzso zzso These results suggest a comparatively distant separation of the zzso and zzso zzso into forms with separate functional constraints that are more strict on the zzso than the zzso zzso zzso positions with zzso unique to one of the four zzso are about twice as common in both of the horse proteins than in either of the human zzso This difference may reflect a general pattern for zzso zzso showing that not only functional properties of the zzso but also other factors, such as generation time zzso in man than in zzso are important for zzso zzso
