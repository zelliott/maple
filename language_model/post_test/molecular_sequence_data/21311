DNA from two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from hair zzso of zzso individuals, was fully zzso zzso and zzso The complete zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Both contain genes for at least six zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso upstream regulatory region located between the zzso and E6 zzso spanning zzso in zzso zzso positions zzso to 350) and zzso in zzso zzso positions zzso to zzso zzso and zzso are zzso placed within the zzso zzso and are most closely related to zzso and zzso zzso As in other members of this zzso the zzso zzso region is very short and does not zzso for an zzso zzso Both zzso contain typical zinc binding zzso in their E6 and zzso zzso but zzso lacks the regular zzso core sequence within its zzso zzso In order to assess the tissue zzso and clinical significance of the novel zzso quantitative zzso real-time zzso zzso were zzso The zzso detection limits of the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Testing of a representative collection of zzso zzso and zzso benign and zzso zzso and hair zzso zzso of 540 zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are relatively rare zzso with a zzso zzso Both zzso were found in sporadic cases of common warts and SCC and zzso of the skin as single or multiple infections usually with low viral zzso zzso can establish persistent infection of hair zzso in zzso zzso A partial zzso sequence of a putative novel zzso zzso related to zzso was identified in a zzso cell zzso of the skin obtained from a zzso old zzso male zzso
