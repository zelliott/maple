zzso zzso zzso play zzso often critical, roles in all processes where zzso are zzso Members of this family of proteins are linked to human disease, including cancer and viral zzso zzso proteins contain two zzso zzso that both contribute to zzso and zzso zzso Despite recent advances the molecular details of how these zzso convert chemical energy into zzso zzso is zzso We present crystal structures of the isolated zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Together with prior knowledge this enables a zzso comparative structural zzso We propose a general mechanism for opening of the zzso binding zzso This analysis also provides insights into the diversity of zzso zzso with implications for understanding the functions of individual family zzso
