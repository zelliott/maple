The zzso zzso virus zzso protein functions as a potent zzso zzso and targets DNA sites with the consensus zzso present in all the viral zzso gene zzso To do so, zzso directs assembly of a zzso complex involving two cellular zzso host cell factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the importance of specific zzso interactions to formation of this zzso complex zzso we used zzso to prevent zzso zzso Linear and zzso peptides corresponding to a region of zzso previously implicated in complex formation were potent zzso of zzso zzso To further characterize the protein interactions involved, we cloned a human zzso zzso the minimal zzso interaction domain of zzso containing zzso acids 1 to 380 zzso zzso The zzso peptides active in preventing zzso assembly were found to specifically block binding of zzso to zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso The zzso activity of these zzso peptides was strictly sequence specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain revealed zzso zzso and zzso to be critical zzso in support of zzso zzso zzso of a single zzso in zzso zzso was shown to virtually abolish complex zzso Interestingly however, none of the zzso zzso that were impaired in their ability to support complex formation exhibited defects in direct zzso zzso supporting loss of function at a higher order in complex zzso
