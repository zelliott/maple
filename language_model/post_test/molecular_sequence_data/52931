zzso transfer of zzso DNA during bacterial zzso zzso and zzso at a specific origin of transfer, zzso We have investigated the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso with regard to the initiation and termination of DNA zzso Using zzso plasmids containing two zzso repeated zzso zzso sequences with or without zzso the zzso required for initiation and termination were determined by examining zzso deletion between the repeated zzso The zzso zzso required for initiation was found to be identical to the zzso zzso core sequence consisting of two units, the zzso zzso region sequence and the zzso repeat A zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso region sequence and two sets of zzso repeat sequences within the zzso minimal zzso sequence were required for efficient zzso zzso repeat A sequences lacking zzso ability were found to be sufficient for zzso suggesting that the zzso repeat structures are involved in the termination zzso A zzso of the DNA segment between the repeated zzso was also found after zzso of the zzso carrying zzso but zzso zzso and zzso but zzso zzso suggesting that the 3' zzso of the transferred strand is zzso by zzso zzso
