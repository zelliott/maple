A family of zzso elements belonging to the zzso group of DNA zzso is described from an zzso the plant pathogen zzso zzso The family, named zzso was identified by studying a hotspot for zzso and DNA zzso insertions adjacent to the mating type zzso The zzso family comprises a small number of full-length copies, each of which is zzso zzso long and predicted to zzso a zzso protein consisting of zzso zzso zzso and several truncated zzso Both types contain zzso terminal zzso repeats and are flanked by zzso target site zzso Despite the detection of a zzso transcript and of many zzso between zzso conclusive evidence of recent zzso was not zzso A zzso analysis indicated that zzso was novel, with only modest similarity to some elements from plants and zzso Relatives were detected in only some members of the zzso This is the first DNA zzso identified in the zzso group of zzso
