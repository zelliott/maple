We describe six new zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene found in patients with zzso zzso These zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso analysis of amplified zzso DNA and characterized by direct sequencing of zzso zzso Three of the zzso were found in males who had zzso onset of zzso The zzso are a single base deletion zzso in zzso 5 at zzso zzso causing a zzso error, a zzso to zzso substitution at the 3' end of zzso 2 zzso 217 zzso causing an zzso zzso site error, and a zzso to zzso substitution at base 236 changing the code from zzso to zzso acid at position 47 of the mature zzso Two different zzso were found in two males whose onset of clinical problems occurred after the zzso zzso One patient had a zzso to zzso zzso in the sense strand of zzso 3 at zzso 281 resulting in a substitution of zzso for zzso in position 62 of the mature zzso zzso This substitution changes the composition of the putative active site for zzso zzso from zzso to zzso The second patient has a zzso to zzso substitution at zzso zzso of the sense strand of zzso 9, changing the code for zzso to zzso in position 272 of the mature zzso zzso This changes a zzso domain of the gene likely to be the zzso binding site from zzso to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
