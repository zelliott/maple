To facilitate zzso studies in zzso zzso we have developed an in zzso zzso system for this zzso used as an industrial producer of zzso acids and a model zzso for zzso This system consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor and a zzso DNA template, that is specifically recognized by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso core was zzso from the zzso zzso strain with the modified zzso zzso which produced zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were cloned and zzso using the zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by affinity zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition of the zzso and zzso promoters and synthesis of the specific transcripts was zzso The developed in zzso zzso system is a novel tool that can be used to directly prove the specific recognition of a promoter by the particular zzso zzso and to analyze zzso control by various regulatory proteins in zzso zzso
