The zzso B zzso variable number of tandem repeat zzso zzso containing larger repeat units is a risk factor for coronary heart zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso solution was applied to the analysis of zzso chain reaction zzso amplified zzso zzso locus for DNA diagnosis of heart zzso The zzso separation gives an excellent resolution of two zzso differing by one or two 16 zzso repeat units in the DNA size range up to 600 zzso with high zzso The zzso zzso differing in length by 2 or 4 repeat units are readily distinguishable by zzso in the DNA size range from 600 to 1000 zzso The plate number achieved was 1 million plates per zzso zzso combining with zzso provides an excellent technique for accurate determination of the number of repeat units of zzso zzso zzso and differentiation of zzso from zzso zzso Using the zzso technique, the zzso zzso zzso from some individuals in zzso were examined towards precise DNA diagnosis for coronary heart zzso
