zzso genes in zzso zzso the only zzso besides zzso zzso to zzso humans in America, are organized in zzso alternate alpha and beta gene tandem repeats of zzso zzso The basic repeat was zzso mapped and partially zzso In contrast to most other zzso where zzso genes are scattered throughout the zzso zzso so far studied are characterized by tandem arrangements of these genes with the zzso zzso displaying an alternating zzso and zzso tandem zzso
