In order to improve the zzso of zzso envelope zzso we have fused zzso to a carrier zzso zzso B surface zzso zzso which is capable of spontaneous assembly into zzso zzso The zzso hybrid proteins assembled efficiently into zzso zzso zzso The particles resemble native zzso particles in size and density, consistent with a zzso composition of about zzso and a zzso content of about 100 per zzso zzso zzso folds in its native zzso and is biologically active, as shown by high affinity binding of zzso The particles express zzso zzso targeted by a panel of broadly zzso zzso zzso and they show tight packing of zzso Because the particles are zzso zzso an array of zzso on their surface closely mimics zzso on the surface of zzso zzso These zzso particles can enhance the quality, as well as zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso
