The complete sequences of zzso disease virus zzso zzso segments 5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained and comprised zzso zzso zzso zzso 1959 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each segment contained a single zzso which zzso putative proteins of 115 zzso 97 zzso 69 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso acid sequences zzso by zzso and zzso contained putative zzso zzso motifs while zzso zzso and zzso each contained an zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed most similarity to the corresponding segments of Rice zzso dwarf zzso Based on sequence similarities, it is predicted that zzso zzso encodes a minor core zzso while zzso zzso encodes an outer zzso zzso The evolutionary relationships of zzso to other zzso are zzso
