zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso product of zzso and is known to be a strong block to zzso DNA zzso A previously solved structure of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso in the sequence context zzso shed light on how zzso blocks primer zzso The protruding zzso group of the oxidized zzso zzso the adjacent zzso which can no longer serve as a template for primer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, Wallace, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso A structural rationale for zzso of a zzso DNA zzso at the most common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 104, zzso Several studies showed that in the sequence context zzso zzso is more likely to be zzso by zzso fragment, an zzso DNA zzso We set out to investigate the role of sequence context in zzso bypass in a zzso zzso and to solve the crystal structures of the zzso zzso DNA zzso in complex with zzso DNA in the three remaining sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso A combination of several zzso the associated zzso activity, the nature of the 3' and zzso bases surrounding zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We also zzso for the first time the structure of a zzso zzso complex, allowing us to identify and confirm the role of key zzso zzso zzso and zzso in strand separation and in the stabilization of the primer strand in the zzso zzso
