zzso protein zzso activity in the zzso of the green zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Using zzso and an zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein was identified as the major zzso protein zzso Its activity was directly zzso by zzso a characteristic of the zzso domain protein zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso alpha from soybean zzso with the zzso protein in the zzso and also with other proteins in the zzso and cell zzso The same zzso zzso were used to screen a zzso zzso zzso expression library in order to isolate zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein with a zzso and zzso domain linked by a junction domain typical of zzso From Southern zzso evidence was obtained for a zzso gene family in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
