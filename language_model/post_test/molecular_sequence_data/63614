zzso 1 and 2 are zzso zzso zzso zzso that can positively regulate zzso zzso and interact with multiple cellular zzso Recent reports implicated zzso as tumor zzso and potential targets of zzso zzso We examined expression of zzso in colon tumors and immune response to these zzso in patients with different types of zzso 

zzso and protein expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso immune response to zzso zzso was investigated by modified zzso zzso Cellular immune response was zzso by zzso and zzso release zzso 

We found that both zzso and protein levels of zzso 2 zzso are zzso in colon zzso In contrast, protein level of zzso 1 zzso is zzso while zzso level shows variable zzso More than a quarter of colon cancer patients develop zzso immune response to at least one of the two zzso In this study we mapped common and unique zzso zzso located in different zzso of the two zzso Additionally, we present evidence for zzso responses both to zzso that are unique for zzso and to those shared between zzso and zzso 

Our study favors a zzso usage of zzso response to zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to these zzso are rare and further investigation is needed to evaluate zzso as potential targets for cancer zzso
