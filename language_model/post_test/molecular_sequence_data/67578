zzso mats containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso develop at zzso hot spring in zzso Under zzso conditions in these mats, zzso interaction between zzso bacteria as zzso producers and zzso zzso as a zzso consumer has been proposed to constitute a sulfur zzso however, the electron donor zzso for microbial zzso production at zzso remains to be zzso In order to determine this electron donor and its source, ex zzso experimental incubation of mats was zzso In the presence of zzso which zzso biological zzso reduction, hydrogen gas was released from mat samples, indicating that this hydrogen is normally consumed as an electron donor by zzso zzso zzso production decreased under zzso indicating that zzso zzso also functions as a hydrogen zzso Small amounts of hydrogen may have also been consumed for sulfur zzso zzso library analysis of zzso zzso genes amplified from the mats indicated the existence of several species of zzso zzso zzso Among them, the most dominant zzso zzso zzso was successfully zzso This isolate produced hydrogen through the zzso of organic zzso zzso of microbial cells in the mats resulted in hydrogen production without the addition of zzso suggesting that simultaneous production and consumption of hydrogen in the mats requires dense packing of zzso We propose a zzso electron flow within the microbial mats, zzso electron flow occurs through three zzso S zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso dioxide, organic zzso and H zzso zzso
