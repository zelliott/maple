In order to compare the structure and function of pigeon zzso chain zzso gene with other zzso zzso gene was cloned using a method of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso according to high conservative zzso sequence of zzso zzso in avian zzso chain zzso zzso a pair of zzso primer was zzso and a special DNA zzso was gained from pigeon zzso cell zzso by zzso Then based on the sequence of gained DNA fragment, some new zzso were zzso and the zzso and the zzso of zzso gene were cloned by zzso zzso Finally a complete zzso of zzso was to extend with newly designed primer by zzso The product was identified by zzso and sequence zzso The results of sequencing indicate that zzso gene is 1,050 zzso in length zzso zzso zzso which includes an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a precursor protein with 211 zzso acid zzso In comparison with the zzso sequences of other zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to zzso showing an overall identity of zzso with chicken and over zzso with human and other zzso zzso In addition, some zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso manifest extremely conservative among animals, which suggests that they could have an important biological zzso
