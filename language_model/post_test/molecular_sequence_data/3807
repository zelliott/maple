zzso regulatory factors zzso regulate zzso of zzso genes through DNA zzso binding to these zzso Using a differential display method for examining gene expression in zzso cells infected with zzso containing zzso zzso we found that expression of zzso regulatory factor 5 zzso zzso was increased in the presence of zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso showed that a potential zzso binding site zzso detected in zzso 2 of the zzso gene could in fact bind to zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso reporter zzso revealed that the zzso possessed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced in zzso cells zzso and zzso but not zzso cells zzso when DNA was damaged by zzso zzso or zzso treatment in a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso and that it might mediate the zzso immune zzso
