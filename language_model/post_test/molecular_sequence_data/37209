Although the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso have received great attention in the last decade, and it has been proposed that zzso and variations in these genes may be implicated in genetic diseases, the zzso structure of the human zzso and zzso genes (also known as zzso and zzso zzso has not been firmly zzso The picture has been confused by the presence of many zzso of both zzso and zzso and the long surviving assumption that the zzso gene is zzso An earlier report on the partial sequence of the human zzso gene and the presence of zzso has largely been zzso We present the full sequence of the human zzso and zzso zzso The two genes are linked head to head zzso approximately 17 zzso and consist of 12 and 4 zzso zzso The first zzso of the human zzso gene is zzso and the first zzso of the human zzso gene ends with the start zzso Analysis of human and mouse expressed sequence tag sequences in zzso indicates that alternative zzso occurs resulting in zzso gene transcripts with different zzso zzso By sequencing of the zzso the zzso boundaries and the region between the two genes in 10 Danish individuals (five zzso nine zzso variations and one zzso deletion have been detected that, by subsequent typing of one child from each couple, have been assigned to five zzso The human zzso gene has been zzso by radiation hybrid zzso between markers zzso and zzso on zzso zzso This location and the position of two zzso fragments in the Human Genome Assembly are consistent with zzso position zzso Using a zzso zzso we demonstrate that the region between the two genes functions as a zzso zzso The zzso activity of the promoter zzso in the zzso direction is approximately twice that in the zzso direction under normal growth conditions and, upon zzso promoter activity in either direction increased by a factor of approximately zzso One of the zzso variations detected is zzso in a putative zzso site in the zzso promoter region and analysis of the zzso activity of the promoter zzso with this variation has shown that it does not affect zzso levels both with and without zzso
