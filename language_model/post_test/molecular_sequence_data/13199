The adult skeletal muscle zzso channel zzso possesses a highly zzso segment between zzso zzso III and IV containing a consensus protein zzso C zzso zzso site that, in the zzso zzso acts as a master control for zzso regulation by zzso and zzso protein zzso It lacks an approximately zzso segment between zzso I and II though to zzso channel zzso We here demonstrate that zzso is regulated by zzso (but not zzso protein zzso in a manner distinct from that observed for the zzso zzso suggesting that under the same conditions muscle zzso could be zzso from motor zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso reduced peak zzso currents by approximately zzso by decreasing the zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso shift in the zzso of zzso zzso and caused a slight speeding of zzso Surprisingly, these effects were not affected by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the pattern of current suppression and gating modification by zzso resembles the response of muscle zzso channels to zzso factors present in the serum and zzso fluid of patients with zzso syndrome, multiple zzso and idiopathic zzso zzso
