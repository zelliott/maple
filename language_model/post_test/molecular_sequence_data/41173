In this study, two strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso sample collected from the South China Sea and characterized by using a zzso zzso Growth was observed at zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso and pH zzso zzso pH zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the strains were identified as members of the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the two strains clustered together and the zzso zzso gene sequence similarities between them and other members of the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso type was zzso Major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso data showed that the two strains represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso AB zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso AB zzso as a reference zzso
