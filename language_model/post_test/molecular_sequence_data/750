An important step in the development of a human zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine is to define the minimal zzso acid motif for a mapped B cell zzso zzso within zzso Identification of this minimal motif is necessary to remove an overlapping T cell zzso that zzso a zzso T cell zzso Here we describe motif zzso mapping of an zzso B cell zzso zzso on zzso protein zzso known as zzso zzso achieved using a set of 22 zzso zzso peptides fused with truncated zzso zzso zzso or truncated zzso zzso and detected using rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the B cell zzso zzso was evaluated in rabbits using expressed B cell zzso zzso fused with truncated zzso as the zzso This construct zzso high zzso zzso to the zzso B cell zzso zzso with zzso to native human zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso
