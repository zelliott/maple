zzso treatment plants with enhanced biological zzso removal represent a state-of-the-art zzso Nevertheless, the process of zzso removal is prone to occasional zzso One reason is the lack of knowledge about the structure and function of the bacterial communities zzso Most of the bacteria are still not zzso and their functions during the wastewater treatment process are therefore unknown or subject of zzso Here, flow zzso was used to identify bacteria capable of zzso zzso within highly diverse zzso A novel fluorescent zzso technique for the quantitative detection of zzso zzso on the cellular level was zzso It uses the bright green zzso of the zzso zzso when it complexes the zzso zzso acting as a zzso in zzso zzso The dynamics of cellular DNA contents and cell sizes as growth indicators were determined in parallel to detect the most active zzso zzso and to determine their zzso affiliation upon cell zzso zzso known as zzso organisms, such as a zzso zzso zzso were found, as well as members of the zzso zzso and zzso The new method allows fast and convenient monitoring of the growth and zzso zzso dynamics of zzso bacteria in wastewater bacterial zzso
