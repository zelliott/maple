Two of the three class I alcohol zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso known functional zzso that act on alcohol with different zzso zzso at both these genes have been implicated in alcoholism in some populations because zzso zzso differ between zzso and zzso Specifically, controls have higher zzso of the zzso with higher zzso zzso and zzso In samples both of zzso and of controls from three Taiwanese populations zzso Ami, and zzso we found significant zzso zzso for all comparisons of the two functional zzso and a third, presumably neutral, zzso zzso in zzso The class I zzso genes all lie within 80 zzso on zzso 4; thus, zzso are not inherited zzso and zzso must be analyzed when evaluating the risk of zzso In the Taiwanese Chinese we found that, only among those zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso the proportions of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and those with zzso zzso zzso are significantly different between zzso and controls zzso The proportions of zzso with zzso and those with zzso are not significantly different between zzso and controls, on a constant zzso background (with zzso zzso with zzso zzso Thus, the observed differences in the frequency of the functional zzso at zzso between zzso and controls, can be accounted for by the zzso with zzso in this zzso
