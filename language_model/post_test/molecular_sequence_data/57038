The 19 zzso pairs of the zzso zzso are resolved into 18 zzso zzso A to Q and Y by zzso flow zzso The zzso content of six zzso has previously been determined by analyzing zzso differences, zzso of animals carrying zzso and zzso studies of genes with known zzso For the remaining zzso putative assignments to flow zzso were deduced from comparison of DNA zzso determined by flow zzso and zzso zzso We present here the complete characterization of the pig zzso flow zzso using the zzso technique combined with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso amplification of 300 sorted zzso with zzso under zzso conditions and used to paint zzso by zzso The zzso content of each peak was zzso zzso A zzso 1), B zzso C zzso D zzso E zzso F zzso G zzso H zzso zzso zzso I zzso J zzso K zzso L zzso M zzso N zzso O zzso P zzso Q zzso Y zzso We were able to characterize perfectly the pig zzso flow zzso Such techniques could be applied to any other zzso
