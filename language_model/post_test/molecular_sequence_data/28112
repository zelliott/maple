zzso coli zzso promoter zzso are shown to be subject to large synergistic zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso and DNA zzso in zzso zzso was studied for the zzso zzso promoter, a promoter with a zzso spacing zzso delta zzso and two promoters with zzso zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoters respond to the simultaneous presence of zzso and zzso by exhibiting large zzso zzso at the low to moderate zzso that are most pertinent in zzso Although all four promoters can be activated by zzso those made stronger by changing downstream promoter elements are less zzso even though each contains an identical zzso binding zzso When each of the zzso promoters is made stronger by introducing DNA zzso the apparent zzso zzso initially remains constant but eventually declines at higher zzso Thus, strengthening the zzso promoter through either DNA sequence changes or the introduction of high-level DNA zzso can lead to diminished potential for zzso by zzso These results are interpreted in terms of a role for zzso in providing extra stabilizing contacts for zzso zzso binding that are necessary only when other stabilizing features of promoter structure are zzso
