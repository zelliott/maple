During the development of a therapeutic zzso large numbers of zzso zzso are required to screen for those that are best suited for the desired zzso Although the single zzso zzso variable gene cloning technique is a powerful zzso the current methods remain an obstacle to the rapid production of large numbers of zzso zzso 

We have developed a novel overlap extension zzso chain reaction, the zzso joint zzso chain reaction zzso and applied it to the generation of linear zzso gene expression zzso zzso is conducted using a zzso zzso variable gene and an zzso zzso cassette zzso that contains all essential elements for zzso expression and overlapping areas of zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique is simple and zzso the zzso zzso zzso variable gene zzso and the zzso are assembled into a linear zzso expression zzso even in the presence of zzso amplified zzso We also developed a robotic magnetic beads handling instrument for single zzso zzso synthesis to amplify zzso variable genes by rapid amplification of zzso zzso ends zzso Using these methods, we were able to produce zzso zzso zzso from large numbers of single plasma cells within four zzso 

Our system reduces the burden of zzso discovery and engineering by rapidly producing large numbers of zzso zzso zzso in a short period of zzso
