The zzso is derived from precursor zzso cells that differentiate into six classes of zzso cells and one class of zzso cells zzso To gain insight into the molecular events underlying retinal zzso we used the differential display zzso chain reaction zzso technique to identify transcripts zzso expressed in precursor retinal cells prior to their zzso One of the zzso that we selected using this technique zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso shown to bind to the zzso protein zzso and which is involved in the zzso of zzso during mid to late zzso Similar to what has been reported recently in the mouse zzso we found zzso D1 zzso to be highly expressed in the zzso chick zzso zzso maturation was accompanied by a substantial reduction in zzso D1 zzso zzso A similar zzso pattern of expression was observed in the developing brain although transcript levels were lower than in the zzso In contrast, zzso D1 zzso levels increased with differentiation in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso cells of the developing chick zzso require exceptionally high levels of zzso D1 zzso perhaps to promote progression through the cell cycle by countering the effect of molecules with a negative role in the cell cycle such as zzso
