The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso has been attributed to the zzso motif zzso present within the zzso that binds a zzso factor designated zzso However, significant residual zzso activity even after deletion of this element has suggested the presence of a second critical functional zzso We have used deletion and zzso analyses to define an element, zzso zzso that is essential for zzso zzso activity in zzso myeloma cells in the absence of the zzso zzso analysis in a panel of zzso cell lines suggests that the presence of either zzso or zzso leads to considerable zzso activity in cell lines representing later stages of zzso zzso whereas both elements are needed for function in cell lines representing earlier zzso Furthermore, in contrast to the results in zzso lines, both zzso and zzso elements function independently in certain zzso lines in which the zzso zzso is zzso
