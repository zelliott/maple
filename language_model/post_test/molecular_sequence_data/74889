zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso pathway, which is responsible for zzso a variety of secondary zzso that participate in development and zzso In this study, we isolated a full-length zzso of the zzso gene from the Korean black raspberry zzso zzso and found that this gene existed as a single zzso By comparing the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso with other sequences reported previously we determined that this sequence was highly zzso among widely divergent plant zzso In addition, quantitative real time zzso studies indicated that the zzso gene had a differential expression pattern during fruit development, where gene expression was first detected in green fruit and was then remarkably reduced in yellow fruit, followed by an increase in red and black zzso To investigate the two zzso in expression observed during fruit development and zzso we measured the zzso zzso The content of the major zzso of Korean black raspberry fruits was determined to be highest at the beginning of fruit development, followed by a gradually decrease according to the zzso zzso In contrast, the content of zzso during the progress of zzso was dramatically zzso Our results suggest that the zzso gene in Korean black raspberry plays a role during color development at the late stages of fruit zzso whereas the expression of zzso gene during the early stages may be related to the zzso of zzso
