zzso with zzso zzso is a mainstay in the management of zzso multiple sclerosis zzso with proven long-term effectiveness and zzso Much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms of action of zzso in the past zzso Previous studies described more than a hundred genes to be modulated in expression in blood cells in response to the zzso However, for many of these zzso the precise zzso expression pattern and the therapeutic relevance are zzso We used zzso zzso to investigate in more detail the gene expression changes in peripheral blood zzso cells from zzso patients receiving subcutaneous zzso The blood samples were obtained zzso at five different time points up to 2 years after the start of therapy, and the patients were clinically followed up for 5 zzso We examined the functions of the genes that were zzso or zzso at the transcript level after short-term or long-term zzso Moreover, we analyzed their mutual interactions and their regulation by zzso zzso Compared to zzso levels, 96 genes were identified as highly zzso zzso many of them already after the first zzso zzso The interactions between these genes form a large network with multiple feedback zzso indicating the complex zzso between innate and zzso immune responses during zzso We discuss the genes and biological processes that might be important to reduce disease activity by attenuating the proliferation of zzso immune cells and their migration into the central nervous zzso In zzso we present novel insights that extend the current knowledge on the early and late zzso effects of zzso therapy and describe gene expression differences between the individual patients that reflect clinical zzso
