A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Owens Lake in California, zzso The zzso cells are zzso zzso in shape and zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth occurs within the following zzso zzso degrees C, with optimal growth at 35 degrees zzso 1-3 % zzso zzso with optimal growth at 2 % zzso zzso and pH zzso with optimal growth at pH zzso The novel isolate is strictly zzso and requires high zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso It zzso some zzso some organic zzso some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extract and zzso The main end products of zzso zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso is resistant to zzso and zzso but sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content of the new isolate is zzso zzso its zzso size is 6 zzso zzso Da and the melting temperature of its zzso DNA is 71 degrees zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated 46 % similarity with the zzso most closely related species, zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular properties, the new isolate belongs zzso to a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the second strain in the zzso (after zzso zzso zzso zzso that is able to use zzso products as the sole energy source, and additional tests have shown that other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also able to grow on zzso extract alone; therefore, an zzso description for the zzso zzso is zzso
