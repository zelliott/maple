A zzso library of zzso zzso DNA was constructed by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso of a spontaneous alcohol zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of a zzso designated zzso zzso and deletion analysis of zzso limited the region that zzso the zzso in alcohol zzso activity of the zzso The zzso sequence of this region was determined and showed that this region contained the full structural gene for the zzso zzso zzso of the alcohol zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the gene showed zzso with sequences of methanol zzso structural genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
