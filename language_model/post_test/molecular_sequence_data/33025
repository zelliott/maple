zzso zzso zzso is a zzso nuclear protein which is identified by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used widely as a reliable tool to detect most zzso zzso cell types in zzso zzso biology, and stem cell research fields as well as diagnostic zzso To date, however, the identity of its zzso zzso itself, has been zzso Here, we identify zzso as the zzso gene product by providing the following zzso 1) Mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso protein yields the zzso zzso acid zzso 2) zzso zzso is recognized by zzso 3) Short hairpin zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) zzso expression is restricted to neural zzso 5) zzso zzso and zzso zzso overlap completely in zzso zzso We also show that a protein zzso with zzso is the synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso I in zzso with one order of magnitude lower affinity than zzso and does not recognize zzso I using zzso zzso (also called zzso protein 3 and zzso contains an zzso recognition motif and is classified as a member of the zzso gene family that binds specifically to an zzso element, zzso We demonstrate that zzso functions as a zzso regulator using neural zzso alternative zzso of the zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso as a zzso Identification of zzso as zzso zzso an important element of zzso zzso
