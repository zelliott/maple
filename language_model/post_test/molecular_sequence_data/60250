zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family that mediates a number of important signaling events in zzso and some other types of cells through interaction of its zzso zzso domain with tumor necrosis factor zzso factor zzso zzso zzso substitution and zzso zzso of the human zzso domain were generated, revealing zzso critical for binding zzso zzso or both of these zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso direct binding of zzso zzso zzso or zzso to zzso was not zzso However, zzso could be recruited to zzso zzso in a zzso manner but not to a zzso zzso zzso that selectively fails to bind zzso zzso zzso with impaired binding to zzso zzso or both of these proteins completely retained the ability to activate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso can stimulate zzso and zzso pathways for zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso lacking the last 32 zzso acids required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction through a mechanism that was zzso by zzso of zzso a zzso version of zzso but not by zzso zzso that while zzso does not directly bind zzso it can participate in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not impair zzso zzso by zzso Taken together, these findings reveal zzso in the involvement of zzso family proteins in zzso zzso induction and suggest that the zzso region of zzso may stimulate the zzso zzso through a zzso zzso
