A human complementary DNA was isolated that encodes a widely expressed zzso zzso that is closely related to zzso the product of the zzso son of zzso zzso The zzso protein contains a region of significant sequence similarity to zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor for Ras from zzso A zzso of zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso loss of zzso function in zzso This zzso domain specifically zzso zzso zzso exchange on zzso Ras proteins in zzso zzso cells zzso full-length zzso had increased zzso zzso exchange zzso Thus zzso is a zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso The zzso zzso with growth factor zzso protein 2 zzso in zzso and in zzso This interaction was zzso by the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to Ras signaling is zzso by a molecular complex consisting of zzso and zzso
