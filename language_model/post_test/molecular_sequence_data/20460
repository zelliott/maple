A new species, zzso zzso was isolated from leaf litter of zzso zzso zzso in Hong zzso This zzso is described and compared with existing species in the zzso It occurs on the zzso as creamy white zzso and has short black zzso zzso characters are typical of zzso and it most closely resembles zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but may be distinguished by its distinct zzso and different zzso zzso To gain further zzso insight into the zzso relationships of our new zzso and its allies, we zzso and zzso 6 different regions of 3 genes zzso DNA and protein coding zzso zzso zzso II largest zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are compared with existing zzso zzso zzso data support the relationship between zzso species and the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we recovered a new zzso lineage (or zzso within the existing zzso framework of zzso as previously zzso In particular, there is a close association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is strongly zzso The affinities of these 2 newly zzso zzso are discussed in light of zzso and molecular zzso
