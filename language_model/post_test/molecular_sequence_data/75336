The primary structure of rat heart muscle fatty zzso protein was investigated by liquid secondary zzso mass zzso The protein was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid zzso The masses of the zzso molecular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides were determined by liquid secondary zzso mass zzso analysis using zzso zzso of zzso From the zzso zzso two peptides with zzso 1036 and zzso were initially found that did not match the published primary sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gordon, zzso zzso and Banaszak, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of these two peptides were determined by a combination of mass zzso zzso zzso and high performance tandem mass zzso techniques to be: zzso see zzso These new data require that corrections be made to the previously published zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso The corrected zzso sequence for rat zzso reveals greater zzso with zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso protein than was previously zzso
