The zzso toxin zzso from zzso zzso Hoffmann and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso scorpion zzso are identical zzso as confirmed by zzso acid sequence of zzso toxins and by DNA sequencing of the two respective cloned zzso Therefore in this communication they will be simply named zzso zzso is a 66 zzso acid long zzso with four zzso bridges, formed between pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (the numbers indicate the relative positions of the zzso zzso in the primary zzso This zzso is zzso to zzso but deadly to zzso zzso zzso zzso body weight of zzso Its three-dimensional structure was determined by zzso using a total of zzso meaningful distance constraints derived from the volume integration of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure displays a mixed zzso fold stabilized by four zzso bridges, with a zzso induced by a zzso in its zzso zzso zzso zzso surface is compared to that of zzso toxin toxic to zzso The local differences produced by additional or zzso zzso that would influence toxin selectivity towards zzso or zzso zzso channels are zzso
