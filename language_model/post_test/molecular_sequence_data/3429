zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso are used for the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from zzso Since zzso exert their activity by binding to nuclear zzso there is intense interest in developing new zzso for the two known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso used to profile new zzso zzso zzso often zzso receptors from different species, with the assumption that they behave zzso To test this belief, we have zzso a number of zzso other steroids, zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso in a solid phase zzso binding zzso using zzso protein for human, zzso and mouse zzso and zzso Certain compounds show species dependent binding preferences for zzso or zzso leading to differences in zzso zzso zzso The zzso acids identified by zzso as lining the zzso binding cavity are the same among the three species, suggesting that as yet unidentified zzso acids contribute to the structure of the binding zzso We conclude from this analysis that the ability of a compound to selectively bind to a particular zzso zzso can be species zzso
