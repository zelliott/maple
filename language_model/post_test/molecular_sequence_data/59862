zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso that is essential for regulating cellular stress responses in zzso The crystal structure of human zzso reveals a novel protein fold with a zzso domain composed of a central zzso that binds two zzso zzso which is surrounded by zzso zzso water molecules at the zzso metal zzso coordinate the zzso group of the zzso and provide a zzso and general acid in the zzso zzso Our model presents a framework for understanding not only the classical zzso protein zzso but also the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain within zzso zzso zzso The protein architecture and deduced zzso mechanism are zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso family of protein zzso zzso with which zzso shares no sequence zzso suggestive of zzso evolution of protein zzso zzso
