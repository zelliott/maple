zzso proteins zzso have been associated with hormone signaling and responses to zzso and zzso stress in zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso from the plasma membrane of cells in response to distinct zzso zzso thereby zzso cellular zzso In addition, several zzso were demonstrated to be necessary for normal colonization of roots by the zzso fungus zzso zzso Here, we present evidence for the involvement of another two zzso in this zzso Furthermore, we show that plasma membrane targeting of zzso might be zzso in other plant species, although we did not find it for all members of the protein zzso Finally, the position of a zzso influences the zzso of zzso which needs to be considered when working with zzso
