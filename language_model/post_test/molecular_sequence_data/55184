zzso zzso hormones represent more than zzso of all insect zzso The zzso family is a major group of insect zzso and they are expected to be found from all insect zzso These zzso zzso have been shown to have a variety of functions from zzso to zzso zzso is well understood in zzso species relative to sex zzso zzso but other potential functions are yet to be zzso Recently, we focused on defining the zzso gene and peptides in fire zzso in preparation for an investigation of their zzso zzso interference zzso technology is a convenient tool to investigate unknown zzso functions in insects, and it is now an emerging method for development of novel zzso control agents as alternatives to zzso This could be a paradigm shift that will avoid many problems associated with conventional chemical zzso In this study, we selected the zzso gene and its zzso products as an zzso target from two insect zzso a social zzso the fire zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso the corn zzso zzso zzso Both insects are economically important zzso We report negative impacts after zzso zzso treatment to suppress zzso gene zzso during zzso and adult stages of both species, zzso increased adult and zzso zzso delayed zzso development and decreased sex zzso production in the zzso This is an important first step in determining the multiple functions of the zzso gene in these two zzso This work illustrates the variety of zzso effects observed after zzso zzso of the zzso gene and suggests the possibility of novel zzso insect zzso control zzso
