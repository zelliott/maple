zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains six putative zzso zzso zzso studies of the protein by different groups of investigators have yielded zzso results with respect to the zzso of zzso It has been suggested that the protein binds anywhere from 3-6 zzso of zzso of zzso We used negative zzso zzso zzso mass zzso in order to definitively determine the exact zzso zzso of zzso zzso and two zzso forms of the zzso one lacking zzso 2 zzso and the other lacking zzso 2 and 6 zzso The full-length protein bound 4 zzso of zzso of zzso while both of the deletion zzso bound 3 zzso of zzso Since zzso has been used extensively as a probe for the determination of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso we also examined the binding of zzso to the three proteins under the same zzso zzso zzso zzso bound 4 zzso of zzso of zzso while zzso zzso and zzso each bound 3 zzso These results clearly show that zzso zzso binds 4 zzso of zzso of protein and that zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso
