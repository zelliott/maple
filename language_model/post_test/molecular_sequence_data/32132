Two issues that have captured the attention of tropical plant evolutionary biologists in recent years are the relative role of long distance zzso zzso over zzso in determining plant zzso and debate about the extent that zzso zzso changes affected tropical zzso zzso of some zzso species are assumed to be capable of zzso due to their ability to float and survive for long periods of time in salt zzso zzso species responded to zzso with a contraction of their zzso Thus, widespread zzso species are an ideal system to study zzso and zzso in the zzso We present zzso and zzso analyses based on internal transcribed zzso region zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and amplified zzso length zzso zzso of zzso DNA that demonstrate recent zzso across the Atlantic, rejecting the hypothesis of zzso for the widespread distribution of the black zzso zzso zzso Northern latitude populations likely became extinct during the late zzso due to zzso and zzso these locations were zzso afterward from southern zzso In some low latitude regions populations went extinct or were drastically reduced during the zzso because of lack of suitable habitat as sea levels zzso Our analyses show that low latitude Pacific populations of zzso zzso harbor more diversity and reveal deeper divergence than Atlantic zzso zzso for our understanding of zzso of tropical species are zzso
