zzso zzso rats were fed with either an zzso diet for 21 days or an zzso diet for 10 zzso Fifty thousand clones of a zzso library of small zzso zzso were zzso with two radioactive samples zzso on zzso from the small zzso of rats fed with zzso or zzso zzso As a result, genes were found with zzso level depending on the content of zzso zzso Iron zzso increased the zzso level of genes of zzso zzso and class 1 zzso and decreased the zzso level of the zzso zzso gene and of an unknown zzso while no change was found in the zzso level of the gene of fatty zzso zzso Excess of dietary iron resulted in the increase in zzso of this gene and in a decrease in the zzso zzso gene and in the unknown zzso The zzso of zzso zzso did not zzso The data indicate that changes in the level of zzso iron influence the expression of genes involved in metabolism of zzso
