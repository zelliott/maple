In this work, four zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso an zzso two putative zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso respectively, were isolated and zzso characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Their expression was studied by real-time zzso during flower zzso open and zzso and fruit zzso green, late green, maturation and zzso development of zzso zzso which is zzso While two zzso of zzso production were zzso at early green and zzso stages in whole zzso the seed was not able to produce it during maturation and zzso zzso All studied genes were zzso expressed during flower and fruit zzso In general, the level of transcripts of zzso was higher in fruits than in zzso However, it was noteworthy that: zzso zzso expression was hardly detected in closed flowers and at low levels during early green zzso and fruit development provoked a notable differential expression in seeds, and zzso zzso the results of zzso expression during fruit development suggest a zzso role of this gene from late green stage zzso The zzso was the only floral organ in which expression of both zzso and zzso zzso genes was not significantly altered during zzso however, their expression decreased zzso with development of zzso zzso floral organ to register a net zzso production when zzso and during first days of zzso development (the highest zzso production during all fruit zzso zzso to zzso the level of zzso zzso was temporally quite similar in the zzso With regard zzso even its expression was very scarce during maturation of zzso was zzso during zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso were low expressed during pit zzso increasing zzso and decreasing during zzso zzso expression was in the zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso described in this work demonstrate that the expression of these genes is not always zzso and that control of its zzso may play an important role in regulating the development of zzso zzso of zzso zzso
