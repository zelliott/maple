G zzso receptors zzso signals through zzso G protein zzso and zzso zzso both of which interact with downstream zzso to regulate cell zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in the zzso of several diseases, suggesting that zzso could be an important pharmaceutical zzso Previously, we used a combination of virtual and manual screening to find small molecules that bind to a zzso interaction zzso zzso on zzso and block regulation of zzso zzso One of the most potent and effective compounds from this screen was zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of zzso and found that zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso and zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso but also a second undefined zzso The high potency of zzso in zzso zzso seems to arise from both high zzso of the zzso group and binding to a specific site on zzso Using structural information about the zzso zzso we developed a strategy to selectively target zzso zzso compounds to a specific site on zzso using zzso carriers such as zzso zzso Mass zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso specifically and efficiently leads to zzso zzso modification of a single site on zzso likely zzso and zzso zzso more than a hundred times more zzso than zzso These data support the concept that zzso zzso can be specifically targeted to the zzso zzso zzso through rational incorporation into molecules that zzso bind to zzso
