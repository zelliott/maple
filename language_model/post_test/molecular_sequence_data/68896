In a previous study, we determined the structures of the zzso present in zzso a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso pit zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso J zzso zzso In order to allocate the various zzso chains to distinct zzso sites of the zzso we have now isolated individual zzso zzso zzso were identified after zzso with zzso zzso F by zzso acid analysis and zzso zzso zzso were assigned to the previously deduced zzso structures by high performance liquid zzso Although only quantitative differences were observed, the results indicate that each zzso site of zzso carries its characteristic zzso zzso Furthermore, all potential sites were shown to be zzso by zzso
