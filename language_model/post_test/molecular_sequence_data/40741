This study examined in detail the population structure of zzso coli from healthy adults with respect to the prevalence of zzso resistance and specific resistance zzso zzso coli isolated from the zzso of 20 healthy adults not recently exposed to antibiotics was tested for resistance to ten antibiotics and for carriage of zzso and resistance zzso using zzso zzso diversity was assessed using zzso and molecular zzso zzso coli was present in 19 subjects at levels ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant to one to six antibiotics were found at high levels zzso in only ten individuals, but at significant levels zzso in zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso from the same individual were zzso but more than one susceptible strain was sometimes zzso Overall, individuals zzso one to four zzso coli zzso although in 17 samples one strain was dominant zzso of zzso zzso strains resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 15 different combinations were zzso One resistant strain was carried by two unrelated individuals and a susceptible strain was shared by two zzso zzso Two minority strains were derivatives of a more abundant resistant strain in the same sample, showing that continuous evolution is occurring in zzso The zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were in zzso in a class 1 or class 2 zzso zzso resistance was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso resistance by zzso zzso or zzso and zzso resistance by zzso or zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso was detected only zzso zzso groups A and B2 were more common than B1 and zzso zzso zzso coli of healthy humans represent an important zzso for numerous zzso genes in many zzso However, measuring the true extent of resistance carriage in zzso zzso coli requires in-depth zzso
