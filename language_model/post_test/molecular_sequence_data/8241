The structural basis for the zzso binding capability of zzso zzso zzso III zzso was assessed by characterizing the zzso and zzso terminal halves of the zzso The native zzso zzso 20 zzso was zzso with zzso F zzso mass of zzso species approximately 18 zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to yield two fragments with molecular masses of approximately 9 zzso zzso The two fragments were zzso by zzso zzso and identified by mass zzso zzso acid analysis and zzso sequencing as the zzso terminal zzso and zzso terminal zzso zzso Due to the apparent zzso of the zzso zzso pattern obtained compared to that expected from the deduced zzso sequence of zzso zzso we carried out partial zzso acid sequencing of the fragments and zzso sequencing for the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso peptides revealed that both exist in buffer in a random zzso zzso However, addition of zzso a zzso agent, resulted in the formation of an zzso reflecting an innate propensity of the peptides to adopt a zzso zzso When zzso with zzso zzso both peptides assumed an zzso zzso indicative of interaction with the zzso In the presence of zzso a 22 zzso blue shift in zzso zzso zzso was observed in the case of the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso are located in a more zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that, compared to native zzso both peptides possessed a reduced ability to transform zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
