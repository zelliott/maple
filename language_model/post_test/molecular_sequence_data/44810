The zzso filament formed on a circular single strand by zzso coli zzso protein in zzso can pair with zzso duplex DNA even when the latter lacks a free zzso end, but subsequent progression of the reaction through strand exchange requires an end in at least one strand of the duplex zzso We zzso from zzso coli an zzso activity that zzso the outgoing strand of duplex DNA at the junction of zzso and zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso This zzso activity also zzso specifically at the junctions of duplex and zzso regions in synthetic zzso zzso whose central portion consists of zzso zzso zzso These activities are consistent with a role in zzso and repair of zzso
