The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a model for the terminal zzso in zzso in zzso zzso has been investigated by computer simulations and zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations were performed for 1 zzso in zzso solution and 20 zzso in zzso using the zzso force fields zzso and zzso An additional zzso Carlo simulation with the zzso force field was also carried zzso Experimental zzso data in water solution was obtained from measurement of long-range zzso zzso zzso zzso constants, zzso using one-dimensional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso values from the simulations showed a varying degree of agreement to experimental zzso It could be shown from simulation that the zzso zzso angles zzso which was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso were done of zzso distribution functions and of hydrogen zzso It was suggested that zzso hydrogen bonds were present, but in contrast to simulation the results from zzso zzso did not support any major zzso zzso their influence on the zzso of the zzso is rather zzso zzso of zzso zzso chemical shifts for the zzso and the zzso in zzso revealed high zzso However, the derived zzso of the model substance in this work differed at one zzso zzso angle compared to the zzso on a large zzso
