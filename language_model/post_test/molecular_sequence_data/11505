Three zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed and tested for zzso detection of zzso species in the human zzso zzso zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso contained sequences unique to this zzso and proved zzso as target sites for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso specificity of the zzso was performed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso To this end, cells were fixed on glass zzso zzso with the zzso and monitored by zzso In combination with image analysis, this allowed zzso of the zzso per cell and objective evaluation of zzso zzso One of the zzso developed was used to determine the population of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso A comparison was made with results obtained by cultural methods for zzso Since both methods gave similar population estimates, it was concluded that all zzso in feces were zzso However, since the total zzso counts were only a fraction of the total microscopic counts, the contribution of zzso to the total zzso zzso was overestimated by almost zzso when cultural methods were used as the sole method for zzso
