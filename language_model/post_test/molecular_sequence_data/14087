zzso is one of the precursor proteins of zzso zzso envelope that is formed beneath the inner surface of the cell membrane during terminal zzso Although zzso is specifically expressed in the upper zzso cells of the zzso the precise regulatory mechanism of zzso gene expression remains zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso which binds to zzso zzso is a nuclear protein expressed in various types of cells including zzso zzso study has revealed that zzso protein is highly expressed on the zzso cell layer of the zzso To examine the possible regulatory mechanism of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso we zzso zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso which was constructed by connecting the zzso upstream region of the zzso gene zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start site and downstream including the untranslated first zzso to the zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso expression zzso significantly zzso zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso The repression was also observed by zzso of the zzso zzso which was constructed by replacement of the zzso DNA binding domain by the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso repression is due to zzso of a limiting zzso zzso factor that is essential for zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
