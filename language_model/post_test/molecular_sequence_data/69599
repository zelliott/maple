Fluorescent tagging of free zzso by reductive zzso permits sensitive detection and zzso of these zzso To expand the scope of this approach, we have zzso a fluorescent zzso zzso This zzso can tag zzso under zzso conditions with high zzso The resulting zzso show excellent zzso by zzso zzso with sensitive detection in the low zzso zzso When combined with sequential zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the sugar chains is zzso The zzso group can also be used to recover the sugar chain from reaction zzso The zzso interaction of the zzso group with zzso zzso or zzso can be used to create the functional equivalent of zzso carrying multiple copies of zzso of defined zzso These complexes allow the production of zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso They can also harness the power of zzso technology for the detection and isolation of zzso receptors from native sources of zzso zzso
