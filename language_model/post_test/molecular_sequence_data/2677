A DNA zzso in the coding region of zzso factor zzso valuable for carrier zzso prenatal diagnosis, and population zzso described in zzso It had been discovered with zzso zzso that distinguish between zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso of the zzso Its use as a diagnostic tool has been limited because zzso factor IX zzso zzso is dominant to zzso factor IX zzso zzso in zzso of zzso therefore, detection of zzso zzso is not possible in all zzso A DNA method for recognizing all zzso has been developed, but it also has zzso We report the development of another DNA procedure based on amplification of the relevant DNA with the zzso chain reaction zzso This method is zzso avoids the use of zzso and zzso film, and specifically identifies all the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The procedure can be performed zzso on small samples of blood (less than 1 zzso as suggested by Kogan et al (N zzso J zzso zzso zzso The method described is zzso to any genetic zzso that zzso a restriction zzso recognition zzso
