Among zzso factors that regulate zzso zzso zzso gene expression are those that interact with zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso functions as a zzso and zzso as a zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso This study reports the cloning and characterization of a second member of the zzso family that also binds zzso zzso zzso contains four zzso zinc fingers that collectively share zzso zzso acid sequence similarity and zzso sequence identity with those found in zzso In addition, there are highly zzso zzso acid sequences in the zzso segments of the two zzso In spite of their structural similarities, the two proteins are zzso at distinct zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso on zzso The predicted open reading frame of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso protein specifically binds to the zzso promoter elements of zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that a major zzso transcript of zzso zzso is expressed zzso at low levels, with elevated expression levels in zzso and in adult zzso liver, and zzso zzso of zzso gastric zzso and zzso colon zzso cells with a zzso expression construct and with an zzso reporter construct show that zzso zzso zzso expression in the two cell lines by 80 and zzso zzso zzso the data suggest that zzso binds zzso promoters and may complement the activities zzso by zzso
