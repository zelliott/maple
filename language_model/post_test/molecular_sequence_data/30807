zzso VA zzso maintains protein synthesis by preventing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso There appears to be a single binding site for zzso on zzso and this site is blocked by VA zzso VA zzso binds to zzso zzso and can be zzso to the zzso by zzso zzso To determine the relationship between zzso binding and VA zzso structure and function, we examined the binding abilities of zzso and zzso VA zzso In several cases, the ability to bind zzso efficiently in zzso did not correlate with function in zzso Secondary structure analysis suggested that efficient binding requires an zzso zzso structure, whereas zzso of zzso zzso requires the central domain of the VA zzso zzso We propose that the duplex stem permits VA zzso to interact with the zzso binding site on zzso and zzso zzso by zzso the central domain of the zzso with the zzso active zzso
