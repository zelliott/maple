zzso zzso recordings were made from identified zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Seven zzso were tested for activity and their actions compared with zzso and zzso zzso Three peptides isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso had mainly zzso effects with thresholds of around 1 zzso This zzso was due to an increase in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all active on certain zzso the first two showed only zzso effects while zzso was mainly zzso The thresholds in each case were zzso zzso When zzso replaced zzso in zzso the potency was reduced by at least 100 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso only excited zzso but with a very low zzso around zzso zzso zzso There was no obvious correlation between the action of these peptides and either zzso or zzso
