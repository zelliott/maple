Small DNA fragments zzso to 80 zzso randomly obtained from a collection of 14 zzso zzso or regulatory zzso coli zzso have been zzso cloned in place of the zzso zzso binding zzso A total of 47 zzso showing substantial zzso synthesis (at least zzso of the zzso were isolated, and their newly acquired zzso starts were zzso Of these, 46 were found to carry a zzso binding site from one of the original zzso and only one, a zzso zzso Moreover, 12 out of the 14 natural starts were zzso The two that were not found are the only ones lacking a zzso zzso So, real starts are generally active in the zzso zzso whereas the many sites zzso 100 in this gene zzso that carry a zzso element followed by zzso or zzso but are located in zzso or zzso regions, or on zzso zzso are zzso I conclude that: zzso these zzso starts, being strongly zzso against in the zzso message, are presumably also inactive in their original zzso zzso the discriminating information, being portable from one zzso to another, must be contained within a small DNA region surrounding the zzso Indeed, I further show that it generally lies within a sequence of about 35 zzso zzso real zzso and zzso this information must have a larger effect on initiation than the exact structure of the zzso because the discrimination persists despite a complete change of this zzso Previous statistical analysis has shown that real starts differ from false starts in having a zzso sequence composition from zzso zzso to zzso with respect to the zzso To uncover whether these biases constitute the discriminating information or simply reflect coding constraints, zzso starts were randomly searched in zzso largely zzso zzso These zzso starts all have an zzso zzso or zzso preceded by a typical zzso zzso outside these zzso the zzso region is zzso rich in A, and poor in zzso These biases match those found around real starts, demonstrating that they are indeed part of the initiation zzso Finally, I describe a simple procedure for introducing any DNA zzso in place of the zzso operator site on the zzso coli zzso
