zzso proteins of 13 almond zzso zzso zzso with known zzso were surveyed by zzso and zzso combined with zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analyses to identify zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso in this plant zzso zzso activities corresponding to zzso and zzso two of the four zzso tested, were identified by zzso and zzso activity zzso The zzso band reacted with the zzso prepared from Japanese pear zzso zzso no reaction with the zzso was observed with the zzso zzso When the zzso band was excised from an zzso gel stained for zzso activity, subjected to zzso and detected by zzso it appeared that this band consisted of a single protein that reacted with the zzso with zzso of about 28 zzso With zzso and silver zzso of the zzso zzso all four zzso could be successfully distinguished from each other in the highly basic zone of the zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso had roughly the same zzso of about 30 zzso the zzso seemed to be slightly smaller than the zzso and slightly larger than the zzso In zzso profiles as well, the zzso had zzso of about 28 zzso apparently smaller than the other three zzso A bud sport, in which one of the two zzso of the original zzso is impaired, was zzso as a loss of zzso which is consistent with the previous zzso zzso All four zzso reacted with the zzso probably because of the differing zzso of these zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in zzso appeared to be identical to zzso in zzso both had the same zzso and were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the four zzso revealed that they were highly zzso to each other and similar to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, zzso in the style are strongly suggested to be associated with the zzso zzso of zzso This is the first report identifying and characterizing zzso in zzso
