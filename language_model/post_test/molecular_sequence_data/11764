We have studied the molecular physiology of zzso unloading and zzso during seed development of fava bean zzso zzso During the zzso phase, high levels of zzso in the zzso and the zzso zzso space are correlated with activity of cell zzso zzso in the seed zzso Three zzso were zzso zzso comparison revealed genes zzso zzso one soluble and two cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso was studied in different zzso and zzso of developing seeds by zzso gel analysis, in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso One zzso zzso gene is expressed during the zzso phase in the zzso zzso of the seed coat, a region known to be the site of zzso zzso We propose a model for an zzso unloading process during early seed development and the regulation of zzso zzso zzso After unloading from the seed coat, zzso is zzso by cell zzso zzso Thus, zzso contributes to establish sink strength in young zzso The zzso zzso are loaded into the zzso and control zzso zzso via an influence on the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso regulated degradation of the zzso zzso expressing the zzso apparently zzso the storage zzso This is characterized by a switch to a low zzso zzso Feeding zzso to zzso zzso in zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso ratio and changes zzso zzso in favor of zzso zzso the transcript level of the major storage product zzso B is zzso
