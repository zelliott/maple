zzso zzso produces zzso zzso composed of zzso soluble zzso S and zzso Neither S nor F component alone is zzso but components together are zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso which does not have zzso zzso identified an F component with zzso identical to that of zzso in the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning of this toxin obtained zzso zzso sequences containing two novel open reading frames for S and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the S and F were respectively 91 and zzso identical to those of zzso and zzso These were named zzso of zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso to rabbit zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to rabbit red blood cells although the activity was only zzso of zzso but zzso was zzso These activities were quite different from the zzso which was reported no zzso and poorly zzso to zzso compared to zzso The zzso was found in zzso of clinical zzso of zzso zzso but zzso was not zzso These data demonstrate the existence of zzso zzso in zzso strain zzso zzso
