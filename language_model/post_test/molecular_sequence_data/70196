The mechanism by which zzso antagonize the ability of zzso zzso zzso to induce the zzso of zzso genes is only partially zzso To examine the effect of zzso responsive element zzso zzso and zzso sequences on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso several zzso zzso containing a perfect zzso repeat zzso but lacking the zzso zzso sequences typical of highly zzso zzso were cloned into a zzso zzso The zzso centers of symmetry were spaced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso turns zzso zzso and zzso binding to these zzso was specific and zzso but zzso and, in contrast to our earlier work with zzso binding to zzso zzso not zzso The affinity of zzso binding decreased as the distance between adjacent zzso was increased, suggesting that zzso binding to closely spaced zzso is more stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the above zzso In contrast, the affinity of zzso binding increased with increased zzso spacing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso sequences zzso the zzso increased the binding affinity of zzso and zzso an increase reflected in slower zzso rates of zzso from these zzso The zzso sequence also enhanced the binding capacity of zzso but not zzso Since the binding capacity of zzso is identical with or without an zzso region, we suggest that zzso sequences are more important in stabilizing zzso binding and may be critical for cooperative binding to zzso zzso
