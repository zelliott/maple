Relatively little is known about the type and number of zzso zzso receptors zzso that mediate zzso from adrenal zzso zzso In these studies, we investigated zzso reserve pools and their zzso using zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso By using zzso under zzso conditions, adrenal zzso release was reduced zzso approximately zzso zzso This effect was slowly zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused shifts to the right in zzso zzso of approximately zzso as well as decreases in zzso values for the zzso nicotine and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso approximately 46 zzso that was somewhat less zzso than nicotine zzso approximately zzso of 10 zzso zzso in adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a small shift to the right in the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso as well as a decrease in the zzso zzso zzso which causes a slowly developing loss of zzso zzso produced a zzso shift to the right in zzso zzso zzso and a reduction in zzso for nicotine and zzso zzso treatment produced only a reduction in the zzso value of zzso Finally, we cloned and zzso a reverse zzso chain reaction product from bovine adrenal zzso zzso that shares a high degree of zzso with beta 4 zzso zzso Northern analysis provided evidence for the presence of this transcript in zzso cell zzso Together, these studies support the presence of a zzso reserve in adrenal zzso cells that is zzso by zzso These studies also support the presence of more than one zzso population zzso zzso and the presence of beta 4 zzso zzso
