Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common neurodegenerative zzso They are characterized by the zzso of selected populations of nerve cells that develop zzso inclusions before zzso The zzso inclusions of Alzheimer's disease are made of the zzso protein zzso in a zzso zzso Recent work has shown that the zzso inclusions of Parkinson's disease are made of the protein zzso and that rare, familial forms of Parkinson's disease are caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Besides Parkinson's disease, the zzso inclusions of two additional neurodegenerative diseases, namely zzso with zzso bodies and multiple system zzso have also been found to be made of zzso zzso zzso zzso inclusions are not limited to Alzheimer's zzso They are the defining zzso characteristic of zzso zzso such as zzso disease, and of progressive zzso zzso and zzso zzso The recent discovery of zzso in the zzso gene in familial forms of zzso zzso has provided a direct link between zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso The new work has established that zzso and zzso account for most zzso neurodegenerative diseases in zzso The formation of zzso zzso inclusions might be the gain of toxic function that leads to the demise of affected brain zzso
