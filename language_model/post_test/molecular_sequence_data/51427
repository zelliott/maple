We induced vitamin A depletion to define early and late changes during the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso An early change is the zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is separated from the basement membrane by a continuous layer of zzso zzso zzso showed an exclusive zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells of normal and zzso zzso At the zzso stage no zzso was observed above the zzso layer with zzso to zzso but upon progression of the zzso to a zzso focus all cells from zzso to terminally differentiated were positive for zzso and zzso In contrast, when we used zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso all cells were negative in the normal zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso layers of zzso zzso cells found in zzso zzso failed to express normal zzso differentiation marker zzso zzso and zzso but expressed the proliferation marker zzso zzso and the internal zzso zzso zzso zzso not normally found in the zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could be maintained in culture in zzso medium for at least 4 weeks in the presence of zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso cells from vitamin zzso zzso showed markedly reduced growth and an increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since our previous work had implicated zzso in the control of cell zzso we were interested to find out whether changes in cell zzso occur in vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, compared to normal zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso cells, obtained from zzso zzso or maintained in culture, displayed reduced attachment to zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso studies did not show a decrease either in the alpha 6 zzso zzso which was localized in the zzso aspect of zzso cells, or in basement membrane zzso However, the expression of zzso protein 37 decreased as the zzso changed from zzso to zzso zzso a coordinated pattern of changes in zzso gene zzso as well as in the expression of zzso protein 37, the precursor to the cell surface zzso zzso zzso and in adhesive properties takes place in zzso zzso when its zzso changes from zzso to the zzso stage of zzso zzso
