zzso zzso of small peptides to polystyrene surfaces is often not zzso zzso a simple and general coating procedure to improve the coating efficiency of small synthetic zzso zzso to polystyrene is zzso In this study, the binding capacities of four small synthetic peptides zzso linked to various zzso during synthesis were compared to their parent counterparts in terms of the amount of zzso coat concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a short zzso sequence by an zzso zzso zzso group or a zzso zzso resulted in an enormous reduction in zzso coat concentration for all tested peptides of net two to four orders of magnitude when corrected for chain zzso The optimal length of the zzso zzso depended on the length of the model zzso Replacement of both extensions by zzso zzso zzso zzso and other basic zzso acid zzso in the case of the zzso zzso was possible without reducing their enhancing properties to a great zzso Additional experiments showed that a zzso zzso consisting of a linear stretch of seven zzso zzso consisting of a linear stretch of seven zzso zzso was more effective in comparison to a zzso zzso construct and could easily compete with the multiple zzso zzso zzso
