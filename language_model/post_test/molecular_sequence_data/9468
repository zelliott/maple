A gene zzso a synthetic truncated zzso zzso zzso B zzso was generated via automated zzso and expressed in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis detected five truncated zzso zzso suggesting multiple translation starts from the six zzso zzso zzso The longest open reading frame, which zzso to zzso acids zzso of the mature zzso appeared to be expressed in the greatest zzso The truncated zzso was immobilized on zzso zzso zzso and used to produce zzso and zzso zzso from crude corn oil and refined soybean zzso The yield of zzso zzso was zzso greater from corn oil than from soybean oil and was zzso and 50% higher, respectively, when compared to a commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso using the same zzso A zzso zzso ratio of ethanol to corn oil produced zzso and zzso greater yields than ratios of zzso and zzso zzso With corn oil, zzso zzso production was zzso higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso step prior to the zzso zzso increased yields of zzso zzso from corn oil by zzso compared to zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso The results suggest zzso truncated zzso has potential application in zzso production using zzso
