The zzso zzso 4) proteins are the core components of a new class of zzso zzso zzso that regulate cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA damage zzso To determine the composition of zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, we used zzso zzso affinity zzso to isolate the proteins that associated with human zzso complexes and identified them by zzso A novel and zzso zzso zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso was found to associate with zzso and zzso zzso also interacts with replication licensing protein zzso in zzso Loss of zzso in zzso zzso and human cells suppressed zzso of zzso in response to DNA zzso We further isolated the human zzso complexes by zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells and found it associates with zzso components of the zzso complex zzso and zzso We found that zzso interacts with zzso and loss of zzso suppressed zzso zzso after DNA zzso Our data also revealed that in zzso zzso of zzso causes the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso and zzso interact with zzso complexes and are involved in zzso degradation after DNA zzso
