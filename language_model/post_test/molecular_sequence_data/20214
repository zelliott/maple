zzso interacts with zzso receptors and other important signaling zzso It contains a BAR and a zzso domain near its N zzso and the two zzso may function as a unit zzso zzso We report here the crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso The structures reveal novel features for BAR domain zzso and for the interactions between the BAR and zzso zzso The BAR domain zzso of zzso contains two zzso zzso whereas other BAR domain zzso have only three zzso in each zzso The zzso domain is located at the opposite ends of the BAR domain zzso zzso zzso zzso confirm the interactions between the BAR and zzso zzso zzso binding zzso show that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso can bind zzso The ability of zzso to interact with multiple signaling molecules and zzso supports an important role for this zzso in cell zzso
