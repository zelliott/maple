zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso one of the important candidate genes for coat color zzso was used to analyze the single zzso zzso zzso in Chinese native pig breeds by zzso strand zzso zzso zzso The study had also taken 3 imported pig breeds as zzso The results showed that the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso found in Chinese native pigs were consistent to the zzso found in the European Large Black zzso However, zzso or zzso and zzso were only found in the imported individuals, which were obviously different from the Chinese native zzso zzso we presumed that the coat colors of Chinese native pigs belonged to dominant black color system, which was completely distinct to that of imported pig zzso Thus it was implied that zzso gene was not the principal factor affecting the coat color differences of Chinese native pig breeds, but could be used to trace the molecular evolution of pig zzso
