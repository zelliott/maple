zzso is a model system for zzso a class of peptides displaying zzso activity against various zzso zzso After zzso zzso the precursor zzso is modified in two steps, of which the last one involves consecutive zzso reactions zzso by the zzso zzso Here, we present a detailed in zzso study of the interaction between zzso and the zzso precursor zzso Our results unravel a specific interaction of zzso with the leader zzso independent of the maturation zzso Furthermore, zzso studies identified a specific binding sequence within the zzso Two zzso acids zzso and zzso within the highly zzso zzso box of class I zzso are essential for zzso They represent a potential general binding motif between leader peptides of a group of zzso with their zzso zzso In zzso these in zzso data provide a new perception on the complexity of the zzso modification zzso
