zzso alpha zzso are involved in transmission of signals for development, zzso and secondary metabolism in plant zzso and zzso zzso We cloned two zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso class, while zzso belongs to the class defined by zzso of zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with the wild type for zzso growth, zzso zzso of zzso the ability to zzso colonies of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in confrontation zzso and the ability to colonize the zzso of these pathogens in zzso Both zzso grew as well as the wild type, zzso zzso did not zzso in the dark, and responded to blue light by forming a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by straight zzso germ tubes, while zzso zzso like the wild type, zzso by zzso and highly zzso germ zzso In confrontation zzso both zzso and zzso zzso and the wild type zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso but zzso zzso had reduced ability to colonize zzso zzso zzso In the soil plate zzso both zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso but zzso zzso were unable to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso is involved in antagonism against zzso zzso but neither G protein zzso is involved in antagonism against zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a wide host range, thus employs a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
