Most of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso used currently are designed and zzso for zzso zzso B viruses and hence may not be suitable for India, where the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso 

Development and zzso of zzso zzso real time zzso zzso suitable for measuring plasma and zzso viral zzso levels in zzso zzso C infected zzso 

A zzso real time zzso was developed using zzso and zzso selected in the gag region for detection of Indian zzso zzso C zzso Plasma zzso and zzso samples zzso obtained from zzso infected subjects were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso A comparative evaluation was carried out with a commercially available quantitative zzso viral load zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was able to amplify all zzso group M zzso except zzso zzso zzso loads could be estimated in all the plasma zzso and zzso zzso samples obtained from zzso positive zzso zzso of this zzso was found to be 180 zzso zzso with the commercially available viral load zzso was very good zzso 

A zzso real time zzso was standardized for zzso zzso C and it was more sensitive zzso zzso than standard zzso monitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
