zzso a zzso protein responsible for maintaining the zzso of iron, has been demonstrated in cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the light and heavy chain zzso of zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rat zzso cell lines, in fetal rat zzso and in primary cultures of rat zzso zzso zzso In zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso was observed in both active zzso and in zzso A zzso zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso cells by an zzso zzso This protein zzso with native zzso and could be zzso into zzso zzso with zzso light and heavy zzso zzso of zzso zzso to cultures of zzso zzso cells resulted in the zzso of the iron in zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that cells of the zzso lineage possess a functional zzso iron zzso and storage system capable of regulating metal zzso in zzso
