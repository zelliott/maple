zzso charge clusters from the calf eye lens protein zzso are zzso The clusters consist of four to six side chain charged groups with zzso distances in zzso pairs from 4 to 7 zzso The charge clusters appear to decrease the zzso potential of the molecular surface which maintains the transparent refracting lens medium of zzso with a very high protein zzso It is shown that the charge pattern for different gene products of one species is conservative as well as for whole set of 25 sequences of zzso including zzso frog, zzso zzso calf and zzso Taking into account zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of those charge positions is equal to zzso zzso important charge clusters are absent in the ancient structural motifs of zzso
