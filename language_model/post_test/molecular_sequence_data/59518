A zzso for the zzso zzso gene (for sugar transport protein 4) was isolated, and the properties of the zzso protein were studied in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso acids and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analyses revealed that zzso is expressed primarily in roots and flowers of zzso This was shown in more detail with zzso zzso zzso plants yielding strong zzso zzso activity in root tips and zzso zzso of plants transformed with zzso zzso resulted in a rapid increase in zzso activity in cells directly adjacent to the zzso This was confirmed by zzso protection analyses in zzso zzso plants showing a strong, zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was induced rapidly in zzso zzso cells that were treated with the zzso zzso zzso or with zzso or in zzso plants that were exposed to zzso zzso Our data suggest that the role of zzso is to catalyze zzso import into classic sinks, such as root tips and zzso and, most importantly, to meet the increased zzso demand of cells responding to environmental zzso
