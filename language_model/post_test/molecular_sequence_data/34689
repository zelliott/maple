This study focused on detecting zzso genes for zzso aromatic zzso zzso distributed in the zzso zzso of zzso Bay, zzso These zzso and mud environments were severely affected by human activities, including agriculture and zzso Our previous study on microbial roles in natural decontamination displayed the possibility that zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play an important decontamination role in a zzso zzso In order to gain further fundamental knowledge on the natural decontamination process, zzso genes for zzso metabolism were investigated through zzso amplification of zzso genes using soil zzso DNA and zzso Comparative analysis of predicted zzso acid sequences from 50 randomly selected zzso clones capable of zzso zzso aromatic zzso indicated that these were divided into three groups, two of which might be originated from zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of each zzso clone were a part of the genes zzso zzso for initial zzso of zzso zzso or zzso that might be originated from bacteria in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
