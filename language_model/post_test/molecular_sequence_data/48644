Gene zzso events have been proposed to be involved in the adaptation of plants to stress zzso precisely how is zzso To address this question, we studied the evolution of two families of zzso zzso zzso are important for normal cell function and in plants, zzso zzso have also been implicated in salt zzso Two well-known plant zzso zzso are zzso and zzso which perform zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso from the cell, zzso However, our knowledge about the evolution of zzso and zzso stress responsive gene families is still zzso 

In this study we performed a comprehensive molecular evolutionary analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso Using available sequences from a total of 33 plant species, we estimated gene family zzso and gene zzso zzso as well as examined zzso selection pressure on zzso acid zzso Our results show that, while the zzso family expanded and zzso the zzso family remained a low copy gene family that appears to have undergone zzso during its evolutionary zzso Additionally, we found that both families are under zzso selection although zzso is less zzso 

We propose that the different evolution histories are related with the zzso function and zzso and that the zzso and zzso families are examples of two different evolutionary paths through which zzso events may result in zzso evolution of stress zzso
