Since the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso II are known to be expressed almost exclusively in the brain, we compared the effect of zzso of the beta zzso of zzso zzso II with that of the alpha zzso The zzso distribution of the alpha zzso was different from that of the beta zzso although the zzso properties of the alpha and beta zzso expressed in zzso cells were similar to those of brain zzso zzso zzso The alpha zzso was found in the soluble fraction more than in the particulate zzso whereas most of the beta zzso bound to zzso zzso In the cell zzso alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso II, zzso extension was promoted when compared with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso outgrowth of cells zzso zzso zzso II was further zzso by the treatment of zzso zzso a selective but not absolutely specific inhibitor of protein zzso zzso The zzso change was rapid and observed within 1 h followed by zzso zzso zzso changes, such as the number of cells with zzso and length of zzso were greater in the beta cells than in the alpha zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of protein zzso C, also zzso the zzso outgrowth of these zzso Some zzso of zzso zzso II related to zzso outgrowth were detected in cells zzso zzso zzso II zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso H and protein zzso C play an important role in the control of cell change, and that the zzso distribution of zzso zzso II is important for regulating cellular functions zzso
