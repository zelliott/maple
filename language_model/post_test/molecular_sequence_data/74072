The properties of contact zzso ( C zzso needed for native proteins to be the zzso zzso are considered in relation to a contact energy zzso ( E zzso The total zzso energy is assumed to consist of zzso interaction energies between atoms or zzso each of which is expressed as a product of a zzso function (an element of the C zzso and a zzso energy zzso (an element of the E zzso Such zzso interactions in proteins force native C zzso to be in a relationship as if the interactions are a zzso potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, 183 zzso for the native C zzso because the lowest bound of the total energy function is equal to the total energy of the native zzso interacting in a zzso zzso zzso This relationship between C and E zzso zzso to zzso a parallel relationship between the zzso of the C and E zzso and a linear relationship between their zzso and zzso a parallel relationship between a contact number zzso and the principal zzso of the C and E zzso where the E zzso is expanded in a series of zzso with an additional constant zzso The additional constant term in the spectral expansion of the E zzso is indicated by the lowest bound of the total energy function to zzso to a threshold of contact energy that approximately separates native contacts from non-native zzso Inner products between the principal zzso of the C zzso that of the E zzso and a contact number zzso have been examined for 182 zzso each of which is a representative from each family of the zzso database zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 536 zzso and the results indicate the parallel tendencies between those zzso A statistical contact potential zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, 49 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso estimated from protein crystal structures was used to evaluate zzso zzso interactions in the zzso In addition, the spectral representation of C and E zzso reveals that zzso zzso zzso which depend only on the types of interacting zzso zzso but not on other zzso in a zzso are insufficient and other interactions including zzso zzso and zzso hindrance are needed to make native structures unique zzso zzso
