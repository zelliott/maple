zzso zzso zzso harboring five different zzso fragments for the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso directed the synthesis of this protein in zzso coli zzso Crude bacterial extracts were zzso with an zzso against the zzso R zzso The presence of specific zzso for the R zzso in a given extract was compared with zzso zzso activity and with the ability to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso The expression and the zzso properties of these proteins were correlated with their zzso zzso zzso The results show that the zzso R zzso can be functionally expressed in zzso coli cells either as a fusion protein with zzso or as a zzso zzso In both cases, the products of zzso clones containing the entire coding sequence retained zzso zzso activity and the capacity to interact with the zzso zzso One of the zzso lacking the 94 zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso activity, although it bound zzso with an affinity similar to that of the native R protein from zzso zzso
