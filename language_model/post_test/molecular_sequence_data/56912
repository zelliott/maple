zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters contain one or more copies of the sequence zzso beginning within the zzso zzso zzso The clear statistical overrepresentation of this sequence and, to a lesser extent, of its zzso zzso zzso and zzso implies that they may be significant promoter zzso Their collective sequence similarity to zzso initiators zzso of the zzso class suggests that the zzso and zzso elements are zzso Prior work in zzso systems has emphasized the role of the zzso in promoters lacking zzso boxes, where it can serve as an alternate staging site for zzso II zzso However, it is clear that the zzso sequence is by no means restricted to zzso zzso zzso tests using the zzso zzso gene zzso support the idea that the zzso is a zzso promoter element, required for efficient zzso under some zzso For example, the zzso protects zzso expression of zzso from the zzso effect of zzso response zzso In addition, the zzso is required for the function of an zzso of zzso activity in zzso We conclude that zzso are promoter elements found sporadically throughout the higher zzso that the requirement for an zzso depends upon the array of other promoter elements which may be present in a given zzso and that zzso may permit enhancers to discriminate among zzso
