Tight binding zzso of zzso zzso exhibit complex repression zzso In this work, in zzso zzso operator binding of three such zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pro zzso and the double zzso zzso pro zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso synthesis controlled by ideal zzso operator and its 27 zzso operator zzso containing each possible zzso at each single zzso position in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The average increase of repression with all operator zzso was about 3 fold with the zzso zzso It was about 4 fold with the zzso zzso and about 2 fold with the double zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed the same increase of affinity to all operator zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited lower repression with some zzso than with most zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso has gained no additional zzso In contrast the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso exhibit a relaxed specificity for certain base pairs in positions 1 and 3 of zzso zzso This suggests that the extreme zzso of zzso zzso may interact with the inner zzso in the minor zzso
