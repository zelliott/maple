zzso regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso against viruses and plasmids via incorporation of short zzso called zzso derived from foreign genetic zzso zzso zzso are thus considered to provide records of past zzso To describe the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions involving the zzso freshwater zzso zzso zzso we investigated zzso in four zzso zzso strains and in two previously zzso zzso The number of zzso in each locus was larger than the average among zzso All zzso were strain specific, except for a string of 11 zzso shared in two closely related zzso suggesting diversification of the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso were identified in a natural zzso zzso Among 995 unique zzso zzso only 10 sequences showed similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso Of these, six zzso showed only silent or conservative zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso suggesting a strategy by the zzso to avert zzso immunity dependent on zzso zzso These results imply that zzso interactions can be divided into zzso zzso combinations rather than zzso of zzso infectious zzso zzso similarity also showed frequent exposure of zzso zzso to small cryptic plasmids that were observed only in a few zzso Thus, the diversification of zzso implies that zzso zzso has been challenged by diverse communities zzso entirely zzso of zzso and zzso
