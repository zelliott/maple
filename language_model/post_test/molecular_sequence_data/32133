Although northern zzso contribute significantly to natural methane emissions, recent studies of the importance and type of zzso in these systems have provided conflicting zzso zzso controlling zzso in northern zzso remain poorly zzso despite the importance of methane as a greenhouse zzso We used zzso zzso gene retrieval and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso to zzso zzso communities in 15 zzso zzso sites in Alaska and three zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso community composition was zzso in the context of zzso vegetation and zzso factors characterized in a parallel zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso sites were dominated by a cluster of zzso zzso and members of the families zzso and zzso which are not zzso Members of the zzso family zzso were not zzso whereas those of the family zzso were either not detected or were zzso These results are consistent with zzso evidence that zzso zzso is not a zzso terminal decomposition zzso in most of the sites zzso zzso analyses indicated a link between vegetation type and zzso community zzso suggesting that plants zzso the environmental conditions that control their zzso influence both zzso community activity and zzso
