The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in gastric zzso zzso Recently, the zzso intermediate zzso region, which is located between the signal zzso and middle zzso regions, was identified as a third zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso there are approximately zzso deletions between the zzso i and m regions zzso the d zzso The aim was to clarify the roles of the zzso d region in relation to zzso zzso diseases and zzso gastric zzso zzso We assessed the zzso signal s-, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso status in zzso zzso zzso recovered from Western countries zzso zzso zzso and East Asian countries zzso zzso zzso by zzso In East Asian countries, there were no relationships between the zzso zzso and the clinical outcomes and zzso zzso In Western countries, strains with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (no zzso zzso significantly increased the risk for the development of gastric cancer compared with the risk from strains with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso odd ratios, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for zzso The highly virulent zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso and gastric zzso in zzso analysis, whereas only the zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso and gastric zzso in both the zzso and the corpus by multiple linear zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso strains could be an improved predictor of zzso inflammation and the potential for zzso compared with the presence of the zzso s-, zzso and zzso zzso in Western zzso
