zzso zzso zzso symbol, zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the coding region of zzso were recently identified in two children with symptoms of muscular zzso zzso seizures, and abnormal zzso zzso During zzso construction in the zzso region of human zzso 19 we identified a zzso clone carrying the entire zzso zzso This clone was shown to overlap with zzso from a zzso that was previously mapped to zzso zzso The human zzso gene has a size of about 5 zzso and consists of six zzso which agree with the published zzso zzso Since the mouse zzso zzso are located on band C of mouse zzso 10 in a region of zzso zzso with zzso and jittery mice exhibit zzso and abnormal movement zzso the zzso sequence of zzso was determined in zzso and jittery zzso The coding region of the zzso zzso however, was not zzso in these zzso zzso Our linkage and sequence data will facilitate the identification of new zzso zzso in patients suffering from an abnormal zzso zzso
