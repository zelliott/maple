Eleven strains of zzso zzso zzso isolated from healthy and diseased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured in Spanish Mediterranean fisheries have been studied by a zzso approach that included a wide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso All strains were zzso related to zzso species and zzso zzso On the basis of sequence analysis and zzso zzso data, eight of the strains were identified as zzso zzso The remaining three strains formed a tight, independent zzso in all sequence analyses and showed less than 70 % zzso zzso with strains of the closest zzso species, from which they could be differentiated by several zzso zzso We conclude that these three strains represent a novel species in the zzso zzso and we thus propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso In addition, we propose the zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2002 as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and we provide an zzso description of the zzso zzso
