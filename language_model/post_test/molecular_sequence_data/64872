zzso proteins are a large family of zzso proteins that are characterized by an approximately 40 zzso acid zzso Some zzso proteins are critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory zzso Here we report that a novel member of zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and identified during the large-scale sequencing analysis from a human fetal brain zzso zzso zzso gene shares zzso acid similarity with several putative mouse genes not only in zzso domain but also in the rest of the zzso which indicates that zzso might also contain some other unknown zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso gene had a zzso low expression pattern in most human adult zzso According to zzso analysis, the zzso gene was found located in zzso zzso
