An zzso region at the zzso flank of the human zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso gene was found to be active in driving expression of the cat reporter zzso indicating that it contains a functional zzso zzso analysis showed that the promoter activity is present in the region between zzso zzso zzso and zzso the sequence upstream from this region zzso zzso to zzso has an zzso zzso The promoter for the zzso zzso resembles zzso promoters in that it drives zzso from multiple start points zzso and lacks zzso zzso and zzso box zzso The cluster of zzso lies in a region which is particularly zzso zzso In this region, upstream from and near to the furthest upstream zzso two closely located zzso repeat motifs were zzso These motifs also appear twice in the promoter for the zzso growth factor zzso where they were shown to be essential for promoter zzso The human zzso zzso promoter shows an overall zzso yet also some marked zzso to the recently described promoter for the mouse zzso zzso
