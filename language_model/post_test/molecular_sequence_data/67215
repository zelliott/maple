Two novel genes zzso zzso involved in the conversion of zzso acid zzso to zzso through zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the zzso DNA library of zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins of these two genes were expressed in zzso coli zzso and their zzso activity zzso were performed in zzso It was found that the zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso while the zzso gene zzso an zzso zzso which showed the zzso ability to convert zzso to zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso play important roles in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and that they have potential applications in the industrial production of zzso
