zzso is a major health problem zzso zzso zzso has been a primary cause of zzso outbreaks in many zzso In Brazil, few molecular typing studies have been zzso The aims of this study were to zzso type zzso zzso strains isolated in Brazil in order to determine the genetic relationship between strains of food and human origin, as well as, to assess their zzso potential and zzso zzso A total of 128 zzso zzso strains isolated from human feces zzso and food zzso between 1986 and 2010 were zzso The zzso diversity was assessed by zzso and zzso using zzso the zzso resistance by the zzso zzso and the presence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes assessed by zzso The zzso results revealed that 112 strains exhibited a similarity of zzso and the zzso that 96 strains exhibited a similarity of zzso Almost all strains zzso zzso all 13 zzso genes zzso zzso strains zzso were resistant to zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso acid resistance observed after 1996 is indicative of an increase in the use of this zzso It may be suggested that these 128 strains might have descended from a common zzso that differed little over 24 years and has been both zzso food and humans and causing disease for more than two decades in zzso
