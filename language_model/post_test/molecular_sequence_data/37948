The zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso nuclear proteins that directly mediate the mechanism zzso zzso process that occurs in zzso and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso is required for the proper development of maturing zzso To identify evolutionary zzso regulatory regions adjacent to both genes we isolated and zzso a zzso clone containing zzso of zzso DNA of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso of zzso and contains the same number of genes as the zzso of higher zzso With low abundance of repetitive DNA, the zzso of the zzso has shown to be ideal for comparative zzso We found three complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a possible zzso of the plant zzso zzso zzso There is also the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso possibly zzso The genetic structure of both zzso and zzso is identical to that found in other fish, but the size of the zzso region is smaller in zzso zzso analysis by zzso shows the presence of zzso transcripts in kidney of adult zzso The human zzso was identified in a zzso assigned to zzso zzso which is close to the location of the zzso zzso This indicates conservation of linkage between human and zzso
