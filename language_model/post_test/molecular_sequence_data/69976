We report the isolation and characterization of an zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene spans a zzso region of 15 zzso and the coding sequence is interrupted by two zzso It appears to be the only gene of the zzso family present in the zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein is zzso zzso acids long and contains several zzso including the zzso well zzso when compared to other proteins of the zzso zzso Based on sequence comparisons we have zzso in the zzso zzso zzso several features which are in common with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso It also has some features specific for zzso zzso zzso this gene appears to have zzso from an ancestral gene common to both the zzso and zzso insect zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments show that the expression of this gene in zzso development of zzso is restricted to the zzso part of at least the zzso and zzso zzso The pattern is generated zzso from a growth zone organized in columns of cells close to the zzso region of the zzso Cell proliferation in the growth zone follows an zzso pattern without evidence of early lineage zzso The zzso expression is detected in the growth zone before any zzso is visible and continues to be expressed in a zzso location in the segments that are zzso zzso zzso expressed in isolated cells, it spreads into rows broadening to zzso cells as segments zzso The evidence presented here is compatible with the hypothesis that zzso signaling mechanisms are in part responsible of the early zzso of zzso zzso
