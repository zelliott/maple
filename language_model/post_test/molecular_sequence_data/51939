zzso markers with high degrees of zzso are of vital importance in the construction of high resolution zzso zzso linkage maps of human zzso as specified in the short-term goals of the Human Genome zzso In this paper, we report on molecular and genetic characterization and physical zzso of 11 new zzso restriction zzso length zzso markers on human zzso zzso Ten of these represent three- and zzso zzso of the base substitution type probably at two adjacent restriction zzso One has been identified as a novel zzso sequence zzso a variable copy number tandem repeat array of a zzso zzso zzso This collection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers should prove valuable and increase the resolution power of the available zzso zzso genetic zzso
