zzso factor beta gamma zzso from rat liver was previously shown in zzso studies to control the binding of zzso zzso II to promoters by a mechanism analogous to that zzso by bacterial zzso factors, by decreasing the affinity of zzso for zzso sites on DNA and by increasing the affinity of the zzso for the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso Garrett, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 88, zzso By constructing and analyzing zzso of beta zzso we have identified a novel functional domain located in the zzso zzso of the gamma zzso zzso This domain shares sequence similarity with region 4 of bacterial zzso zzso in particular, it exhibits striking similarity to the zzso regions zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence from zzso studies argues that a zzso gamma zzso lacking zzso acid sequences similar to zzso zzso region zzso is able to assemble with the beta zzso zzso to form a zzso beta gamma zzso with impaired ability to interact with zzso zzso zzso
