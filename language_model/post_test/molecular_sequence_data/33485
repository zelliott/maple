The zzso zzso zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso channels with genetically established importance in humans and zzso zzso of human zzso cause type IV zzso a devastating pediatric neurodegenerative zzso Our recent zzso studies revealed that, although a zzso current can only be recorded in late zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso patch clamp technique, a zzso substitution in zzso zzso results in a large whole cell zzso Thus, it remains unknown whether the large zzso current results from an increased surface expression zzso elevated channel activity zzso or zzso Here we performed systemic Pro zzso in a region previously implicated in the gating of various 6 zzso zzso zzso We found that several Pro zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso activities at both the plasma membrane zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso Pro zzso localized exclusively in zzso and were barely zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso with high zzso activities were not restricted to zzso zzso and most significantly, exhibited significant surface zzso Because zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso due to Pro zzso may have resulted in zzso zzso zzso release, hence the surface expression and whole cell current of zzso Indeed, surface zzso of zzso membrane zzso zzso was dramatically increased in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an inwardly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso permeable zzso channel that may be gated by unidentified cellular mechanisms through a zzso change in the zzso face of the zzso 5 zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso may lead to the appearance of zzso proteins at the zzso
