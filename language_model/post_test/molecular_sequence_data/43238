We report the cloning of a zzso zzso the human zzso factor zzso containing the zzso DNA binding domain and related to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but the strongest expression is observed in the zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso In correlation with its zzso zzso we show that zzso binds to several functional zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We define a novel functional element in this zzso zzso zzso repeated sites to which zzso binds zzso In the corresponding region of the zzso zzso which is known to be zzso this element is zzso by a naturally occurring single base zzso that zzso zzso zzso We further show that the binding of the previously described zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso sites is disrupted by zzso zzso directed against the zzso domain and that this factor is a zzso degradation product of the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso regulates the activity of the zzso gene zzso
