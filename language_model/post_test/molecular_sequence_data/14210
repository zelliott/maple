We examined the distribution of zzso zzso zzso along depth profiles spanning the zzso zzso of the Black Sea zzso zone to gain insight into their respective ecological zzso zzso zzso correlated with depth and chemical profiles, zzso similar zzso within zzso zzso A zzso zone sample was split into zzso and zzso zzso to examine putative zzso and zzso zzso All identified zzso were present in the zzso fraction except for members of the zzso zzso which were apparently zzso zzso from zzso zzso known to carry out the zzso process, formed two distinct clusters with zzso depth zzso One zzso only zzso similar to the named species, was present at high zzso and low ammonium zzso in the upper zzso zzso We propose this sequence type be named zzso zzso zzso A second zzso containing sequences more similar to zzso zzso zzso was present at high ammonium and low zzso conditions in the lower zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zone zzso zzso yielded zzso from two zzso zzso clusters and three potentially new zzso as well as sequences from the zzso zzso zzso
