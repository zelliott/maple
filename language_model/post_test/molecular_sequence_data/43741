The zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso in addition to the functional zzso a number of zzso and gene zzso Fourteen zzso of DNA were zzso from the segment upstream of the zzso gene fragment, as well as shorter segments from different zzso and corresponding zzso zzso The analysis of the sequences and restriction fragments indicates that the segment is a remnant of an ancient zzso zzso which may have been functional before the zzso radiation and which later became the source of extant functional zzso genes in various zzso groups, different ones in different zzso The remnant segment has remained constant in its organization for at least 4 million zzso This constancy contrasts with the zzso of the adjacent functional part of the zzso zzso occupied by the zzso and other zzso The constancy may be related to the zzso and evolutionary conservation of the zzso zzso
