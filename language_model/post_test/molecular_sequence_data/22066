zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 catalyze the last two steps of the zzso zzso leading to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the major scent compound of many rose zzso zzso zzso zzso Modern roses are descended from both European and Chinese species, the latter being producers of zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso Here we investigated why zzso zzso zzso production occurs in some but not all rose zzso In zzso zzso zzso were shown to be localized specifically in the zzso predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso In these cells, zzso become increasingly associated with zzso during zzso development, suggesting that the scent zzso zzso zzso by these zzso may be directly linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were detected in two zzso rose species of European origin, but no zzso transcripts were zzso and these varieties lacked both zzso protein and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso gene expression may have been a critical step in the evolution of scent production in zzso
