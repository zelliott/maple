We have isolated putative zzso genes from various bacterial zzso Thirty open reading frames predicted to zzso zzso were randomly selected from 13 zzso bacterial zzso and were cloned into an expression zzso The zzso activity of the resulting clones was tested on a zzso plate at different pH values and zzso Nine out of thirty tested clones exhibited significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso from the gene zzso of zzso coli, the zzso zzso from the gene zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from the gene zzso of zzso zzso exhibited high activity at an alkaline pH zzso The zzso zzso zzso by the gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from the gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso both showed a sharp increase in zzso activity above pH zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso retained the zzso activity when they were incubated at 50 degrees C, suggesting that these zzso are zzso zzso pH zzso activity and temperature zzso activity experiments with selected zzso in a solution zzso system confirmed the zzso of the above zzso The zzso exploration strategy of proteins provided valuable information on the zzso by revealing subtle zzso differences between the zzso of different zzso
