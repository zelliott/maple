Four of five zzso species infecting humans are present in zzso zzso zzso remains the second most prevalent species, but is zzso No data is available on its zzso to zzso the drug recommended for intermittent preventive treatment during zzso In this study, the prevalence of zzso zzso infection and the zzso in the zzso and zzso genes were zzso The correlation between these zzso and clinical and zzso responses was also investigated in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso clinical zzso were collected in eight zzso sites from the four major zzso areas for malaria across Madagascar in zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso for zzso zzso The therapeutic efficacy of SP in zzso zzso infections was assessed in zzso in the zzso of the central zzso An zzso analysis of treatment outcome was carried zzso 

A total of 159 zzso zzso samples were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene were found in zzso of samples, and in zzso gene in zzso of zzso Six zzso zzso were identified in zzso including two novel zzso at zzso 21 and zzso For zzso beside the known zzso at zzso zzso a new one was found at zzso zzso For the two zzso different combinations were ranged from zzso to quadruple zzso Among the 16 patients enrolled in the zzso clinical trial zzso days of zzso and after adjustment by zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso of them were classified as treatment failure and were zzso zzso double zzso carriers with or without the zzso zzso zzso 

This study highlights zzso that zzso in the zzso and zzso genes remains a useful tool to monitor the emergence and the spread of zzso zzso zzso resistant in order to improve the national zzso drug policy, zzso the issue of using zzso as a zzso for intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women or zzso
