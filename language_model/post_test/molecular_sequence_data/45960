The zzso factor zzso is expressed during normal kidney development and is thought to influence outgrowth and branching of the zzso zzso Mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso defects of the zzso region, zzso zzso and ear and are zzso During zzso zzso is also expressed by zzso cells as they cluster and reorganize to form zzso elements of each zzso but the function of zzso in these cells is zzso In this study we hypothesized that zzso activates expression of zzso a zzso zzso known to be critical for successful zzso zzso protein was identified in zzso portions of the zzso body, and the protein persists in the emerging zzso zzso of zzso fetal zzso zzso activated zzso promoter activity zzso in zzso zzso with zzso cells derived from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the human zzso gene identified three novel zzso recognition zzso each exhibited specific zzso protein binding in zzso shift zzso Two motifs were contained within a completely duplicated zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso expression zzso was associated with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was decreased by zzso in zzso cell zzso of fetal kidney from mice with a zzso zzso zzso We speculated that a key function of zzso is to activate zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cells as they differentiate to form elements of the zzso zzso
