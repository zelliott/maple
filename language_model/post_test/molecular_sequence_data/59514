A pair of zzso zzso were designed from the zzso sequence of the gene zzso the small zzso zzso zzso zzso of the oral zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso amplified a zzso DNA zzso by zzso chain reaction and were specific for zzso zzso but not for other zzso oral zzso and bacteria, or human zzso With this method, the DNA from as few as 30 cells of zzso zzso could be zzso These results suggest that this approach is zzso to the detection and identification of zzso zzso in the human oral zzso
