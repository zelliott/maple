Fusion of biological zzso is zzso by specific zzso proteins that induce the formation and expansion of an initial fusion zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso of the zzso Forest virus fusion zzso E1 in its zzso zzso zzso E1 adopts a zzso zzso that, in the final zzso form of the full-length zzso would bring the fusion zzso loop and the zzso anchor to the same end of a stable protein zzso The observed zzso of the fusion zzso loop is compatible with interactions only with the outer leaflet of the zzso zzso Crystal contacts between fusion zzso zzso of adjacent E1 zzso together with electron zzso zzso suggest that in an early step of membrane fusion, an intermediate assembly of five zzso creates two opposing zzso zzso in the viral and target zzso leading to formation of the fusion zzso
