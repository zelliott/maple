A bacterial artificial zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso part of zzso zzso zzso of markers zzso and zzso is zzso This zzso to zzso portion of zzso zzso was previously not physically zzso It contains 24 genes or expressed sequence zzso five zzso zzso repeats, and three new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several of the genes thus mapped are excellent candidates for zzso genes whose zzso have previously been assigned to zzso zzso Our primary interest is in the zzso zzso gene zzso that resides within the zzso between markers zzso and zzso based on linkage zzso
