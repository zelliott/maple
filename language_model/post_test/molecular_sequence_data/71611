The zzso of bovine serum zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso carrier, was investigated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso circular zzso and differential scanning zzso Upon interacting with zzso the zzso zzso spectrum of zzso exhibits zzso at 330 and zzso zzso due to the formation of a Schiff zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso intensity zzso at 295 or 280 zzso by zzso and enhances zzso zzso polarization of zzso by zzso These observations suggest a zzso change in zzso when it interacts with zzso However, this zzso change appears to be small since circular zzso showed only a zzso decrease in the zzso content of zzso and no change in the zzso content, and differential scanning zzso yielded only a zzso change in the zzso of zzso unfolding of zzso zzso zzso an zzso causes no effect on either zzso zzso spectrum or zzso zzso intensity of zzso suggesting that zzso lacks sensitive zzso zzso To help in understanding zzso as a carrier for zzso the results were compared with those for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which requires zzso as the zzso for zzso Although zzso and zzso exhibit comparable molecular weights zzso versus zzso numbers of zzso acid zzso zzso versus zzso and binding affinity zzso zzso distinct zzso zzso occur between the two proteins upon interacting with zzso a small zzso change for zzso versus a large zzso change for zzso In contrast to the case of zzso zzso causes significant effects on both the zzso spectrum and zzso zzso intensity of zzso because zzso contains sensitive zzso zzso zzso such as zzso bond and active site sequence were discussed to understand zzso as a carrier for zzso and a zzso zzso
