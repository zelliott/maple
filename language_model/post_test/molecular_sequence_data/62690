The crystal structure of zzso binding protein zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at a resolution of zzso A with an R factor of zzso By comparing this structure with the structures of zzso from a zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as by comparing zzso acid sequences of zzso from zzso covering a wide range of optimum growth temperatures, two significant zzso of the stability of zzso have been zzso increasing the interior zzso by interaction between three zzso zzso zzso and zzso with further differentiation of the surface, and increasing its zzso and raising the cost of zzso These findings suggest directions along which the stability of zzso can be zzso
