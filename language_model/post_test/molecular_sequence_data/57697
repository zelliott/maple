Type IX collagen is a component of cartilage and zzso zzso Its structure and zzso zzso suggest it may serve to mediate interactions between zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso abnormalities in type IX collagen may result in zzso In this paper we describe the preparation and use of two zzso zzso which recognize zzso sequences within the human cartilage alpha 1 zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso is highly sensitive and highly zzso It permits the zzso detection of type IX collagen extracted from zzso amounts of normal and zzso zzso it also identifies the zzso form of the alpha 1 zzso chain in human zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly specific, but of low zzso It was used to make the new observation that an zzso zzso is present in the zzso zzso domain of the alpha 1 zzso zzso We anticipate that these zzso may be valuable tools in the study of human and other zzso zzso
