Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso is a complex disease characterized by the inability of the zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso to overcome insulin resistance in peripheral zzso To determine if zzso are involved in the zzso of human zzso we zzso the small zzso of human zzso from diabetic and zzso organ zzso We identified a cluster of zzso in an imprinted locus on human zzso zzso that is highly and specifically expressed in human zzso cells and dramatically zzso in zzso from zzso organ zzso The zzso of this locus strongly zzso with zzso of its zzso Using zzso for the essential zzso zzso we identified zzso targets of the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso that cause increased zzso cell zzso upon zzso in human zzso Our results support a role for zzso and their zzso control by DNA zzso in the zzso of zzso
