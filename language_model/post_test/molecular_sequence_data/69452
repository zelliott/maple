We have isolated a new class of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause cells to grow slowly on rich media containing carbon sources zzso by zzso This zzso is suppressed by adding high zzso of iron to the growth zzso zzso zzso also fail to grow on a zzso carbon source, zzso when iron is reduced to low zzso in the zzso suggesting that the zzso gene is required for efficient metabolism of iron during growth on zzso as well as zzso carbon zzso However, activity of the iron zzso system appears to be unaffected in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and regulation is normal in zzso zzso zzso zzso induction during zzso growth is zzso but this appears to be a secondary effect of growth rate zzso The zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso it encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso 13 possible zzso zzso and significant similarity to zzso channel proteins from fish and zzso suggesting that zzso encodes an integral membrane zzso A zzso deletion zzso generated in zzso and introduced into zzso zzso strains by gene zzso was not zzso zzso consumption by intact zzso cells and by zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso was reduced zzso relative to wild type, indicating that zzso function is defective in these zzso We suggest that zzso encodes a transport protein that is involved in zzso iron zzso
