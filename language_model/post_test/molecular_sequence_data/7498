zzso cloning has provided evidence for a new family of protein zzso in zzso zzso These zzso show no sequence similarity with other zzso protein zzso but are related by sequence to the zzso protein zzso found in zzso These protein zzso responsible for zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes, are located exclusively in zzso zzso space and have most likely evolved from genes originally present in zzso bacteria zzso by primitive zzso zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of the activities of these two zzso are of considerable zzso zzso protein zzso increases the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein associated with the zzso zzso zzso complex and the message level for zzso zzso zzso zzso are both greatly increased in the liver of rats starved for zzso suggesting increased expression of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity results in greater zzso and lower activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso consequence is conservation of zzso chain zzso acids for protein synthesis during periods of dietary protein zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been identified and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, the first zzso zzso zzso to the 48 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolated from rat heart zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, the second zzso zzso zzso to the 45 zzso zzso of this zzso In addition, it also appears to zzso to a possibly free or soluble form of zzso zzso zzso that was originally named zzso zzso zzso Assuming that differences in kinetic and/or regulatory properties of these zzso exist, tissue specific expression of these zzso and/or control of their association with the complex will probably prove to be important for the long term regulation of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the diabetic state are known to greatly increase activity of the zzso zzso zzso in the liver, heart and muscle of the zzso This contributes in these states to the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso complex and conservation of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
