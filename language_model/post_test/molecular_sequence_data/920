By similarity searching of the human zzso sequence using known family C zzso receptors zzso as query zzso we have identified a putative novel human gene product of unknown function zzso on zzso band zzso The transcript, entitled zzso zzso 1), was cloned from a human kidney zzso zzso complementary to zzso library and shown to zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed the presence of a zzso zzso domain and an unusually long zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso These traits, along with a significant zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso the taste zzso 1 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso places zzso in family C of the zzso Interestingly, zzso bears the highest resemblance with an zzso goldfish zzso zzso zzso which suggests that zzso is the human zzso of this zzso zzso is widely expressed in brain and peripheral zzso with highest levels in zzso skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso All three zzso are expressed in zzso cells, but are poorly expressed on the cell zzso In this work, we report the existence of two additional zzso zzso (2 and 3) carrying zzso deletions in the zzso Except for the zzso where zzso 1 and 2 appear equally zzso zzso 2 and 3 are generally less abundant than zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso composition of the zzso gene confirms that zzso 2 and 3 are naturally occurring zzso zzso
