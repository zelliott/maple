zzso zzso the zzso precursor are located in zzso and zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso While the zzso zzso zzso has been extensively characterized both at the zzso and zzso level, little is known about those transcripts residing in zzso of zzso zzso As revealed by in zzso zzso at the electron microscopic level, the zzso is located in zzso and zzso zzso segments and is exclusively confined to regions containing rough zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso may be capable of local precursor synthesis independent of that occurring in the cell zzso A zzso system has been employed to define zzso elements within the zzso zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of the zzso promoter coupled to the rat zzso zzso have been injected into the cell zzso of cultured zzso derived from embryonic rat superior cervical zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also sorted to zzso of these zzso indicating that the molecular zzso of zzso zzso transport are not cell zzso zzso of the targeting elements revealed two segments within the zzso zzso that are able to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso which is normally confined to the cell zzso
