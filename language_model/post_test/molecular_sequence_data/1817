To test the feasibility of developing a diagnostic zzso for a specific disease, we selected all zzso changes of the zzso gene occurring at a frequency zzso in the zzso Dutch population for zzso A zzso zzso extension zzso approach was used to detect 19 different zzso causing zzso or abnormal zzso In the zzso reaction, the zzso were zzso at the zzso with a zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso complementary to the zzso following tag zzso to a glass or zzso zzso We compared the performance of a generic glass array and a porous system, by testing each zzso separately using zzso carriers and by screening a cohort of 40 unknown zzso carriers and zzso The results were verified by direct zzso The zzso system was able to detect 17 zzso zzso simultaneously with zzso accuracy in a single zzso zzso The zzso array performed slightly better zzso but the main advantages of the system included real-time data recording and a considerable time saving achieved through a reduced zzso zzso
