zzso is a large zzso zzso produced by the human and animal pathogen zzso zzso The zzso activity of this zzso is directed towards a rare zzso zzso zzso which is displayed on the class III zzso deep within the gastric zzso In addition to the family 89 zzso zzso zzso module this zzso has six zzso that share sequence similarity to the family 32 zzso zzso zzso suggesting the zzso has considerable capacity to adhere to zzso Here we suggest that two of the zzso zzso and zzso are not functional as zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are indeed capable of binding zzso zzso and zzso have a novel binding specificity for zzso which thus zzso the specificity of the zzso zzso The X-ray crystal structure of zzso in complex with this zzso reveals a mode of recognition that is based primarily on accommodation of the unique bent shape of this zzso In contrast, as revealed by a series of X-ray crystal structures and quantitative binding studies, zzso displays the structural and functional features of zzso binding that is commonly associated with zzso family zzso The functional zzso that zzso contains suggest the possibility for zzso binding events and the zzso of this zzso to highly specific regions within the gastrointestinal zzso
