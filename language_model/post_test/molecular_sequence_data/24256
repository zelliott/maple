zzso of the zzso family are the smallest zzso zzso about 110 zzso acids long, that zzso various drugs in exchange with zzso thereby rendering bacteria resistant to these zzso One of these zzso zzso is an zzso coli zzso which has been cloned based on its ability to zzso resistance to zzso and zzso zzso and which has been extensively zzso More than 60 genes coding for zzso proteins have been identified in several bacteria based on zzso acid sequence similarity to the zzso zzso In this work we have analyzed the sequence similarity among these zzso and identified some distinct signature sequence elements and several fully zzso zzso Five of these zzso from human pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from zzso coli, were cloned into an zzso coli expression zzso The proteins were further characterized and show varying degrees of zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso binding in zzso zzso The zzso can also form mixed zzso with zzso that exhibit intermediate binding zzso A comparative study of various zzso proteins provides a tool for deciphering zzso relationship and zzso interaction in zzso zzso and in membrane proteins in zzso
