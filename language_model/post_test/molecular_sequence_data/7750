zzso zzso slow zzso is a zzso zzso of mice that causes zzso and zzso of rod and cone zzso zzso in zzso the human zzso of the zzso zzso are responsible for several inherited retinal zzso including a subset of zzso zzso The normal zzso locus encodes zzso an integral membrane zzso present in outer segment zzso zzso libraries from zzso and zzso mice were screened with an zzso zzso and zzso zzso clones that span the normal and zzso zzso were zzso We show that in mice, zzso is caused by the zzso into zzso II of a zzso repetitive zzso element that is very similar to the zzso zzso element in the zzso zzso The entire element is included in the zzso products of the zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso in mice represents a zzso zzso
