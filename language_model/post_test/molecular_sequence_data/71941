The natural zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso normal zzso expressed and zzso are known to inhibit human zzso virus zzso entry, and zzso modified zzso zzso are more potent than native zzso in blocking zzso However, potent zzso blocking agents may select for zzso zzso that use alternative zzso at less than fully zzso zzso In this study, two zzso chemical modifications of zzso produced by total zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested for their ability to prevent zzso infection and to select for zzso switch zzso in the human peripheral blood zzso mouse zzso Mice were infected with a zzso zzso isolate that requires only one or two zzso acid zzso to use zzso as a zzso Even though it achieved lower circulating zzso than zzso (75 to 96 zzso as opposed to 460 zzso under our experimental zzso zzso was more effective in preventing zzso zzso However, in a subset of treated mice, these levels of zzso rapidly selected viruses with zzso in the zzso loop of envelope that altered zzso zzso These results reinforce the case for using agents that block all significant zzso zzso for effective zzso
