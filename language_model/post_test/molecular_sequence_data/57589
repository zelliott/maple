In host plants, zzso spread of tobacco mosaic virus zzso presumably occurs through zzso connections, the zzso zzso movement is zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso operates is largely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso expressed in transgenic plants is a zzso We have developed an zzso for in zzso zzso of zzso zzso by plant cell wall zzso and have localized the zzso sites to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso sites do not zzso to any known consensus zzso sites for protein zzso While zzso binding to zzso DNA zzso was shown to involve zzso zzso of this zzso does not appear to play a role in binding zzso The protein zzso activity contained in the cell wall zzso was zzso zzso expressed predominantly in zzso Within a zzso this protein zzso activity increased with leaf maturation and correlated with the reported development of secondary zzso sites of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso may represent a mechanism for the host plant to zzso zzso following its zzso to cell zzso
