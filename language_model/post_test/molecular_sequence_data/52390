A panel of zzso zzso zzso to bovine zzso zzso is described which zzso either zzso binding or cell zzso to zzso or zzso A combination of competitive exclusion and binding to zzso fragments identified zzso in the zzso II, zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso which bound to the zzso region, strongly inhibited the cell zzso of zzso zzso primary zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso cells, to zzso at zzso zzso as low as 1 zzso This zzso was not so effective at zzso the zzso of zzso mouse melanoma zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso was more sensitive to zzso by zzso binding to zzso II zzso A9, zzso zzso Of these, zzso and zzso significantly increased the binding of zzso to zzso whereas zzso and A9 did not affect zzso zzso zzso A9 and zzso showed good binding to zzso the 40 zzso zzso zzso of human zzso which contains both zzso II and zzso zzso III connecting zzso These zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso to the zzso zzso binding zzso by zzso the greatest zzso being shown by zzso zzso Two synthetic peptides from the zzso zzso zzso 1) from the zzso region and zzso I from the zzso II region, also inhibited zzso cell zzso to zzso by approximately 70 and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso cell zzso to the zzso involves both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects of the two peptides were zzso additive in zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso A9 and zzso showed synergistic additive effects with each of the zzso This points to the existence of an additional important cell binding site in zzso II, other than zzso zzso Recent independent evidence for an additional cell binding site in zzso II supports this zzso zzso cellular zzso for the zzso II region may be cell surface zzso but do not appear to bind to areas of zzso II with high affinity for soluble zzso as the latter was not an inhibitor of zzso cell zzso to the zzso The increased effectiveness of zzso in zzso cell zzso compared to zzso and A9, may be due to zzso effects which increase the binding of soluble zzso but reduce affinity for the cellular zzso These results are discussed in context with other reports in the zzso
