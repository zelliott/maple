zzso of the zzso zzso producing zzso zzso and zzso zzso were grouped and differentiated in a zzso tree using ITS sequence zzso An attempt was made to develop a zzso zzso for the detection and differentiation of zzso zzso from other zzso species using the zzso of the zzso gene as a zzso However, this zzso was unable to zzso to a satisfactory level, between zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso providing further genetic evidence for their close genetic zzso A robust and zzso zzso was developed for the detection and differentiation of both species based on sequence determined from zzso amplified zzso zzso These zzso were able to detect both species in samples of grain taken from the zzso
