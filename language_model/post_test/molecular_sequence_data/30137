The zzso coli zzso zzso which zzso the final zzso step in the zzso of the bacterial zzso precursor zzso Ala, has been zzso to zzso from an zzso coli strain that harbors a zzso zzso bearing the structural gene for this zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso of molecular weight zzso and it has a turnover number of zzso zzso for zzso zzso bond zzso zzso monitoring the fate of zzso zzso and zzso proved that the preceding zzso in the zzso branch pathway, zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso fluorinated zzso which the zzso zzso can then incorporate to form zzso zzso zzso
