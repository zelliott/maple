zzso zzso zzso virus zzso models are powerful tools for studying the zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso in the zzso Our laboratory recently isolated a zzso viral zzso zzso a zzso of zzso which was the result of sequential intravenous passages of viruses isolated from the brains of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Animals infected with zzso or its precursor zzso developed zzso meningitis and/or encephalitis at high zzso Since we observed zzso with a combination of meningitis and encephalitis, as well as animals in which meningitis or encephalitis was the dominant zzso we hypothesized that distinct mechanisms could be driving the two pathological zzso zzso we assessed viral populations in the zzso and the brain zzso by laser capture zzso zzso zzso were isolated from representative areas of the zzso brain zzso terminal zzso and zzso fluid zzso and from the zzso and the zzso envelope zzso was amplified by zzso zzso analysis of envelope sequences from the conventional zzso revealed zzso of viral populations between the zzso and the zzso In one of these animals, viral populations in zzso were closely related to those from zzso and shared signature zzso in the zzso domain of zzso consistent with a common zzso Apart from magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso is the most accessible assess to the central nervous system for zzso zzso However, our results suggest that the virus in the zzso may not always be representative of viral populations in the brain and that caution should be applied in zzso between the properties of viruses in these two zzso
