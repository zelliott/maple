The zzso box A zzso domain is an zzso zzso zzso zzso domain present in approximately one-third of zinc finger proteins of the zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we report the isolation of a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso interacting protein 1 zzso that physically interacts with the zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso finger, or zzso family of zinc binding proteins whose other members are known to play important roles in zzso zzso and signal zzso The zzso protein has high zzso to zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso function of nuclear zzso A zzso zzso for zzso is zzso expressed among all adult mouse zzso zzso When a zzso fusion protein is expressed in zzso cells with a zzso zzso reporter construct with five zzso binding sites, there is zzso repression of zzso Thus, zzso interacts with the zzso region of zzso zinc finger proteins and may mediate or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
