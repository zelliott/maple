The zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso protein zzso the first two reactions of the zzso zzso In this zzso these two reactions are feedback inhibited by the end product zzso In the present work, the mechanisms of these integrated inhibitions were zzso 

The results obtained show that the zzso is competitive in the case of zzso zzso and zzso in the case of zzso zzso They also identify the zzso whose binding is altered by this zzso and the step of the zzso zzso reaction which is zzso Furthermore, the structure of the zzso catalyzing these two reactions were zzso in order to zzso the zzso which, specifically, alter the zzso zzso sensitivity to the feedback inhibitor zzso Taken together, the results make it possible to propose a model for the integrated regulation of the two activities of the zzso zzso binds to a regulatory site located in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the third step of this zzso zzso Through a local zzso change, this binding zzso zzso the affinity of this site for the zzso zzso At the same time, through a long distance signal transmission process it zzso decreases the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso site for the zzso zzso 

This investigation provides zzso about the mechanisms of zzso zzso of the two activities of the zzso zzso Although many zzso zzso zzso were zzso this is the first report on integrated zzso regulation in a zzso zzso The positions of the point zzso which specifically abolish the sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso define an interface between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso through which the zzso signal for the regulation of zzso zzso must be zzso
