Type III zzso systems are essential zzso zzso for many zzso bacterial zzso The type III zzso system consists of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain is a hollow needle protruding above the bacterial surface and is held within a zzso body that zzso both bacterial zzso zzso proteins are zzso via this external needle, directly into host cells, where they zzso normal cell functions to aid zzso Physical contact with host cells zzso zzso and leads to formation of a zzso thought to be zzso with the needle channel, in the zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso needle zzso zzso and a complete model for the needle assembly built into our three-dimensional zzso zzso The model, combined with zzso data, reveals that signaling of zzso contact is relayed through the needle via zzso contacts and suggests a mode of binding for a tip zzso
