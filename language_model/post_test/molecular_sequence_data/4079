The plasmids zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso DNA sequence determination and zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso genetic organization containing five major, highly zzso open reading frames zzso Transformation studies indicated that zzso zzso of a zzso fused to a zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso constitute the minimal requirements for replication of zzso in the zzso host zzso zzso The zzso are predicted to zzso type I zzso zzso system zzso zzso with different zzso on either zzso suggesting that these plasmids may be involved in host defense by expanding their host zzso system zzso These plasmids constitute the basis for the construction of novel zzso zzso zzso
