zzso pathogens cause an expressive negative impact worldwide on human health, with ever increasing treatment zzso A significant rise in resistance to commercial antibiotics has been observed in zzso bacteria responsible for urinary and zzso zzso zzso the development of novel approaches to control such common infections, a number of defense peptides with zzso activities have been zzso In this report, the zzso zzso was isolated from zzso seeds zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso affinity column followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso activity against zzso but resulted in a clear growth reduction in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are the principal pathogens involved in urinary and zzso hospital zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso characterized zzso a zzso with a molecular mass of zzso and small quantities of a zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed clear identity to the plant zzso protein family, with zzso the first such protein with activity towards zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso showed a zzso structural zzso to an zzso from zzso coli, and other zzso zzso revealing that it might act by formation of a zzso zzso shows potential, in a near future, to contribute to development of novel antibiotics from natural zzso
