Ion channels are often modulated by changes in zzso zzso with most examples resulting from shifts in the zzso state of zzso zzso in the channel zzso The application of zzso zzso solution inhibited expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel zzso with zzso zzso of approximately zzso being approximately fourfold more sensitive than zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso was found to be zzso dependent, resulting from a shift in the affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso at the inner mouth of the selectivity zzso The zzso by zzso zzso resulted from a reduction in the single-channel zzso without significant changes in zzso zzso or open zzso zzso and zzso zzso both possess a zzso zzso in their outer pore region between the zzso zzso segment and the pore zzso with zzso also exhibiting an additional zzso zzso between the selectivity filter and zzso zzso revealed that the outer pore zzso common to both channels was critical for zzso The greater sensitivity of zzso currents to zzso arose from the additional zzso zzso in the zzso which was more zzso to the zzso zzso and in the zzso vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso The decrease of channel zzso by zzso zzso was zzso by zzso of the outer pore zzso in zzso to an zzso zzso These data suggest that local interactions involving the outer zzso zzso zzso are crucial to enable high zzso openings, with zzso zzso current by changing pore zzso
