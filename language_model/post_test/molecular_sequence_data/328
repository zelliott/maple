zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso repeat proteins that mediate zzso immunity in zzso zzso zzso are fundamentally different from the zzso of zzso zzso which consist of zzso zzso zzso We determined the structure of an zzso egg white zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso display, bound to zzso The zzso whose affinity resembles that of zzso zzso uses nearly all its zzso surface to bind the zzso in addition to a loop that zzso into the zzso active zzso The zzso structure combined with sequence analysis revealed an almost perfect match between zzso positions and positions with highest sequence zzso Thus, it is likely that we have defined the generalized zzso site of zzso We further demonstrated that zzso can be zzso by zzso to affinities as high as those of zzso zzso making zzso potential alternatives to zzso for biotechnology zzso
