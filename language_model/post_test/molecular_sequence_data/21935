We previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso point zzso zzso displays a defective zzso in zzso zzso polarity in zzso zzso To investigate the biological function of zzso in detail, we isolated two zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso induced point zzso zzso zzso we detected no zzso of zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited altered zzso zzso aerial zzso was not formed with no zzso formation, zzso the zzso exhibited colonial, and very slow zzso growth on a solid medium and by shaking culture in a liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is reduced to less than half that by wild type, zzso the zzso exhibited spiral growth of zzso and zzso female zzso with defective zzso zzso The zzso processes of 1, 3, and 5 are light induced in the wild zzso Moreover, despite only zzso of total zzso zzso zzso activity, the zzso of relevant transcripts in the zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso was similar to that of wild zzso
