We have characterized a growth zzso zzso zzso isolated by differential screening of a zzso complementary DNA library from zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells which encodes a zzso acid protein presenting high similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and protein is rapid and remains at high levels for several zzso The increase in zzso zzso is mainly due to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been expressed in the zzso system and has been demonstrated to be involved in zzso synthesis and to be inhibited by zzso demonstrating that zzso is indeed an zzso related to zzso The zzso gene maps to the zzso region of the zzso zzso
