A novel zzso protection system for zzso zzso based on a genetic zzso in which a strictly zzso promoter isolated from the zzso zzso zzso is used to activate a bacterial suicide system after infection, was zzso The lethal gene of the suicide system consists of the zzso restriction cassette zzso which is lethal across a wide range of zzso zzso The zzso trigger promoter zzso and the zzso restriction cassette were cloned in zzso coli on a zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso activity was not apparent in zzso coli or zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso In zzso challenges of zzso zzso with zzso the efficiency of zzso was lowered to zzso and accompanied by a fourfold reduction in burst zzso zzso zzso revealed that only zzso of infected cells released progeny zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso suicide cassette also inhibited four zzso zzso zzso at levels at least zzso greater than that of zzso The zzso suicide system is a genetically engineered form of zzso infection that traps and eliminates zzso potentially evolving in zzso environments by destroying the zzso zzso and killing the propagation zzso This type of zzso suicide system could be designed for any zzso zzso given a universal lethal gene and an zzso promoter which is triggered by the infecting zzso
