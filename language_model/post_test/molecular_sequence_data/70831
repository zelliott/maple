The zzso zzso has been proposed to play the role of triggering zzso in the natural zzso zzso by human zzso zzso In this study we have identified the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso that we termed zzso The zzso gene is localized on zzso 7 that is zzso to the human zzso 19 where the zzso gene is zzso zzso encodes a type I zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso that, like human zzso is characterized by two zzso zzso zzso a zzso portion containing a positively charged zzso and a zzso tail lacking the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso The zzso protein is expressed on the surface of cell zzso and displays a molecular mass of approximately 46 zzso similar to that of its human zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso similar to the human zzso is selectively expressed by zzso zzso The zzso protein displays 58 % identity with the human zzso zzso This high zzso together with the presence of a charged zzso acid zzso in the zzso portion suggest that zzso may associate at the cell membrane into a zzso complex with zzso containing zzso
