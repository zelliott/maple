zzso forming zzso zzso are some of the most promising tools in the zzso strategy for the development of gene targeting zzso However, the stable triplex formation is restricted to the zzso sequences consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the T or zzso zzso in the zzso strand zzso the stable triplex zzso We have developed zzso zzso zzso zzso for the formation of the zzso type triplex DNA, with sequences containing the interrupting site in an zzso triplex zzso In the present study, we tested the zzso effect of zzso having zzso which increased the stability of the triplex formation with a target sequence including the zzso interrupting zzso We designed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for targeting sequences of the zzso or zzso zzso The gel shift zzso showed that the zzso zzso formed more stable zzso than the natural zzso zzso the zzso or zzso zzso zzso inhibited the cell proliferation and induced a zzso zzso It was confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso more effectively decreased the number of zzso products in the zzso cell than the natural zzso
