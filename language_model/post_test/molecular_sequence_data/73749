We have identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is an early and highly specific marker of neural induction in zzso zzso which encodes a zzso family related zzso is expressed during early zzso in the prospective zzso region of the zzso and later in development throughout the nervous system zzso zzso expression is highly dynamic and, after zzso zzso defines prospective cortical zzso The only apparent expression of zzso outside the zzso is restricted to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the times corresponding to the zzso that precedes zzso zzso Cellular expression of zzso zzso shows extensive zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrate a physical association between zzso and zzso zzso functions as an zzso protein that may be important in the organization of the zzso zzso during neural fate zzso and development of the zzso
