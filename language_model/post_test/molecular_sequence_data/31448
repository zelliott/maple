Notwithstanding their biological importance, Y zzso remain poorly known in most zzso A major obstacle to their study is the identification of Y zzso zzso due to its high content of repetitive DNA, in most zzso projects, the Y zzso sequence is fragmented into a large number of small, zzso zzso Identification of zzso genes among these fragments has yielded important insights about the origin and evolution of Y zzso but the process is labor zzso restricting studies to a small number of zzso Apart from these zzso zzso in a few zzso species, the zzso sequence of the Y is essentially complete, zzso to painstaking zzso mapping and zzso Here we use female zzso sequencing and zzso comparison to identify zzso sequences in two very different zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using this method, essentially all zzso zzso scaffolds were zzso classified as zzso or not zzso We found 800 new scaffolds zzso zzso zzso and four new genes in the Y zzso of zzso zzso including zzso a gene involved in hybrid male zzso Our results also strongly support the preponderance of gene gains over gene losses in the evolution of the zzso zzso In the zzso studied human zzso used here as a positive control, we recovered all previously known genes or gene families, plus a small amount zzso zzso of new, unfinished zzso zzso this method works in large and complex zzso and can be applied to any species with sex zzso
