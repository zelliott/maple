zzso characterization of muscle fibers relies on zzso activity and on differential zzso of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso calcium cycling proteins and components of the zzso zzso The recent introduction of zzso technology has enabled detailed gene expression studies under different zzso and pathological conditions, thus generating novel hypotheses on muscle zzso However, zzso approaches are limited by the incomplete zzso coverage of currently available chips, and by poor correlation between zzso concentration and protein expression zzso We have used zzso and zzso to build a reference map of proteins from rat mixed zzso and zzso muscle, and to assess qualitative and quantitative differences in protein distribution between these two functionally dissimilar zzso More than 800 spots on each gel were detected by silver zzso of which 167 were zzso zzso zzso with zzso and analyzed by zzso One hundred and zzso eight distinct gene products were identified, including zzso transport and zzso zzso Forty one spots displayed differences in relative expression level between mixed zzso and zzso zzso These data not only enable differentiation of functionally distinct zzso and zzso fiber types, but also provide tools for investigating muscle plasticity in response to zzso and environmental conditions such as aging or zzso
