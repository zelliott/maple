A survey was conducted on the ecological distribution of zzso zzso acid bacteria in zzso a typical fermented food in zzso zzso AND zzso Nine zzso were sampled for isolation of zzso Almost all isolated zzso strains produced zzso but no isolated zzso did zzso The zzso zzso were divided into nine groups by zzso zzso As the zzso characters were highly diverse, these strains could not be identified to species level on the basis of their zzso The nine representative strains from each group were identified by zzso zzso zzso These zzso with one exception zzso zzso were identified as strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the nine strains were classified into five types according to their zzso spectral patterns and their zzso zzso The zzso inhibited zzso bacteria in zzso such as zzso zzso but did not inhibit the useful zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso acid zzso were widespread at high zzso in zzso They were considered to play an important role in preventing the growth of zzso zzso 

This study suggests that zzso act effectively as safe zzso and may contribute to the zzso in zzso
