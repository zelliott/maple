zzso zzso of yellow fever virus zzso in zzso cells was employed to derive seed material for a novel zzso zzso zzso Two independent zzso series identified a novel zzso to zzso zzso at zzso acid 160 of the envelope zzso a zzso zzso in structural domain zzso A third passage series resulted in an zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 113 of the zzso zzso a central membrane spanning region of the protein which has previously been associated with zzso cell adaptation of other zzso zzso These studies confirm that zzso adaptation to growth in zzso cells can be zzso by structural or zzso protein zzso
