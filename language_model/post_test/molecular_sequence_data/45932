zzso is a zzso zzso protein with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso the removal of zzso zzso modifications from proteins and we have found that it resides in the zzso third of zzso The recognition of the zzso zzso suggests that the zzso is related in structure and zzso mechanism to zzso zzso and zzso These families of zzso all possess a zzso zzso of zzso zzso with one providing an zzso function, and the second acting to orient and use the zzso group of zzso during zzso Indeed, we show that the zzso also possesses the zzso zzso motif shared among these zzso and that these two essential zzso are zzso acids at positions 175 and zzso respectively, in mouse zzso In addition, a zzso zzso at 166 and a zzso zzso acid at 174 were also found to be necessary for fully efficient zzso zzso Given this information, we propose that the zzso active site resembles those of the above zzso which carry out the zzso of zzso linkages in a zzso zzso zzso
