zzso zzso turnover is a highly important process, but its mechanism is poorly zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as a model, we described a role for the zzso zzso in stabilization of zzso zzso during zzso zzso acting via a zzso response element zzso in the zzso untranslated region zzso We have now identified two major zzso zzso zzso and zzso that specifically bind to the zzso zzso of both proteins is required for zzso zzso stabilization induced by zzso zzso signals and for zzso stabilization in a zzso system that zzso essential features of regulated zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for formation of an zzso zzso complex that responds to specific zzso stabilizing zzso
