zzso syndrome type 2 zzso is an uncommon zzso condition characterized by zzso zzso a skeletal zzso affecting the zzso and zzso skeleton and zzso anomalies including zzso of the brain, heart, zzso system, and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes for the protein zzso A, have recently been shown to cause zzso and the zzso syndromes zzso type 1, zzso and zzso zzso zzso these conditions constitute the zzso spectrum zzso We report on two zzso affected by zzso The diagnosis was achieved at autopsy of a zzso male zzso with typical external and skeletal findings of zzso A subsequent pregnancy was terminated due to zzso findings resembling those observed in the previous zzso zzso studies revealed zzso sclerosis and do not support the previously reported zzso zzso zzso observed in this zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a novel zzso zzso in zzso that had arisen de zzso in the zzso This zzso zzso predicts the substitution zzso within the second zzso zzso domain of the zzso domain of zzso zzso The identical substitution has been recently identified in an analogous zzso position within the zzso binding domain of zzso leading to zzso zzso The observation that zzso is normally present in the same position in other proteins zzso zzso but leads to disease when present in zzso A implies that the function and/or structure of these zzso binding zzso are not entirely zzso
