A visibly distinct muscular zzso zzso commonly known as double zzso occurs with high frequency in the Belgian Blue and zzso cattle zzso The zzso zzso zzso locus causing zzso condition in these cattle maps to bovine zzso 2 within the same zzso as myostatin, a member of the zzso zzso of zzso Because targeted disruption of myostatin in mice results in a muscular zzso very similar to that seen in zzso zzso we have evaluated this gene as a candidate gene for zzso condition by cloning the bovine myostatin zzso and examining the expression pattern and sequence of the gene in normal and zzso zzso The analysis demonstrates that the levels and timing of expression do not appear to differ between Belgian Blue and normal animals, as both classes show expression initiating during fetal development and being maintained in adult zzso Moreover, sequence analysis reveals zzso in zzso cattle of both zzso Belgian Blue cattle are zzso for an zzso deletion in the coding region that is not detected in zzso of any normal animals zzso This deletion results in a zzso zzso that removes the portion of the zzso protein that is most highly zzso among zzso family members and that is the portion targeted for disruption in the mouse zzso zzso animals tested have a zzso transition in the same region that changes a zzso zzso to a zzso This zzso alters one of the zzso that are hallmarks of the zzso family and are highly zzso during evolution and among members of the gene zzso It therefore appears likely that the zzso zzso in these breeds involves zzso within the myostatin gene and that myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle growth in cattle as well as zzso
