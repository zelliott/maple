Using a zzso approach we have isolated zzso a novel member of the zzso family in zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein of 193 zzso acids and is zzso expressed throughout the zzso life zzso zzso identity zzso was found to a zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to zzso proteins of animal species zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we have fused it at its zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso and studied the dynamics of zzso zzso using a zzso laser scanning microscope and a zzso microscope zzso zzso was zzso distributed in the zzso and accumulated at the plasma zzso especially at regions of transient zzso zzso zzso also localized zzso to zzso and zzso cups and was gradually released within zzso zzso after formation of the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso On stimulation with zzso no enrichment of zzso was observed in leading fronts, from which it was found to be initially zzso Cell lines were obtained using zzso zzso that expressed a truncated zzso gene lacking sequences zzso the zzso region responsible for membrane zzso These cells displayed normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso associates with dynamic structures that are formed during zzso and zzso Although zzso appears not to be essential, it might act in concert and/or share functions with other members of the zzso family in the regulation of a subset of zzso zzso that are required for these zzso
