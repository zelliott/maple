Depending on growth phase and culture conditions, zzso zzso makes up zzso of the zzso in zzso coli with the remainder being primarily zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso coli, the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso each zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of two PG molecules to form zzso and zzso However, a zzso zzso still makes zzso in the stationary phase, indicating the existence of additional zzso We identified a third zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso has sequence zzso with zzso and zzso which all belong to the zzso D zzso The zzso zzso lacks zzso zzso regardless of growth phase or growth zzso zzso can be restored to near zzso levels in stationary phase in the triple zzso by expressing either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso alone resulted in a low level of zzso in the stationary phase, which increased to near zzso levels by zzso of its neighboring zzso zzso zzso synthesis by all zzso is increased with increasing medium zzso during zzso growth and in stationary zzso However, only zzso contributes zzso levels of zzso at low zzso during zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso motif of zzso prevents zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso use PG and zzso as zzso or zzso the combined zzso used zzso as the zzso donor to PG to form zzso which demonstrates a third and unique mode for zzso zzso
