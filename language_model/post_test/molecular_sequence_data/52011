A novel zzso zzso finger gene zzso was identified by screening zzso libraries with zzso derived from zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of DNA binding zzso It is zzso in mouse where zzso in zzso is initiated at Day 20 after zzso The mouse zzso gene is located in the zzso inversion of the zzso and is zzso regulated in the same manner as zzso The human zzso of zzso was isolated to allow a precise zzso zzso By using a combination of zzso cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, zzso and zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso we mapped the two genes to the zzso to zzso region and linked them to each other within 300 zzso of DNA, approximately 2 zzso zzso to the major zzso zzso
