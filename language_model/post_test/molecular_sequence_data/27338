zzso a member of the multiple zzso resistance regulator zzso family of regulatory proteins in bacteria and zzso plays important roles in development of zzso resistance, a global health zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso strain 7 zzso with zzso a well-known inhibitor of zzso proteins and the zzso complex with its promoter DNA, refined to zzso and zzso A resolutions, zzso The zzso complex shares the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with each zzso containing a winged zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso large zzso changes occurred upon DNA binding and in each of the zzso zzso in the zzso unit of the zzso zzso zzso zzso loop zzso interacting with the bound DNA and zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso and zzso were important for DNA zzso zzso the bound DNA exhibited a new binding zzso
