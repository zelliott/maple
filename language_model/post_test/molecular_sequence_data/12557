zzso of individual zzso of the plasma membrane zzso were made in the highly zzso region that (in related zzso zzso has been associated with zzso zzso zzso of the strictly zzso zzso to zzso nearly eliminated the ability of the pump to transport zzso while zzso at zzso zzso and zzso reduced the zzso High levels of zzso zzso zzso did not overcome the reduced activity, indicating that it could not be due to a reduction in the affinity for zzso zzso not directly related to zzso binding seemed to result from zzso in this zzso For instance, the amount of zzso intermediate in the most severely inhibited zzso zzso was nearly as high as that in the wild type, a much larger amount of zzso intermediate than was expected from its low zzso However, the rate of decomposition of this intermediate was much slower than that of the wild type, indicating that the zzso of this zzso resulted from an zzso of the E approximately zzso step in the zzso zzso
