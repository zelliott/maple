zzso of zzso ratio on zzso and zzso removal efficiency were investigated in model experiments applying zzso zzso The reduction of both zzso performed well at different zzso ratios ranging from zzso to zzso The removal rates of nitrate and zzso were 6 and zzso respectively, at zzso ratio zzso while zzso concentration reached up to zzso The major zzso and zzso bacteria were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso ratio led to obvious changes in bacterial zzso Although the zzso zzso became dominant, the population of zzso ones also increased as it was demonstrated by analysis of zzso zzso zzso fragments, which suggested that zzso and DB zzso well in zzso
