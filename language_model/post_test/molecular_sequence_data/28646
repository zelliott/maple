zzso acid sequence analysis of the product zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is capable of zzso zzso zzso revealed all known motifs zzso among replication zzso proteins that initiate zzso replication of plasmids related to zzso Using the zzso expression system in zzso coli, zzso was identified as a zzso zzso Its lethal effect on bacterial cells was unusually high for a protein of the zzso zzso analysis of the potential active centers zzso and zzso showed that the lethal effect of zzso is not associated with its putative zzso zzso zzso On evidence of deletion zzso the lethal effect was attributed to the zzso and zzso zzso each accounting for about zzso of the total zzso The zzso fragments essential for the lethal effect were found to share a zzso which showed no appreciable zzso to known zzso zzso The high lethal effect of zzso was assumed to result from zzso of the motif and to play an zzso role, providing for the stable maintenance of the zzso zzso in zzso bacterial zzso
