zzso zzso and zzso have been identified, by using specific blockers, as zzso involved in zzso volume regulation under zzso zzso All three channels were zzso on the zzso droplets and tail of human zzso zzso by zzso zzso Using flow zzso zzso zzso was found to be present in zzso or more zzso and zzso in only about zzso with zzso expressed by zzso of zzso Whereas the zzso of such protein expression did not differ statistically between zzso donors and zzso patients, the former group exhibited higher capacities for zzso volume regulation which were correlated with other zzso qualities including normal zzso and zzso zzso number in the zzso Channel identification was further confirmed at the protein level using Western zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso of proven quality indicated the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso products demonstrated that the zzso sequences of the entire zzso regions of zzso and zzso were identical to those published in the database, whereas that of zzso zzso showed a single zzso synonymous zzso that agrees with the published zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed the amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same order as for protein zzso Thus, zzso is probably the major zzso involved in regulatory volume decrease in human zzso and channel activity is regulated beyond the extent of protein zzso
