We reconstruct the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from Asia Minor and the zzso We used the complete zzso b gene of 65 specimens in order to zzso their evolutionary history in this zzso interesting zzso Our zzso analysis did not evidence the previously suggested zzso of the zzso zzso but revealed five zzso lineages in the zzso the lineages zzso zzso including all species of zzso plus the lineage zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso from Lake zzso in zzso was closely related to the zzso population of zzso zzso and zzso inside the lineage zzso zzso The strictly zzso distribution of the four lineages of zzso suggests that zzso has played a major role in the diversification of zzso All zzso species of zzso zzso zzso from Asia Minor and zzso were closely related to zzso zzso zzso from Central Europe, the Danube basin and the Caucasus, indicating at least two zzso events into Asia Minor and the zzso A third, recent zzso event led to the presence of zzso zzso generally restricted to the Aegean Sea zzso in the Danube zzso Besides the zzso of zzso and zzso events in the zzso history of the zzso zzso in Asia Minor and the Balkans, our analysis suggested also a rapid zzso evolution of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso zzso b clocks of zzso sequence divergence per million years zzso suggest that the split between the five major lineages happened approximately zzso zzso and according to the lack of zzso resolution of this zzso group probably the split of all lineages happened within a narrow time zzso
