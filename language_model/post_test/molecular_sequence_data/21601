zzso zzso zzso are poorly characterized zzso In spite of this scarce knowledge, zzso has been described as playing a central role in the zzso of human pathogens such as zzso zzso for which zzso has been shown to participate in the nitrogen zzso zzso zzso analysis has revealed that at least two different groups of zzso are classified as zzso zzso on the one hand, the derivatives of the zzso zzso which are the best studied to date, and on the other hand, the derivatives of zzso zzso zzso Here we present the zzso zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second member of the zzso zzso to be zzso showing new features of the zzso further supporting its relationship with zzso zzso We also present zzso zzso zzso studies confirming the importance of the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso activities of the zzso zzso Moreover, we can conclude that a second zzso zzso is critical in several members of the zzso zzso meaning that what has consistently been identified as a zzso zzso is in fact a zzso zzso
