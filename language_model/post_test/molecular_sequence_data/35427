zzso are small zzso zzso that are widespread in living zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently shown to be an zzso plant zzso zzso is critical for proper vascular development and zzso cell zzso but it is not known how zzso zzso is controlled in the zzso We present data in the zzso model system supporting the existence of a negative feedback control of zzso levels in stem zzso zzso the main site of zzso zzso While zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulted in strong zzso of zzso expression and zzso zzso in leaves, the corresponding levels in the secondary zzso zzso of the stem were similar or lower than those in the zzso zzso zzso had a negative effect on zzso of zzso acid, while zzso zzso had a positive effect on zzso zzso thus promoting zzso zzso Further, zzso of zzso zzso affected expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor gene zzso a zzso of zzso while zzso of zzso positively affected zzso zzso These results indicate that excessive zzso of zzso is prevented by a negative feedback control of zzso transcript levels through suppression of zzso acid levels, and that zzso is involved in the control of zzso zzso We propose that this negative feedback loop functions to maintain zzso levels of zzso which is required for proper zzso development, and that it is dependent on the presence of high zzso of zzso zzso acid, such as those present in the secondary zzso zzso
