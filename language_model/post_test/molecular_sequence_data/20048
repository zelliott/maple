The marine zzso zzso zzso is a species complex composed of many highly divergent and mostly zzso genetic lineages that are reproductively isolated but share a remarkably similar zzso One such lineage commonly zzso zzso throughout the zzso Atlantic zzso To explore the processes leading to geographical diversification, zzso isolation and zzso in this zzso we zzso investigated zzso Atlantic zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso used breeding trials between geographical zzso to ascertain zzso zzso We find that zzso diversity is geographically variable and there is a strong population structure, with significant isolation by zzso zzso Atlantic zzso zzso is structured into two main zzso lineages that appear to have had independent zzso zzso Range expansions have resulted in two contact zones in Spain and W zzso zzso 1 is found from Ireland to Spain and has low zzso diversity, with closely related zzso suggesting a recent population expansion into the Irish Sea, S Ireland, S England and zzso zzso 2 is found from zzso to Spain and has high zzso zzso Complete zzso isolation was found between some geographical zzso representing both zzso whereas it was incomplete or zzso between others, suggesting these latter zzso groups probably represent zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso Atlantic zzso zzso does not fall easily into a pattern of southern zzso and we discuss likely differences between zzso and marine system responses to zzso glacial zzso
