A zzso dysfunctional form of zzso zzso zzso shows reduced zzso zzso activity, although it retains full zzso activity toward synthetic zzso To zzso the structural zzso of the zzso zzso we first performed genetic analysis of zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of the zzso 8 through 14 of the zzso and her family members' zzso zzso which code the zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso analysis, identified two zzso zzso in zzso 10 specific to this zzso One zzso zzso detected in the father was inherited by the zzso and one of her sisters, and the other detected in the mother was also inherited by zzso This result indicates that the zzso has two different base pair changes in the zzso zzso showed two novel point zzso in the zzso zzso One is a T to C transition at position zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso 337 zzso zzso zzso The other is a G to A transition at zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso 388 zzso zzso zzso By sequencing analysis of her parents, it was determined that zzso zzso I was inherited from the father and zzso zzso II from the zzso These results confirm that zzso zzso is compound zzso for two dysfunctional zzso zzso
