The DNA sequences of zzso from G + zzso and A + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso are deficient in zzso zzso and contain an excess of zzso and zzso zzso relative to zzso predicted from their zzso zzso In contrast, for sequences from zzso of G + zzso and A + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso and human zzso zzso a zzso the mean observed zzso of these zzso are close to those expected from their zzso zzso Comparisons between DNA sequences that zzso proteins zzso in all these viruses also show that sequences of these zzso viruses are zzso whereas the zzso genes from the zzso viruses and the zzso are zzso zzso of local variations in zzso zzso reveal some zzso of clustered zzso zzso in generally deficient zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso gene of zzso and locally zzso regions within some generally zzso zzso zzso the major immediate early genes of human, zzso and zzso zzso A relative zzso in zzso and an excess of zzso and zzso zzso is a diagnostic feature of higher zzso DNA sequences that have been subjected to zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with the resulting increase in zzso to give zzso (and thereby its complement, zzso The available evidence implicates the zzso zzso as the site of zzso of these zzso We conclude that in the zzso zzso the normal zzso precursors to infectious progeny are not zzso whereas there is local zzso of the immediate early locus in the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of these zzso zzso are extensively zzso
