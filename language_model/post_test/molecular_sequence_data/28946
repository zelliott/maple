We have cloned the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a new zzso that zzso zzso and zzso to the corresponding zzso acid, zzso and hydrogen zzso By inserting the DNA zzso for GO into the multiple cloning site of the expression zzso zzso we produced a zzso zzso zzso The zzso encodes a fully active fusion protein with six additional zzso at the zzso of GO zzso In zzso zzso coli cells, and under optimal zzso zzso induction conditions, soluble and active zzso GO was expressed up to zzso U zzso of cell (and a zzso yield of zzso U zzso zzso of zzso zzso An zzso zzso protein zzso was also successfully expressed in zzso coli as a soluble protein and a fully active zzso zzso represents approximately zzso of the total soluble protein content of the zzso The zzso GO was zzso in a single step by zzso zzso to a specific activity of zzso U zzso zzso protein at 25 degrees C and with a yield of zzso The characterization of the zzso zzso showed that GO is a zzso of approximately 180 zzso with the spectral properties typical of zzso GO exhibits good zzso stability, with a zzso of 46 degrees C after 30 zzso zzso its stability is zzso in the zzso pH zzso A comparison of zzso sequence and zzso specificity indicates that GO has similarities to other zzso acting on primary zzso and on zzso zzso
