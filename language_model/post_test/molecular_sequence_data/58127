The zzso of human T cell zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso precursor zzso T zzso zzso were zzso from zzso obtained from the peripheral blood and zzso fluid zzso of infected individuals with and without zzso neurological zzso An estimate of the zzso was obtained by separating zzso cells, zzso these cells in limiting zzso and testing zzso for zzso specific zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso cell lines zzso infected with zzso zzso expressing zzso gene products or zzso zzso with zzso synthetic zzso In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the frequency of zzso zzso zzso was at least zzso higher than in zzso zzso zzso All zzso patients (five of five) predominantly recognized zzso products zzso within the zzso zzso Lower zzso to zzso were demonstrated in three patients, and only one of five zzso patients had zzso to zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to the tax region of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso was recognized in association with human zzso zzso zzso zzso in two zzso zzso patients with a high zzso zzso frequency of zzso and zzso zzso A second zzso region of zzso tax zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso was identified to be restricted by zzso in two zzso zzso patients with a zzso zzso frequency of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of a patient with zzso also showed a zzso frequency against zzso of similar magnitude to that demonstrated from peripheral blood zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also comparable to zzso from zzso These results indicate that an extremely high zzso frequency to zzso zzso peptides may be related to zzso of zzso associated with zzso
