A zzso 5 zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain harboring a zzso type zzso using a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso Five thousand zzso were zzso for zzso on carrot zzso zzso zzso zzso 54 zzso were zzso or very zzso The cellular zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso in those zzso were identified by Southern zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in the zzso was selected and zzso The zzso had the same growth rate as that of the parent strain in zzso The zzso and the parent strain had similar attachment ability to carrot root zzso zzso was inserted into one site of the zzso The zzso target zzso region zzso base zzso was cloned and zzso An open reading frame zzso consisting of 395 base pairs was zzso The zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso introduced into zzso strain zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso A soluble protein was predicted from the zzso The zzso was inserted near the zzso of the zzso zzso search of this zzso found no significant zzso to known genes and zzso Thus, the zzso identified in this paper seems to be a new zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso
