We have previously defined the promoter of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in a zzso zzso between bases zzso and zzso relative to the translation start zzso Here, we report that a novel nuclear zzso zzso sequence zzso at zzso is located in the zzso promoter and one of the two zzso zzso regions, region I between bases zzso and zzso This zzso motif differs at positions 7-9 from the zzso consensus sequences of zzso zzso where R indicates A or G, Y indicates C or zzso and N indicates any zzso and at positions 1 and 7-9 from the zzso motifs zzso where H indicates A, C, or zzso R indicates A or G, Y indicates C or zzso and N indicates any zzso Nuclear extracts from zzso cells contain proteins that specifically bind to the zzso site at position zzso zzso of the zzso motif decreased the binding of zzso factor zzso and reduced the zzso promoter activity in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso with a dominant negative zzso zzso expression zzso reduced zzso promoter activity by zzso These results demonstrate that a previously zzso zzso motif is required for zzso promoter zzso
