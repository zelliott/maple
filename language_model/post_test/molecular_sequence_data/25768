zzso in putative zzso VIII of zzso zzso that retain the ability to accumulate zzso were created by cassette zzso A zzso insert zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was zzso chemically by using zzso contaminated with zzso each of the other three bases and zzso into a zzso site in the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso that retain transport activity were selected by transforming a strain of zzso coli containing a zzso zzso zzso but deleted in zzso with the zzso library and identifying colonies that transport zzso on indicator zzso zzso of the zzso region in zzso in 129 positive colonies reveals 43 single zzso acid zzso at 26 sites and 26 multiple zzso The variable zzso acid positions are largely on one side of the putative zzso a stripe opposite zzso This zzso stripe of low information content is probably in contact with the membrane zzso
