zzso zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso in many developing countries where drought stress considerably diminishes agricultural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso which play a crucial role in cellular zzso and zzso stress zzso In this study, 84 zzso genes were identified in barley by a comprehensive in zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso analysis grouped these zzso proteins in eight zzso The largest numbers of the zzso genes zzso were included in the zzso class followed by 21 genes in Phi, five in zzso two in zzso two in zzso two in zzso and one each in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the putative zzso from zzso rice, and barley indicated that major functional diversification within the zzso family predated the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso seems to be zzso zzso patterns of five zzso genes from zzso and zzso classes were investigated in three barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso under control and zzso conditions, during the zzso zzso All investigated genes were zzso significantly under drought stress and/or showed a higher level of transcripts in the tolerant zzso Additionally, zzso zzso activity was superior in zzso and induced in the zzso leaves, while it was not changed in zzso under drought zzso Moreover, the lowest and highest levels of zzso zzso were observed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on the achieved results, zzso and zzso activity of zzso might be considered an important factor in the drought tolerance of barley zzso for further zzso
