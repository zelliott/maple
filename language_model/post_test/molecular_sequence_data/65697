Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that certain steroids, zzso de zzso in the brain, hence named zzso produce immediate changes zzso zzso in zzso zzso a time scale that zzso a zzso locus of zzso zzso molecular targets underlying zzso of brain zzso include both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Of particular interest is the interaction of certain zzso with the zzso zzso the major zzso zzso in zzso zzso During the last decade, compelling evidence has accrued to reveal that locally produced zzso may selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso A range of molecular mechanisms including the zzso composition of the zzso zzso and local steroid zzso zzso the zzso and zzso selectivity of action of zzso at synaptic and zzso zzso zzso The relative contribution played by each of these mechanisms in a variety of zzso and zzso scenarios is currently being zzso at a cellular and molecular zzso However, it is not known how such mechanisms may act in concert to influence zzso profiles in health and zzso An important question concerns the identification of the anatomical zzso zzso the repertoire of zzso produced by zzso zzso mice expressing zzso zzso zzso engineered to be insensitive to zzso or general zzso have proved invaluable in evaluating the role of zzso zzso zzso in complex zzso such as zzso zzso and anxiety zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso However, the development of a similar approach for zzso has been hampered by the limited knowledge that, until recently, has surrounded the identity of the zzso acid zzso contributing to the zzso binding zzso Here, we will review recent progress in identifying the zzso binding site on the zzso zzso and discuss how these discoveries will impact on our understanding of the role of zzso in health and zzso
