zzso zzso zzso produced by a clinical isolate of zzso zzso from chickens were detected with zzso zzso tests of the Clinical and Laboratory zzso Institute, and minimum zzso zzso of several zzso drugs against the isolate were determined by the twofold dilution zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolate were identified by zzso amplifying of zzso genes and DNA sequencing zzso The results revealed that the isolate was able to produce zzso They were resistant to third-generation zzso such as zzso and zzso and showed characteristics of zzso zzso The zzso gene from the zzso zzso isolate was of the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene had zzso and zzso identity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, at the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso from the zzso gene revealed three zzso compared with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso When it was compared with zzso zzso zzso there were only two zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso to zzso at position 51 in the zzso acid zzso The zzso type was a zzso zzso
