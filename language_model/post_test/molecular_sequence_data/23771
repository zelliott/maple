zzso zzso receptors have been the focus of intensive research particularly in mouse and zzso We report the cloning and characterization of three novel zzso chicken zzso receptors zzso that display a two zzso zzso structure, a zzso region lacking charged zzso and a zzso domain containing two zzso The zzso of all receptors to a small zzso region and the zzso pattern indicated that they belong to a zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso domain with two zzso zzso the signal zzso and single zzso for each zzso domain resembled that of all human zzso zzso receptors and killer cell zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso the C zzso displayed a structure closely resembling killer cell zzso zzso zzso A zzso generated against one zzso designated zzso reacted with all B cells and a small T cell zzso but not with zzso zzso or various zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso a zzso protein from zzso cells and zzso zzso The zzso zzso 2 domain containing protein zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso even in zzso cells, whereas zzso treatment induced the zzso zzso and recruitment of several zzso proteins including zzso and increased levels of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso reduced the proliferation of a stable zzso cell zzso Together, we have identified a zzso family containing multiple zzso including one zzso designated zzso that is mainly expressed on B zzso and zzso cellular proliferation by recruitment of zzso and zzso
