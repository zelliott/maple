zzso V gene expression was studied in a zzso of zzso B cells zzso zzso which was enriched by cell transfer and had earlier been shown to persist in the immune system over long periods of zzso Among 17 zzso derived from zzso B cells of two different mice, eight were progeny of only three different B cell precursors which apparently had expanded to clones of large size, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso of their zzso V zzso Furthermore, several zzso independent cells expressed zzso zzso V zzso These data define a novel zzso of B cell development in which cells expressing a selected set of zzso zzso are continuously zzso in the zzso A zzso B cell leukemia derived from a similar transfer experiment expressed a zzso gene that had been isolated in three independent zzso B cell zzso suggesting that the zzso cells had been equally selected in this zzso
