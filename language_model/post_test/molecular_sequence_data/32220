zzso pathogens in the zzso zzso and zzso cause acute infection in zzso zzso hosts and are major causes of zzso disease in animals and zzso zzso with zzso outer zzso zzso protection against acute zzso zzso infection and disease, and a zzso and zzso approach recently identified 21 proteins within the outer membrane zzso in addition to the zzso major surface proteins zzso to zzso Among the newly described proteins were the type IV zzso system zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso transfer protein zzso In other zzso bacteria, zzso proteins form channels, facilitate zzso of zzso and are required for zzso zzso However, zzso proteins have not been explored as vaccine zzso In this study we demonstrate that in zzso zzso outer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are recognized by serum zzso zzso zzso and stimulate memory zzso proliferation and gamma zzso zzso zzso induced the greatest proliferation in zzso zzso lines, and zzso zzso zzso clones responded to three zzso zzso zzso confirming the zzso zzso responses are directed against zzso in the native zzso The three zzso proteins are highly zzso with zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso T cells and by zzso from cattle zzso with the protective outer membrane fraction provides a rationale for including these proteins in development of vaccines against zzso zzso and related zzso
