zzso whose lack of expression causes the zzso fragile X syndrome, is a modular zzso binding protein thought to be involved in zzso zzso We have solved the structure in solution of the zzso domain of zzso zzso a functionally important region involved in multiple zzso The structure consists of a composite fold zzso two repeats of a Tudor motif followed by a short alpha zzso The interactions between the three structural elements are essential for the stability of the zzso zzso Although structurally similar, the two repeats have different dynamic and functional zzso The second, more flexible repeat is responsible for interacting both with zzso zzso and with zzso one of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso since zzso of its fold leads to altered zzso zzso of zzso We suggest that the zzso composite fold determines an zzso mechanism that regulates the zzso zzso
