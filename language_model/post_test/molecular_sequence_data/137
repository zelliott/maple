A gene zzso a zzso of zzso zzso was identified from the zzso zzso adult zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence including a signal zzso that has zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso group III zzso III zzso of other zzso It also has typical features of group III zzso including 10 zzso the key zzso of the zzso loop and zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso by this gene expressed in zzso coli showed a product of about zzso in zzso zzso of signal zzso and Western zzso analysis indicated the group III zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was an zzso product zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso protein was determined using zzso as zzso The result revealed that the protein was a zzso zzso Both zzso test and cell cycle analysis of zzso showed a higher percentage of cells are in proliferation zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated an zzso expression of collagen III in these cells after incubation with the zzso zzso We also identified that the zzso zzso could bind to some membrane proteins on zzso cells specifically by zzso thus there might be receptors of zzso on the zzso cell zzso Our results suggest that zzso might play an important role in the initiation and development of zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso
