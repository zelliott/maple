The zzso system is expansive and complex, characterized by swift zzso zzso dynamic zzso of membrane constituents, and zzso positioning zzso To properly navigate this zzso membrane zzso zzso protein zzso typically require specific sorting signals that are zzso by components of protein zzso The zzso sorting process within the zzso system is the rapid zzso of select zzso proteins within zzso zzso zzso signals consist of linear zzso zzso zzso or zzso modifications in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These signals are interpreted by a diverse set of zzso sorting proteins zzso that zzso from the zzso to the inner face of the plasma zzso Signal recognition by zzso is highly zzso involving additional interactions with zzso zzso zzso other zzso and zzso and is regulated by large zzso changes and zzso zzso Related sorting events occur at other zzso sorting zzso
