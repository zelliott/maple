The use of transgenic plants to express orally zzso protein zzso is an emerging strategy for vaccine zzso and zzso This concept has particular suitability for developing zzso One factor that has limited the development of this technology is the relatively modest levels of zzso of some zzso proteins in plant zzso We used fusion protein design to improve expression of the zzso B surface zzso zzso by attempting to mimic the process of zzso targeting to the zzso zzso of human liver cells during zzso B virus zzso We created a gene zzso a zzso zzso modified to contain a plant signal zzso fused to its zzso zzso The signal zzso from soybean zzso storage protein zzso zzso alpha zzso directed zzso zzso targeting of zzso in plant cells, but was not zzso and resulted in enhanced zzso alpha zzso fusion zzso This product was more stable and presented the protective zzso zzso zzso to significantly higher levels than unmodified native zzso expressed in plant zzso It also showed a greater extent of zzso zzso bond formation and formation of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso alpha zzso zzso higher levels of serum zzso than native zzso when injected into zzso We conclude that zzso zzso a zzso fusion at the zzso zzso and that zzso alpha zzso is an improved zzso for zzso expression of a zzso vaccine for zzso B zzso
