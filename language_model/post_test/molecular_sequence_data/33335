Members of the zzso zzso zzso family are important for the preservation of zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso within one zzso raise the question of functional zzso Whereas five different zzso are present in humans, the model plant zzso zzso zzso carries seven zzso zzso in its zzso We performed zzso analysis of zzso expanded upon a previous analysis of zzso and compared their zzso Both proteins differ in their domain zzso Our analysis demonstrates that they are 3' to zzso zzso with similar activities on partial duplex zzso However, they promote different outcomes with synthetic DNA structures that mimic Holliday junctions or a replication zzso zzso zzso Holliday junction branch migration and replication fork regression, while zzso cannot act on intact Holliday zzso The observed reaction of zzso on the replication fork is in line with unwinding the lagging zzso On zzso Holliday zzso which have not been zzso studied with zzso zzso before, zzso but not zzso shows a clear preference for one unwinding zzso In addition, zzso is much more efficient at catalyzing DNA strand zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are likely to perform different tasks in the cell, and zzso differs in its zzso properties from all other zzso zzso zzso characterized so zzso
