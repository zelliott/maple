The zzso world hypothesis zzso that zzso will be competent for varied essential cellular zzso One such indispensable cell function is regulation of membrane zzso Though this was not a known zzso activity, zzso yielded zzso that bound zzso zzso At least eight zzso approximately zzso sequences bind well to the outside of the zzso zzso though zzso sequences had no such zzso No distinct sequence motif for zzso binding was zzso However, zzso of one such zzso shows that a smaller, zzso irregular zzso hairpin is an active membrane binding zzso Bound zzso increases the zzso of zzso to zzso In addition, using zzso clamp technique, four individual zzso increase the zzso zzso of the plasma membrane of cultured human zzso The existence of multiple sequences that bind zzso and provoke zzso changes suggests that these may be elementary zzso functions that could be selected in zzso
