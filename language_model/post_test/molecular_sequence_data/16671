The structural maintenance of zzso zzso family of proteins play key roles in the organization, packaging, and repair of zzso zzso zzso holds zzso sister zzso together until zzso zzso zzso acts in zzso zzso and zzso performs currently enigmatic roles in DNA repair and zzso zzso The zzso zzso must associate with zzso zzso to perform their zzso Using both zzso and genetic methods, we have isolated a novel zzso of the zzso complex, zzso zzso is an essential nuclear protein that is required for normal zzso zzso segregation and cellular resistance to a number of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso suggests that like zzso zzso functions in the zzso zzso based repair of DNA zzso We previously identified two zzso zzso of zzso called zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrates that they are crucial for zzso The zzso zzso displays zzso DNA segregation and zzso zzso zzso zzso viability is reduced by zzso and zzso without affecting zzso zzso Finally, genetic interactions shared by the zzso zzso suggest that the zzso complex is important for replication fork zzso
