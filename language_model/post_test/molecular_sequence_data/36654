We have studied the zzso of a 17 zzso zzso triple zzso formed on a zzso of duplex DNA derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that an 80 zzso zzso has an altered zzso when the triple zzso is formed, which is most likely to result from an induced bend in the zzso Investigation of the detailed zzso of the double zzso zzso junctions has been performed by means of molecular zzso zzso on the zzso and 3' sides of the third strand zzso are not located at equivalent positions with respect to the zzso which is explained in terms of base zzso The junction effects on DNA structure, induced by the requirement for zzso zzso in the zzso strand to form zzso base zzso are also zzso
