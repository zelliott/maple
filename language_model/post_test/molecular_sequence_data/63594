zzso genes originate by a) loss of a stop zzso among zzso genes coded in different zzso b) shift to an upstream initiation zzso of one of the zzso zzso or c) by zzso zzso a novel open reading frame originates through point zzso inside an existing zzso Although overlapped genes are common in zzso it is not clear whether zzso has led to new genes in zzso 

Here we report the origin of a new gene through zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso gene coding for a positive regulator of the zzso 32 heat shock promoter arose by point zzso in a zzso phase within an open reading frame zzso of unknown function, most likely in the lineage leading to zzso coli and zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso sequences coding for zzso genes have a slower evolutionary rate than those lacking an overlapped zzso zzso 

While zzso has been shown to be rather frequent in the evolution of new genes in zzso our results suggest that this mechanism has also contributed to the origin of a novel gene in a zzso We propose the term zzso (from zzso the zzso Roman zzso to describe the zzso relationship that holds between two genes when one originated through zzso of the zzso One cannot dismiss the possibility that at least a small fraction of the large number of novel zzso genes detected in zzso and zzso studies arose by zzso
