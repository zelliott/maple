The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes the zzso for the DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced in response to 254 zzso radiation and a variety of chemical damaging zzso We report here the identification of promoter elements required for zzso zzso zzso is regulated primarily through three sequence elements clustered within a 120 zzso region immediately upstream of the zzso start zzso A 20 zzso interrupted zzso comprises zzso and is responsible for zzso of zzso and induced zzso zzso alone can activate zzso of a zzso minimal promoter but does not zzso damage zzso In the intact zzso promoter zzso function is dependent upon an upstream essential sequence zzso zzso contains a binding site for the zzso zzso zzso consistent with this role, deletion or specific zzso of the zzso increase zzso level expression and decrease the induction zzso zzso of zzso also eliminates the requirement for zzso for promoter zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso are similar to regulatory sequences found upstream of both damage responsive and zzso genes involved in DNA repair and zzso
