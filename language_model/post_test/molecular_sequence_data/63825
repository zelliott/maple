The complex processes of zzso are regulated by various zzso The aim of the current study is to determine the effect of zzso growth factor zzso on zzso proliferation and clarify the mechanism causing the proliferation in zzso zzso In the organ culture, zzso zzso zzso zzso but not their differentiation into zzso zzso cloning identified 3 members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso showed that all the receptors cloned were expressed in both zzso and germ cells at the zzso zzso In the organ cultures with zzso for the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso proliferation was zzso Furthermore, when the organ culture was exposed to zzso the expressions of stem cell factor zzso zzso domain containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These results suggested that, since the zzso are zzso within zzso by the zzso barrier consisted of zzso cells, zzso possibly mediates zzso proliferation in an zzso manner through the receptors including zzso zzso and zzso expressed on zzso cells via zzso of zzso cascade zzso zzso cascade by zzso the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso
