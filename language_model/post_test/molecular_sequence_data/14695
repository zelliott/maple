zzso evidence implicates zzso zzso against oxidized forms of low density zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, insufficient knowledge of their structure and function is a key zzso Using an elderly LDL zzso zzso zzso we isolated a novel zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso LDL, but minimally with native zzso Further analysis showed that zzso zzso also zzso in zzso with zzso LDL zzso a known key zzso in zzso LDL zzso By screening a zzso library expressing single chain variable region zzso zzso we selected an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso acid zzso between zzso and an irrelevant control zzso zzso showed that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all critical for zzso zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso on zzso involving both heavy and light zzso zzso of zzso acids in zzso zzso and zzso with zzso the major LDL zzso showed zzso zzso suggesting zzso has structural similarities to the zzso zzso binding site on zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso binds zzso in mouse and human zzso zzso The zzso zzso combination therefore provides a very promising model for analyzing the structure and function of an individual zzso zzso in relation to zzso
