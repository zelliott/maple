A method is developed for zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso as internal standard and its zzso is reported for 4 types of zzso It consists of reverse zzso of total zzso using zzso selective for zzso zzso and the message of zzso zzso the zzso reaction mix is diluted zzso and the dilution error is minimized by adding 10 zzso of zzso before the dilution and determining the level of zzso before and after the zzso zzso from the diluted zzso mix and the zzso reverse transcripts are zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso The samples are analyzed by zzso bands detected by zzso and in each lane the ratio is determined between zzso in the band of interest and zzso in the zzso zzso The ratio is a measure of the level of zzso in the sample and can be used to monitor changes in zzso during treatments, development and zzso
