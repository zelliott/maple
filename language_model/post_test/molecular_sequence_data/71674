zzso region 1 zzso of zzso C virus zzso is known to contain zzso zzso We previously found that zzso zzso against zzso captured a different zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso We investigated the zzso and zzso of zzso of animal zzso zzso responses in this zzso zzso zzso which were induced in mice and a zzso by zzso were found to be zzso to zzso zzso zzso responses against zzso and zzso peptides were detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso individuals, zzso Nine zzso sequences from six individuals, who were strongly positive for zzso zzso were only zzso identical to that of zzso All nine of these zzso peptides were zzso to zzso from the six patients and/or to zzso against zzso and zzso produced in mice and zzso zzso tests of zzso zzso indicated that a given species of zzso zzso was zzso to multiple zzso zzso Fine zzso mapping of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso in zzso sequences determined the observed zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a single zzso zzso
