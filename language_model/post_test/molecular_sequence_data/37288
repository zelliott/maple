zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a class 3 G zzso zzso and an important zzso of synaptic activity in the central nervous zzso Previous work demonstrated that zzso couples to zzso toxin zzso G zzso However, the specificity of zzso zzso to individual members of the zzso family is not zzso Using zzso expressed zzso in rat sympathetic zzso from the superior cervical zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso profile was characterized by zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso By employing this method, it was demonstrated that zzso coupled strongly with zzso zzso zzso and zzso although zzso to zzso was less zzso In addition, zzso did not seem to couple to the most divergent member of the zzso family, zzso although zzso coupled strongly to the zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine which zzso proteins may be zzso expressed in zzso zzso the presence of zzso for various zzso proteins was tested using reverse zzso chain zzso Strong bands were detected for all members of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as for zzso and zzso A weak signal was detected for zzso and no zzso zzso was zzso
