zzso column plays an important role in zzso liquid zzso coupled with tandem mass zzso for dealing with the high dynamic range and complexity of protein samples in shotgun zzso zzso In this study, the integrated monolithic zzso into the particulate zzso zzso column was zzso By comparing the prepared zzso column with conventionally zzso zzso column, smaller size of packing materials could be easily packed into the zzso to achieve higher average peak capacity and zzso zzso As the monolithic zzso was integrated onto this type of column, the void volume between packing particles and zzso zzso was eliminated and the zzso quality was zzso The prepared zzso column was applied to zzso analysis of mouse liver zzso and it was observed that the number of identified proteins and peptides increased zzso and zzso as well as the peak capacity increased zzso by using zzso column over conventionally zzso zzso zzso
