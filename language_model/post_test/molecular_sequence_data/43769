Although zzso zzso accumulates early during zzso a differentiation control element in its 3' untranslated region zzso zzso zzso until late stage zzso We have zzso two proteins from rabbit zzso that specifically mediate zzso zzso and identified them as zzso K and zzso zzso of zzso K and zzso E1 into zzso cells specifically silenced the translation of reporter zzso bearing a differentiation control element in their 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso zzso in rabbit zzso specifically zzso with zzso zzso In a zzso zzso translation system, addition of zzso zzso K and zzso E1 zzso this regulation via a specific zzso of zzso zzso assembly on zzso zzso Both proteins can control zzso and internal zzso entry zzso translation by binding to differentiation control zzso Our data suggest a specific zzso function for zzso as zzso regulatory zzso
