In zzso the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso functions to couple a variety of zzso membrane receptors to zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha results in the stimulation of zzso zzso and an increase in the second zzso zzso A zzso zzso has been identified and characterized from zzso that codes for a protein zzso identical to bovine zzso zzso The similarity is most striking in the regions thought to be responsible for the interactions with receptors and zzso suggesting that the basic components of this zzso zzso have been zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequence analysis suggest that a single transcript, expressed predominantly in the head, is present in zzso In zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso alpha transcript is localized primarily in the cells of the central nervous system and in the zzso
