The zzso zzso transport protein zzso has been investigated by replacing 22 consecutive zzso within zzso domain IV, one at a time, with zzso A zzso zzso retaining zzso functional properties served as the starting zzso The single zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso coli, isolated, and functionally zzso in a zzso zzso The accessibility of each single zzso zzso to three zzso zzso was evaluated by determining the zzso first order rate zzso for zzso of zzso zzso These rate zzso varied by seven orders of zzso With three independent data sets we observed zzso and zzso in the rate constant data at identical zzso acid positions and a zzso of four was observed from zzso zzso Based on the pattern of accessibility we conclude that zzso zzso exist as an zzso Furthermore, a zzso face of the zzso has been defined consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso face has been delineated consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We zzso that the zzso face comprises a portion of the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso whereas the zzso surface faces the zzso zzso
