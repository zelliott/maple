The gene zzso protein zero zzso the most abundant protein of peripheral nervous system zzso is expressed uniquely in zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that much of the cell type specificity of this expression is due to zzso control elements in the zzso pair zzso region of the zzso We have now analyzed this region and have identified a set of functional elements in the 500 base pairs zzso to the zzso start zzso DNA sequence conservation within the zzso regions of the human, zzso and rat zzso genes zzso closely with the results of promoter deletion analysis of the zzso pair region zzso in zzso cell cultures and reveals a potent zzso region from position zzso to zzso Sites of zzso interaction within the zzso 500 base pairs of the promoter were identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso elements were identified within the protected regions in the zzso promoter by zzso and transient zzso analysis in zzso cell zzso The core (or zzso zzso promoter is identified as two regulatory zzso a zzso element that binds nuclear factor zzso and a zzso box that binds zzso These core elements are essential for the zzso observed from the zzso promoter in cultured zzso zzso
