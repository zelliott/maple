zzso zzso zzso have shown promise as an alternative technology to DNA zzso for DNA detection and zzso zzso zzso the effect of DNA sequences on the melting temperature of the system is central to developing reliable detection zzso We studied the effects of DNA zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso on the melting temperature of zzso zzso We found that, contrary to the general assumption that defects lower the melting temperature of DNA, some defects increase the melting temperature of zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso and deletions were found to depend on the specific base pair, the zzso and the location of the zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso DNA exhibit zzso behavior different from that of free zzso Such findings indicate that a detailed understanding of zzso assembly phase behavior is required for quantitative interpretation of zzso zzso
