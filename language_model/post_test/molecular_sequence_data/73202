In plants, zzso is largely determined by the orientation and extent of cell zzso To define the molecular mechanisms regulating plant cell enlargement, we have conducted a molecular genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso affecting the zzso gene were found to alter cell size, but not cell number, in zzso throughout the zzso zzso and zzso analyses suggest that the zzso gene is not required for proper cell type zzso and it is likely to act downstream of the hormones zzso and zzso The zzso gene was cloned by a zzso tagging method and confirmed by the molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and by the analyses of six zzso zzso zzso zzso with the global effects of the zzso zzso the zzso gene is expressed in all major plant zzso The deduced zzso product is a novel zzso zzso with putative zzso motifs near the zzso zzso zzso genes were identified from a zzso zzso zzso a fungus zzso zzso and another plant species zzso zzso with the sequence identity including the putative zzso zzso These results imply that the zzso protein is a member of a new class of zzso proteins that is widespread in zzso and required for regulated cell zzso
