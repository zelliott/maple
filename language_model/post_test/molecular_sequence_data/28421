A zzso library was prepared from zzso isolated from anterior zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso levels were predicted to be very zzso Nine zzso representing abundant zzso species, were identified and shown to contain zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso and 580 zzso were zzso by DNA zzso The shorter clone was found to be a truncated zzso product but otherwise identical to the longer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame capable of zzso a zzso of 229 zzso zzso This putative zzso has a high degree of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting that zzso encodes chicken zzso The protein was predicted to have a 30 zzso acid signal sequence which would be zzso off to give a mature protein of 199 zzso zzso The zzso sequence also had a zzso zzso to chicken growth hormone, which is related to zzso This similarity confirms the conclusion that zzso is a chicken zzso zzso zzso An abundant zzso of approximately 880 b was detected in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso with zzso Analysis of chicken zzso DNA showed that there is one copy of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso strongly to zzso DNA from closely related zzso zzso and zzso and less strongly to DNA from more zzso related species zzso and ring zzso
