The level of zzso resistance in clinical zzso of zzso zzso depends not only on the reduced affinity of zzso binding proteins zzso but also on the functioning of zzso that modify the stem zzso structure of cell wall zzso We used zzso zzso in search of additional genetic zzso that may further zzso the level of zzso resistance in the zzso A zzso zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso strain zzso showed reduction of the zzso minimum zzso concentration zzso from 6 to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was also observed upon introduction of the zzso (named zzso zzso for zzso of drug zzso into representatives of major epidemic clones of zzso zzso zzso of resistance levels was specific for zzso The zzso zzso has retained unchanged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and unchanged cell wall stem zzso zzso but the zzso became hypersensitive to zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that both zzso resistance and zzso zzso linked to the defective zzso zzso DNA sequence comparison and chemical analysis of the cell wall identified zzso as the structural gene of the zzso zzso zzso
