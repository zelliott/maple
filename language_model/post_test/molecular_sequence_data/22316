The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of a family B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the accessory protein zzso activity zzso protein zzso It couples to zzso but it is not known which zzso zzso mediate zzso We have identified the boundaries of this loop based on the relative position and length of the zzso zzso regions 3 and zzso The loop has been analyzed by systematic zzso of all zzso to zzso measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso of the zzso zzso plays a part in the zzso switch after zzso zzso zzso and zzso were essential for a functional zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso is due to a disruption to the cell surface transport or surface stability of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso had zzso expression and zzso zzso suggesting a direct disruption to the downstream signal zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso Modeling suggests that the loop zzso a significant shift in position during zzso zzso exposing a potential zzso binding zzso zzso changes position to point into the pocket, potentially allowing it to interact with bound zzso zzso occupies a position similar to that of zzso in bovine zzso part of the zzso motif of the latter zzso This is the first comprehensive analysis of an entire zzso loop within the zzso family of zzso zzso These data help to define the structural and functional characteristics of the zzso and of family B zzso receptors in zzso
