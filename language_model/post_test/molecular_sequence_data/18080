zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA indicates that zzso zzso carrier protein zzso is zzso by a zzso family of some 35 zzso zzso Two zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso The coding sequences of the 2 respective genes were found to be perfectly zzso to 2 distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and therefore represent zzso forms of zzso The 2 zzso zzso sequences share zzso zzso within their coding zzso Both genes are interrupted by 3 intervening sequences whose position within the 2 coding sequences is zzso zzso protection studies were used to map the zzso start site of one of the genes and to provide further evidence that the gene is zzso The expression of a zzso of the zzso gene family was found to be zzso regulated in concert with the storage zzso synthetic phase of seed zzso The coding sequence of both zzso zzso genes are highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they may have evolved from this ancestral zzso
