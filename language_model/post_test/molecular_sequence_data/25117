zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso in soybean zzso zzso cell suspension cultures zzso zzso & zzso (1989) Plant zzso 90, zzso This zzso zzso has been zzso from cells grown for 72 h in the presence of either 100 zzso or 500 zzso zzso It has a molecular mass of about 600 zzso and is built up from a 28 zzso zzso which is recognized by zzso raised against pea zzso zzso seed zzso and it has the same zzso sequence as this latter, except for zzso number 3, which is zzso in pea seed zzso instead of zzso in zzso soybean cell zzso It contains an average of zzso atoms of iron per zzso whatever the zzso zzso concentration used to induce its zzso It is shown that the presence of 100 zzso or 500 zzso zzso in the culture medium leads respectively to an zzso and zzso increase in the total zzso iron concentration and to a zzso and zzso increase in the zzso zzso However, the percentage of iron stored in the mineral core of zzso remains constant whatever the zzso zzso concentration used and represents only zzso of cellular zzso
