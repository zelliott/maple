zzso DNA zzso clones containing the entire coding region of human zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso libraries prepared from the zzso spinal zzso In the human zzso the zzso zzso assigned to the putative initiation zzso for zzso rat and mouse zzso zzso was replaced by zzso The human zzso contained an zzso zzso zzso 324 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso should code for a zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso This deduced molecular weight was larger than that of zzso protein zzso from the human brain and zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso containing the entire coding region was zzso to an expression zzso and introduced into African green monkey kidney zzso cells and Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso The cells expressed high zzso activity and produced two protein bands zzso with an zzso to monkey zzso The molecular weight of the proteins was estimated to be approximately 70 and 80 zzso by zzso gel zzso When partial zzso that lacked the first zzso but contained the replaced zzso zzso were introduced into zzso cells, the cells expressed moderate zzso activity and an zzso protein band of 70 zzso These results indicate that translation of human zzso zzso starts at two sites and produces two zzso proteins with different molecular zzso It might be that the larger form of zzso zzso is an zzso precursor for processing or that the zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso of the zzso
