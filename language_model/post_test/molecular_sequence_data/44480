zzso coli zzso zzso zzso were zzso to induce zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and subjected to gel zzso under zzso conditions, to separate molecules on the basis of the zzso loop zzso zzso separated this way were enriched for specific zzso and could be analyzed by the reverse zzso arrest zzso to determine exact zzso zzso Thirteen zzso sites have been identified at single zzso zzso Of these, eight are within or adjacent to secondary structure zzso one of these zzso zzso zzso involves an interaction between zzso within an interior loop, one zzso zzso zzso involves an interaction between zzso in adjacent base pairs, and the others involve interactions between zzso that are within junction regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or are interactions between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that somehow cross known base zzso Five other zzso connect sites distant in the secondary structure and provide global constraints for the arrangement of zzso regions within zzso zzso I and II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and within domain III zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso known at zzso resolution, are useful in the prediction of local zzso regions, as well as the global zzso
