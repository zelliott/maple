zzso tuberculosis zzso several proteins into the zzso environment, some of which are restricted to the zzso tuberculosis zzso One of these zzso is zzso Recently, the authors showed that native as well as zzso zzso is able to distinguish between an zzso tuberculosis infection and a zzso Danish zzso zzso zzso distinction between zzso zzso protein zzso zzso sensitivity zzso by an zzso tuberculosis infection and that induced by a zzso vaccination or infection with environmental zzso would be useful in the control of zzso In this study, the authors report the mapping and characterization of a zzso zzso by the use of synthetic peptides in zzso vaccinated with zzso Danish zzso or zzso Studies with overlapping synthetic peptides have zzso the biological activity to a single zzso zzso at the zzso region of zzso consisting of 15 zzso between zzso acids zzso and zzso the core zzso zzso A fine mapping using truncated versions of zzso indicates the zzso is restricted to 13 zzso between zzso acids zzso to zzso However, the optimal zzso zzso is obtained by zzso Different modifications of zzso revealed that a zzso tree construction improves the skin zzso to a maximum level approaching that of the zzso to zzso zzso
