Previous reports from our laboratories showed that type IV collagen from anterior lens capsule zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso This property was shown to reside in the region zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain zzso of the alpha zzso zzso We also reported that zzso IV collagen or the synthetic alpha zzso zzso zzso induced a rise in zzso zzso which persisted for up to 60 zzso In the present work we extend our previous studies on signal zzso by alpha zzso zzso and we provide new data showing the involvement of zzso zzso and protein zzso The data also show that the alpha zzso zzso triggered a rise in zzso calcium that was dependent on zzso C zzso zzso of the zzso system suppressed both the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso increase and the zzso activity of the zzso on zzso triggered zzso zzso When alpha zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso was blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso C zzso or by zzso a zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effect of the zzso on zzso zzso production was also zzso These findings provide evidence that signal zzso by the alpha zzso zzso occurs via pathways which involve zzso Indeed, the zzso increase was shown to be zzso by zzso and zzso zzso receptors and required calcium zzso since zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso related zzso zzso suppressed the activity of the alpha zzso zzso The zzso effect of the zzso on zzso zzso generation was slightly affected by 1 zzso zzso or zzso two zzso of zzso zzso but was completely suppressed by 10 zzso zzso A or 10 zzso zzso acid, two zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso protein zzso and/or zzso zzso are involved in signal zzso by the alpha zzso zzso zzso and is consistent with the concept that zzso zzso occupancy zzso zzso zzso
