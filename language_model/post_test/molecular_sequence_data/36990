In this study, zzso repression in zzso zzso was zzso under defined zzso conditions, at both the molecular and zzso levels, by pulsing zzso to a zzso continuous zzso During this pulse of zzso the zzso feed was kept zzso Directly after the zzso pulse, carbon dioxide production increased while oxygen consumption remained constant, demonstrating that the surplus of zzso had been consumed by means of zzso The direct zzso of zzso in the medium after the zzso pulse indicated that the consumption of zzso had been stopped zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso zzso was still present but apparently was incapable of zzso zzso which could be due to zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso The total concentration of zzso increased from 5 zzso zzso at zzso zzso 0 to 25 zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso After 2 zzso the concentration of zzso gradually decreased again to the normal zzso Within 2 zzso after the addition of zzso the zzso of the zzso genes and zzso was zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, was also zzso which demonstrates that the zzso gene is regulated at the zzso level comparable with zzso
