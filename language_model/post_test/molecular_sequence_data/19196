zzso genes are the integration sites of zzso zzso into their hosts zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso The crossover between zzso and host zzso leaves zzso zzso motif as zzso marker of integration on zzso This zzso zzso motif on host zzso is our zzso zzso zzso To track integration in zzso host zzso and zzso features in zzso zzso motifs and in zzso were zzso The zzso has a zzso zzso long zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the viral zzso motif has a zzso zzso region and a hairpin secondary zzso zzso to a host zzso we observe up to two zzso on zzso zzso The length of the zzso is not zzso The fraction of zzso excised off in zzso is either zzso or 50, or zzso or zzso Thus, the integration fragments the zzso zzso dividing it approximately in ratios zzso or zzso or zzso or zzso More than zzso of zzso have lengths that are excised zzso off zzso It turns out that zzso zzso implies that the ratio of the length of zzso to its zzso is just zzso the golden zzso zzso the vast majority of zzso are at or near the golden zzso Evidence emerges of new zzso viral zzso
