zzso electron transfer zzso zzso are zzso containing a single equivalent of zzso zzso zzso zzso They function as electron zzso between primary zzso zzso involved in zzso fatty acid and zzso acid zzso and the zzso electron transfer zzso zzso zzso The structure of human zzso solved to zzso resolution reveals that the zzso zzso is comprised of three distinct zzso two zzso are contributed by the alpha zzso and the third domain is made up entirely by the beta zzso The zzso portion of the alpha zzso and the majority of the beta zzso have identical zzso zzso in the absence of any sequence zzso zzso lies in a zzso between the two zzso with most of the zzso zzso residing in the zzso portion of the alpha zzso zzso of all the known sequences for the zzso alpha zzso together with the putative zzso gene product shows that the zzso directly involved in zzso binding are zzso A hydrogen bond is formed between the zzso of the zzso zzso ring and the zzso side chain of alpha zzso suggesting why the zzso zzso alpha zzso affects zzso activity in patients with zzso zzso type zzso zzso bonds between the zzso of the zzso chain of zzso and zzso of the zzso ring, and between alpha zzso and the zzso oxygen of the zzso ring, may play a role in the stabilization of the zzso zzso With the known structure of medium chain zzso zzso we zzso a possible structure for zzso the two zzso
