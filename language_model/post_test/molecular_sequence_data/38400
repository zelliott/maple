We have identified a 35 zzso acid zzso toxin of the inhibitor zzso knot family that blocks zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and has zzso zzso to other zzso zzso It was isolated by zzso whole zzso using reverse phase zzso and then zzso zzso on zzso channels zzso in zzso patches from adult rat zzso Although the channel gating zzso were different between zzso and zzso patches, the properties associated with the channel zzso such as selectivity for zzso zzso zzso ( approximately 45 zzso at zzso zzso and a mild zzso were unaffected by zzso zzso zzso produced a complete block of zzso in zzso patches and appeared specific since it had no effect on zzso zzso zzso The equilibrium zzso constant of approximately 630 zzso was calculated from the ratio of association and zzso rate zzso In zzso swollen zzso zzso produces approximately zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in isolated zzso cells from a rabbit zzso zzso model, zzso produced a near complete block of the zzso zzso zzso but did not affect the zzso zzso In the zzso heart cells, where the zzso current is zzso active, zzso also reduced the cell zzso This is the first report of a zzso toxin that specifically blocks zzso zzso The toxin affect on zzso zzso currents implicates zzso in volume zzso
