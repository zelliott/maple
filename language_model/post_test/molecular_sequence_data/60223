zzso based on the zzso ring structure are widely used in zzso of food zzso zzso of the zzso ring is an important step in the zzso of zzso compounds and hence in their complete removal from the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which yields carbon dioxide and zzso the zzso is subject to further zzso which yields zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso acid zzso was cloned into zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso a strain that is capable of utilizing zzso as nitrogen zzso zzso of zzso acid was detected in crude extracts of zzso coli containing the cloned gene by monitoring the disappearance of zzso acid and the appearance of zzso by zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso were used to purify zzso acid zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso had an apparent zzso of zzso zzso for zzso acid at pH zzso The zzso did not cleave any other zzso or zzso compound, although zzso acid zzso zzso was found to be a strong competitive zzso Neither the zzso sequence of zzso nor the zzso acid sequence of the gene product exhibited a significant level of similarity to any known gene or zzso
