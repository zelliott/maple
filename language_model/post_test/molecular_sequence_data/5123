A set of zzso peptides of the form zzso has been designed to evaluate the propensity of different zzso triplets for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kirkpatrick, zzso Shah, zzso and Brodsky, zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso All zzso guest triplets led to a decrease in melting temperature from the host zzso zzso except for zzso In this zzso environment, zzso was found to be as stabilizing as zzso zzso stability of zzso peptides containing zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso indicated a stabilization that is optimal for zzso and specific to the zzso zzso was found to have a similar stabilizing effect when zzso other than Pro are in the zzso Both zzso and zzso stabilize the zzso zzso in the zzso in a zzso manner and occupy largely zzso in zzso However, zzso zzso units are highly stable and promote zzso zzso whereas incorporation of multiple zzso triplets was zzso and folded slowly due to charge zzso In zzso zzso may contribute zzso to local zzso stability while also having the potential for zzso interactions in zzso formation and zzso
