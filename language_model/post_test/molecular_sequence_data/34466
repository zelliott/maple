Members of the flowering plant family zzso harbor the largest known zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso zzso of cucumber zzso zzso We help solve a 30-year mystery about the origins of its large size by showing that it mainly reflects the proliferation of dispersed repeats, expansions of existing zzso and the acquisition of sequences from diverse sources, including the cucumber nuclear and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cucumber zzso has a novel structure for plant zzso mapping as three entirely or largely autonomous circular zzso zzso zzso 84, and 45 zzso that vary in relative abundance over a twofold zzso These properties suggest that the three zzso replicate independently of one zzso The two smaller zzso are devoid of known functional genes but nonetheless contain diagnostic zzso zzso zzso sequencing conflicts reveal differences in zzso dynamics among zzso for which an explanatory model is developed, as well as a large pool of zzso zzso zzso many of which may result from zzso zzso across zzso and sometimes highly divergent zzso These findings highlight the promise of zzso sequencing for zzso the zzso dynamics of plant zzso zzso
