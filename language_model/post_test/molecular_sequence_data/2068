We have isolated the zzso zzso a novel human zzso factor, zzso by weak zzso to the mouse zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis and the identification of the corresponding gene indicate that human zzso is a member of a small gene family which also contains the human zzso to zzso Although structurally related to the mouse factor, the human zzso constitutes a different protein which nevertheless is capable of inducing the zzso zzso in embryonic zzso mouse zzso zzso The existence of more than one zzso protein in human skeletal muscle is further suggested by the detection of several similar but distinct zzso zzso The zzso conversion of zzso cells by the human factor is recognized by the capacity of the cells to form zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso heavy zzso Moreover, transient expression of zzso in zzso cells leads to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso reporter gene which by itself is zzso silent in the zzso cell zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of clone zzso reveals a region which is highly similar to zzso proteins and the zzso factors from zzso zzso by the zzso zzso locus and the twist zzso The zzso zzso region and a preceding cluster of basic zzso acids are located in a larger sequence domain with strong similarity to the mouse zzso factor zzso Two additional short segments with high zzso and zzso content are zzso between the two zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
