zzso of proteins recovered from two-dimensional zzso gels is being used systematically to identify proteins in the master human zzso zzso gel zzso To date, about 250 protein spots recorded in human zzso gel databases have been zzso and, of these, 145 are recorded in the zzso database under the entry partial zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso protein spots cut from several (up to 40) dry gels were concentrated by zzso gel zzso zzso onto zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso zzso peptides were separated by zzso zzso collected individually and zzso Computer search using the zzso and zzso programs from zzso Computer Group indicated that 110 of the zzso zzso shared significant similarity with proteins contained in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Only 35 zzso corresponded to zzso unknown zzso zzso sequences of all 145 proteins are listed together with their coordinates zzso molecular weight and zzso in the zzso zzso
