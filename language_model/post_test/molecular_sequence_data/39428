We used zzso analysis to study the evolutionary dynamics of 27 disease resistance zzso genes by zzso the zzso repeat zzso region in 96 zzso zzso zzso We compared single zzso zzso zzso in these R genes to an empirical distribution of zzso in the same sample based on 876 fragments selected to sample the entire zzso zzso regions are highly zzso for protein zzso but not for synonymous changes, suggesting that they generate many zzso maintained for short time zzso zzso is also relatively common and important for generating protein zzso Although none of the genes is nearly as zzso as zzso a locus previously shown to have strong signatures of balancing selection, seven genes show weaker indications of balancing zzso Five R genes are relatively zzso indicating young zzso but all contain segregating protein zzso zzso analysis in neighboring fragments yielded zzso evidence for recent selective sweeps at these zzso In addition, few zzso are candidates for rapid increases in frequency expected under directional zzso zzso sharing analysis revealed significant zzso of R gene zzso with extended zzso compared with zzso random zzso zzso Lack of convincing evidence for directional selection or selective sweeps argues against an arms race driving R gene zzso Instead, the data support transient or zzso selection maintaining protein zzso at a locus for variable time zzso
