The roles of 11 zzso zzso acids of the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso were examined by performing kinetic and zzso analyses of zzso zzso This zzso information along with the zzso crystal structure of rat zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved with binding and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our data confirm structural evidence that zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso are zzso for the essential zzso zzso and suggest that zzso may also play a role in zzso zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that zzso is important for binding the essential zzso zzso of the protein zzso
