The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of an industrially used zzso zzso strain has been detected by zzso acid zzso zzso characterized and zzso One zzso of zzso zzso with coding capacity for a zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso The zzso was preceded by a typical zzso promoter zzso An zzso repeat structure with delta G of zzso zzso zzso was found downstream of the coding zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed a zzso zzso transcript and one zzso start site was identified via primer extension analysis using an zzso zzso In a zzso study, the expression of zzso in zzso zzso was studied as a function of zzso zzso of zzso was typical of exponential growth phase zzso The zzso gene has been cloned into zzso and expressed at a high level in zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso activity was observed at pH zzso and 45 degrees zzso According to gel zzso analysis, zzso is a zzso of 165 zzso The zzso was zzso by heavy metal zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso did not decrease zzso activity zzso It was completely inhibited by zzso and zzso by adding zzso and strongly inhibited by zzso zzso is thus a zzso zzso zzso having functional zzso groups at or near the active zzso
