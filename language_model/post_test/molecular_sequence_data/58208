The zzso region of the envelope zzso zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 zzso has a zzso zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso zzso which consists of a zzso repeat of zzso or zzso zzso has been suggested to play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was tested by replacing the highly zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso motif with a strong zzso zzso zzso We report here that such zzso did not abolish the ability of zzso protein to form zzso indicating that this highly zzso zzso motif does not have a crucial role in zzso protein zzso However, the zzso viruses all showed impaired zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso motif can have an important role in the virus life zzso
