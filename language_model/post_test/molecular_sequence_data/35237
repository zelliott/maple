In mice, zzso zzso cells are mainly located in the zzso zzso zzso cells are well known for their role in the early stages of zzso immune responses against zzso invasion as well as for the production of natural zzso zzso Although such B cells have been claimed to give rise to zzso plasma cells producing zzso a clear role of zzso cells in zzso production in the zzso zzso is still not zzso Here, we employed the transgenic zzso mouse model characterized by the lack of B-2 cells and presence of zzso cells as major zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso repertoire in this mouse allowed us to take typical zzso cell zzso sequences as indicators of the presence of zzso zzso cells in zzso patches as well as in zzso zzso However, amongst the zzso sequences recovered from the same zzso none of the sequences showed zzso zzso Interestingly, all zzso sequences derived from the zzso zzso of zzso mice displayed extensive numbers of zzso exchanges, indicating zzso zzso and affinity zzso This suggests that the contribution of natural zzso zzso by zzso cells to zzso immunity is zzso
