zzso colored snow, containing zzso brown zzso has been observed in several zzso in zzso In order to characterize this remarkable phenomenon, the microbial community and chemical species in snow were zzso A core sample of snow which had a colored region was investigated and it revealed vertical shifts in zzso characteristics and the microbial community zzso The abundance of particles peaked within the colored layer, and correlated with the amount of zzso zzso The zzso water of the colored layer was enriched with zzso and characterized by reduced concentration of dissolved zzso The bacterial community in the colored region was characterized by higher relative abundance of zzso bacteria and zzso zzso of the brown particles were found as zzso in snow melt pools, and were subjected to cloning analyses targeting several different zzso The majority of bacterial zzso zzso gene clones belonged to the class zzso or the zzso zzso No snow algae were detected in the zzso small zzso zzso gene clone zzso As a possible carbon source to sustain the community in the snow, zzso of carbon dioxide and methane were investigated by analyzing the genes involved in their zzso In the analyses of genes for zzso zzso clones related to sulfur zzso were zzso The analysis of particulate methane zzso genes indicated dominance of zzso zzso These results emphasized the uniqueness of this phenomenon, and iron zzso of the zzso zzso are suggested to be the key organisms that could be investigated in order to understand the mechanism of this zzso
