Chlorella virus zzso zzso zzso is the smallest member of a family of zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The primary structure of zzso is more similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso than it is to the zzso zzso of other DNA zzso To evaluate the higher order structural similarities between zzso and the zzso zzso we performed an zzso scan of individual zzso of zzso that were predicted, on the basis of the crystal structure of zzso to be located at or near the active zzso Twelve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were deemed essential for zzso by zzso zzso as their replacement by zzso reduced zzso activity to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso relationships were zzso by introducing conservative zzso at the essential zzso The zzso results suggest that the active site of zzso is likely to adopt a tunnel fold like that of zzso and that a similar constellation of side chains within the tunnel is responsible for metal binding and reaction zzso Nonetheless, there are several zzso zzso effects in zzso versus zzso which suggest that different members of the zzso family vary in their reliance on certain zzso within the active site zzso We found that zzso and zzso were potent competitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), whereas zzso had little zzso zzso displayed a weak intrinsic zzso activity zzso of its zzso zzso but was unable to zzso zzso
