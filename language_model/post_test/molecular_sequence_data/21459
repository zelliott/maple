zzso zzso is a marine zzso capable of using a wide variety of different zzso schemes and in particular is an zzso zzso zzso zzso In the work reported here we use a deletion zzso that we have constructed to investigate the structural origin of the unusual zzso zzso complex zzso in this zzso We suggest that the structure is essentially zzso when compared to the usual zzso complexes but that a change in the environment of the zzso zzso group is responsible for the change in zzso We tentatively relate this change to the presence of a zzso zzso in the zzso Surprisingly, the low spectral overlap between the peripheral and core zzso systems appears not to compromise energy collection efficiency too zzso We suggest that this may be at the expense of maintaining a low antenna zzso
