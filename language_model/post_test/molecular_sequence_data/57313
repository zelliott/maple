In an attempt to induce an immune response against zzso zzso by zzso zzso mouse zzso with zzso B cells from zzso mouse zzso we generated a panel of zzso zzso from which the zzso zzso taken as a representative zzso was thoroughly zzso This zzso specifically zzso with B cells from all mouse strains studied including zzso mice as shown by zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso techniques, zzso zzso was found to be specific for zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of a zzso derived from a zzso zzso from zzso B cells showed a zzso zzso with a sequence within zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was able to interact with the cell surface of zzso cell line, known as a typical zzso cell zzso The presence of zzso can be modulated on the surface of zzso cells since this zzso was zzso after exposure of these cells to a cocktail of zzso and zzso Finally, zzso zzso was shown to interact with freshly isolated B cells from human peripheral zzso
