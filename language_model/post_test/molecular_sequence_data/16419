zzso are a group of zzso zzso clustered together on a small region of zzso zzso Recent reports suggest that zzso are zzso expressed in zzso and have potential as cancer zzso The human zzso gene locus has now been fully characterized and 15 functional zzso were zzso Although many zzso zzso have already been characterized in zzso none have been identified in zzso 

In the current study, we identified the first human zzso zzso named zzso and mapped it between the zzso and zzso zzso This zzso shares a moderate degree of similarity with the adjacent functional zzso It has a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its surrounding zzso but lacks the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of some zzso zzso are also zzso in the zzso This zzso lacks zzso sequences and should thus be classified as a processed zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicate that this zzso may be zzso active, because zzso was detected in many zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and adrenal zzso as well as in zzso of the female zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence of the gene is, however, defective and is not predicted to code for a zzso zzso zzso sequences were found in the zzso region of the zzso thus supporting the view that it evolved by zzso We also identified another zzso zzso zzso that has only the zzso zzso zzso The functional significance of the zzso and the other zzso is yet to be zzso
