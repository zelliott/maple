The genetic zzso of 52 zzso zzso zzso collected from various environmental and clinical sources, including zzso zzso zzso patients, as well as the presence and the expression of some zzso genes were zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis identified 47 profiles and three clusters of zzso with an identical zzso pattern considered to be indistinguishable zzso zzso zzso length zzso of the zzso gene grouped the 52 strains into nine different zzso Most zzso clinical zzso (29 out of zzso showed profile 1, while the analysis of the zzso regions of the zzso zzso gene revealed five distinct zzso variations, with the majority of zzso zzso zzso out of zzso belonging to sequence group zzso Furthermore, the strains were characterized for zzso and expression of zzso zzso including genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso All zzso zzso strains exhibited a very broad range of swimming and twitching zzso while none showed swarming zzso A complete zzso gene was zzso only from clinically derived zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of representative zzso zzso strains impaired in the expression of zzso and zzso activities was evaluated by infecting larvae of the wax zzso zzso zzso The results obtained strongly indicate that the major zzso zzso zzso may be a relevant zzso factor of zzso zzso
