As a first step towards the development of a sensitive zzso protection zzso to study the regulation of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells of zzso we have isolated a complementary DNA zzso clone zzso precursor sequence of zzso from a zzso library prepared from goldfish zzso zzso zzso The zzso goldfish zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso with two possible start zzso of zzso zzso acid sequence alignment revealed that zzso has the characteristics of four zzso zzso zzso B, C and zzso common to all zzso with the domain B being the most zzso region among all the characterized zzso Similar to other zzso zzso this zzso is similarly related but clearly distinct from growth hormone and zzso of goldfish and other zzso However, unlike most other known zzso zzso which have more than zzso zzso acid sequence identity to each other, the overall zzso acid sequence identity of this novel zzso with other previously characterized zzso ranges from only zzso to zzso Moreover, this zzso contains only six zzso zzso rather than seven in most other zzso in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a single zzso zzso transcript of approximately 1 zzso in the zzso of both sexually zzso and maturing male and female zzso
