DNA zzso II zzso zzso is an essential nuclear zzso which zzso the zzso of various forms of zzso As predicted from the human zzso II zzso the zzso contains a potential zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We therefore tested whether zzso II could enter zzso interactions with other better characterized zzso zzso proteins and determined if these interactions could modify zzso II zzso activity in zzso By far Western zzso a large zzso zzso of human zzso II was shown to interact with the DNA binding and zzso regions of either zzso response element binding protein zzso or the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso II zzso also zzso with full-length zzso but not with full-length zzso Using zzso as a prototype, the effect of this interaction on various zzso II zzso activities was assessed in zzso zzso at a zzso to zzso zzso excess relative to zzso II, inhibited zzso DNA zzso activity on a zzso pair zzso of the human zzso hormone zzso gene zzso Very high zzso zzso zzso zzso apparently inhibited zzso II DNA relaxation activity, but this result was likely a direct effect of zzso on the zzso of the DNA zzso More interestingly, a zzso zzso excess of zzso zzso zzso II zzso activity, the essential function of this zzso in cell zzso This zzso effect could also be zzso by zzso which interacts with zzso II, but not by zzso which does not bind zzso II in our in zzso zzso Since similar amounts of zzso reduced the abundance of zzso II DNA zzso products from the human zzso promoter yet also zzso zzso activity, it can be concluded that either: 1) zzso zzso the zzso rate of zzso zzso or 2) zzso directed zzso II to a new zzso site present on the zzso zzso but not present on the limited zzso zzso The structural requirements for zzso II zzso interactions were also zzso zzso zzso which destroyed the putative zzso II zzso zzso did not disrupt zzso II zzso zzso Since the putative zzso zzso in zzso II does not appear to mediate zzso zzso we propose that an alternate as yet zzso structure is involved in the association of zzso II with itself and other regulatory zzso
