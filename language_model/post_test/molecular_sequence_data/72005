We have identified and characterized zzso a novel protein containing a zzso recruitment domain zzso in its N zzso and a zzso region rich in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso showed striking similarity to zzso a product of the zzso zzso zzso formed zzso via its zzso and zzso with viral E10 but not with several zzso regulators containing zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso region of zzso containing the zzso was sufficient and necessary for zzso zzso Point zzso in highly zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso disrupted the ability of zzso to activate zzso and to form zzso indicating that the zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso We propose that zzso acts in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso
