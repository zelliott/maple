zzso muscle cells zzso express a battery of zzso differentiation zzso many of which are zzso during the course of vascular zzso Here, we present the zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso mapping of the gene zzso human smooth muscle cell zzso zzso Human zzso transcripts are restricted to zzso and cells of zzso origin and, in the latter case, appear to be uniquely controlled in two distinct human zzso lines of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso analysis of a zzso human bacterial artificial zzso zzso revealed a zzso structure zzso zzso spanning zzso 11 zzso very similar to that reported for the mouse zzso zzso Using a variety of zzso zzso cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping panels, the human zzso gene was mapped to a zzso zzso of less than zzso zzso in zzso These results provide new information concerning the regulation of zzso gene expression and demonstrate the utility of two human zzso lines for the further characterization of this zzso expression zzso The identification of a zzso harboring the entire human zzso locus represents an important zzso for future analysis of zzso regulatory zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso to a defined zzso zzso will facilitate an analysis of its potential as a candidate gene for disease zzso mapping to zzso
