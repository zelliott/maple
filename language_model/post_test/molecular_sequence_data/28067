The purpose of this investigation was to develop zzso zzso to zzso protein A zzso that could be used to characterize the protein and its distribution in various zzso Five zzso corresponding to different regions of the predicted zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were chemically zzso by solid phase zzso The peptides were zzso to zzso by reverse phase high pressure liquid zzso and coupled to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso responses were monitored by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso proteins was determined by zzso and zzso zzso All of the peptides except zzso zzso yielded significant immune zzso zzso to peptides zzso zzso and zzso each specifically recognized proteins of Mr zzso and zzso from zzso preparations of rat zzso tissue and showed limited or no zzso with other members of the zzso hormone zzso Three experiments were performed to determine whether the Mr zzso and zzso species were zzso derivatives of an Mr 25,000 zzso Treatment of zzso zzso preparations with zzso prior to zzso resulted in the identification of only an Mr 25,000 zzso It was also determined that the Mr zzso and zzso species specifically bound to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso shifted the synthesis of zzso by zzso zzso from the Mr zzso and zzso forms to the Mr 25,000 zzso The Mr zzso and zzso species were identified in serum obtained from pregnant and fetal rats but not in serum from zzso females or zzso We conclude that zzso is expressed in rat zzso An Mr 25,000 precursor zzso from zzso zzso and these zzso is zzso to either the Mr zzso or zzso form, both of which predominate in zzso and in zzso
