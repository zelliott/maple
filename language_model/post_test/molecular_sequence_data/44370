The zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains the genes for zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for the zzso chain zzso factors G zzso zzso and Tu zzso zzso This zzso producer contains three zzso or zzso zzso zzso encodes the regular zzso and is located immediately downstream of zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso start site directly upstream of zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso promoter zzso zzso from these promoters appeared to be growth phase dependent, diminishing drastically upon entry into stationary phase and at the onset of production of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cultures, a second round of zzso transcription, coinciding with aerial zzso formation and zzso production, was zzso The zzso promoter zzso was located in the zzso region between zzso and zzso by high-resolution zzso zzso in zzso transcription, and in zzso promoter zzso During zzso growth, the zzso and zzso transcripts are present at comparable zzso In contrast to zzso coli, which has two almost identical zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso contains only zzso for its regular zzso High levels of zzso may therefore be achieved by the zzso activity of zzso
