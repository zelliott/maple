The 3' zzso tail of zzso zzso and the zzso binding protein zzso play important roles in the regulation of zzso Recently, a human zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso interaction and consequently zzso translation, was zzso To gain insight into the biological role of zzso we studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the bona fide human zzso zzso as it interacts with zzso zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso tail, and reduces translation of a reporter zzso by approximately zzso in an zzso zzso translation zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso wings and wing discs results in a size reduction zzso which is due to a decrease in cell zzso zzso of cells zzso zzso in wing discs also contain fewer cells than zzso This zzso can be explained by a primary effect on cell zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso growth, zzso as it reduces zzso size in eyes and cell size in the zzso fat zzso We conclude that zzso zzso cell growth primarily by zzso protein zzso
