zzso and zzso use a zzso called the zzso that has an integral role in maintaining cellular function through the selective degradation of zzso zzso occurs in a zzso zzso core zzso which in zzso zzso is built from four stacked zzso rings of zzso zzso and zzso arranged zzso zzso zzso These rings form three interconnected zzso including a pair of zzso zzso by zzso through which zzso are passed before degradation and a zzso chamber zzso where the zzso zzso reaction zzso Although it is clear that zzso must be unfolded to enter through narrow, gated zzso zzso in zzso located on the zzso the structural and zzso properties of zzso inside the zzso zzso remain zzso zzso in the zzso might be expected to promote folding and thus impede zzso Here we investigate the zzso stability and dynamics of three small protein zzso in the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that these zzso interact actively with the zzso walls and have drastically altered kinetic and equilibrium properties that maintain them in zzso states so as to be accessible for zzso
