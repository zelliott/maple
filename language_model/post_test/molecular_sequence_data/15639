The pore region of zzso zzso zzso channels acts as the channel zzso zzso events occurring in the zzso zzso zzso domain must be coupled to the movements of the pore zzso When zzso in the pore region, zzso and zzso in the P zzso and zzso in the upper portion of the zzso zzso are zzso into an zzso gating is zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of a constant zzso zzso contrary to what can be observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso channels, zzso in these zzso channels is associated with zzso of zzso in the outer zzso In the zzso state, zzso zzso in different zzso become closer and zzso becomes more accessible to zzso zzso zzso is also observed in the zzso channel zzso but not in the zzso channel zzso zzso channels zzso and zzso did not zzso but zzso currents with a normal gating were observed in the zzso channels zzso and zzso zzso with tandem zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso channels indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso is within the same zzso These results show that zzso forms a zzso interaction with zzso zzso the P zzso with zzso whereas zzso could interact with zzso zzso the pore wall to the P zzso These interactions are essential for normal gating and zzso the zzso between the zzso domain and the zzso
