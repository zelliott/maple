In normally growing zzso cultured cells the zzso heat shock zzso factor zzso is localized in the zzso and zzso into the nucleus after heat zzso In the zzso of zzso cells, the zzso is present as a zzso that cannot bind zzso Upon stress, the zzso enters the nucleus where it is observed to be a zzso A novel nuclear zzso sequence zzso in the zzso was found to be responsible for zzso nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso prevents nuclear entry, as expected, yet surprisingly also allows zzso zzso and DNA binding in the zzso Further analysis of the zzso by zzso suggests that the two functions of nuclear entry and zzso are zzso in that distinct zzso present in the zzso are responsible for zzso zzso in certain basic zzso completely block nuclear entry, as expected for a zzso zzso In addition, two zzso were found in the zzso that, when altered, allowed zzso nuclear entry of zzso independent of zzso These zzso may interact with a putative cellular component or possibly other zzso of the zzso to prevent nuclear entry in normally growing zzso The zzso can also function autonomously to target a zzso fusion protein into the nucleus in a heat zzso zzso
