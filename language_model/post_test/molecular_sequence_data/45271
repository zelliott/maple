zzso of the small zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a member of the zzso inhibitor family, with bovine zzso was followed by zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso of the inhibitor with increasing amounts of the zzso reveal tight and specific binding in agreement with zzso zzso zzso and unparalleled among zzso zzso zzso zzso not only zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso but also some segments of it located zzso far from the zzso zzso of the zzso were affected by zzso However, besides changes, some of the zzso features of the free inhibitor are retained in the zzso zzso of the free and zzso inhibitor structures revealed that most, but not all, of the observed chemical shift changes can be attributed to minor structural zzso We suggest that the classical zzso + binding zzso model of zzso zzso might not be fully valid for the inhibitor family zzso In our view, this feature allows for the emergence of both zzso and zzso zzso in this group of small zzso
