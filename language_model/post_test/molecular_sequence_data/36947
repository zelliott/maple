The zzso regulation of the zzso zzso gene in liver results in high-level expression in the zzso followed by dramatic zzso repression after zzso We have examined the mouse zzso gene for zzso control sequences that may be involved in its zzso repression in zzso We showed previously that removal of a DNA region between positions zzso base pairs zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in the persistence of expression of an zzso zzso in the zzso liver of transgenic mice zzso and zzso Science zzso zzso This study examines the distribution of these zzso transcripts in liver using in zzso zzso We show that there is a zzso distribution of zzso transcripts in the adult zzso of these zzso zzso surrounding the central veins express high levels of zzso zzso while zzso in the intermediate and portal areas contain few, if any, zzso zzso zzso protection analysis shows a decrease in zzso zzso levels after birth, consistent with repression in all but a small subset of zzso These results indicate that repression in the zzso zzso is dependent upon the presence of a zzso zzso domain, which is located between the enhancers and the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso In contrast, this domain is not essential for complete repression of zzso zzso in the intermediate zone and zzso zzso
