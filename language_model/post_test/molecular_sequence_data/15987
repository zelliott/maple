zzso is a large zzso that binds zzso to zzso zzso of DNA in a zzso manner and lies in the minor groove about four bases to the zzso side of the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso repair system, we have obtained data showing that the ABC zzso makes incisions both zzso and 3' to the zzso zzso and that the incision activity is zzso by the addition of zzso II and DNA zzso I (and zzso Our results with the zzso zzso are consistent with the reported in zzso processing of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but do not agree with a recent study that reported anomalous processing of the zzso zzso by ABC zzso and zzso zzso Our results also imply that, in binding to damaged DNA, ABC zzso does not make important contacts in the minor groove four bases to the zzso side of the damaged zzso
