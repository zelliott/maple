The complete set of zzso and zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified, zzso and zzso The zzso sequence indicated the presence of two open reading frames corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins were calculated to be zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and showed extensive sequence similarities with the known zzso and zzso proteins of zzso coli and zzso zzso A zzso transcript initiated upstream of the zzso coding region was identified by zzso analysis of in zzso zzso indicating that the two genes consist of an zzso At least six zzso zzso proteins were identified in the cell extract of heat treated zzso zzso Two proteins of 10 and 60 zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells carrying a zzso zzso and zzso zzso were demonstrated to zzso to two out of the six zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso were physically mapped on the 60 degrees region of a 360 degrees map and genetically mapped at the position of zzso linkage with the zzso locus using zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso with a zzso resistance zzso zzso
