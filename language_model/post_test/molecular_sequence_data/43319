zzso zzso in Japanese were identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence zzso We analyzed zzso zzso obtained from Japanese individuals positive for zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso including two locally proposed splits zzso and zzso In the zzso analysis of both zzso 2 and 3, we zzso five different zzso zzso Each zzso pattern corresponded to each zzso split zzso zzso sequencing analysis of zzso 2 and zzso 3 showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Japanese are zzso by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and those zzso zzso and zzso zzso are previously unidentified zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing showed that the zzso sequence is identical to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 1 to 2 except for a synonymous substitution at zzso position 165 in zzso zzso On the other hand, the sequence of zzso 3 to 7 was identical to those of some zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was generated by a zzso event between one of the zzso and zzso zzso and one of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso As for zzso the entire zzso 1 to 7 sequence is identical to that of zzso except that the zzso of the zzso 3 sequence is identical to those of some zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that an event such as gene conversion, zzso exchange, or double zzso occurred in this zzso
