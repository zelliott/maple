The zzso locus encodes two unconventional zzso zzso and zzso consisting of fused protein zzso and zzso head zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso are the major zzso proteins in the zzso and the zzso interaction is required for the normal zzso zzso of zzso as well as for normal zzso In the current report, we present evidence for two zzso sites in zzso C1 and zzso which have different in zzso binding zzso C1 was found to be common to both zzso and zzso while C2 was unique to zzso To address the requirements for zzso binding at each site in zzso we generated transgenic flies expressing zzso genes deleted for either C1 or zzso We found that the spatial zzso of zzso depended on binding to both C1 and zzso Furthermore, zzso of either site resulted in a defective zzso A prolonged zzso zzso zzso was zzso at lower light zzso than necessary to produce a zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso binding to both C1 and C2 is required in zzso for termination of zzso
