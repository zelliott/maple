We show that a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso which was isolated as a deletion of the zzso end of the protein actually consists of the replacement of the last 16 zzso acids (which are mostly zzso by 26 mostly zzso zzso zzso This change almost completely zzso the in zzso zzso activity as well as its capacity to bind zzso ends in zzso although the zzso domain of the protein resides at least 150 zzso acids from the zzso This sharply contrasts with the properties of a series of zzso zzso and short zzso deletions in zzso described earlier which only slightly decrease the overall zzso zzso
