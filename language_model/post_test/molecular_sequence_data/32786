zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is present at high levels in humans and zzso zzso However, the function of zzso zzso in zzso infection is not well zzso In this investigation, a new gene zzso technology is used to predict molecular function and biological pathways of zzso zzso In comparison with human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso has similar molecular functions such as zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequences for human and zzso zzso zzso zzso are very different, the molecular functions are zzso This suggests that any zzso therapeutic treatment aimed at blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso function may affect human zzso zzso In contrast, a selective zzso zzso inhibitor targeting the zzso zzso function of zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso acid cycle provides an attractive therapeutic zzso
