In a screen for zzso genes that interfere with zzso repression zzso by the zzso group of zzso we identified a dominant zzso affecting the zzso zzso zzso the fly zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a fusion partner of both zzso and zzso in infant zzso Both fusion proteins retain the zzso zzso domain of zzso but not its zzso zzso We show here that, while the full-length zzso protein has no activity on zzso zzso elements zzso zzso of the isolated zzso zzso zzso domain activates several zzso Within the zzso full-length zzso the zzso domain zzso the zzso deregulation zzso by the zzso zzso zzso This deregulation is zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso domain, which zzso the same activity on an zzso zzso fusion protein expressed in zzso zzso These data reveal new properties for the zzso zzso domain and thus might provide new clues to understanding the mechanisms by which zzso fusion proteins in which the zzso domain is lost might trigger zzso in zzso
