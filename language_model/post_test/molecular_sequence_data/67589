zzso zzso is a multitasking protein involved in DNA replication and zzso repair, and it is important for preservation of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein contains a zzso putative zzso zzso cluster signature motif spanning the zzso active zzso We show that this motif is indeed an zzso cluster zzso zzso of zzso involved in metal coordination greatly reduces not just the zzso activity but also the zzso activity of zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso activities are zzso The affinity for DNA is not significantly reduced, but binding mode in the C to A zzso is zzso zzso a point zzso zzso zzso to the zzso cluster domain, which renders cells temperature sensitive, closely mimics the global defects of the zzso cluster zzso zzso This points to an important role of this zzso zzso zzso in stabilizing the zzso zzso The C to A zzso are deficient in DNA replication and repair in zzso and, zzso the degree to which they are defective zzso directly with degree of loss of zzso zzso Taken together with previous results showing that zzso in the zzso domain affect zzso function, our results provide a new zzso paradigm for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso fused in the same zzso
