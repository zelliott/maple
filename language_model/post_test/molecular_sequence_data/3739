The zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso group zzso enhances global zzso repair of zzso zzso zzso and suppresses zzso zzso Because zzso zzso increases after DNA damage in a zzso manner, we searched for and found a region in the human zzso gene that binds and responds zzso to zzso The corresponding region in the mouse zzso gene shared significant sequence identity with the human gene but was deficient for zzso binding and zzso zzso Furthermore, when mouse cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso remained zzso despite the zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrate direct zzso of the human zzso gene by zzso They also explain an important difference in DNA repair between humans and mice and show how mouse models can be improved to better reflect cancer zzso in zzso
