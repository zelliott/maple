zzso zzso zzso were developed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each of 4 zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso and each specifically stained the zzso of zzso zzso zzso were mapped using fusion protein zzso with specific deletions of defined regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized an zzso in the zzso terminal region between zzso acid zzso zzso 3 and 56, whereas zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso was further delineated to zzso zzso by Western analysis and zzso of in zzso transcribed and translated zzso protein having specific deletions in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was ultimately localized to the region between zzso 180 and 189 of the protein by zzso zzso zzso using zzso acid zzso synthetic zzso This sequence is apparently unique to zzso and has little zzso to other zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso into a zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso confirming the specificity of this zzso zzso zzso was then used to examine the expression of zzso in normal and zzso human zzso zzso was not detected in any normal adult tissue but was detected in 25 of 25 zzso confirmed zzso zzso was localized to the nucleus and showed marked zzso between cells as well as differential zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was further determined by zzso zzso where zzso was found to zzso to zzso areas, more frequently associated with the nuclear zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso stained 2 of 5 zzso tumors and one zzso zzso known to contain zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also of value in the accurate zzso zzso of 2 of 4 tumors previously diagnosed as zzso Ewing's zzso and 2 of 3 tumors diagnosed as zzso zzso
