zzso is a large zzso zzso found in developing zzso zzso A zzso probe to mouse zzso zzso was used to determine the cellular origins of this zzso in the zzso tooth germ by in zzso zzso At embryonic day 19, a zzso signal significantly greater than background was detected with zzso in the zzso layer of the dental zzso and in the inner zzso zzso of the zzso zzso At zzso day 1, a signal was detected over zzso and the strata zzso and zzso No zzso zzso was detected in zzso or the zzso zzso at either age, and zzso in zzso was not significantly greater than background at zzso day zzso Thus, much of the zzso found throughout developing teeth appears to be zzso by zzso and the inner zzso zzso the two populations of cells destined to generate zzso zzso
