The human fur gene encodes a zzso designated zzso the zzso half of which contains a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso exhibits striking primary zzso acid sequence similarity to the zzso zzso of members of the zzso family of zzso zzso We here report characteristics of the zzso protein and propose a three-dimensional model for its zzso zzso domain with zzso that predict zzso to exhibit an zzso zzso selectivity at paired basic zzso This prediction is substantiated by zzso and zzso experiments, using zzso zzso Full length fur zzso evokes the specific synthesis of two zzso of about 100 zzso and 90 zzso as appeared from Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso was performed by zzso of fur zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso precursor of von zzso factor zzso and revealed an increased zzso processing of zzso In contrast, zzso of fur zzso with a zzso zzso zzso having the zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso site zzso replaced by zzso revealed that zzso is not processed by the fur gene zzso We conclude that in higher zzso zzso is the zzso of a zzso class of zzso processing zzso with zzso specificity for paired basic zzso
