zzso zzso moves rapidly over surfaces by a process known as gliding zzso The mechanism of this form of zzso is not zzso Four genes that are required for zzso zzso gliding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been zzso zzso is similar to the zzso components of zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso was used to identify two additional zzso zzso and zzso that are required for cell zzso zzso and zzso appear to constitute an zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso was polar on zzso zzso which carries the entire zzso region, restored zzso to each of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which expresses zzso but not zzso restored zzso to each of the zzso zzso but did not complement the zzso zzso zzso has six putative zzso segments and is similar in sequence to zzso components of ABC zzso zzso is similar to putative accessory proteins of ABC zzso It has two apparent zzso zzso one near the zzso zzso and one near the zzso zzso and a large intervening loop that is predicted to reside in the zzso zzso and zzso are involved in membrane zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso may interact to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso is not closely linked to zzso but the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso related gliding zzso zzso zzso are arranged in what appears to be an zzso The exact roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in gliding are not zzso zzso similarities of zzso to components of other ABC zzso suggest that the zzso zzso may be involved in export of some material to the zzso outer zzso or zzso
