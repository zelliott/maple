The binding site of zzso was zzso chemically in the zzso center of zzso from zzso coli and of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso of the zzso zzso showed altered chemical zzso in the presence of zzso They include zzso zzso and zzso for zzso coli, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso were also observed at zzso and zzso within zzso I and III, respectively, of zzso coli zzso zzso In further experiments, zzso was shown to produce a major reduction in the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso within the zzso site of zzso coli zzso Moreover, it strongly zzso the putative zzso zzso between a zzso B drug and zzso at an adjacent site in zzso coli zzso zzso These data strongly support the concept that zzso along with other zzso zzso in particular the zzso B drugs, bind to an zzso structural motif that contains several zzso and accessible base zzso of the zzso zzso loop zzso This zzso motif is also likely to provide binding sites for the 3' zzso of the zzso and donor zzso In contrast, the effects at zzso and zzso which are located at the exit site of the zzso channel, are likely to be caused by a structural effect transmitted along the zzso zzso
