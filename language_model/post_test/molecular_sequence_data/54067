The class I region of the major zzso complex contains two zzso blocks zzso zzso each), known as the alpha and beta zzso These blocks contain members of zzso gene families including zzso class I, zzso zzso called zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously shown that each block consists of imperfect duplicated segments zzso containing linked members of different gene families, zzso and zzso that have zzso as part of two separate evolutionary zzso Another region zzso designated here as the zzso block is located between the alpha and the beta blocks and contains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within about 250 zzso of zzso Using zzso elements to trace the evolutionary relationships between different class I zzso we have found that zzso the zzso block contains zzso zzso zzso J sequences and other zzso patterns more in common with the beta than the alpha zzso zzso the zzso pattern associated with the zzso zzso is different from all other zzso class I zzso indicating a more complex zzso zzso the zzso zzso although substantially zzso is closely related in sequence to the zzso and -C zzso zzso two of the six zzso zzso J elements within the zzso and -C zzso are associated with the zzso zzso confirming their evolutionary relationships within the beta zzso and zzso the zzso zzso J elements within the alpha block are distinctly different from those identified within the beta and zzso zzso The sequence conservation and location of duplicated zzso zzso J elements in the zzso class I region show that the beta and zzso blocks have evolved separately from the alpha block beginning at a time before or during the evolution of zzso J elements in zzso
