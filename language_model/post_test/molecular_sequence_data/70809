In order to zzso the mechanisms of zzso evolution in zzso and to trace the fate of known zzso in a single animal during the acute phase of infection, a zzso zzso zzso was infected with the zzso zzso zzso B virus zzso zzso 197 zzso was injected zzso with pooled zzso collected from a chronic carrier that had been infected originally with a molecular clone of known zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso from both the zzso and the follow-up zzso from zzso were characterized for the presence of zzso related to the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso were zzso 6 weeks zzso zzso whereas a highly zzso virus population was present in the first zzso serum (4 weeks zzso Using zzso as the prototype, the zzso of the Pol and zzso regions in the first 11 weeks zzso has been zzso The sequence population in serum collected 6 weeks zzso was highly zzso with a mean zzso of zzso in the region zzso Mean zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso were found in zzso from the other zzso The presence of possible selective pressure was zzso by means of the zzso versus synonymous variation ratio zzso We found that the zzso values were stable for the S zzso zzso from zzso to zzso whereas a wider range was observed for the Pol zzso (from zzso to zzso Furthermore, from the analysis of the zzso of the zzso positions for the two overlapping zzso it was found that, in most cases, zzso zzso at position 1 of the Pol zzso zzso 3 of the S zzso corresponded to synonymous variation in the S zzso ORF, indicating independent evolution of the zzso zzso
