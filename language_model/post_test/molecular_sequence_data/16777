The regulation of floral organ number is closely associated with floral zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso cause enlargement of the floral zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulting in an increase in the number of all floral zzso zzso floral zzso develop in the zzso of each organ and/or in the additional whorls that zzso Inner floral zzso are more severely affected than outer floral zzso Many zzso zzso develop zzso and zzso zzso zzso remain in the center in zzso zzso zzso with this result, zzso a molecular marker of zzso indeterminate cells in rice, continues to be expressed in this zzso Although floral zzso are strongly affected by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are largely normal, even in this strong zzso We isolated the zzso gene by zzso cloning and found that it encodes a zzso repeat zzso zzso most similar to zzso zzso in zzso zzso This suggests that a zzso similar to the zzso signaling system that regulates zzso maintenance in zzso is zzso in the grass zzso Unlike zzso which is predominantly expressed in the zzso layer of the shoot zzso zzso is expressed throughout the whole floral zzso suggesting that small modifications to the zzso signaling zzso may be required to maintain the floral zzso in zzso In addition, zzso transcripts are detected in all zzso responsible for development of the aerial part of rice, suggesting that genes sharing functional zzso with zzso act in the zzso and zzso zzso to mask the effects of the zzso zzso
