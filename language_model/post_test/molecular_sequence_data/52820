zzso of the sibling zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso use the same three sex zzso components in different ratios to attract zzso zzso zzso the sensory hairs on the antennae of males contain three zzso cells sensitive to each of the zzso zzso In agreement with the number of zzso used, three different zzso proteins zzso could be identified in zzso hairs of both species by combining zzso and molecular cloning zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso droplets from zzso zzso zzso of male zzso zzso revealed the presence of three major zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and two minor zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In Western blots with four zzso raised against different zzso zzso zzso zzso was found only with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses revealed at least three zzso zzso zzso proteins with zzso values between zzso and zzso zzso sequencing of these three proteins revealed two proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso identical in the first 49 zzso acids to the already known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso and a new zzso having only 57% identity with this zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso libraries with an zzso probe corresponding to the zzso end of the new zzso zzso zzso led to the discovery of full length clones zzso this protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso By screening the zzso zzso library of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso studies with the two main zzso components of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso revealed that in zzso zzso both zzso zzso and the new zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso whereas no binding of the zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso two zzso from sensory hair zzso showed binding affinity for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso
