This paper describes the expression profile of the zzso zzso during differentiation of zzso zzso zzso and embryonic stem zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso is expressed in discrete embryonic structures and, in view of this, we sought an in zzso differentiation model of development in which we could study more readily the structure and function of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were chosen as they have the capacity to develop down the cardiac muscle zzso and we have previously demonstrated that zzso is expressed abundantly in the embryonic zzso The differentiation process in both cell types is accompanied by an induction of zzso zzso and zzso However, in differentiated cultures zzso is not expressed in zzso cells, indicating that these zzso cells do not represent zzso embryonic zzso zzso of zzso is observed on zzso cells which appear to migrate over and out from the zzso zzso zzso the major zzso for zzso is also associated with these zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that expression of both zzso and zzso by the zzso cells is required for zzso zzso and cell zzso As zzso is zzso in these cultures, zzso cells are now established as a useful model system to study the factors regulating expression of the zzso zzso
