zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is essential for the proliferation of the zzso the zzso stage of the zzso zzso This has been demonstrated using deletion zzso zzso the insect stage of the zzso first, in zzso after differentiation to zzso which subsequently lost their potential to zzso second, by infection of zzso zzso which were able to cope with the infection and cleared the zzso third, by infection of zzso mice, which showed no zzso zzso The zzso deletion zzso zzso are a potential live vaccine because they zzso zzso transform to zzso and deliver zzso zzso to raise an immune response without causing the zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in a zzso infection is likely to resolve the disease and as such, is an ideal target for drug development against zzso Here we investigated the presence and copy number of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso major, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and discuss the results with regard to drug development and vaccination using zzso deletion zzso
