Five novel genes zzso to the zzso genes zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso of mouse have been identified as a result of a zzso survey of zzso in sturgeon, zzso zzso chicken and zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso primary structure of these genes revealed that they belong to a novel class of zzso zzso which we name zzso All genes of this class investigated so far have similar patterns of expression during early zzso characterized by zzso transcript levels being present at the anterior zzso of the main embryonic body zzso The data obtained also suggest that, despite considerable high structural divergence between their zzso all known zzso genes may be zzso and thus represent one of the most quickly evolving classes of zzso zzso zzso
