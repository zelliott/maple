zzso the evolution of protein structures from specific sequences may be achieved by predicting the desired folded structure from a given sequence and by predicting compatible sequences from a known structure using principles of protein folding and zzso zzso design requires the synthesis of a broad range of sequences consistent with a zzso target zzso However, the number of possible protein sequences for a given target structure zzso increases with the number of zzso making the explicit zzso of all sequences intractable zzso and zzso For sequence libraries of arbitrary size, the results of a zzso mean field theory is applied to a three-dimensional cubic lattice model of proteins and real zzso protein sequences to estimate the number and zzso composition of sequences consistent with a generalized zzso zzso zzso calculated zzso zzso probabilities and the zzso pair probabilities at each position in a sequence are compared to those obtained from exact zzso for cubic lattice zzso For real proteins the theoretically predicted sequence zzso are compared to that obtained from a set of zzso protein zzso The theory results match extremely well with both the cubic lattice protein and real protein zzso The theory also evaluates the zzso of specific zzso and identifies the beneficial zzso The theory may be used to zzso particular design strategies and explore zzso zzso strategies in zzso de zzso proteins in context of in zzso protein zzso
