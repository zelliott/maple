The human zzso zzso expressed in tissue culture cells, is selectively activated by zzso zzso investigation of its anatomical and cellular distribution has been performed in the zzso It is expressed by zzso in a number of brain zzso by zzso cells that include pancreatic zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso cells in the gastrointestinal zzso and by cells in the zzso and zzso The zzso role of the zzso zzso expressed by these cells remains to be zzso All pharmacological studies performed to date have used the human zzso We have now isolated a complementary DNA including the entire coding sequence of the rat zzso zzso and compared its pharmacological profile with that of the human zzso zzso when each is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso including rat zzso rat zzso and human zzso have low potency at the rat zzso zzso for stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When compared with the effect of a bovine zzso zzso zzso peptides are partial zzso at the rat zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is unlikely to be a zzso important zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A zzso zzso to an activity detected in a bovine zzso extract is a good candidate for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
