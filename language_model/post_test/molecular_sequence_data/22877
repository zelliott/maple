Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso linkage region and is a diagnostic marker of an enhanced zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated zzso zzso of human zzso and assessed the impact of the zzso region on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso with deletions at the zzso domain were expressed in insect cells and zzso for zzso zzso As many as 260 zzso acids could be truncated at the zzso region of the zzso without affecting its zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso 272 and 273 zzso acids resulted in a 70, 90 and zzso loss in zzso zzso Interestingly, deletion of the single 12 zzso acid motif zzso leads to a zzso zzso zzso This is in agreement with our findings zzso the importance of the zzso zzso where we have shown that zzso zzso resulted in a nearly inactive zzso zzso Moreover, we investigated the location of the zzso site of human zzso using the truncated zzso zzso binding was observed to be slightly altered in zzso lacking zzso or zzso zzso zzso but deletion of the potential zzso motif zzso did not lead to a loss of zzso binding zzso The effect of zzso or zzso on the zzso activity of all zzso was not significantly different from that of the zzso Our study demonstrates that over zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso is necessary for expressing a zzso zzso with full zzso zzso
