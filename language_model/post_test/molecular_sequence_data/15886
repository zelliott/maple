An ideal vaccine should elicit a long lasting immune response against the natural zzso both at the zzso and zzso zzso The immune response should occur in all individuals and be directed against zzso that do not vary in the natural zzso zzso A major problem in designing synthetic zzso vaccines is that T cells generally recognize zzso zzso only in association with one or a few of the many zzso of major zzso complex zzso zzso During the characterization of zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso that are recognized by human T cells, we zzso a sequence of the zzso zzso and found that synthetic peptides corresponding to this sequence are recognized by T cells in association with many different zzso class II zzso both in mouse and in zzso This region of the zzso protein is zzso in different zzso zzso zzso derived from this region should be capable of inducing zzso responses in individuals of most zzso types, and may represent good candidates for inclusion in an effective zzso zzso zzso
