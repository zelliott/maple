zzso zzso C zzso a zzso zzso implicated in the regulation of many zzso zzso consists of a family of at least twelve zzso which differ in tissue distribution, zzso zzso regulatory properties, zzso In addition to this zzso at the protein level, we identify here for the first time a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript, specifically expressed in the brain, which is identical with zzso zzso except for sequence divergence within the first variable domain zzso The authenticity of this unique zzso sequence zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso protection and reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso When translated zzso with zzso zzso a stop zzso is located 28 zzso acids towards the zzso of the divergence point and the intervening sequence lacks an expected initiating zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in terms of protein synthesis since Western zzso with an zzso directed against the zzso of zzso zzso failed to reveal a protein smaller than zzso zzso and synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to support protein synthesis in a translation system in zzso zzso amplification of rat zzso DNA demonstrated lack of an zzso at the junction between zzso and the first constant domain (the zzso zzso and zzso DNA Southern zzso analysis using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that they have different zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, is not derived from the zzso zzso gene by alternative zzso but rather is the product of a distinct zzso In Northern zzso analysis, brain zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso zzso transcript, while the abundant zzso and zzso zzso zzso previously reported to zzso zzso zzso are, in fact, zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of rat brain, heart, zzso liver, kidney and skeletal muscle revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso only in zzso zzso zzso transcripts were most abundant in lung and kidney zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the tissue profile of zzso zzso zzso in Western zzso zzso complementary to the common zzso and C1 zzso detected both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the C1 probe also detected an abundant novel zzso zzso zzso in brain and heart, suggesting the existence of an additional zzso zzso zzso This work, therefore, also emphasizes the importance of careful choice of zzso and zzso zzso to study zzso zzso zzso
