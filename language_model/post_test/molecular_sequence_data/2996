Two vaccines against an zzso expressed B cell zzso were assessed for their ability to induce protective immunity in mice against challenge with a zzso cell zzso One vaccine was based on a zzso expression zzso and the other was a zzso zzso zzso both vaccines expressed a zzso derived from the zzso regions zzso of the zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso as a fusion product with mouse zzso zzso factor zzso Mice zzso with either vaccine showed significantly higher survival rates than controls after challenge with leukemia zzso However, protection from tumor challenge was optimal when the DNA vaccine was used for zzso followed by a booster zzso with the zzso virus zzso This vaccination protocol induced resistance not only to the first tumor challenge given shortly afterwards, but also to a second challenge given months zzso Both zzso and zzso T cells contributed to protection in vaccinated zzso These data suggest that such a vaccine regimen might reduce the zzso of recurrence in patients with minimal residual disease after conventional zzso
