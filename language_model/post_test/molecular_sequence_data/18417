A novel approach was taken to screen for the presence of highly specific zzso in tissue extracts and to monitor their zzso We successfully used this method to identify zzso activity in brain which may be responsible for the generation of the zzso of the zzso the major protein in the brain zzso deposits of Alzheimer's zzso A zzso synthetic zzso spanning this putative zzso site, was used as an artificial zzso zzso was monitored by TLC separation of the reaction products followed by zzso zzso shifts indicate zzso the identity of the fragments can be zzso from synthetic markers or from comparison to control zzso with known zzso When using highly zzso or zzso zzso larger amounts of zzso zzso zzso can be used and the resulting fragments identified by zzso The zzso is fast, sensitive zzso zzso compatible with crude zzso allows simultaneous analysis of multiple samples and is highly selective with respect to the specificity of the zzso The method is generally zzso to the search for zzso with known, putative or even desired zzso
