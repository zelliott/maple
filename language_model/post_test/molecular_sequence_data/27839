The cloning of the gene for human zzso has permitted remarkable advances to be made in understanding the structure of this zzso zzso From computer models and the determination of the actual zzso of expressed zzso human zzso at 3 zzso a considerable amount of information has emerged concerning the molecular mechanism of zzso activity, thus permitting the logical design and analysis of zzso zzso suitable for use in zzso zzso In addition, many of the properties of zzso can now be explained in molecular terms, including the species specificity of its reaction with zzso From the production of zzso zzso the next avenue of research is likely to be the design of drugs that will reduce the activity of the human zzso gene and thereby curtail zzso zzso This may involve a zzso zzso based on zzso zzso Thus cloning of the zzso gene has led to zzso of the zzso structure of human zzso for inhibitor design, and will similarly permit studies of zzso factors that may be future targets for blockade of the zzso system in zzso zzso
