zzso identified, zzso and characterized two zzso binding proteins from the pale brown zzso zzso zzso One of the proteins zzso 116 zzso acids zzso showed high zzso acid identity zzso to two previously identified zzso from zzso zzso The second protein zzso showed limited sequence similarity to zzso and zzso zzso but contained only 133 zzso zzso Both proteins showed the occurrence of six highly zzso zzso zzso mass spectral data suggested they are all bound in three zzso zzso During zzso zzso separated into several zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and zzso zzso mass zzso demonstrated that they are different zzso of the same zzso In the native gel zzso binding experiments, none of the zzso bound 1, zzso but different zzso showed different binding affinities for zzso a zzso from related zzso zzso and zzso the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also bound zzso
