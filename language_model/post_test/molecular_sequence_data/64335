Fourteen zzso zzso acid bacteria that were isolated from zzso grains and zzso fermented zzso were assigned to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso based on their characteristic zzso zzso features and zzso profiles of zzso zzso Further zzso analyses on representative strains from both zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso share 100 % zzso zzso sequence similarity and belong zzso to the zzso zzso species zzso zzso binding values of zzso % and analogous DNA zzso contents of zzso zzso showed that the strains studied belonged to one zzso zzso zzso is a later synonym of zzso zzso An zzso description is proposed for zzso zzso Due to the specific zzso and zzso characteristics of these zzso in zzso grain formation, it is proposed that zzso zzso should be reclassified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
