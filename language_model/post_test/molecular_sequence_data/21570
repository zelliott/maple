Root colonization and diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in plants growing in fly ash zzso Eight species could be separated zzso while zzso analyses after zzso amplification of the ITS region followed by zzso and sequencing revealed seven different AM zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis showed that these sequences cluster into four discrete groups, belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of plants with spores of AM zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with zzso root pieces increased the growth zzso zzso zzso and total P content zzso of zzso zzso zzso grown on fly ash compared to zzso zzso The growth improvement was the consequence of increased P nutrition and decreased Al, Fe, zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggested that the zzso of tree zzso with stress adapted AM zzso aid in the reclamation of fly ash zzso
