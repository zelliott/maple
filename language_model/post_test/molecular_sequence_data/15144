The traditional knowledge in textbooks indicated that zzso were the closest relatives to zzso among all extant zzso However, this opinion was challenged by several recent zzso studies using hundreds of nuclear zzso The researchers suggested that zzso but not zzso should be the closest living relatives to zzso In the present study, by using data generated from hundreds of zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso in terms of whole zzso zzso zzso Our results firmly demonstrate that each of extant zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso But the results present several alternative zzso trees depending on different sequence zzso used in the zzso Although no clear zzso relationships are zzso those trees indicate that the ancient common zzso diversified rapidly soon after their appearance in the early zzso and generated all major zzso lineages during a short historical period, which is consistent with zzso zzso revealed by zzso It was the zzso evolution that obscured the zzso relationships of extant zzso Thus, we conclude that an zzso analysis approach rather than simply using more DNA sequences should be employed to address the distant evolutionary zzso
