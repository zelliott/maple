zzso is a giant zzso protein with multiple zzso whose interactions with zzso and small zzso suggest that it has an important role in zzso zzso structural support, and the zzso alignment of the zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the zzso zzso of zzso and examined its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso and central nervous system by 24 hours zzso zzso and in the heart by 48 zzso zzso of zzso using two independent zzso zzso zzso resulted in diminished numbers and marked disarray of skeletal zzso impaired lateral alignment of adjacent zzso disorganization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abnormalities of cardiac structure and zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso is required for zzso cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso The diminished capacity to generate and organize new zzso in response to zzso depletion suggests that it may have a vital role in the causation of or adaptation to cardiac and skeletal zzso
