Many zzso and zzso chemicals are zzso to zzso which may be zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso to less zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the reported rabbit zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we constructed a 35 base zzso which was used to screen rabbit liver zzso zzso Overlapping rabbit zzso clones were isolated and the full-length zzso sequence of zzso zzso was zzso The rabbit zzso sequence has a high degree of similarity zzso than zzso with zzso sequences reported for rat and human zzso Northern zzso analyses with fragments of the rabbit zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the liver and induced following exposure to zzso or zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso is also observed in rabbit zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso as zzso zzso zzso activity is shown to correlate closely with tissue levels of zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses of rabbit DNA suggest that the zzso gene exists as a single copy per zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the human and rat were compared to that of the deduced rabbit protein in order to analyze the degree of conservation and zzso profiles in these zzso This comparison permitted the zzso of a zzso model of zzso zzso as it may relate to the zzso zzso
