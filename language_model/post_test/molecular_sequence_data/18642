Quality zzso zzso zzso is a hard kernel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we created opaque zzso zzso to identify zzso modifier genes and to investigate deletion zzso combined with zzso sequencing as a zzso zzso zzso functional zzso zzso A zzso zzso deletion zzso was zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso and abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing revealed a zzso pair deletion encompassing the zzso and zzso zzso genes on zzso 7 and a deletion of at least 232 zzso on zzso zzso zzso body number was reduced by over zzso while protein body size is similar to the wild zzso zzso zzso for the zzso deletion had intermediate zzso and zzso zzso levels and were zzso indicating zzso of these gene products in zzso zzso zzso The zzso deletion further increased zzso in zzso in its zzso and zzso zzso This work identifies zzso zzso as an zzso modifier gene within the largest zzso quantitative trait locus and may suggest the zzso zzso also contributes to this quantitative trait zzso It further demonstrates that zzso deletions in zzso zzso lines can be identified through a combination of assembly of zzso reads against the zzso zzso and integration of zzso sequencing zzso
