zzso zzso zzso are a well-studied family of zzso inhibitor proteins of zzso zzso In nature, the active region of zzso possesses a highly zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The importance of this zzso has been zzso by synthetic zzso zzso site loop zzso In particular, this zzso was exclusively identified for active zzso zzso selected from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A further kinetic analysis of 26 zzso zzso peptides revealed that zzso provides both optimal binding affinity and optimal resistance against zzso turnover by zzso zzso we report the zzso zzso study of a zzso zzso of these zzso site loop peptides representing a zzso elimination of the zzso zzso zzso and inversion of its zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso adopts a three-dimensional structure that closely mimics the one of the corresponding region of the complete zzso This zzso the use of this template for the investigation of zzso zzso While the overall backbone geometry is similar in all studied zzso zzso changes induced by the modification of the zzso side chain have now been identified and provide a rational explanation of the zzso observed functional zzso zzso the zzso group has little structural effect, whereas the elimination of the zzso atom or the inversion of the zzso zzso results in characteristic changes to the zzso hydrogen bond zzso We conclude that the zzso hydrogen bond between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso backbone zzso is an important zzso constraint and directs the zzso contact of the zzso zzso side chain with the zzso surface in a functionally optimal zzso both in the zzso and the native zzso In at least four zzso inhibitor protein families similar structural arrangements for a zzso zzso zzso have been observed, which suggests an analogous functional zzso zzso at zzso of the zzso also affect the zzso balance between zzso and trans zzso at a distant zzso motif zzso Presented with a mixture of zzso zzso zzso appears to interact preferably with the zzso that retains the zzso zzso Pro geometry found in the parent zzso zzso
