zzso of the zzso membrane network of the zzso apparatus depends on zzso and zzso but the mechanism is zzso We developed an in zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was targeted to the zzso outer membrane either directly or via binding to zzso zzso bearing zzso became zzso to one another, and this depended on a zzso zzso domain that was also required for zzso zzso Point zzso within the predicted binding groove of the zzso zzso domain blocked both zzso and, in a gene replacement zzso zzso ribbon zzso zzso also required zzso membrane zzso of the zzso domain, suggesting a mechanism that zzso the zzso binding groove to favor interactions in zzso Thus, a zzso zzso interaction mediates zzso zzso in living zzso
