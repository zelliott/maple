The zzso beta precursor protein can exist as both a zzso and a zzso zzso with the former having the potential to generate the zzso beta zzso present in the zzso plaques which are characteristic of Alzheimer's zzso In this study, we have used a clone of the zzso mouse zzso cell line which expresses high levels of the zzso beta precursor protein to characterize the zzso state of the zzso and zzso forms of the protein and to examine the role of zzso modifications in protein zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso beta precursor protein demonstrated that the soluble form of the protein contains significant amounts of zzso acid, with the zzso zzso being reduced in the particulate cellular zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso to interfere with the formation of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso beta precursor protein and an increase in the level of the cellular form of the zzso The increase in zzso beta precursor protein levels in the cellular fraction was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso Furthermore, cells zzso the zzso zzso also demonstrated an increase in zzso beta precursor protein zzso These results suggest that the presence of terminal zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso may be required for the optimal transport of the zzso beta precursor protein from the zzso to the cell membrane with the subsequent zzso to generate the zzso form of the zzso
