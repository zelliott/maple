In order to better understand the relationship between zzso and the release of zzso hormone into the blood, we cloned and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 2) from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 had high similarities to group 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and group 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso and 2 were expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells, they responded to zzso by increasing zzso zzso levels, thus indicating the presence of zzso zzso There were no clear differences in zzso and 2 zzso levels between zzso zzso complexes of zzso and zzso egg producers during zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso were concentrated in the mushroom body zzso rather than in the zzso zzso Taking into account the results of earlier experiments on excised regions corresponding to mushroom bodies, zzso and 2 in the mushroom body apparently play a role in the release of zzso zzso
