zzso of a base in a specific DNA sequence protects the DNA from zzso zzso by restriction zzso recognizing the same zzso The zzso zzso zzso system of zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a restriction zzso gene and two zzso zzso The zzso zzso by this system recognize an zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso the last zzso in the recognition sequence zzso to zzso A second zzso zzso was cloned and zzso to zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso zzso the internal zzso in the recognition sequence zzso yielding zzso and zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso The protein exists in solution as a zzso of molecular mass 30 zzso Da under zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso behaves in the same zzso zzso analysis showed that the complete zzso zzso system, consisting of two zzso genes and the zzso zzso is the most stable and the least harmful to bacterial zzso
