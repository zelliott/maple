The complete zzso sequence of the S zzso of tomato spotted zzso virus zzso was zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long and has an zzso coding zzso The sequence contains two open reading frames zzso one in the viral sense which encodes a protein with a predicted Mr of zzso and one in the viral complementary sense which encodes the viral zzso protein of Mr zzso Both proteins are expressed by translation of two zzso zzso species that possibly terminate at a long stable hairpin structure, located at the zzso zzso The structure of this zzso segment resembles that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The absence of significant sequence zzso between zzso and zzso infecting animals suggests that zzso should be considered as a representative of a new zzso within the zzso
