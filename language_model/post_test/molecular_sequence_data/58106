zzso directed against the zzso cluster of zzso differentiation zzso recognize zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A major zzso in extracts from zzso zzso bound by zzso zzso exhibits a relative molecular mass of zzso According to recent data, this zzso may be a product of the zzso zzso zzso gene that belongs to the zzso gene zzso As a result of alternative zzso the zzso gene is transcribed into at least seven distinct zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso were raised against the zzso domain expressed in bacteria and to a zzso zzso the zzso 23 zzso acids zzso by the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and an zzso specific for members of the zzso family were used to identify potential zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso For comparison, the binding of zzso to zzso zzso from human zzso was zzso In the membrane preparation from zzso the only zzso identified by the zzso the domain zzso and the zzso zzso was the zzso of zzso 160,000 recognized by a zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso 160,000 zzso membrane zzso of the zzso cluster is the product of the zzso zzso containing all coding sequences of the zzso zzso Among two major zzso zzso present in human zzso the zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso domain, whereas the domain is lacking in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso
