Our previous studies provided evidence that a zzso major zzso membrane zzso termed zzso zzso between zzso and the plasma membrane along the zzso zzso in rat zzso cells zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the movement of a zzso major zzso membrane zzso referred to as zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso membrane transport system of cultured rat zzso zzso fragments of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso were used as zzso to analyze zzso the transport of these two membrane proteins from the cell surface to zzso After the addition of zzso and zzso zzso fragments to the culture zzso the delivery of the zzso zzso to zzso was examined by cell zzso on a zzso density zzso The amount of these zzso zzso in the zzso fraction became larger as the period of cell incubation was zzso zzso values for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso fragments were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which were comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso process of the two zzso continued for an extended period in the cells exposed to the protein synthesis zzso zzso Furthermore, we measured the transit times of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments from the cell surface to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
