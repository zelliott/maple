zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While the chemical and physical properties of the protein have been extensively zzso its overall zzso structure is zzso By comparison with zzso zzso and snake zzso the zzso zinc binding site of zzso has been identified, as well as a potential binding site for zzso which has not been recognized zzso The positions of the major secondary structural features are predicted, and found to be similar to other structurally characterized zzso while the positions of the three zzso zzso bonds are also zzso Finally, zzso is reported to be zzso and earlier work on zzso zzso from snake zzso identified six zzso acids which might be responsible for zzso zzso It is shown here that most of these zzso occur in zzso and yet it is zzso in its zzso Altogether, this work demonstrates the utility of sequence analysis methods in the characterization of the structure of zzso zzso
