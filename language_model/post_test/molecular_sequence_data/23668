zzso zzso is a genetically diverse bacterial species that chronically zzso human zzso and sometimes causes severe zzso zzso Studies of zzso DNA sequences can suggest geographic origins of individual zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso zzso which is just after the translation stop of a gene of unknown function, near the promoter of zzso zzso signal zzso genes in strain zzso and absent from this site in strain zzso This zzso zzso was found in 9 of 9 zzso (West zzso 9 of 20 zzso South zzso and 9 of 40 zzso Spanish strains but in only 2 of 20 zzso North American strains and none of 20 zzso 20 Indian, and 20 Japanese zzso Four South African zzso that lacked zzso and that belonged to an unusual zzso group contained a zzso zzso at this site zzso whereas none of 181 other strains screened contained zzso In further tests zzso (10 of zzso of strains from African Americans but only zzso (3 of zzso of strains from Caucasian Americans carried zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso strains of modern African Americans seem to retain traces of African roots, despite the multiple generations since their ancestors were taken from West zzso zzso zzso sequences were found at numerous sites in zzso zzso zzso always between zzso Such sequences might affect regulation of zzso and could facilitate zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso differences between African-American and zzso zzso zzso gene pools may bear on our understanding of zzso zzso transmission and disease zzso
