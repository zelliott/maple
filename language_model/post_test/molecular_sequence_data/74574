zzso are zzso fly larvae zzso zzso zzso zzso found only in Australia and New zzso Their core habitat is rainforest zzso and wet zzso Eight species are present in zzso five of them have been recently zzso The geographic distribution of species in Australia encompasses the zzso regions of the eastern Australian coastline from the Wet zzso region of northern zzso to the cool temperate and zzso zzso of southern Australia and zzso zzso trees based upon partial sequences of the zzso genes zzso zzso II and zzso zzso show that populations tend to be clustered into zzso geographic groups showing overall zzso with the known species zzso The deepest division is between the zzso southern zzso zzso and the more widespread zzso zzso zzso comprises the sister groups, zzso zzso from zzso and the newly described species, zzso zzso found in a high-altitude cave at Mt Buffalo in the Australian zzso in zzso The remaining Australian zzso in zzso zzso are distributed in a zzso of geographic clusters that extend from the Wet zzso in northern zzso to the temperate forests of southern zzso zzso from caves and zzso within any one geographic location tended to cluster together within a zzso We suggest that the zzso differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso larvae are zzso adaptations to local zzso conditions rather than due to the presence of cryptic species in zzso
