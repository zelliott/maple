zzso zzso binding properties were examined in zzso an abundant zzso membrane protein expressed in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso An overlay zzso using zzso as a zzso demonstrated the ability of a zzso zzso produced from the zzso zzso expression zzso to bind zzso zzso A high yield of zzso zzso was obtained from the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso The fusion product enabled zzso zzso via affinity zzso zzso zzso by zzso resulted in its separation from the zzso carrier zzso zzso A direct zzso study was performed with zzso zzso by a zzso column technique, in the presence of zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso zzso for binding of zzso to zzso with a zzso constant of 130 zzso zzso A zzso truncated protein consisting of 13 zzso from the zzso zzso domain was found to retain the capacity to bind zzso zzso A data search for zzso between zzso and known zzso proteins revealed considerable similarity to members of the zzso family in a zzso acid region from the zzso terminal of zzso which zzso two tandem zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
