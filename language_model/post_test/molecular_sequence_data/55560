An effective immune response to zzso challenge is critically dependent on the size of the zzso cell population generated from zzso zzso of zzso T zzso The zzso network involved in regulating the size of the zzso population, particularly for zzso zzso cells, is poorly zzso In this study, we investigate the role of zzso an inhibitor of E protein zzso factors, in the generation of zzso zzso Using a T zzso conditional zzso knockout mouse model, we show that inhibitor of DNA binding zzso is essential for the development of experimental zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso T cells are produced in these mice, the activated zzso T cells form a smaller pool of zzso cells in the peripheral zzso zzso exhibit reduced proliferation and increased cell death, and are largely absent in the zzso In the absence of zzso E protein targets, including the zzso protein zzso and zzso are expressed at higher levels among activated zzso T zzso This study reveals a critical role of zzso in the control of zzso zzso T cell population size and the development of a zzso zzso zzso
