zzso of a new zzso with zzso to zzso were recently identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this novel virus, called zzso virus zzso or human zzso zzso 8 was detected in classical zzso and zzso body cavity based zzso by zzso chain zzso In this report major and minor zzso proteins of zzso were zzso cloned and produced as zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso from 69 zzso infected patients with zzso 30 zzso infected patients without zzso and 106 control individuals were tested by zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from four patients were tested over periods ranging from 18 months to 6 zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso were detected in patients with zzso zzso and in some AIDS patients without zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso proteins occurred more than 1 year prior to diagnosis of zzso In a considerable portion of zzso patients no zzso or zzso zzso against zzso zzso proteins were zzso In these patients there was an inverse relationship between zzso against zzso and the zzso ratio, suggesting that the inconsistency of zzso zzso is due at least partly to an impaired immune zzso No zzso against zzso zzso zzso was detected in the vast majority of zzso from zzso control zzso Our findings indicate that a specific zzso immune response against zzso proteins is raised in zzso infected individuals, and that zzso zzso can be used to diagnose zzso zzso The correlation between occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso supports the hypothesis of a zzso role of zzso
