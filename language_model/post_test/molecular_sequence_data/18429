A zzso gene of carp zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the gene indicates six zzso spanning zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso of restriction zzso zzso of carp zzso DNA indicate that there are two copies of the zzso zzso and several other species of zzso zzso The zzso start site is 85 zzso and 24 zzso downstream respectively from consensus zzso and zzso promoter zzso The organization of the carp zzso gene is identical to that of chicken, human, and rat genes in terms of size, zzso locations and junctions and in having a zzso silent first zzso The fish gene is zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, respectively, with land zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso gene expression indicated that the gene is highly expressed in brain, less so in muscle, and much less so in liver zzso The putative zzso zzso promoter of zzso identified by the conservation of known zzso regulatory zzso is zzso active in both zzso and zzso zzso
