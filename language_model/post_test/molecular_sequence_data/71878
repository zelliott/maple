Gene III zzso of zzso a zzso zzso specifically infecting zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to zzso a zzso protein zzso required for zzso zzso In this study, the zzso start site for the gene and the zzso sequence of the protein were determined, resulting in the revision of the translation initiation site from the one previously predicted for this zzso For comparative study, the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso specifically infecting zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these two zzso exhibit a high degree of identity in their zzso halves and possess the structural features typical of the zzso proteins of zzso zzso a signal sequence in the N zzso a long zzso region near the center, and a zzso membrane zzso domain in the C zzso The regions between zzso and the upstream zzso 128 zzso in both zzso are larger than those of other zzso zzso A hybrid zzso of zzso consisting of the zzso zzso and all the other components derived from zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is the gene specifying host specificity and demonstrating the zzso of the zzso
