The clam zzso zzso inhabits the zzso west coast of the island of Puerto zzso It contains three different zzso zzso I zzso which is zzso at all zzso carries zzso in its zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli cells was performed in the presence of zzso acid zzso zzso of the protein was achieved using zzso zzso exchange and size exclusion zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso was assessed by detection of the protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso derivatives by zzso zzso with zzso zzso at zzso zzso and 425 zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso binds zzso and forms a zzso zzso complex like the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine the zzso affinity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and association rate zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso affinity constant of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso lower than that of the native clam zzso reported zzso This effect is attributed mostly to the first of two zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso 61 and zzso zzso zzso and additional zzso acids present in our construct as demonstrated by zzso of the association rate with a new construct lacking most of the additional zzso and the zzso zzso The elimination of these zzso restores the similarity between the expressed and zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso association zzso A pH dependence on the zzso association rate was also contributing to the overall affinity constant and was taken into account in the zzso of the functional properties of the new zzso zzso
