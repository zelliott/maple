zzso zzso and zzso at the human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso site requires an upstream zzso zzso to overcome the zzso sequence context of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso functions to stabilize the association of the zzso with zzso and zzso specificity factor zzso the factor responsible for recognition of the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso efficiency could be restored to near zzso levels upon replacement of the zzso region immediately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (the B zzso by the analogous sequences from the efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the contributions of zzso sequence and structure to zzso site recognition, we have used an in zzso selection system to identify B segment sequences that enhance the zzso efficiency of a zzso zzso lacking a zzso zzso The final zzso selection pool was composed of two zzso classes of zzso zzso probing revealed that the selected sequences restored an zzso zzso that zzso recognition of the zzso zzso by zzso These results indicate that both the sequence and structural context of the zzso zzso contribute to zzso site recognition by zzso
