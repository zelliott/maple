A novel zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso strain zzso which was isolated from zzso water of the Indian Ocean, was studied zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can zzso several zzso including zzso and zzso as sole carbon zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso showed the highest similarity with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed lower similarities zzso with other members of the zzso zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which accounted for zzso of the total fatty zzso It had zzso 10 as the major respiratory zzso and zzso as the major zzso All these characteristics were consistent with those of recognized zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso experiments and zzso fingerprint comparisons also indicate that strain zzso represents a novel zzso species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
