The discovery of zzso causing human disease has so far been biased toward zzso zzso Having excluded all zzso coding regions, we performed targeted zzso parallel zzso of the zzso zzso linkage zzso at zzso of family zzso We identified in the binding site of zzso factor zzso a regulatory zzso that leads to zzso of the zzso zzso regulator zzso When tested on embryonic zzso neural stem cells and embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a significant increase of the production of zzso and a considerable reduction in zzso zzso Two other zzso potentially deleterious changes have been identified by zzso sequencing in individuals with intellectual zzso implicating zzso in normal brain zzso
