Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that possesses potent zzso activity in zzso The zzso gene encodes human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso domain 1 zzso zzso the zzso 51 zzso acid zzso of zzso in zzso has also been zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso therapeutic potential of zzso its two zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso First, these peptides were tested for activities against different clinically important zzso We found them to possess zzso zzso activities; specifically, most exhibited excellent in zzso activity against eight clinically important zzso strains tested, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso counterparts and zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso These findings also suggest that the mechanism of action of both zzso and zzso D1 for these zzso is different from that of zzso B or zzso zzso zzso Second, we examined the stability of these peptides in whole human saliva and human zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso D1 zzso at a lower rate than zzso In human serum, zzso D1 was also more stable than zzso both peptides were more stable in serum than in zzso Third, we examined the zzso of these peptides using human zzso and two human cell lines zzso and zzso No (or very zzso zzso activity was observed with any of the four zzso even at the highest protein concentration tested zzso zzso while zzso B caused zzso zzso at only zzso zzso The toxic effects of zzso and zzso D1 toward zzso and zzso cells were also much lower than that of zzso B as measured by zzso blue zzso Together, these findings indicate that the investigated peptides possess high zzso therapeutic potential, in particular for the treatment of drug-resistant zzso strains associated with zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso The same peptides could also be used as components of artificial saliva for patients with zzso zzso
