The African zzso zzso and the Oriental zzso zzso groups are closely related and composed of major malaria zzso in Africa and Southeast Asia, zzso None of the species of either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso group can be identified with absolute certainty using the adult zzso zzso present on the internal transcribed zzso 2 zzso of zzso DNA allowed the development of 10 zzso that combined with an universal forward primer lead to a simple and sensitive multiplex zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Moreover, the possible additional amplification of the entire zzso allows one to detect other zzso species in zzso with members of both groups not included in this zzso and serves as a control zzso This universal zzso method permits the discrimination of 10 species within the zzso zzso among which figure three major malaria zzso and constitutes a very efficient and powerful tool to improve our knowledge on these species distribution and zzso Not only restricted to zzso this zzso could also be developed and applied to other insect zzso
