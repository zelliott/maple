A genetic approach to define the role of zzso in zzso and pathological bone zzso is to identify spontaneous zzso in the zzso gene which alter zzso zzso zzso it is possible, though zzso zzso to alter genes zzso critical zzso acid sequences in the collagen zzso in a manner analogous to the successful development of animal models for osteogenesis zzso We have thus zzso this approach to alter the zzso gene to zzso zzso acid zzso in sequences around the known zzso zzso site zzso at positions zzso in type I zzso and zzso these genes into zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso at the zzso site and double zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in type I collagen resistant to zzso by zzso Furthermore, in normal zzso zzso with a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso resistance in which an additional zzso substitution at position zzso provided a marker for the zzso zzso zzso and wild type triple zzso molecules were zzso and zzso as zzso A single zzso alpha zzso chain did not prevent zzso of the wild type alpha zzso chain but it is likely that the zzso alpha zzso chain would prevent zzso of the triple zzso fragments containing the other zzso zzso Introduction of these genes into transgenic mice should result in abnormal zzso characterized by altered zzso tissue zzso
