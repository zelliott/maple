A simple and efficient method was developed for zzso of zzso sequences into zzso In this method, an zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Only the single strand of the zzso was zzso at the zzso end of the zzso and this resulted in the creation of a long zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso were used to transform zzso zzso This simple zzso and transformation reaction rendered approximately zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso zzso of white colonies per zzso DNA from the zzso and zzso zzso This number is almost the same or even higher than the number of blue colonies from the control reaction in which zzso was used without the zzso By this method we could mutate one zzso site to another or create zzso and zzso zzso very zzso Fidelity of this method was checked by restriction zzso DNA sequencing and zzso zzso By DNA sequencing, we observed that zzso of the white colonies contained a single zzso zzso
