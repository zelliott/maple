zzso type zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso 2 zzso zzso on zzso zzso To date, six loss of function zzso and one zzso zzso have been demonstrated in zzso zzso It remains to be determined how dysfunction of a zzso expressed zzso causes a zzso zzso An animal model for zzso would provide insights into the zzso of this zzso We have therefore characterized the mouse zzso of zzso by reconstructing the full-length zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso The 1932 zzso open reading frame zzso to 15 coding zzso spanning a zzso region of approximately 55 zzso on mouse zzso 9 as demonstrated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso A comparison between the mouse and human genes revealed a similar zzso structure, except for the number of alternatively spliced zzso in the zzso region, two in mouse and three in zzso In zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso showed that zzso was zzso expressed during zzso at zzso with some areas of enriched zzso At zzso zzso zzso was more abundant in the peripheral nervous system, including in zzso root zzso and spinal zzso
