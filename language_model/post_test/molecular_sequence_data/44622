The zzso zzso binding zzso zzso has been linked to zzso protein body formation in zzso To obtain further information on the possible role of this zzso in protein body formation we have cloned and zzso a zzso zzso zzso from rice zzso The rice sequence is very similar to the zzso zzso exhibiting zzso zzso identity and zzso deduced zzso acid sequence identity in the coding zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso exists between rice zzso and zzso zzso from several other plant and animal species including long stretches of conservation through the zzso zzso zzso zzso variation, however, is observed within the putative zzso zzso domain between the plant and zzso zzso zzso A single hand of approximately zzso zzso was visible when zzso gel blots of total zzso zzso from seed tissue were zzso with zzso rice zzso zzso This band increased in intensity during seed development up to 10 days after zzso and then decreased gradually until seed zzso zzso gel blots indicated that zzso zzso zzso parallels that of the zzso zzso throughout seed zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is localized in a zzso fashion in the zzso zzso membrane complex of developing zzso zzso It is abundant on the periphery of the protein inclusion body but not in the central portion of the protein body or in the zzso zzso zzso connecting the protein zzso These data support a model which proposes that zzso associates with the newly zzso zzso zzso to facilitate its folding and assembly into a protein inclusion body, and is then zzso
