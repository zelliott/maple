zzso zzso are plant zzso which zzso host tissue with an zzso zzso that forms zzso within living plant zzso To identify genes expressed during zzso growth, zzso sequencing was performed with a zzso zzso library from zzso zzso One thousand zzso zzso were generated, which assembled into zzso zzso Several of the most frequently represented sequences in the zzso database were identical to the in zzso induced genes zzso identified previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of in zzso rust genes isolated from a zzso zzso library, zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso zzso sequences were identified, providing evidence for two novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed many zzso that were significantly activated in zzso leaves compared to zzso zzso Very strong in zzso expression was found for two zzso zzso putative zzso Furthermore, several genes involved in zzso zzso and translation, zzso zzso acid zzso stress response, and zzso showed an increased expression in the zzso zzso These data indicate a strong shift in gene expression in rust zzso between zzso and the zzso stage of zzso
