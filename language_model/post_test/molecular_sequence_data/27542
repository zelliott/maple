Previously, zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was proposed as potential drug candidate for the treatment of zzso The present work is aimed to zzso zzso stability of zzso and to develop further stabilized zzso with zzso or higher biological zzso A stability study on zzso was carried out in solution state, and degradation mechanism was deduced by zzso and zzso acid zzso Three novel zzso derivatives were designed and chemically zzso on the basis of stability data, being subjected to zzso and pharmacological zzso zzso stability studies revealed the gradual degradation of zzso following zzso zzso Chemical modification of zzso mainly position at 24, resulted in marked improvement of stability, although the chemical modification had no influence on the secondary structure, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in rat lung zzso Novel derivatives also exhibited more potent zzso outgrowth in rat zzso zzso cells when compared to zzso and zzso possibly due to improved zzso zzso of zzso at position 24 might be responsible for degradation of zzso zzso and stability and chemical modification studies led us to the successful development of novel zzso derivatives with higher stability and biological zzso
