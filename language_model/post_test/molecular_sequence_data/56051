Two genes zzso and zzso zzso natural zzso resistance in the budding zzso zzso zzso have been cloned by expression in zzso zzso Both genes determine resistance to the zzso action of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso are present as single copies in zzso zzso where they map on zzso II and zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso contains an open reading frame of 321 zzso which is interrupted by an zzso of zzso zzso It encodes a zzso of 106 zzso acids of molecular mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of similarity to the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso from several zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso region of zzso possess zzso elements which are typical of zzso zzso protein zzso A single zzso acid change determines the resistance or sensitive zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso since replacement of zzso in zzso from zzso with zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may serve as a practical zzso cloning marker if integrated in a zzso zzso
