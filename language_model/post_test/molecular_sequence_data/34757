To investigate the expression status of 11 different zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tissue and adjacent normal zzso zzso taken from 35 zzso zzso patients were zzso for the expression of 11 different CT zzso genes by zzso zzso 

Of the 11 CT zzso genes zzso none of them was expressed in normal zzso zzso zzso was found to be the most frequently expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso followed, in the order of expression frequency, by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No expression of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Among the 35 cases, 28 zzso expressed at least one CT zzso zzso 21 zzso expressed more than 2 CT zzso zzso and 4 of the 21 zzso expressed more than 4 CT zzso which accounted for zzso of total number of patients zzso No CT zzso expression was found in the tumor tissue in 7 cases, including 5 cases in stage II and 1 case each in stage I and IV, zzso Of the 11 CT genes zzso expression of 5 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was correlated with tumor zzso zzso and zzso expression was found more frequently in early stage zzso With progression of the disease, the frequency of zzso of multiple CT zzso genes was significantly increased reaching zzso in stage III zzso 

Of the 11 different CT zzso genes examined by zzso in zzso zzso 8 genes were detected in various zzso in 28 of the 35 zzso cancer patients zzso They are candidate zzso zzso in the preparation of tumor vaccines for zzso in zzso cancer zzso
