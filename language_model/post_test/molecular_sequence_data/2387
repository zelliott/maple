Human zzso inhibitor zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso results from defective zzso of the inhibitor from the zzso The zzso gene exhibits two point zzso which specify zzso acid zzso zzso to Ala and zzso to zzso The functional importance of these zzso in zzso zzso was investigated by studying the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso genes altered by zzso zzso This model system correctly zzso the zzso zzso seen in individuals zzso for the zzso zzso and shows that the substitution of zzso for zzso alone causes defective zzso of zzso The substitution of zzso for zzso eliminates the possibility for a salt bridge between zzso zzso and zzso which may decrease the zzso stability of the zzso and thus account for the zzso zzso However, when we removed the potential to form a salt bridge from the zzso inhibitor by changing zzso to zzso zzso zzso was not reduced to the zzso of normal level seen for zzso in fact, zzso of normal zzso was zzso When the potential for salt bridge formation was returned to zzso by changing zzso to zzso only zzso of normal zzso was zzso These data indicate that the zzso acid substitution at position zzso rather than the potential to form the zzso salt bridge, is the critical zzso leading to the zzso in zzso zzso
