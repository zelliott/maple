Mass zzso methods were used to investigate the zzso processing and zzso structures of three seed defensive proteins from zzso zzso The proteins were the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso all of which are related to the seed zzso zzso and zzso The mass data showed that the zzso zzso required for zzso of the zzso zzso is followed by loss of the terminal zzso zzso in zzso and in all three zzso seven or more zzso were clipped from the zzso in the manner of the seed zzso In most instances, individual zzso could be assigned at each zzso site, due to the unique masses of the plant zzso It was found that zzso and zzso differed significantly in their zzso patterns, despite their high sequence zzso These data complement the previous X-ray studies of the zzso inhibitor and zzso where many of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso could not be zzso
