To gain an increased understanding of the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we studied the zzso distribution and zzso zzso of this zzso in wheat zzso zzso zzso A zzso for wheat zzso was isolated from an zzso library and the missing zzso end was amplified by anchored zzso chain zzso zzso transcripts were detected in zzso and zzso zzso with the highest levels occurring in developing zzso Wheat kernels were then dissected into zzso zzso zzso and zzso layer, and subjected to protein zzso zzso zzso was most abundant in the zzso Within the zzso the vast majority of zzso was zzso A much smaller amount of the zzso was associated with starch zzso zzso was not trapped within starch zzso and was absent from dry zzso zzso was also present in green zzso which suggests a role in the synthesis of both reserve and leaf zzso
