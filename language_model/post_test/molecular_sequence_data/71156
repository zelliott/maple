In contrast to many type II restriction zzso zzso proteins that cleave DNA at individual recognition sites 4-6 zzso long, the zzso zzso is a zzso protein that binds to two copies of an zzso sequence before cutting the DNA at both zzso The mode of action of the zzso zzso thus seems more appropriate for DNA zzso than for zzso To zzso its biological function, strains of zzso coli expressing the zzso zzso system were transformed with plasmids carrying zzso zzso The zzso system often failed to restrict the survival of a zzso with one zzso site, but plasmids with two or more sites were restricted zzso zzso containing zzso zzso sites were not zzso No zzso of the plasmids carrying zzso sites were detected among the zzso zzso provided the target DNA contains at least two recognition sites, zzso displays all of the hallmarks of a zzso system as opposed to a zzso system in zzso coli zzso The properties of the system in zzso match those of the zzso in zzso For both restriction in zzso and DNA zzso in zzso zzso operates best with two recognition sites on the same zzso
