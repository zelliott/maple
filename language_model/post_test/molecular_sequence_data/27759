zzso zzso was shown to have two zzso zzso genes linked in zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a cloned zzso zzso gene confirmed that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso although its zzso zzso is also similar in both primary sequence and predicted secondary structure to the zzso zzso of the zzso but also extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso Two clusters of zzso genes have also been cloned and zzso form zzso zzso The smaller zzso cloned in zzso is composed of zzso zzso and the larger zzso cloned in zzso is composed of zzso zzso The zzso zzso with the exception of the zzso translate abundant zzso in zzso zzso The zzso genes do not contain zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clusters of zzso genes have been zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso so that comparisons of zzso signals, gene organizations and primary sequences can be made and features possibly related to zzso zzso During evolution, a zzso zzso gene appears to have been incorporated into the cluster of zzso genes in the zzso but not in zzso zzso
