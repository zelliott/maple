Polar transport of the plant hormone zzso is regulated at the cellular level by zzso of zzso from a plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transport inhibitor zzso acid zzso to a regulatory site associated with the carrier has been zzso but the zzso zzso have not been zzso Experimental disparities between levels of zzso zzso binding and zzso transport zzso can be explained by the presence of a zzso binding site and in zzso zzso of zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso (AP) activities, zzso of zzso transport by artificial zzso zzso and zzso displacement of zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso suggest that PM zzso may be involved in both zzso zzso binding and zzso We report the zzso and molecular cloning of zzso PM zzso and associated proteins from zzso This is the first report of PM zzso in zzso PM proteins were zzso by gel zzso zzso exchange, and zzso affinity zzso monitored for zzso zzso Lower affinity zzso contained two zzso of zzso zzso involved in signal zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso and inhibitor sensitivities similar to their zzso zzso and have zzso and spatial expression patterns consistent with previous in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins suggest that the zzso interact with zzso cell surface and cell wall zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by single zzso In zzso translation products of zzso and zzso have zzso activities similar to those of native zzso
