The zzso role of the zzso zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso is zzso In zzso studies have shown that zzso promotes zzso of complementary DNA strands zzso et zzso zzso zzso negative zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso of protein zzso in an zzso zzso manner zzso et zzso zzso In this study, we examined the relationships among the binding of zzso to zzso DNA, its interaction with protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid as probe demonstrated that exposed zzso surfaces in zzso are responsible for interactions with protein zzso and zzso DNA, whereas the site of zzso activity has a zzso zzso The interactions of zzso with zzso DNA and with protein zzso are mutually exclusive events, suggesting that the zzso activity and the zzso activities of zzso may be competitive in zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso by zzso is independent of the binding of zzso to zzso DNA or protein zzso
