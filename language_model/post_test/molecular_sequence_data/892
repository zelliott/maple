zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which is associated with zzso zzso disease and gastric zzso It is urgent to discover novel drug targets for appropriate zzso agents against this human zzso In bacteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso the removal of a zzso group from the zzso of nascent zzso Due to its zzso and absence in zzso cells, zzso has been considered as an attractive target for the discovery of novel zzso In this work, a new zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso alignment shows that zzso zzso zzso zzso shares about zzso identity to zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso demonstrate its relatively high activity toward zzso with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso appears to be fully active at pH between zzso and zzso and temperature 50 degrees zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso is apparently higher than that of zzso zzso This present work thereby supplies a potential platform that zzso the discovery of novel zzso zzso and further of possible zzso agents against zzso zzso
