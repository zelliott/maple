zzso zzso have key roles in diverse regulatory zzso including control of zzso timing, cell zzso zzso cell zzso and organ zzso zzso regulate gene function through a process termed zzso interference zzso which is a highly zzso zzso mechanism that regulates zzso gene zzso zzso is triggered by zzso small interfering zzso zzso which can be processed from small hairpin zzso zzso generated from an expression zzso In some recently described zzso the zzso are expressed from synthetic zzso precursors of zzso zzso driven by zzso II zzso We have reported new zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso that take into consideration zzso processing and zzso zzso by placing the zzso artificial zzso expression zzso inside of synthetic zzso Like the original zzso zzso these zzso and zzso zzso can efficiently zzso the expression of their target zzso Moreover, the expression of a zzso fluorescent marker, zzso is substantially improved by this new zzso The new zzso can also be used to express natural zzso and label cells expressing these zzso These zzso zzso thus provide new tools for gene suppression and zzso zzso We describe in this chapter the protocols for selecting and cloning artificial and natural zzso (or zzso evaluating their efficiency in zzso gene zzso and also discuss the potential applications of these zzso
