zzso zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso agent of dental zzso and zzso to the tooth surface through the zzso A zzso cell zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso activity results in a marked reduction in the zzso potential of zzso zzso and the frequency of dental zzso zzso is a natural plant extract that was previously reported to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso has an zzso effect against zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso Western zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso induced the partial release of the zzso protein into the zzso The zzso mass of zzso zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso zzso which was not caused by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso might be important as a new agent to prevent zzso
