A novel member of the family of G zzso receptors has been isolated from a mouse brain zzso library by screening with zzso chain reaction zzso generated zzso of mouse zzso DNA amplified using zzso zzso zzso comparison demonstrates that the zzso protein sequence shows the highest zzso to the zzso family of zzso The pharmacological profile of zzso from zzso cells zzso with this zzso zzso to a new zzso zzso that we propose to call zzso Its major sites of expression are in the mouse zzso and heart, also with zzso expression in brain and zzso We speculate that it could account at least in part for the zzso functions attributed to the zzso zzso
