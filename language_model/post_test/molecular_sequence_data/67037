zzso zzso is a type II zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso domain and is predominantly expressed in zzso and zzso Here we report that zzso expression is closely associated with the appearance of zzso during chick development and is positively regulated by zzso zzso At stage 23, when zzso expression in the zzso has extended to the tail region, zzso was zzso in the anterior eight zzso At stage 25, zzso and zzso were both zzso in the regions adjacent to the zzso Double positive zzso for these genes were flanked by a zzso zzso single positive and a zzso zzso single positive zzso At stage 28, the expression profile of zzso in the zzso zzso displayed more distinct zzso features at different levels of the zzso At stage 32 and later, zzso and zzso showed similar expression profiles in developing zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in the significant zzso of zzso in cultured zzso but not in zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso by zzso into the zzso could not induce the generation of additional zzso but did result in the zzso of zzso expression in the zzso at stage 33 and zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a late marker of zzso formation and that zzso positively regulates zzso expression in a zzso cell zzso zzso
