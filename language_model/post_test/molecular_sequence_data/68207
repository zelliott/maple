A bovine zzso DNA library was surveyed with respect to the template activity for zzso DNA synthesis by calf zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso About zzso of the zzso DNA clones contained distinct initiation sites consisting of zzso clusters of zzso zzso The initiation sites were located at or near the zzso of the zzso zzso One of these zzso containing a zzso zzso cluster with major initiation sites, was analyzed in zzso By the successive zzso of zzso in the cluster with zzso zzso in the zzso to 3' direction, the minimum length of the initiation sequence was estimated to be as long as the zzso In contrast, when one or three zzso at the zzso of the cluster were replaced with zzso the zzso activity was largely lost, indicating that these zzso zzso were indispensable for zzso Furthermore, base zzso of upstream or downstream sequences outside the zzso cluster also decreased the total zzso zzso Interestingly, the base zzso inside or outside of the zzso cluster sometimes caused a shift in the major zzso zzso These results indicate that the minimum zzso unit of the zzso template for zzso DNA synthesis consists of a zzso cluster zzso with one zzso at its zzso and that both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso by enhancing the zzso frequency and/or slightly shifting the sites of initiation of primer zzso It was also revealed that the lengths of the product zzso zzso became shorter as the length of zzso cluster was shortened by substitution with zzso The gel zzso zzso further showed that the complex formation between DNA zzso zzso and the DNA templates was strongly in competition with zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso Furthermore, template activities as well as the zzso contents of a series of zzso DNA correlated well with their affinities to the zzso as measured by both gel zzso zzso and their zzso values for the zzso zzso Apparently, DNA zzso zzso primarily recognizes the minimum zzso unit consisting of a zzso cluster with a zzso at the zzso of zzso but the initiation of primer zzso synthesis can be modified by zzso zzso outside of the minimum zzso zzso
