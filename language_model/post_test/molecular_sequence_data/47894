Analysis of 600 zzso of sequence encompassing the zzso zzso zzso gene on human zzso 22 revealed zzso zzso within zzso resulting in three active zzso zzso two zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso The zzso sequence of zzso shows a remarkable similarity to that of zzso The zzso sequence comparison of zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso identity between the zzso which were most similar to the zzso Finger zzso gene from human zzso zzso The sense zzso transcripts zzso proteins with the zzso structure, composed of zzso finger, zzso and zzso zzso which are characteristic of the zzso zzso Each of these zzso are thought to mediate zzso interactions by promoting zzso or zzso The zzso gene on zzso is also a member of the zzso family and is zzso in zzso syndrome zzso The zzso dominant form of zzso shows linkage to zzso We detected a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso of the population, which was not associated with the zzso zzso We identified zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes cover substantial portions of their sense counterparts, which suggests that the function of zzso and zzso is a zzso regulation of the sense zzso zzso We illustrate the role of zzso zzso in the generation of zzso zzso which were created by a series of zzso and share an zzso with the zzso domain containing genes from the major zzso complex region on human zzso zzso
