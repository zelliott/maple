Several receptors for the zzso zzso protein collagen have been described which belong to the zzso of receptors collectively known as zzso Although several zzso have been shown to interact with zzso zzso molecules via a common recognition site, zzso Acid zzso within the beta 1 zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso 5 beta 1) has been convincingly shown to interact with zzso In the present study, we tested whether a collagen zzso could interact with zzso zzso of an zzso cell line, zzso to immobilized collagen I was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso (where zzso indicates that zzso zzso in zzso and not by the linear zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, using zzso affinity zzso a zzso protein could be specifically zzso from the column by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso material with zzso zzso showed zzso with the collagen zzso alpha 2 beta 1 and not alpha 3 beta zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso peptides can interact with the collagen zzso and the differences seen with the linear and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso has a higher zzso for the zzso than the more flexible linear zzso In this paper, we provide supportive evidence that one possible mode of collagen interaction with alpha 2 beta 1 is via the zzso recognition zzso
