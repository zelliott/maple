A genetic screen designed to identify proteins that zzso the signal recognition particle zzso for targeting in zzso coli was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso Six plasmids were identified in this screen, and each is predicted to zzso one or more putative zzso membrane zzso zzso One of these, zzso has three open reading frames zzso two of which have no similarity to known proteins in zzso other than sequences from the closely related zzso zzso Further analyses showed that one of these, zzso encodes a protein that is dependent on the zzso for zzso This gene also appears to be essential in zzso zzso since it was not possible to generate zzso zzso in the zzso Although appearing unique to zzso at the DNA sequence level, zzso was found to share some features with the cell division gene zzso of zzso zzso These features included similar zzso locations (with respect to linked zzso as well as similarities in the predicted protein domain zzso Here, we show that zzso can complement an zzso coli conditional zzso zzso and therefore encodes a functional zzso zzso in zzso zzso This observation is significant in that it is the first zzso zzso identified in a zzso zzso Also interesting is that this is the fourth cell division protein (the others are zzso zzso and zzso shown to zzso the zzso for zzso which may in part explain why the genes zzso the three zzso components are essential in zzso
