In this paper, zzso correlation zzso zzso is used for investigation of homogeneous immune reaction using synthetic zzso as zzso The binding process of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso was systematically zzso The zzso constant and zzso rate for zzso complex were determined, which were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Under optimal conditions, the detection limit of the competitive zzso was 4 zzso zzso zzso The good zzso were obtained with human serum zzso Our preliminary results demonstrated that the homogeneous competitive zzso based on zzso is simple, zzso sensitive and small sample and zzso requirement, and this method maybe possess great potential applications in clinical diagnosis, food and environmental analyses and biological and biomedical zzso
