An essential component of the zzso life cycle involves zzso in the zzso of an infected zzso The site of zzso integration has the potential to disrupt a gene and zzso a normal cellular zzso To begin to address whether disease zzso may correlate with the site of zzso zzso cellular sequences at these zzso integrated regions were directly amplified from peripheral blood zzso cells DNA from a broad range of infected individuals using an inverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso regions were zzso and examined for similarity to the zzso acid zzso In this group of analyzed samples, the zzso zzso was inserted within zzso regions throughout the zzso of the infected host, in which zzso sites were positioned in close proximity to different zzso repetitive elements while zzso sites were located within zzso zzso zzso were also detected at sites without a specific gene designation but not within short tandem repetitive zzso zzso or zzso repeat zzso Altogether, it is expected that this approach will yield new information on sites of integration by zzso that may be associated with the zzso manifestations of disease zzso
