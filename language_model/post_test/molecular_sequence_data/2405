zzso E zzso is the zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso of numerous zzso hormones and zzso This zzso has been previously zzso to zzso from bovine zzso and zzso clones zzso zzso isolated from a bovine zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso full-length rat zzso has been isolated and zzso Both the zzso and zzso acid sequences of rat zzso show substantial zzso with the bovine zzso The bovine and rat zzso sequences are zzso within the entire coding region, as well as within several portions of the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of rat zzso is greater than zzso zzso with the bovine zzso Northern zzso analyses indicate a single species of zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso in length to be present in many neural and zzso zzso High levels of zzso zzso are present in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and cerebral zzso and moderate levels are present in the brain zzso zzso heart, zzso and zzso Low levels are detected in zzso and zzso but not in liver or zzso This zzso expression of zzso zzso is consistent with the proposed role for this zzso in the production of numerous zzso hormones and zzso
