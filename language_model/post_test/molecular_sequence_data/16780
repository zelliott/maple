The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the essential gene zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family in the zzso zzso We examined zzso in the zzso zzso cells to investigate the mechanism of its zzso in the zzso At the zzso temperature, most zzso was found in the zzso zzso of zzso cells, which have defective zzso and in the zzso of zzso cells, which have defective zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso that is exposed to the zzso binds to zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives that have lost a cluster of zzso in the vicinity of the zzso domain had reduced binding activity to zzso and the zzso with this sequence was delivered to the zzso Our results indicate that zzso escapes from delivery to the zzso by recycling to the zzso zzso and retrieval requires the zzso zzso tail that can bind to the zzso zzso
