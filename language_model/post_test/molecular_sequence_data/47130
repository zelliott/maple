The analysis of mirror type internal symmetry distribution in primary structures of different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso domain clusters determining zzso zzso in zzso a highly conservative region of zzso zzso forming both zzso and regulatory zzso of zzso zzso and the functionally important regions in variable parts of their molecules (in particular, zzso binding zzso are shown to have symmetrical zzso These data are in conformity with a hypothesis put forward by the zzso the zzso of internal symmetry may commonly either coincide with sites responsible for protein biological activity, or be spaced in the immediate vicinity of these zzso In different types of zzso zzso long repeating sequences were zzso The zzso structures were established for some zzso zzso The regions containing repeats usually displayed a symmetrical structure which confirms a positive correlation between internal symmetry of zzso acid sequence and its repeat zzso
