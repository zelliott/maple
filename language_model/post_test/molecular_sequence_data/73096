The promoter regions of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from Chinese cabbage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso sequences of their promoter regions were compared with that of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso High zzso sequence zzso were observed among these three genes in the region between 210 zzso upstream and the putative zzso start zzso A sequence motif zzso which is similar to that of the zzso core motif zzso of two tomato zzso zzso zzso and zzso was present in these two cloned zzso To determine regulatory sequences responsible for the zzso expression of the gene zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso and zzso zzso + zzso containing different lengths of the promoter fused with the zzso zzso were constructed and introduced into tobacco plants by zzso zzso The result showed that the zzso zzso zzso + zzso of the zzso promoter region was sufficient for the zzso expression of the zzso zzso The zzso expression in a tobacco plants transformed with these zzso was first detected in zzso zzso and persisted at in zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression level was increased during zzso development, reaching the highest level in mature zzso
