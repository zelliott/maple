zzso of the zzso locus and its zzso at the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required for the zzso expression of the zzso structural zzso We carried out a deletion analysis of zzso gene zzso to zzso the functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso domain of zzso is contained in zzso zzso that zzso zzso constitute a functional core region including the zzso zzso that zzso zzso are required to inhibit the zzso function of zzso and that the rest of the zzso region of the protein contains a zzso domain that acts to relieve the zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso overproduction of zzso does not overcome the negative regulation of zzso gene expression in the absence of zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso is not involved in the negative regulation of the zzso A model for zzso zzso of the zzso is zzso
