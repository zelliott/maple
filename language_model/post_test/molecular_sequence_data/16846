Chemical zzso of the mouse is ongoing in several centers around the world, with varying estimates of zzso rate and number of sites zzso to zzso To address these questions, we zzso approximately zzso zzso of DNA from zzso progeny of zzso mice in a large, zzso zzso We identified 10 zzso at eight unique sites, including six zzso coding zzso This zzso the zzso zzso rate for two zzso centers, implies significance criteria for zzso cloning efforts, and provides working estimates of effective genetic target sizes for selected zzso
