The question of multiple sequence alignment quality has received much attention from developers of alignment zzso Less forthcoming, however, are practical measures for zzso alignment reliability in real life zzso Here, we present a method to identify and zzso uncertainties in multiple sequence zzso The proposed method is based upon the observation that under any objective function or evolutionary model, some portions of reconstructed alignments are uniquely zzso while other parts constitute an arbitrary choice from a set of zzso zzso The zzso portions of reconstructed alignments are, thus, at most half as reliable as the uniquely optimal zzso For zzso zzso this zzso uncertainty can be zzso by the comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso which form the zzso envelope for the two zzso We extend this approach for the case of progressive multiple sequence alignment by forming a large set of equally likely zzso alignments that zzso the zzso zzso This set can, then, be used to derive a series of local reliability measures for any candidate zzso The resulting reliability measures can be used as zzso and zzso of alignment zzso We report a simulation study that demonstrates the superior power of the proposed local reliability zzso
