We describe the isolation of a new type of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of five zzso and four zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The zzso protein has seven zzso zzso The zzso domain shows zzso identity overall to that of zzso coli zzso DNA zzso and is most closely related to Homo sapiens zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso protein is unique and the longest known among members of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso protein has DNA zzso activity and that the zzso region is zzso for this zzso The zzso zzso accumulates in zzso and is expressed at high levels in early zzso We show for the first time that the expression of a zzso zzso is zzso regulated in zzso These data suggest that the DNA zzso activity of zzso might be involved in the DNA metabolism of early zzso
