zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are blue zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso of an array of aromatic zzso zzso with the reduction of molecular oxygen to zzso Most of the known zzso have zzso or plant origins, although few zzso have been also identified in bacteria and zzso Most of the zzso zzso reported thus far are zzso zzso whereas only few zzso from zzso bodies have been described so zzso Multiple zzso of zzso are usually zzso by each fungus depending on species and environmental zzso As a fact, a zzso gene family has been demonstrated in the zzso fungus zzso zzso This work allowed identification and characterization of the first zzso zzso from the zzso body of zzso zzso Discovery through mass zzso of zzso proves the expression of a functional protein by the related deduced zzso zzso The zzso of zzso tree of zzso zzso proves that zzso falls in cluster with the members of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although zzso deduced zzso structure differs from that of the zzso members and the related locus is located in a different zzso zzso show that the evolutionary pattern of zzso and that of the other zzso zzso genes may have evolved zzso possibly through zzso zzso The reported data add a new piece to the knowledge about zzso zzso zzso zzso family and shed light on the zzso played by individual zzso zzso in zzso zzso
