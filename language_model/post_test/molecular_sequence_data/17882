By directed zzso of the cloned zzso coli zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso forming an essential zzso complex with zzso zzso was converted to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to facilitate zzso of the reduced zzso was converted to zzso zzso Both zzso genes were placed in the same zzso zzso where each of them came under the control of a strong zzso zzso This was designed to achieve equal zzso of both genes in the same zzso coli zzso The parental zzso show no zzso or very little zzso activity as zzso zzso The formation in zzso of zzso carrying one crippled and one fully functional active site, was detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and by active site zzso The fractional distribution of zzso and zzso was in zzso with that expected for a random association of zzso zzso In a zzso the zzso zzso leads to a big fall in the value of zzso for zzso which binds some zzso zzso from the point of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, zzso zzso However, the one active site in the zzso zzso exhibited kinetic parameters similar to those of the zzso zzso Thus, the effect of the zzso zzso must be retained within the active site that zzso it and is not transmitted through the protein to the second active site across the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
