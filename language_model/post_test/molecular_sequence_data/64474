zzso A zzso zzso fragments corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso named zzso for their zzso effects on vascular tension, have been zzso as important zzso regulators of the cardiovascular zzso We have used an in zzso isolated working zzso zzso zzso heart as a zzso to study the effects of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso synthetic zzso on cardiac zzso Under zzso conditions, the zzso zzso of the two peptides exhibited a significant negative zzso This zzso response was unaffected by zzso with either zzso zzso or two zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or the soluble zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso indicating an zzso zzso zzso zzso The negative zzso was also unaffected by either zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso or G proteins zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, it was dependent from both zzso zzso and zzso channels, since it was abolished by zzso to either the zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, the findings that zzso exert an zzso zzso on zzso cardiac performance and zzso as previously reported, the zzso positive zzso strongly support a zzso role for these zzso
