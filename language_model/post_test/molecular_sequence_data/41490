Alternative zzso of zzso greatly contributes to diversity in products generated from a single zzso However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly zzso In the present study, we describe zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso secondary zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso secondary structure causes zzso hindrance to enforce mutual zzso zzso while zzso zzso pairing largely functions through a zzso zzso Moreover, mutually exclusive zzso may be regulated by zzso pairing competition between zzso and zzso zzso the resulting dynamic zzso architecture largely controls mutually exclusive zzso although zzso regulatory sequences may fine-tune this zzso Our results emphasize the importance of dynamic zzso architecture in alternative zzso
