The role of various zzso in the zzso structural elements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been studied by zzso zzso Replacement of zzso of the zzso zzso by Ala or zzso significantly decreased the zzso value for the zzso zzso but only by a factor of 15 and had little effect on the other zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the same loop and of zzso of the zzso zzso yielded very unstable zzso However, the zzso zzso could be zzso as a fusion protein with zzso that exhibited decreased rates of zzso by the zzso zzso and various zzso Similar fusion proteins obtained with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were unstable and their zzso and zzso properties were very strongly zzso In zzso zzso the presence of the zzso influenced the zzso values, which suggested a zzso zzso more complex than a simple partition of the zzso between zzso and zzso These results are compared with those obtained with two other zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso
