zzso acid zzso zzso is an intrinsic membrane protein that zzso the synthesis of zzso acid zzso from zzso acid zzso It is well known that zzso is involved in zzso zzso while its role in zzso progression has been of emerging interest in the last few zzso To date, seven members of the zzso gene family have been found in zzso Here we report a novel zzso member, designated as zzso which was zzso base pairs in length and contained an open reading frame zzso zzso 434 zzso zzso The zzso gene consisted of 12 zzso and 11 zzso and mapped to zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in 18 human zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso fusion protein revealed that zzso was distributed primarily in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso of zzso can induce zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso on zzso in zzso zzso
