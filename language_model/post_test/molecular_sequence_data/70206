The action of zzso on the induction of the two milk protein genes zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso is delayed and appears to be zzso The response requires a zzso of cells with zzso is restricted to zzso zzso cells and is dependent on zzso sequences localized in the promoter region of the two zzso We have searched for zzso zzso zzso binding sites in these hormone response zzso In zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed with a zzso preparation of the zzso from rat zzso The sequences between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso of mouse zzso and rat zzso gene promoter, respectively, were found to contain multiple sites which were protected from the attack of zzso by the zzso zzso The sites comprise sequence motifs related to the delayed secondary zzso response elements described zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1991), which represent half sites of classical zzso binding zzso In the zzso gene promoter, the motifs are arranged head to tail with irregular zzso The zzso binding sites are in close proximity or even overlap with the zzso sites for candidate factors involved in zzso cell specific gene zzso The results suggest a direct zzso between zzso and zzso cell specific zzso factors in zzso the expression of milk protein zzso
