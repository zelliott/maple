A genetic approach has been exploited to investigate zzso salvage pathways in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Using a new zzso zzso zzso designed to facilitate the rescue of zzso zzso even when multiple plasmids integrate as a tandem zzso 15 independent zzso lines resistant to the toxic zzso analog zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso two-thirds of these clones lack zzso zzso zzso zzso Parallel studies identified an expressed sequence tag zzso exhibiting a small region of weak similarity to human zzso and this locus was zzso in several zzso zzso zzso Library screening yielded full-length zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso AK gene contains five zzso spanning a approximately 3 zzso zzso and the predicted coding sequence was employed to identify additional AK genes and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso construct lacking essential coding sequence was used to create defined genetic zzso at the zzso zzso AK zzso and AK activity was restored using a zzso zzso zzso analysis of DNA from 13 zzso zzso zzso reveals three distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso at the AK zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso at the AK zzso suggesting the possibility that another locus may be involved in regulating AK zzso and zzso zzso with normal AK activity zzso transport zzso
