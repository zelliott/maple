We used Random zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso to address issues of zzso in two zzso zzso zzso artifacts of zzso markers were controlled by assessing zzso patterns relative to the zzso patterns generated by quantitative zzso of DNA from putative parents zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso for which the mating histories of both males and females were unknown, we found strong evidence for complete zzso success for the contact guarding zzso In the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we detected and zzso mixed zzso in zzso produced offspring zzso and demonstrated that zzso success is correlated with the duration of zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is suitable to address issues of zzso in systems which are genetically zzso and produce large offspring zzso
