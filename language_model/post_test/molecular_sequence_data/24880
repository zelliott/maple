zzso type 2 zzso imports its DNA zzso through the nuclear pore complex zzso of cells in zzso for viral zzso Here we identify the zzso protein zzso as a zzso site for incoming zzso zzso zzso to CAN is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso to free their DNA for zzso This process requires binding of nuclear zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and involves zzso factors, restricting this irreversible process to the proximity of the zzso Our results provide a molecular mechanism for zzso of zzso and reveal an unexpected function of zzso zzso in zzso DNA zzso
