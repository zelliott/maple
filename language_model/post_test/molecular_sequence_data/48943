zzso zzso snakes inhabit the southwestern islands of zzso A zzso zzso zzso named zzso was isolated from Okinawa zzso zzso zzso and its zzso acid sequence was determined from both protein and zzso zzso was unable to induce zzso In contrast, zzso a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso which is different at only three positions from zzso is known to induce zzso A new zzso named zzso which is similar to zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are identical in the zzso half but have one to four zzso acid zzso in the zzso and its zzso Such zzso sequence zzso among them are due to isolation in the different environments over 1 to 2 million years and appear to have been brought about by natural selection for point zzso in their zzso Otherwise, a major zzso named zzso zzso exists in the zzso of zzso zzso snakes from the three islands with one to three synonymous zzso in their zzso It is assumed that the zzso gene is a zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and has hardly undergone zzso zzso as a principal toxic zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso acid sequences revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso are clearly separated into three groups, zzso type, basic zzso type, and zzso zzso Basic zzso zzso may manifest their own particular toxic functions different from those of the zzso of the zzso type and zzso zzso
