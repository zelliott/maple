zzso human zzso I zzso I) is an important clinical agent that is zzso into the airways where it degrades DNA to lower molecular weight fragments, thus reducing the zzso of zzso and improving the lung function of zzso zzso zzso To investigate zzso with potentially improved properties, we constructed a molecular fusion of human zzso I with the hinge and zzso region of human zzso heavy chain, creating a zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso of zzso insect cells with zzso zzso resulted in the expression and zzso of the zzso zzso fusion zzso The fusion protein was zzso from the culture medium using protein A affinity zzso followed by zzso by gel zzso and was characterized by zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso and activity zzso The zzso fusion contains zzso I, as determined by a zzso I zzso and an zzso zzso and an intact zzso zzso region, which was zzso by an zzso zzso in a zzso zzso ratio, zzso The zzso zzso zzso fusion was functionally active in zzso DNA zzso zzso albeit about zzso less than zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fusion by zzso resulted in a specific activity comparable to the zzso zzso Salt was zzso for wild type zzso zzso I but actually enhanced the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein was also less zzso than zzso I zzso These results are consistent with a higher affinity of the zzso fusion protein to DNA than zzso zzso zzso The engineered zzso zzso fusion protein described zzso has properties that may have clinical zzso
