The events leading to blood zzso in zzso insects are not well understood at the molecular zzso Here we report on the characterization of a zzso gene from the black fly zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso zzso contains at least two zzso zzso zzso extension experiments identified two closely spaced zzso initiation sites, 3 zzso zzso A zzso clone containing the zzso gene was restriction mapped and the zzso sequence of the zzso region was zzso Several sequence elements were identified, including a consensus zzso box 35 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation site, a consensus zzso zzso site at position zzso and two zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The latter two elements are present at comparable distances from the zzso initiation sites in black fly and zzso zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso zzso were detected in guts of zzso zzso Upon blood zzso zzso zzso levels gradually increased to reach twice the initial abundance at 8 zzso after blood zzso In contrast to other zzso insects, the induced zzso level persists for a prolonged period of time (at least 48 zzso after blood zzso The results of this study provide information that may be useful for the expression of zzso in insects of medical zzso
