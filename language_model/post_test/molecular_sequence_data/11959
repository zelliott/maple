We have used a zzso zzso system to show that human zzso zzso proteins can form zzso complexes in zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain is critical for this activity although zzso sequences also contribute to zzso Our experiments also reveal that zzso possesses an intrinsic zzso zzso activity in zzso which resides in the zzso zzso of the zzso
