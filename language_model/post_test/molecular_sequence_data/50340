We have inserted a zzso snake zzso into the zzso end of zzso coli alkaline zzso between zzso zzso and zzso of the mature zzso For this purpose, we have designed a cloning and expression zzso which allows zzso of foreign DNA between the corresponding zzso and visual selection of the desired zzso clones upon recovery of zzso zzso The hybrid protein is exported to the bacterial zzso the alkaline zzso signal zzso is correctly zzso and both zzso are functionally zzso The zzso domain displays zzso activity, and the inserted toxin is able to bind to its biological target, the zzso zzso zzso The hybrid zzso is remarkably stable and resistant to zzso Crude zzso extract containing the hybrid can be used as a zzso zzso in competitive zzso and zzso zzso We propose to use the system described in this paper for fast preparation of properly folded zzso zzso zzso
