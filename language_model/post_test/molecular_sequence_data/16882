zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein not normally expressed in healthy zzso but highly induced during acute zzso While zzso has been shown to be zzso and zzso in zzso its definitive biological function in zzso is not zzso 

To zzso the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting all three zzso of zzso were administered via zzso injections (5 zzso zzso day, 2 zzso to rats prior to induction of zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were zzso Administration of zzso but not the scrambled zzso zzso control, reduced zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso I, II, and III, respectively, compared to zzso controls zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly worsened zzso serum zzso activity, zzso wet weight zzso zzso and serum zzso protein levels all increased in zzso animals compared to zzso controls (by zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso zzso evaluation of zzso revealed worsened zzso elevated zzso zzso and fat necrosis after zzso zzso Gene expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso isolated from zzso rats compared to zzso zzso 

This is the first in zzso evidence indicating that zzso mediates significant protection against pancreatic zzso Our data suggest that zzso may exert its protective function by suppressing local pancreatic as well as systemic inflammation during acute zzso
