We report here the second evidence of zzso of zzso which was found inserted into the zzso gene of a patient, causing zzso muscular zzso zzso When the zzso was used to amplify a region of the zzso gene encompassing zzso 44 from zzso DNA of two Japanese brothers with zzso it was found to be approximately 600 zzso larger than zzso Both the normal and the zzso large products were amplified from the DNA of their zzso However, the maternal grandparents did not have the abnormal zzso and the zzso must therefore have occurred in the zzso Analysis of zzso sequence of the amplified product from a patient disclosed that the zzso was present zero to two bases upstream from the 3' end of zzso 44 and that two to four bases of the zzso sequence were deleted from the zzso zzso The zzso sequence was found to be composed of zzso zzso and to be almost identical to the inverse complement of 3' portion of the zzso zzso consensus zzso The zzso gene transcript from peripheral zzso of one of the patients was analyzed by using reverse zzso zzso The size of the amplified product encompassing zzso 42 to 46 was smaller than zzso zzso of the amplified product disclosed that the sequence of zzso 43 was directly joined to that of zzso zzso zzso 44 of the transcript was thus shown to be skipped during zzso This novel zzso of the zzso gene has important implications regarding zzso of an active zzso element and provides a new insight into the origins of zzso in the zzso zzso
