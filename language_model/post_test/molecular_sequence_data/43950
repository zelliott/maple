To address the origin of the zzso zzso we isolated and zzso the complementary DNA and partial gene that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso a sister group of the zzso and zzso but one that evolved before the zzso This is the first report of any zzso member zzso from an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene results in a zzso zzso that is zzso zzso The gene contains 3 zzso that zzso a signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso has 59% identity with human zzso whereas the deduced zzso acids of zzso zzso have zzso identity with the zzso human, and salmon zzso zzso Another complementary DNA clone zzso was isolated and shown to contain 4 zzso that zzso a signal zzso a cryptic zzso and two peptides that are clearly members of the zzso zzso One of the peptides has zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso A comparison of the two structurally related zzso zzso each zzso two peptides on separate zzso shows high zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis suggests that an zzso zzso followed by a gene zzso was responsible for the origin of the two zzso It is argued that the zzso gene is derived from the zzso ancestral genes that led to the zzso forms of zzso and zzso
