The plant zzso family of protein zzso and their interacting zzso the zzso family of zzso zzso function together in decoding calcium signals zzso by different environmental zzso zzso is activated by zzso and subsequently zzso the zzso zzso zzso to bring about cellular zzso zzso under salt zzso In addition to possessing the zzso activity, members of the zzso family of protein zzso can bind to protein zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso complex of zzso with the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso resolves central questions regarding the dual function of zzso as a zzso and a zzso zzso A comparison with the structure of zzso zzso reveals the basis of the molecular function of this family of zzso and their interacting calcium zzso Furthermore, our study suggests that the structure of the zzso domain of zzso defines a scaffold module zzso from zzso to zzso
