Two zzso clones ( zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso each zzso a zzso DNA zzso zzso were isolated from rice ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso with 12 zzso and 11 zzso while zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso with 11 zzso and 10 zzso Although zzso and zzso have high sequence similarity overall, they share only zzso identity in zzso 1, and zzso 3 of zzso is absent from zzso As for other zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso class, the derived zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso suggest that they are comprised of two-thirds regulatory domain and one-third zzso zzso Most functional zzso identified for other zzso were present in the rice zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison indicated high similarity zzso zzso of rice zzso proteins to other plant zzso sequences but limited similarity zzso zzso zzso to animal zzso zzso zzso zzso and database analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of zzso (on zzso 3) and single copy of zzso (on zzso zzso zzso protection zzso revealed expression of both zzso and zzso in highly dividing cells, but the zzso level of zzso was 7- to zzso higher than that for zzso in zzso root and zzso The functional involvement of the rice DNA zzso in gene zzso was investigated using an zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso of either the zzso or zzso regions of zzso were zzso into zzso derived from a rice line bearing a silenced zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression in the bombarded zzso was consistent with the zzso of maintenance zzso and with previous evidence for the involvement of zzso in zzso of this zzso
