zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso is the most important pathogen causing zzso zzso The role of bacterial proteins contributing to zzso in zzso infections has not yet been clearly determined, but the C protein complex has been suggested to be involved in both zzso and protective zzso The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of zzso strains bearing the gene zzso for the beta zzso of the C protein among clinical zzso from 68 zzso with zzso 45 newborns zzso without clinical signs of infection, and 50 zzso from pregnant zzso The prevalence of the beta zzso gene in all three groups was low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the differences between groups were not statistically zzso Clinical characteristics and zzso plasma levels did not differ between septic patients with beta zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was not found among zzso III zzso which accounted for roughly half of all the strains zzso Thus, zzso chain reaction zzso analysis based on the beta zzso gene seems not helpful for distinguishing invasive from colonizing zzso zzso A vaccine based on zzso zzso from the beta zzso of the C protein would most probably not provide protection against the majority of zzso zzso When analyzing the zzso products of the C protein beta zzso gene by DNA sequencing, a genetic zzso was observed, revealing small repetitive genetic elements within the amplified fragment, an observation that should be studied zzso
