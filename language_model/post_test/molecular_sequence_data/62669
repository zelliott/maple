The gastrointestinal zzso tract is exposed to a wide range of zzso The expression of zzso peptides has been demonstrated in different regions of the zzso zzso predominantly in zzso cells, which represent the first host cells with which the zzso have to interact for zzso The zzso zzso zzso is complex, consisting of different cell types, and most have a limited zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been studied the most and are expressed by distinct types of zzso zzso Enteric zzso expression is normally restricted to zzso and intermediate cells in the small zzso However, there are important differences between mice and humans in the processing of the precursor forms of enteric zzso zzso infection zzso an increase in the number of enteric zzso zzso and intermediate cells in the zzso small zzso In the chronically inflamed zzso zzso zzso zzso cells (which are absent in the normal zzso also express enteric zzso zzso expression of zzso may be zzso or zzso by infectious and inflammatory zzso The production of some members of the zzso family appears to be restricted to distinct parts of the zzso zzso Recent studies using genetically manipulated zzso have demonstrated the likely in zzso importance of enteric zzso peptides in innate host defense against zzso The ability of these peptides to act as zzso for cells of the zzso and zzso system may also play an important role in perpetuating chronic inflammation in the zzso zzso
