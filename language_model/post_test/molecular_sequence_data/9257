In the model, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene cluster zzso which encodes an zzso transport system, was induced under conditions of carbon limitation and its zzso impaired the zzso of zzso Thus, this gene cluster encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso regulator, was expressed under carbon limitation and at higher levels in the absence than in the presence of combined zzso with a positive effect of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso was expressed from two putative zzso start sites located zzso and 64 zzso upstream from the gene zzso The latter was induced under carbon limitation and was dependent on positive zzso by zzso zzso was required for the induction of the zzso zzso zzso thus representing a zzso regulator of zzso zzso These results show a novel mode of zzso by C and N availability through the concerted action of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
