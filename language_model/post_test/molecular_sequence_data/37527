zzso and zzso studies have demonstrated that gap junctions connect diverse types of zzso in the central nervous system, permitting direct electrical and zzso zzso A member of gap junction channel zzso zzso zzso is zzso for the location of zzso communication in the zzso zzso where gap junction networks of major classes of zzso are zzso We present an analysis of the expression and zzso of zzso protein in adult zzso rat zzso using a newly generated zzso zzso against a sequence in the predicted zzso loop of the zzso zzso acid zzso deduced from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso recognizing a single zzso zzso consistently labeled discrete zzso of zzso structures likely to be associated with gap junctions in the inner zzso layer, and also zzso within zzso and zzso of retinal zzso and zzso cells, following examination with various fixation protocols and double labeling zzso These results provide that prominent zzso communication appears in mature zzso zzso such as retinal zzso cells, in addition to zzso zzso cells, zzso by gap junctions in the adult zzso
