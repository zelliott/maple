A circular zzso called zzso with a zzso size of zzso zzso was identified in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using cloned plasmids revealed no DNA sequence similarity between the zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso The complete sequence of the zzso was determined, and the sequence analysis revealed that it contained a single long open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicated that the derived zzso acid sequence of the zzso exhibited similarity to the reverse zzso of the circular zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the linear zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the regions of zzso all of the seven zzso zzso acid blocks characteristic of zzso could be zzso
