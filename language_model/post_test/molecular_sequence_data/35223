zzso zzso zzso is present in most organisms and might be involved in zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso level is controlled by a specific zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins are present in all zzso of life and act on various zzso zzso 

Using zzso mass zzso and zzso analysis, we identified the key structural zzso of the high specificity and zzso efficiency of zzso zzso 

zzso binding requires three zzso zzso while the zzso mechanism relies on an unusual zzso zzso By zzso of the zzso zzso in the active site, we found that zzso should interact with the zzso part of the zzso zzso thus playing a key role in zzso recognition and zzso Sea zzso and zzso zzso zzso which retain the corresponding zzso zzso are also specific zzso Surprisingly, the whole zzso region containing the zzso gene is lost in zzso 

The specificity for zzso is linked to a stacking interaction between the zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso The latter likely plays a key role in the secondary acquisition of zzso activity in early zzso zzso zzso in the lineage leading from zzso to zzso 

We show that zzso activity is not restricted to zzso as previously thought but is an acquisition of early zzso This, and the identification of critically important zzso allows us to draw an evolutionary perspective of the zzso family of zzso
