zzso is an essential zzso zzso editing accessory factor that acts specifically on zzso zzso To understand the mechanism of zzso action, we undertook an in-depth analysis of edited zzso populations in zzso zzso cells and an in zzso examination of the zzso activities of the zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso more severely impacts editing at the zzso ends of zzso zzso than at their 3' zzso The initiation of editing is reduced to some extent in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso plays a zzso role as editing becomes stalled in zzso cells, resulting in an overall decrease in the 3' to zzso progression of zzso zzso analyses of edited zzso from zzso and zzso cells reveal that zzso zzso progression of editing past intrinsic pause sites that often zzso to the 3' ends of zzso guide zzso zzso In addition, zzso edited junction regions are either absent or significantly shortened in zzso cells, consistent with impaired zzso zzso zzso analysis further suggests that zzso zzso complete zzso of certain zzso In zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso unwinding zzso demonstrate that zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso these data are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso initiation and 3' to zzso progression of editing through its ability to affect zzso zzso both during the transition between specific zzso and during usage of certain zzso
