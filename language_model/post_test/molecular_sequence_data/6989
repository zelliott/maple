The zzso zzso protein of zzso coli is integrated into the membrane with two zzso located zzso zzso while its large zzso domain is zzso to the AAA family of zzso The previous studies on dominant negative zzso zzso raised a possibility that zzso functions in zzso zzso We found that zzso was zzso at zzso corresponding to a larger molecular weight than expected from zzso structure in zzso zzso Moreover, treatment of zzso or their zzso extracts with a zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso products of zzso To dissect possible zzso complex, we constructed an zzso zzso with zzso zzso at its C zzso zzso When zzso prepared from cells in which zzso was zzso together with the normal zzso were treated with the zzso intact zzso and in zzso degradation products of zzso without the tag were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed the interaction between the zzso zzso To identify regions of zzso required or sufficient for this interaction, we constructed zzso proteins between zzso and zzso a protein with a similar zzso arrangement, by exchanging their corresponding zzso We found that only the zzso hybrid protein with an zzso membrane zzso domain and an zzso zzso domain caused a dominant zzso zzso and was zzso with zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso region of zzso mediates directly the interaction between the zzso zzso
