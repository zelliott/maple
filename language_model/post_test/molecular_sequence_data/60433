Nuclear factor 1 zzso family zzso which are zzso by four different genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to the zzso sequence and regulate the expression of many viral and cellular zzso We have previously zzso zzso and zzso from rat liver as factors that bind to the zzso in the zzso zzso P zzso and have also reported the repression domain of zzso In the present study we cloned five zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and compared their expression profiles and the affinity and specificity of the DNA binding of these zzso family zzso By Northern zzso analysis, we found that the expression profiles of the zzso are indistinguishable in the various zzso of the zzso The zzso affinities of zzso and zzso are higher than those of zzso and zzso whereas all four zzso proteins showed the same zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the function of zzso on the zzso regulation differed between zzso zzso and was affected by the zzso that bind to the promoter zzso In addition, we identified the zzso regulatory domain of zzso which is enriched with zzso and zzso zzso
