We systematically investigated the zzso response as well as DNA damage repair and damage tolerance in zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso and solar light zzso zzso showed the highest zzso sensitivity among zzso strains zzso with zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso of zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso cells did not show an increased UVA resistance compared to zzso zzso instead, they were more sensitive at high UVA zzso zzso zzso survived better on zzso soy zzso than zzso plates regardless of the growth zzso A zzso survival rate of zzso was observed following doses of zzso J of zzso zzso zzso J of zzso zzso 25 zzso of UVA zzso and zzso J of solar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an increased survival rate to zzso of as much as zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and 3- to zzso following zzso zzso and solar light zzso zzso A significant zzso zzso to zzso resistance was detected in both zzso and zzso samples, with the zzso frequency in the range of zzso to zzso Unlike in zzso coli, the expression levels of the zzso zzso repair zzso component genes zzso zzso and zzso were not damage zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso increased the zzso survival of this strain by more than 3 orders of zzso Loss of damage zzso of the zzso system appears to contribute to the high sensitivity of this zzso to zzso as well as to other zzso zzso
