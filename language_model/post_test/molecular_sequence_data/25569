A zzso zzso zzso expression library was constructed in zzso zzso from muscle larvae zzso and zzso screened to identify genes zzso previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the library with zzso zzso infection serum from zzso or rabbit zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso identified one zzso designated zzso that contains a zzso transcript zzso zzso in length and codes for an apparent zzso zzso fusion protein that does not zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso infection zzso Western blots of zzso zzso extracts and zzso zzso of tissue sections from muscle larvae using zzso to zzso zzso demonstrate zzso between zzso and the 53 zzso diagnostic zzso from zzso products zzso zzso and zzso the zzso native zzso to the zzso cells of the zzso zzso tests using zzso as zzso detected zzso to zzso zzso in zzso mice as early as 14 days zzso with maximum zzso zzso being reached at 28 days zzso The zzso zzso zzso to zzso sequences expressed in both the muscle larvae and adult zzso however, zzso expression of the native zzso is not observed within adult zzso zzso Southern blots of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso fragments verify zzso as a zzso zzso specific sequence that is present in multiple copies within the zzso zzso
