Recently a second zzso zzso termed zzso zzso beta zzso has been cloned and zzso and shown to be expressed at the highest levels in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso In the course of amplifying a region of the zzso domain of the rat zzso zzso we identified a second, larger transcript which appears to arise through differential zzso The second zzso has 54 zzso inserted after position zzso zzso 18 additional zzso zzso Both zzso are expressed at similar relative abundance in a range of zzso
