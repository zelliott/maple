zzso studies have been carried out on the zzso zzso system (a system of three linked zzso units, in the zzso zzso using energy zzso zzso For X, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso The energy zzso have been classified into different groups based upon the zzso zzso There are 15, 20, 18 and 6 zzso that are possible for the four cases respectively and these fall into 11 different zzso A study of these zzso shows that, zzso some zzso contain hydrogen zzso zzso or zzso type, zzso the low energy zzso qualify themselves as bend zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are possible for the zzso zzso as also the C zzso and C zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso at the first zzso zzso is ruled out, due to the high zzso The available crystal structure data on proteins and zzso containing zzso segment have been examined with a view to find the zzso that occur in solid zzso The data from protein show that they fall under two zzso The zzso at X in zzso is near extended when it is a zzso zzso In both peptides and proteins there exists a preference for zzso zzso at zzso zzso over zzso when X is a zzso zzso The zzso obtained can be useful in zzso zzso
