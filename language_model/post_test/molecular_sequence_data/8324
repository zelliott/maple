We present a zzso cheap and highly efficient method for zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso This method is zzso to every DNA zzso which has to be cloned into the multiple cloning site of any zzso or zzso pair, in two different zzso It requires only two zzso one new and specific zzso primer and one of the usual sequencing zzso In the first zzso a zzso DNA zzso is zzso which is amplified zzso in the second zzso In contrast, zzso sequences are only zzso amplified resulting in an efficiency of zzso of nearly zzso
