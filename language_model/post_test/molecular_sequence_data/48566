The zzso is the major regulatory zzso of cardiac zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso interactions to influence muscle zzso However, the precise zzso and the specific zzso involved in zzso the functional effects of the zzso are not fully zzso zzso charged zzso adjacent to zzso sites in the zzso are thought to be critical for effects of zzso on zzso interactions by zzso zzso binding with zzso zzso and/or zzso However, recent structural studies revealed that highly zzso sequences downstream of the zzso sites form a compact zzso zzso Here we used zzso zzso to probe the functional significance of charged zzso adjacent to the zzso sites and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso confirm that charged zzso adjacent to zzso sites and zzso within the zzso bundle are important for zzso effects of the zzso on zzso In addition, four zzso zzso within the zzso bundle that are associated with human zzso zzso caused either zzso or zzso effects on zzso zzso the effects of the zzso zzso zzso increased the affinity of the zzso for zzso Together, results demonstrate that functional effects of the zzso are not due solely to interactions with charged zzso near zzso zzso and provide the first demonstration that the zzso bundle contributes to the functional effects of the zzso most likely by binding to zzso
