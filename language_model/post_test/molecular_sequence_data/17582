To analyze the processing of zzso zzso of zzso zzso an zzso extended hybrid zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso as the zzso for the in zzso processing reaction, in which a zzso zzso was added at the zzso of the mature zzso zzso The extended zzso in zzso zzso was completely processed by the zzso alkaline zzso of zzso zzso alone at pH zzso to zzso The processing was inhibited by 2 zzso zzso In contrast, the neutral zzso did not process the extended zzso The processing activity of the zzso alkaline zzso was fully active in 100 zzso zzso and zzso buffer while it was partially active in 100 zzso zzso or zzso zzso The optimum pH of the activity ranged from zzso to zzso although the optimum pH of the alkaline zzso activity toward zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso processed in zzso coincided with those of the mature zzso zzso zzso in the culture medium of zzso zzso zzso The appearance of the processing activity of alkaline zzso was correlated with the changes of the pH in the culture zzso
