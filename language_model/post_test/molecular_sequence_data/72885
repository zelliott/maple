We examined previously unexplored aspects of the zzso and zzso DNA zzso binding properties of native, zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso protein zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso reassemble spontaneously after zzso zzso and undergo zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso as a function of protein concentration is zzso suggesting a zzso transition in intrinsic binding affinity and in the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the precursor form of zzso does not disrupt zzso formation but has a specific zzso effect on DNA binding that is not seen in a fusion protein that zzso a zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso forms of zzso bearing zzso acid zzso at highly zzso zzso acid positions exhibit subtle or severe defects in zzso binding activity and/or zzso even when assembled into zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso These experiments provide new insights into structural and functional properties of zzso zzso and have implications for the zzso of human diseases resulting from defects in zzso zzso
