In previous studies, we have reported that the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso binds to a zzso zzso and zzso both alkaline zzso activity and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso This zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso gel induced zzso bone formation in rat calf muscle, and activated zzso to promote the repair of rat zzso bone zzso Here, we report repair of zzso long rabbit zzso bone defects using the zzso zzso combined with a porous zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso was released from the porous zzso scaffold over more than one zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso combined with the porous zzso scaffold promoted zzso in the implanted area in a zzso manner, and that 5 zzso of the zzso zzso induced connection of zzso long zzso defects of critical size, 12 weeks after zzso zzso examination revealed newly formed bone and a zzso cavity in the implanted zzso The area of bone denser than zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso was nearly equal to that of the zzso zzso
