A zzso zzso phase I trial was conducted in human zzso virus type 1 zzso subjects receiving vaccines zzso by zzso DNA and modified zzso virus Ankara zzso expressing zzso zzso gag linked to a string of zzso zzso zzso The trial had two zzso One group received either two doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso or two doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso The second group received zzso zzso followed by one dose of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso zzso responses peaked 1 week after zzso vaccination in both ex zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso mean, 210 zzso zzso zzso and proliferation zzso mean stimulation index, zzso with zzso detecting positive responses in four out of eight and five out of eight subjects, zzso No zzso zzso responses were detected in either zzso in the zzso zzso group or subjects receiving zzso Using a highly sensitive and zzso cultured zzso zzso zzso positive responses mainly zzso by zzso T cells were detected in eight out of eight zzso in the zzso group and four out of eight zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso responses were detected in the eight subjects receiving zzso Of the 12 responders, 11 developed responses to previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso with 6 volunteers having responses to more than one zzso Five out of 12 zzso also developed zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso T cells produced a variety of zzso zzso including tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso inflammatory protein 1 zzso These data demonstrate that zzso vaccination with zzso DNA and zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso T cells in the majority of zzso
