A novel human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso acid zzso has been zzso to zzso zzso from human zzso As judged zzso the newly described zzso is low spin in the oxidized state, with a zzso band at 415 zzso and an increased maximum at zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared homogeneous as judged by the appearance of a single band on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso with an estimated molecular weight of zzso Although zzso zzso had a relatively low specific content of zzso zzso it possessed a high activity of zzso acid zzso The zzso oxidized zzso acid in a zzso system into the four zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso 11, zzso 14, zzso at a rate of zzso zzso a rate which is zzso higher than that observed with the crude zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso at the rate of zzso zzso whereas other zzso zzso reactions were carried out at zzso lower rates and ranged between zzso zzso The zzso acid composition is different from that of other zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso acid zzso was compared to that of zzso and zzso the zzso forms in rabbit and rats, zzso zzso was also made with two forms of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso There were zzso identical zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso There were zzso identical zzso for zzso and zzso and no identical zzso were found for zzso We conclude that the biologically active zzso are formed by a distinct and unique zzso zzso from human liver and that zzso acid can serve as a screen for detection of the novel zzso zzso
