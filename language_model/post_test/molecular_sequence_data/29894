The nuclear zzso zzso zzso A, zzso B, and a zzso zzso zzso are zzso modified by a zzso derived from zzso This modification can be inhibited by treatment with zzso demonstrating that it is zzso in zzso We have examined the association between zzso metabolism and processing of the zzso A precursor in human and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso by zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso pools and zzso the conversion of zzso A to zzso zzso zzso A processing is also blocked by zzso zzso of zzso a zzso cell line zzso for zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso A processing by zzso treatment is rapidly reversed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso of zzso A is, therefore, dependent on zzso zzso Analysis of the conversion of zzso A to zzso A by two independent methods, zzso and two-dimensional zzso pH gel zzso demonstrates that a zzso relationship exists between zzso A and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso cells shows that the rate of turnover of the zzso group from zzso A is comparable to the rate of conversion of zzso A to zzso zzso These results suggest that during the zzso maturation of zzso A, the zzso zzso is zzso A significant difference between zzso A processing, and that of zzso and the zzso zzso that undergo zzso zzso zzso is that the mature form of zzso A is no longer zzso
