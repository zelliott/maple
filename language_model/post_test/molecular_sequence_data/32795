In this review, we focus on the assembly of zzso complexes that trigger zzso in zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso elements zzso and zzso zzso belonging to this zzso zzso zzso with DNA binding zzso of different origins, and recent data indicate that the zzso of functional zzso has been an important evolutionary aspect in the generation of new zzso within the zzso zzso These data also reveal that the zzso terminal repeats zzso at the ends of zzso contain three kinds of motif within their zzso The first two are well known and zzso to the zzso site on the outer zzso zzso and the zzso DNA binding zzso The organization of zzso and of the zzso DNA binding zzso implies that differing pathways are used by zzso and zzso to regulate zzso zzso These differences imply that the ways zzso are recognized also differ leading to the formation of differently organized synaptic zzso The third kind of motif is the zzso zzso which have been found in almost all the functional zzso and zzso analyzed to zzso Finally, in zzso and in zzso zzso of various elements all suggest that the zzso initiation complex is not formed randomly, but involves a mechanism of oriented zzso zzso
