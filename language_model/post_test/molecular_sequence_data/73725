We report the complete zzso sequence of the gene cluster zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso analysis revealed the existence of eight genes that map at zzso 8 of the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso Six zzso genes account for a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The order of these zzso zzso with the sole exception of zzso parallels that of the zzso steps of the zzso The zzso gene may zzso the terminal zzso zzso zzso not reported previously in the proposed zzso zzso that catalyze the early reactions of the pathway, zzso and zzso showed the lowest level of sequence similarity to analogous zzso of other aromatic zzso zzso However, the genes zzso present the same organization and appear to be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso supporting the hypothesis of the modular evolution of zzso pathways and becoming the first example of this type of zzso module outside the zzso zzso Two bacterial zzso mosaic elements were found downstream of the zzso locus and flank a zzso zzso which encodes a protein related to the zzso of zzso zzso that might be associated with zzso All of the genes of the zzso cluster are transcribed in the same direction, with the sole exception of zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso genes depends upon the presence, in the zzso or trans position, of a functional zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso gene product is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso revealed significant similarities to that of members of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA cassette was engineered and shown to be functional not only in enteric bacteria zzso coli and zzso zzso but also in zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus zzso its potential application to improve the zzso abilities of bacterial strains for degradation of aromatic zzso
