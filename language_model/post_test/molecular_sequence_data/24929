zzso in zzso neural zzso involves multiple gene families, including basic zzso zzso factors, which initiate and control primary zzso Equally important, though less well zzso are the downstream zzso of the activity of these zzso zzso We have investigated the role of a candidate downstream zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that likely forms large zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso causes prolonged and excessive neural crest zzso Our studies in zzso reveal that this zzso while highly zzso in zzso has a divergent function in primary zzso zzso zzso is expressed mainly by zzso zzso zzso in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems, first appearing after neural tube zzso Its expression is zzso in zzso locations upon zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso expression in animal caps zzso expression of neural markers zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso Furthermore, in animal caps zzso by expression of zzso zzso of zzso causes expression of zzso differentiation markers several stages before zzso normally occurs in this zzso Finally, only zzso forms of the protein can activate sensory marker zzso while all forms of the protein can induce early zzso This suggests that the cellular zzso of zzso may be important to its zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel zzso factor involved in zzso
