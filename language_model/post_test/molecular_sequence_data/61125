The anatomical zzso of zzso receptors was examined by in zzso quantitative zzso techniques in rat spinal zzso sections by using zzso zzso appeared to interact with a single class of binding sites zzso zzso present in the zzso matter in all zzso of the spinal zzso from cervical to zzso zzso zzso of sections in the presence of 150 zzso zzso did not modify the zzso affinity but significantly zzso the number of accessible binding sites and increased specific binding of zzso zzso on each zzso In particular, the superficial layers of the zzso horn exhibited the highest density of sites after zzso Continuous zzso infusion of zzso produced a tolerance accompanied by a significant increase in zzso site density in the superficial zzso Thus, zzso binding sites may have different properties dependent upon the layer and may be zzso during the process of zzso zzso
