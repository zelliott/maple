The promoter region of a soybean zzso zzso zzso was analyzed to identify zzso DNA sequences that may be involved in regulation of zzso Using zzso I zzso and gel mobility shift zzso multiple regions of interaction, including eight major zzso sites, were observed in the zzso zzso Two sequence zzso zzso and zzso related to zzso and zzso zzso respectively, found in several plant zzso were zzso Four distinct zzso zzso were zzso such zzso zzso appear to zzso but not to specify, the expression of many zzso Two new sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso D1 and zzso share a very similar core zzso zzso and zzso zzso In gel mobility shift zzso D1 and zzso elements exhibit a complex interaction of binding zzso The zzso promoter also contains zzso elements which compete with the zzso zzso zzso comparisons have identified zzso sequences in several other zzso genes suggesting the possible importance of zzso and the respective binding proteins in the regulation of expression of these zzso
