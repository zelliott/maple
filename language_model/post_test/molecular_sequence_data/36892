Following reverse zzso and zzso amplification, the human zzso zzso zzso was cloned from total zzso of activated human zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso showed the presence of specific band, and its DNA sequence demonstrated that the zzso was 650 zzso in zzso spanning the complete coding region and part of zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso sequence seemed to be well zzso One zzso change at zzso position was observed, but this change did not affect the zzso acid zzso After inserting the cloned zzso into zzso zzso zzso the zzso was packaged in zzso cells and the zzso virus zzso reached 5 zzso zzso zzso Human zzso was expressed in zzso cell line zzso cells, after being infected by the constructed zzso The zzso resistant zzso cells zzso zzso Its zzso was able to maintain in zzso growth of the zzso dependent zzso cell zzso Northern zzso analysis of the zzso zzso cells showed significantly elevated zzso message, being consistent with the result of T zzso zzso The expression was stable during the 12 month period of zzso The zzso cells, formed after fusion of the zzso zzso cells and zzso exhibited accelerated zzso
