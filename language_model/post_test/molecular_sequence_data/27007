Three zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso II, were zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso salt crystal from Baja California, Mexico, whereas zzso and zzso II were isolated from salt pools in Western Australia and the Greek island of zzso zzso zzso had been exposed previously to conditions of outer space and survived 2 weeks on the zzso zzso zzso and molecular comparisons suggested high similarity between the three zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the strains clustered with zzso species, showing sequence similarities of zzso The zzso zzso values of strain zzso and strains zzso and zzso II are 73 and zzso respectively, indicating that they constitute a single zzso The DNA zzso between strain zzso and the type strains of 13 closely related species of the zzso zzso ranged from 39 to zzso suggesting that the three zzso constitute a different zzso The zzso content of the DNA of the three strains was zzso zzso All three strains contained zzso derivatives of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso together with a zzso zzso On the basis of these results, a novel species that includes the three strains is proposed, with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
