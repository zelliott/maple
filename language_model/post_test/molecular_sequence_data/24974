To determine how zzso interaction is affected by the charges of the zzso acids at position 2 of the zzso and position 297 of the zzso zzso we generated the zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso lost affinity to zzso II and zzso however retained partial affinity to zzso The zzso had high affinity to zzso zzso and partial affinity to the zzso zzso zzso not only the charge, but also the length of the side arms of the zzso acids at position 2 of the zzso and position 297 of the zzso affect their zzso
