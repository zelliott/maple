zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been divided into two major groups, high and low producers, on the basis of the amount of zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is produced in high concentration by zzso Tokyo, zzso Russia and Sweden zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso Copenhagen and Tice zzso zzso it is detected at zzso zzso or less of the concentration of zzso zzso To investigate why this protein is zzso differently, the zzso genes of zzso Tokyo and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso genes in two zzso showed exactly the same zzso Even the upstream and downstream regions of the zzso gene were zzso zzso gene expression was assessed by means of Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso zzso chain zzso The zzso was clearly detected in zzso Tokyo, but a very low level in zzso zzso On the basis of these results, the difference in the zzso of the zzso protein between zzso Tokyo and zzso was attributed to differential zzso zzso
