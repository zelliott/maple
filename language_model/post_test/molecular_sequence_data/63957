To test the hypothesis that zzso can be an important step in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we zzso the zzso within a cluster of zzso zzso close to zzso zzso zzso 1957, collected from Atlantic, Baltic and White Sea salmon zzso zzso farmed rainbow trout zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from Northern zzso The internal transcribed zzso region of the nuclear zzso gene was zzso for zzso zzso zzso on zzso from the White Sea zzso differed from the others by one zzso zzso the remainder were identical to the sequence published earlier from Norway zzso zzso on zzso England zzso zzso on zzso and the Czech Republic zzso zzso on zzso For increased resolution, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene of 88 zzso were zzso and compared with 76 published sequences using zzso zzso For all tree building zzso zzso zzso the zzso formed a zzso zzso of six zzso sister zzso indicating nearly simultaneous zzso Average zzso distances between zzso were zzso and internal mean distances zzso The genetic distance to the nearest known relative, zzso zzso zzso was zzso A variable zzso zzso zzso I was observed both in the Baltic zzso and in zzso populations introduced to the Atlantic and White Sea zzso An zzso zzso II was common in rainbow trout farms in Sweden, Denmark and zzso the same zzso was also infecting salmon in a zzso population in Russian zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Four geographically zzso sister zzso were observed on zzso zzso III in the Baltic Sea zzso zzso IV in zzso rivers draining to the White zzso zzso V in Norwegian river draining to Swedish lake zzso and zzso VI in rivers draining to zzso zzso The pattern fitted perfectly with the zzso history of zzso zzso zzso sampled zzso from salmon and Baltic zzso had zzso zzso in zzso which were isolated early during the zzso zzso The divergence between the six zzso was clear and linked with their zzso but not wide enough to support a species status for zzso zzso from the zzso type population of zzso zzso were not available, so this result does not mean that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso It is suggested that the zzso host of the zzso cluster was zzso and the switch to salmon occurred at least once when the zzso ice isolated Baltic salmon in an eastern freshwater zzso zzso years zzso At the same time, zzso on zzso were split geographically and isolated into several zzso zzso The divergence among the zzso zzso allowed a tentative zzso of the evolutionary rate, leading to an estimate of the divergence of zzso per million years for zzso coding zzso The results supported the hypothesis that parallel to the zzso mode, host switch and instant isolation by host specificity can be operated as a zzso zzso
