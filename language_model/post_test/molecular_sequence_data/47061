We have identified from human liver eight zzso zzso zzso zzso that were also expressed in human heart, prostate and zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave rise to receptors with seven zzso zzso zzso The other five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to truncated receptors lacking zzso domain zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells bound zzso with high affinity zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso increase in zzso free zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso were incapable of zzso binding and signal zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso were present both at the cell surface and in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso were exclusively localized within the zzso Interestingly, in zzso cells, each truncated zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding and zzso trafficking of the zzso zzso zzso However, there was no modification of either the zzso affinity or the pharmacological properties of zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso did not impair zzso zzso Therefore the expression in human zzso of many truncated zzso constitutes a new regulation zzso of biological properties of zzso
