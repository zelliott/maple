zzso gamma receptors zzso play a crucial role in immunity by linking zzso zzso responses with cellular zzso and regulatory zzso zzso zzso in these receptors have been previously identified as risk factors for several chronic inflammatory zzso The present study aimed to investigate the presence of copy number variations zzso in the zzso gene and its potential association with the zzso disease zzso arthritis zzso 

zzso of the zzso gene was studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 518 Dutch zzso patients and 304 healthy zzso Surprisingly, three independent zzso zzso targeting the zzso promoter measured different zzso zzso with zzso and zzso measuring 0 to 5 gene copies and zzso showing little evidence of zzso zzso correlated with the copy number results from zzso zzso which detected low copy number (1 zzso in zzso and high copy number zzso zzso in zzso of the control zzso No significant difference was observed between zzso patients and the healthy controls, neither in the low copy nor the high copy number groups zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region revealed an zzso zzso that explained the disparate zzso results of zzso zzso Finally, a zzso trend was found between the novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso in healthy controls versus zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

The current study highlights the complexity and poor characterization of the zzso gene zzso indicating that the design and interpretation of zzso zzso based on specific probe sequences must be performed with zzso Nonetheless, we confirmed the presence of zzso and identified novel zzso in the zzso gene in the Dutch zzso Although no association was found between zzso and zzso zzso the possible protective effect of the zzso zzso zzso must be addressed in larger zzso
