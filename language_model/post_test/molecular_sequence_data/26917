The giant protein zzso is responsible for the elasticity of zzso muscle zzso zzso passive zzso in zzso is modulated by zzso switching and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso effects on zzso zzso may arise from zzso bonding under zzso stress, as many zzso zzso in zzso spring region have a potential for zzso zzso Using zzso atomic force zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso contain no stabilizing zzso bridge, contrary to previous zzso However, we demonstrate that the human zzso sequence zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso segment zzso zzso zzso zzso contains up to three zzso bridges under zzso zzso zzso force zzso on zzso zzso molecules demonstrated a much shorter zzso length in the absence of a reducing agent than in its presence, consistent with zzso zzso zzso In stretch experiments on isolated human heart zzso the reducing agent zzso lowered zzso zzso to a degree that could be explained zzso zzso elasticity zzso by altered zzso solely of the zzso We conclude that increased zzso stress can elevate zzso zzso of zzso which may contribute to the global zzso stiffening frequently seen in the aging or failing zzso
