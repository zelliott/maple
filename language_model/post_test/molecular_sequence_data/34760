Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel specific smooth muscle differentiation marker thought to play a role in the growth and differentiation of zzso smooth muscle cells zzso 

Good quality zzso that were suitable for X-ray zzso studies were obtained following the zzso of the 14 zzso zzso acids of zzso a region predicted to be zzso The truncated protein zzso zzso consists of a single zzso zzso like domain which includes an zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso The zzso motif is crucial for the interaction of zzso proteins and plays a role in cell zzso The X-ray structure of zzso was determined and was refined to zzso resolution zzso zzso This is the best resolution for an zzso domain structure so zzso The structure adopts a zzso zzso fold and belongs to the I zzso set of the zzso zzso The zzso lying between the zzso form a zzso zzso The zzso motif folds into a 310 zzso that is involved in the formation of a zzso in the crystal which is mainly stabilized by salt zzso zzso zzso studies revealed a moderate zzso constant of 20 zzso at zzso zzso strength, suggesting that zzso zzso is only transient in the zzso The binding constant is strongly dependent on zzso zzso 

Our data suggests that the zzso motif might play a role not only in the zzso of zzso proteins but also in zzso zzso zzso However, it remains to be established whether the rather weak zzso of zzso involving this motif is zzso zzso
