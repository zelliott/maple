zzso community structure and diversity in zzso in two types of zzso distinguished by both plant species and zzso regimen, were assessed by performing a zzso zzso DNA zzso sequence analysis of zzso extracted from zzso soil zzso zzso products were zzso and 45 to 48 clones from each of the six libraries were partially zzso zzso analysis of the zzso 275 clone sequences indicated that there was considerable variation in abundance in replicate zzso zzso soil samples and zzso improved soil samples but that there were no significant differences in the abundance of any zzso zzso Several clone sequences were identical in the zzso zzso region zzso and the clones comprised eight pairs of duplicate clones and two sets of zzso zzso Many clones were found to be most closely related to environmental clones obtained in other studies, although three clones were found to be identical to zzso species in zzso The clones were clustered into operational zzso units at a level of sequence similarity of zzso in order to zzso zzso In all, 34 clusters containing two or more sequences were identified, and the largest group contained nine zzso A number of diversity, dominance, and zzso zzso were zzso and they all indicated that diversity was high, reflecting the low coverage of zzso libraries zzso zzso in diversity between sample types were not zzso zzso curves, however, indicated that there were differences in the underlying community zzso in particular, there was reduced diversity of organisms of the alpha subdivision of the class zzso zzso in improved zzso
