To investigate the presence and the genetic environment of the zzso gene zzso in zzso coli found in domestic zzso 

A total of 1230 zzso coli zzso collected from zzso chickens and zzso were screened by zzso for the zzso zzso The location of the zzso gene was determined by Southern zzso the zzso of zzso gene was tested by zzso and zzso and the regions zzso the zzso gene were zzso by a modified random primer walking zzso The location of the zzso promoter sequence was zzso by mapping the zzso zzso start site using rapid amplification of zzso zzso ends zzso zzso 

Only a single strain from the zzso zzso of a pig zzso the zzso zzso Southern zzso indicated that the zzso gene was located on a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso A zzso segment of zzso zzso with a sequence identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso was flanked by two zzso elements in the same zzso The zzso zzso created a new hybrid promoter in which the zzso region was part of the left zzso repeat of zzso while the zzso sequence was part of the original zzso upstream zzso 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the zzso gene in a naturally occurring zzso coli zzso zzso surveillance of the presence of the zzso gene in zzso bacteria of zzso origin is zzso
