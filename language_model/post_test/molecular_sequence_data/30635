The promoter elements important for zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso gene have been localized downstream of zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso nuclear extracts identified four protected regions, zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that multiple factors interact with the zzso sequence zzso to zzso while the region zzso to zzso binds a single nuclear zzso zzso interference analysis and zzso substitution zzso identified the binding site of the factor between zzso zzso and zzso zzso competition experiments indicate that this factor recognizes the regulatory elements of other zzso zzso
