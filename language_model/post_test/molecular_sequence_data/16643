zzso zzso zzso also called zzso sensory zzso II, zzso is a zzso for negative zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso it forms a zzso complex with its zzso zzso zzso which zzso light signals into the zzso space through zzso zzso We previously found that a specific zzso zzso of zzso or zzso strengthens their binding zzso zzso et zzso (2002) zzso zzso 83, zzso In this study we aim to identify this zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso has only one zzso zzso whose existence spans the zzso time range, the analysis of its zzso rate is zzso We prepared various zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso among which only zzso did not show pH dependence with regard to the zzso zzso rate and zzso value for zzso zzso that the zzso group in question is from zzso The zzso of this group decreased to below 2 when a complex was zzso zzso we conclude that zzso is connected to the distant zzso binding surface via hydrogen bonds, thereby modulating its zzso In addition, we discuss the importance of zzso with respect to the binding zzso
