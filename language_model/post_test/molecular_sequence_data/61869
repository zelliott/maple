Among the most common interaction motifs between nuclear proteins is the recognition of one or more zzso zzso In an effort to determine principles behind this recognition, we have investigated the interaction between the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso The two proteins use relatively small portions of their primary sequences to form a single zzso folded domain consisting of six intertwined zzso three from each zzso Neither of the component zzso forms a zzso folded domain in zzso However, a considerable amount of residual secondary structure remains in the isolated zzso domain according to CD zzso Chemical zzso differential scanning zzso and zzso binding experiments demonstrate that the isolated zzso domain is not entirely unfolded but forms a zzso state with the characteristics of a molten zzso zzso probing the functional and energetic significance of a buried zzso zzso salt bridge in the interface of the protein complex suggest that these zzso are tuned for functional discrimination and not strictly for binding affinity or zzso These results suggest a mechanism for formation of the complex where the unfolded zzso domain interacts with the partly folded zzso domain in a rapid and specific manner to form the final stable zzso
