Plants possess a multilayered defense response, known as plant innate zzso to infection by a wide variety of zzso zzso sugar binding zzso play essential roles in the innate immunity of animal cells, but the role of zzso in plant defense is not zzso This study analyzed the resistance of certain zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso cloning revealed that the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso FOR zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso resistance did not show the properties of conventional resistance zzso zzso resistance and was independent of plant defense hormone zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso showed that zzso interferes with infection by other tested zzso but not with plant viruses from different zzso indicating the broad but specific resistance to zzso zzso by zzso In contrast with the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso which zzso the systemic movement of zzso which are zzso related to zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso at the cellular zzso The existence of zzso genes that show a variety of levels of virus resistance, their targets, and their properties, which are distinct from those of known R zzso suggests the zzso of zzso resistance in plant innate zzso
