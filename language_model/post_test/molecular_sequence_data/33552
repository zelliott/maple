A single strain of zzso zzso zzso eight distinct zzso zzso designated zzso to zzso These zzso are zzso zzso zzso by eight separate zzso zzso zzso The genetic architecture of each of these eight zzso is similar, including the fact that the first gene of each locus is a zzso of the first gene of each of the other zzso zzso These proteins are designated the zzso family, where zzso is replaced by a to zzso depending upon the zzso locus from which it is zzso zzso analysis of three separate zzso genes demonstrated that they are necessary and specific for zzso of their respective zzso zzso zzso and that they function in zzso zzso reporter zzso reverse zzso zzso and deletion analysis demonstrated that the zzso do not affect initiation of transcription, but rather prevent premature zzso termination within the zzso untranslated region between the promoter and the zzso zzso The zzso have zzso motifs that are present in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso within the zzso zzso motif zzso zzso activity, further confirming that these proteins belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of highly similar zzso led to the identification of a small region of these proteins predicted to zzso specificity for their respective zzso Construction of an zzso hybrid that produced a protein in which a zzso segment of zzso was changed to that of zzso altered zzso zzso as it was now able to function in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
