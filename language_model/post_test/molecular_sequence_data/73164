zzso is a small protein involved in the regulation of a wide variety of zzso zzso The cooperative binding of zzso to zzso two zzso binding zzso zzso zzso changes which allow zzso to activate specific target zzso The association of zzso with a zzso corresponding to the zzso binding site of rabbit smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso was studied using zzso zzso zzso The dependence of the binding zzso on temperature, zzso zzso zzso and zzso concentration were zzso It is found that the binding of zzso to zzso proceeds with negative changes in zzso zzso heat capacity zzso and zzso zzso near room temperature, indicating that it is an zzso driven process that is zzso zzso From these results it is concluded that the zzso effect, an zzso effect which favors the removal of zzso protein groups from water, is not a major driving force in zzso zzso Although a large number of zzso zzso are buried upon zzso these stabilize the complex primarily by forming tightly packed van der zzso interactions with one zzso zzso at zzso pH was studied in order to assess the contribution of zzso interactions to zzso It is found that moving to zzso pH results in a large decrease in the Gibbs free energy of binding but no change in the zzso indicating that zzso interactions contribute only zzso to the binding zzso The accessible surface area and atomic packing density of the zzso crystal structure are zzso and the results discussed in relation to the experimental zzso
