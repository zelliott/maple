zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso that zzso signals from cell surface receptors to zzso molecules are made up of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso A complementary DNA clone that encodes a zzso acid protein was isolated from bovine zzso this protein contains zzso sequences that were derived from the zzso gamma zzso of zzso and zzso The primary sequence of this G protein gamma zzso zzso zzso has 55 percent zzso to the gamma zzso of zzso zzso zzso and also has zzso to functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso The probe for zzso the clone was generated with the use of the zzso chain reaction zzso The extent of divergence between T gamma and G zzso the isolation of zzso zzso fragments, and the differences between the predicted zzso acid sequence of G gamma and that derived from the gamma zzso of zzso and Go indicate that gamma zzso are zzso by a family of zzso
