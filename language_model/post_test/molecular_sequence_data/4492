To study the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso zzso we have cloned the mouse zzso zzso including zzso zzso of upstream zzso We show that the first 133 base pairs zzso of the upstream zzso promoter are sufficient to drive near zzso zzso over zzso zzso reporter gene expression in zzso zzso zzso at least 300 zzso of upstream promoter are required for reporter gene expression in zzso zzso cell zzso Using zzso shift zzso we demonstrate that nuclear proteins bind to the zzso nuclear zzso zzso consensus sequence in the zzso zzso The zzso consensus zzso located in the immediate zzso zzso region, is required for zzso zzso of the zzso gene in both zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso consensus sequence zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso of these zzso with zzso zzso zzso initiation of the reporter zzso In contrast, zzso has no significant effect on zzso of the reporter zzso These experiments demonstrate that zzso is an important regulatory element in the zzso zzso of zzso
