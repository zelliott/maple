Recently we reported that zzso a Chinese zzso zzso cell zzso defective in zzso of zzso zzso is defective in the synthesis of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be in the zzso zzso group, which zzso zzso rather than zzso In this paper, levels of various zzso derivatives in zzso are compared to levels of the corresponding zzso derivatives in parental zzso zzso was found to maintain near normal levels of zzso and zzso despite reduced rates of zzso by utilizing those zzso at a reduced zzso The zzso zzso attached to zzso in zzso cells and to zzso in parental cells is the same structure, as determined by zzso zzso and zzso both appeared to be zzso efficiently in an in zzso zzso zzso of G protein was compared in zzso zzso virus zzso parent and zzso although a portion of G protein was compared in zzso zzso virus zzso parent and zzso although a portion of G protein was normally zzso in zzso cells, a large portion of G was zzso resulting in the addition of either one or no zzso to zzso zzso of a single zzso occurred randomly rather than zzso at one of the two zzso
