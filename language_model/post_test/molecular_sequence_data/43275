We have isolated four zzso clones of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained the same sequences as the previously reported DNA fragments, zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso was identical with zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso was specifically induced in response to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was very rapid zzso 30 zzso and insensitive to zzso treatment at zzso up to 100 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected at 1 zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso was suppressed by zzso and zzso but enhanced by zzso These characteristics of zzso expression were well correlated with the zzso data of zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso was strongly induced by zzso but was found to be not zzso zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or action zzso increased the zzso level of zzso zzso
