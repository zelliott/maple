Two zzso of zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso library constructed from zzso zzso rat zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed that zzso contained zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso contained zzso zzso zzso There is zzso conservation of the zzso sequence in the open reading frame of zzso between the rat and the zzso while the zzso of the 3' untranslated region is zzso except for a 150 zzso segment adjacent to the stop zzso which is zzso with the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso into zzso cells resulted in increased zzso zzso In rat vascular smooth muscle cells, zzso beta selectively increased the expression of zzso but not that of zzso as assessed by zzso activity, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only the brain among zzso tested exhibits zzso expression of zzso as the major form of the zzso However, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso in the lung and zzso but not in the heart, after systemic administration of zzso suggesting that zzso but not zzso plays a major role in producing zzso products of zzso acid during zzso zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso was selectively induced in response to inflammatory stimuli in zzso
