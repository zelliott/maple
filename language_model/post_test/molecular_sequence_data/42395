The C1 complex of human complement comprises two loosely interacting zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso With a view to gain information on the nature of the zzso interactions involved in C1 zzso we have studied the effects of the chemical modifications of charged zzso of zzso or the zzso on their ability to zzso the C1 zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as with zzso and zzso inhibited its ability to associate with zzso Treatment of the zzso fragments of zzso with the same zzso yielded the same zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso also prevented C1 zzso through modification of zzso zzso acids which were shown to be located in zzso Further studies on the location of the interaction sites within zzso using zzso and competition experiments with synthetic zzso were zzso suggesting that these sites are contributed to by two or three of the zzso zzso It is concluded that C1 assembly involves interactions between zzso zzso acids of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso located within the zzso region of zzso zzso comparison with zzso binding zzso another zzso zzso which binds the zzso zzso suggests zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso as possible interaction zzso
