zzso zzso zzso is an zzso neutral zzso found in a variety of zzso but primarily in zzso and zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present studies, a portion of rat zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso expression system and the resulting zzso fusion protein was zzso in zzso zzso The approximately 26 zzso zzso protein was used to generate zzso zzso in rabbits that recognize intact zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, and zzso as well as in human zzso zzso In addition, there was an approximately 89 zzso protein observed in all rat zzso expressing the 84 zzso zzso zzso to zzso there was an zzso protein of approximately 102 zzso in sexually immature rats, and additional zzso proteins of approximately 113 zzso and approximately zzso zzso in sexually mature zzso The zzso protein zzso could remove approximately zzso of total neutral cholesterol zzso activity from extracts of rat zzso tissue and zzso a single 84 zzso protein after labeling of zzso with zzso The incorporation of zzso into the 84 zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso by incubation of zzso with zzso The half life of zzso zzso was approximately 4 h in normal rat zzso The production of an zzso protein and generation of zzso that recognize native zzso should be valuable tools in exploring the mechanisms regulating the expression of zzso activity and the function and zzso of its zzso zzso
