zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was originally identified in the cellular slime mold zzso zzso zzso cells show defects in zzso cell zzso and zzso Although the existence of zzso in higher zzso has been reported, its function in zzso cells has not been zzso We cloned a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and examined its zzso properties, zzso zzso and possible zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids and is zzso identical to human zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso The zzso repeat domain zzso zzso alone did not have any affinity for zzso zzso zzso reacted specifically with a single 57 zzso protein present in an extract of the zzso A6 cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of A6 cells revealed that zzso is present in the zzso and concentrated in the cell periphery in membrane zzso During spreading after zzso or wound healing after scratching a zzso zzso zzso became concentrated in the leading edges of zzso A zzso protein of zzso showed a zzso distribution essentially identical to zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to the cell periphery was resistant to treatment with zzso zzso zzso The deletion of 63 zzso zzso acids or of 65 zzso zzso acids abolished the zzso of zzso to the cell zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was concentrated to the leading edges of zzso induced by active zzso zzso expression of a truncated form of zzso zzso but not of full-length zzso significantly decreased the rate of cell spreading after zzso and markedly inhibited zzso extension induced by active zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso extension and cell zzso
