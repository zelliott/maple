Juvenile zzso zzso is an zzso dominant syndrome in which affected patients develop zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso A subset of families with zzso have zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene and are at increased risk of zzso zzso To date, six families with zzso have been described as having the same zzso deletion zzso The objective of the present study is to determine whether this deletion is a common ancestral zzso or a zzso zzso DNA from members of four families with zzso from Iowa, Mississippi, Texas, and Finland, that had this zzso deletion was used to zzso 15 simple tandem repeat zzso zzso markers zzso the zzso zzso including 2 new zzso within zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso in each family were constructed, and the distances of the closest markers were determined from the draft sequence of the human zzso No common zzso was observed in these four families with zzso A zzso region containing the deletion had four direct repeats and one zzso zzso Because no common zzso was suggested by zzso analysis and the sequence zzso the deletion contains repeats frequently associated with zzso this common zzso deletion in zzso most likely represents a zzso zzso
