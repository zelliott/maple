zzso progress in understanding the mechanism of zzso of zzso by zzso has been obtained from different zzso zzso These studies reveal that stable zzso complex formation involves zzso of the zzso loop of the zzso and occurs at the zzso zzso Even though no three-dimensional structure of a zzso complex is zzso structural information is available on some of the individual zzso zzso modeling techniques combined with recently acquired zzso data were used to provide insight into the stable complex formation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and the target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This study reveals that zzso initially interacts with its target zzso when its zzso loop is zzso exposed and thereby accessible for the zzso zzso complex formation, however, involves the zzso of the zzso loop up to zzso and results in a tight binding geometry between zzso and its target zzso The influence of different biologically relevant molecules on zzso complex formation and the differences in zzso rate zzso observed for the different zzso can be explained from these zzso
