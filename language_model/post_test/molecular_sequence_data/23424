In pioneering studies, Avery et zzso identified DNA as the zzso material zzso zzso Avery, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They demonstrated, by means of variation in colony zzso that this substance could transform their rough type 2 zzso zzso strain zzso into a smooth type 3 zzso It has become accepted as fact, from modern textbook accounts of these experiments, that smooth zzso make zzso while rough strains do zzso We found that zzso zzso conversion did not occur in rough strains zzso and zzso when the ability to zzso native type 2 capsule was zzso The continued rough zzso of these zzso strains was attributed to a second, zzso zzso zzso that was sustained by zzso during strain zzso We used a new zzso approach to identify zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso as the zzso locus in zzso and zzso that, with zzso gives rise to rough colony zzso as we know zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is associated with increased cellular zzso zzso activity relative to the ancestral strain zzso Increased zzso zzso activity alters colony shape by zzso cell zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso for the expression of smooth type 2 zzso but not for the expression of smooth type 3 zzso the zzso monitored by Avery et zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso did not impact their use of smooth zzso to identify the transforming zzso
