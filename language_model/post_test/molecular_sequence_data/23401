zzso the major protein of the zzso lens in most species, is an zzso assembled from two zzso each with a molecular weight around 20,000 zzso It is zzso and can be isolated in a variety of forms, including zzso particles with molecular weights ranging zzso from about 200 zzso zzso comparisons reveal that it is a member of the small heat shock protein zzso zzso These proteins are zzso assembled from zzso of 10 to 25 zzso that share a common central domain of about 90 zzso (the zzso zzso with variable zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been zzso studied for more than 50 years but its three-dimensional structure remains unknown because it has not been possible to obtain zzso for X-ray studies and it is too large for zzso zzso zzso information has been derived from a variety of solution zzso Because of the zzso zzso interpretation of data has been zzso This led to different viewpoints and vigorous debate on its structure and zzso Recently, the crystal structures of two zzso small heat shock proteins have been zzso These have provided some insight into the structure of zzso and explanations of previous zzso Like many other heat shock zzso zzso exhibits zzso properties, including the ability to prevent the zzso of zzso proteins and to increase cellular tolerance to zzso It has been suggested that these functions are important for the maintenance of lens transparency and the prevention of zzso
