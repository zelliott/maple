zzso induced arthritis zzso is an zzso model that in many ways resembles zzso arthritis zzso zzso of genetically susceptible strains of zzso and primates with type II collagen zzso leads to the development of a severe zzso arthritis that is zzso by an zzso zzso Like zzso zzso and zzso of cartilage and bone are hallmarks of zzso and zzso to both zzso and zzso is linked to the expression of specific zzso class II zzso Although not identical to zzso zzso clearly establishes the biological zzso that an zzso reaction to a cartilage component can lead to a zzso zzso zzso Although it is induced in susceptible animals by zzso with zzso zzso it is the zzso component of the immune response that leads to zzso A wealth of evidence indicates that zzso is initiated by the production of zzso zzso zzso capable of fixing and zzso zzso The zzso of the specific zzso acid sequences of collagen that are recognized by the zzso molecules has enabled at least two approaches to specific zzso to be zzso zzso small synthetic peptides representing dominant zzso have been used as effectively as the original zzso as a zzso The rather fastidious zzso properties of collagen that make it difficult for its routine use in therapy are thereby zzso by the use of zzso zzso analysis of the specific zzso acid side chains that are involved in zzso contact and zzso recognition enables analog peptides to be devised which can specifically and exquisitely inhibit the response to zzso preventing the onset of zzso Further investigations involving this model may contribute to the development of specific zzso in the human zzso
