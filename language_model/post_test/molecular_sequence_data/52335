Signal sequence zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso are major zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso which are implicated in zzso zzso They were identified as major membrane zzso after in zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cameron, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Doherty, zzso II, zzso zzso Bell, zzso zzso zzso zzso Thomas, zzso zzso and Bergeron, zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso alpha and associated zzso as zzso we have attempted to identify the zzso responsible for their zzso A salt extract from canine pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso possessed zzso alpha zzso activity which showed identical zzso behavior through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Final zzso was zzso from the zzso with three zzso of 38, 36, and 28 zzso detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso On the basis of primary sequence analysis of the three zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso of zzso alpha and associated zzso in zzso zzso zzso by the addition of the zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso alpha and associated zzso is zzso zzso zzso
