The repression of translation of zzso zzso zzso transcripts during early development was examined by analyzing the effects of zzso zzso zzso regions using a zzso reporter zzso On their own, the zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso were unable to inhibit reporter translation until approximately the time of the zzso zzso zzso containing the 3' zzso were zzso after zzso and the zzso zzso When both zzso regions flanked a zzso reporter zzso translation was zzso at all stages of development examined in spite of their zzso after zzso From these data, we conclude that the zzso and 3' zzso interact zzso to prevent translation during early development and that the zzso tail is insufficient to promote their zzso
