Plant steroid hormones, zzso zzso are perceived by a cell surface zzso zzso zzso but how zzso binding leads to regulation of gene expression in the nucleus is zzso Here we describe the identification of zzso as a nuclear component of the zzso signal zzso zzso A dominant zzso zzso suppresses zzso and zzso zzso zzso and enhances feedback zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein accumulates in the nucleus of zzso cells of zzso zzso and is stabilized by zzso signaling and the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a positive regulator of the zzso signaling zzso that mediates both downstream zzso responses and feedback regulation of zzso zzso
