Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has serious zzso for the zzso Current treatments are associated with poor response and high zzso zzso The development of zzso T cell zzso offers a new approach to zzso This will require a detailed understanding of the spectrum of T cell responses induced by zzso zzso and how effectively viral zzso can be zzso by the immune zzso We have investigated the frequency and spectrum of zzso zzso T cell responses to three zzso zzso in 9 women with high grade zzso zzso zzso populations of zzso cells were screened against overlapping zzso peptides covering the sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso T cell zzso to one or more of the proteins in 6 of 9 patient zzso All 6 of these zzso zzso peptides covering the zzso zzso 3 of 9 women responded to E6 zzso but no zzso was seen to zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso T cells zzso are relatively common in women with persistent zzso The zzso zzso response, however, seems to be zzso There is some evidence that there are problems associated with the processing and presentation of zzso zzso by the infected zzso zzso It will be crucial to address this in the design of any T cell based therapy for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
