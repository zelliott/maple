The functions zzso zzso zzso of the zzso element have been mapped to a zzso region that includes the site of integration zzso a gene zzso that specifies a function both necessary and sufficient for integration of zzso and an open reading frame, zzso suspected of zzso a zzso zzso that shows limited similarity to the zzso of other zzso zzso zzso Here we describe experiments that investigate the respective roles of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso We constructed derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that express zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene and tested the ability of these zzso to promote zzso of an zzso zzso zzso that had been integrated zzso into the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene product alone from an zzso promoter was sufficient for zzso of the integrated zzso This result indicates that the zzso zzso protein can carry out zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso gene product, when expressed from an zzso promoter, inhibited zzso integration at the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, under conditions in which zzso and transfer normally occur, precise zzso of zzso was enhanced by the zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, we here designate the zzso gene as zzso
