zzso encodes zzso A zzso a zzso zzso that allows cells to zzso for zzso during carbon zzso zzso activates zzso zzso by binding tandem DNA sites located upstream of the major promoter, zzso Here, we used zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I footprint analyses to demonstrate that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso each bind multiple sites within the zzso regulatory region, that zzso competes successfully with zzso for binding to their overlapping and zzso sites and that zzso binds independently of either zzso or zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso and zzso independently reduce zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso reporter zzso we showed that disruption of DNA sites for zzso or deletion of DNA sites for zzso increases zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso each function directly as zzso of zzso each working independently at different times during growth to set the levels of zzso zzso zzso
