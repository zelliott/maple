zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso classified as zzso zzso are persistent zzso of plant leaf zzso Reports of zzso dialogue led us to examine zzso production by zzso Using zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso we obtained 22 to 111 zzso of zzso per liter from culture zzso of four zzso leaf zzso (from zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of a zzso zzso type culture originally recovered as a soil zzso We identified the zzso isolated as the trans zzso by zzso and by a zzso in which zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso were zzso Smaller and variable amounts of zzso zzso were also zzso zzso was recovered from zzso zzso in addition to the culture zzso suggesting that zzso zzso resulted from zzso turnover rather than from de zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene is responsible for zzso of a specific zzso in some zzso To confirm that the zzso zzso originated from zzso we zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso by single exchange of an internal zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed by zzso did not contain zzso in their zzso and did not zzso zzso into the zzso findings which are consistent with the hypothesis that all zzso is zzso derived rather than zzso de zzso In zzso studies performed with heat-treated soybean seeds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso While zzso production may play a role in the zzso interaction, it is not responsible for stimulation of zzso by zzso
