The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso is an essential zzso of the viral zzso zzso zzso complex and plays a central role in viral zzso and zzso Using both the zzso zzso system and zzso zzso we confirmed the zzso of the P protein of Indiana zzso zzso and zzso interaction between zzso and the P protein of New Jersey zzso zzso Furthermore, by using various zzso and deletion zzso of zzso the zzso domain of the zzso protein was mapped to zzso acids 161 to 210 within the hinge zzso The zzso domain of zzso protein is not required for its binding to zzso and large zzso We further demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso protein is essential for zzso zzso in a zzso system and that a synthetic zzso spanning zzso acids 191 to 210 in the zzso domain of zzso protein strongly inhibited the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso domain of zzso protein plays a critical role in zzso zzso
