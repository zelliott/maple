Early zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso required for zzso fusion in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contains a zzso domain that interacts specifically with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso binding region adjacent to the zzso zzso The dual interaction of zzso with both zzso and zzso has been hypothesized to provide the specificity required to target zzso to early zzso To test this hypothesis, we generated truncated zzso acids zzso and full-length zzso zzso containing point zzso in the zzso zzso that impair zzso but not zzso zzso These zzso localized to zzso in intact cells as efficiently as their zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the truncated zzso both zzso and zzso impaired the function of zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of small, untethered zzso These results suggest that association with zzso is not necessary for the initial binding and zzso functions of zzso A role for zzso binding was revealed, however, upon comparison of zzso in cells expressing full-length zzso or zzso zzso The zzso full-length zzso caused the zzso of zzso clusters and suppressed the enlargement of zzso caused by a persistently active form of zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso with zzso enhanced this zzso Thus, zzso zzso depends on the interaction of zzso with zzso and its interaction with zzso appears to regulate subsequent zzso
