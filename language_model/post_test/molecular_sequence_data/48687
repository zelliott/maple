zzso zzso is a critical process in gene expression in zzso zzso A multitude of proteins are known to be involved in zzso zzso in plants; however, the zzso roles of only some of these have been zzso Here, we investigated the zzso roles of a zzso zzso factor by analyzing root initiation zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso previously shown to have severe defects in zzso zzso and de zzso zzso formation in tissue culture under zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso indicated that zzso is zzso required during development and has roles in processes such as zzso zzso leaf zzso and root zzso zzso was identified as zzso a zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso zzso expression analysis using zzso reporter genes showed that zzso zzso efficiency was affected by the zzso zzso which supported the presumed function of zzso in zzso zzso Our results collectively suggest that robust levels of zzso zzso are critical for several specific aspects of plant zzso
