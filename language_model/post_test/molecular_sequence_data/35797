The problem of zzso recognition in zzso zzso appears to be in part solved by the strong conservation of zzso zzso zzso signals, in particular the zzso zzso and the branch point zzso which interact via base pairing with the zzso components of zzso and U2 zzso zzso Nevertheless, the mere presence of such signals is insufficient for zzso to zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso a silent zzso sequence zzso is located 7 zzso upstream of the zzso branch point zzso In order to investigate whether other factors, in addition to the zzso zzso zzso affect branch point selection in zzso we created a zzso zzso by converting the zzso to a strong branch point signal zzso If simply having a zzso zzso sequence were sufficient for zzso formation, a zzso ratio in usage of the two signals should have been zzso In this double branch point zzso however, the downstream zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from the analyses of numerous sequence zzso zzso the two zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso sequences in the branch point region are able to define zzso zzso zzso we conclude that U2 zzso is not the only requirement determining branch point selection in zzso and local structure in the vicinity of the branch point could play a critical role in its zzso
