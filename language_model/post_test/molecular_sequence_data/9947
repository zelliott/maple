The zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are zzso within the zzso zzso They are needed for zzso but do not zzso any known structural or regulatory zzso They may be involved in zzso protein export, which proceeds by a type III export zzso The genes have been cloned and zzso The sequences predict proteins with molecular masses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All four gene products were identified zzso consistent with their high zzso zzso content, they zzso with the membrane zzso From zzso zzso acid sequence analysis, we conclude that zzso starts immediately after zzso rather than at a previously proposed site zzso zzso existed in two forms, a zzso form and a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of the zzso form demonstrated that it had undergone zzso of a signal zzso rare process for zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso at the zzso site resulted in impaired processing, which reduced, but did not zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in swarm plate zzso A cloned zzso zzso the mature form of the protein could also complement the zzso zzso but did so even more zzso Finally, when the first zzso span of zzso (a zzso membrane protein that does not undergo signal zzso zzso was fused to the mature form of zzso the fusion protein zzso very zzso Higher levels of synthesis of the zzso proteins greatly improved zzso We conclude that, for zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso is important zzso but not absolutely zzso
