The effect of a series of zzso zzso zzso on the expression of the surface zzso zzso gene of human zzso B virus zzso was examined using zzso zzso cells that contain integrated zzso zzso Of a number of zzso zzso tested, synthetic zzso directed at the cap site of zzso and regions of the zzso initiation site of the zzso gene were found to be highly effective and inhibited viral gene expression by as much as zzso The zzso was specific to the zzso gene and appeared to be at the level of zzso These results suggest a therapeutic potential for zzso zzso in the treatment of patients who are chronically infected with zzso
