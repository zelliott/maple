The DNA sequence and zzso pattern of the zzso gene from the spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso were zzso The zzso zzso gene codes for a protein 81 zzso acids in zzso this is the shortest zzso zzso identified thus zzso A novel characteristic of the zzso zzso gene is that it contains tandem late initiation sites zzso having different zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequences of other zzso gene products showed that they each appear to have a similar zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso which zzso as zzso zzso Another feature of the zzso N zzso is that the central region of the zzso domain resembles a bend or hairpin loop and could fold into a hairpin or form a bent rod zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso is likely to be a step leading to the formation of zzso zzso bodies in infected zzso
