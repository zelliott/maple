zzso 2 and zzso 2 of the zzso zzso gene from 20 individuals were cloned and zzso and eight zzso were zzso Based on our analysis, the zzso diversity of the zzso end of zzso 2 was higher than the synonymous zzso diversity of zzso 2, which may be due to the lower zzso content and the zzso zzso In contrast, the opposite phenomenon was observed for the 3' end of zzso 2, which may be the result of the zzso between the 3' end and zzso end of zzso 2 and the subsequent genetic zzso The results indicated that different regions of zzso 2 in the zzso gene had different evolutionary zzso
