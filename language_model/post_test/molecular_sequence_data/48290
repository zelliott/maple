We present evidence for the directed formation of ice by zzso communities dominated by zzso zzso sampled from the zzso zzso Great zzso We zzso that ice formation promotes attachment of these zzso zzso to zzso ice, thereby maintaining a favorable position for the zzso in the zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether the zzso themselves are responsible for ice zzso zzso electron zzso revealed associations of bacterial zzso with the dominant zzso of the zzso zzso and bacteria isolated from the zzso showed elevated temperatures of zzso zzso as high as zzso zzso Ice zzso bacteria were identified as belonging to the zzso zzso but we could not demonstrate that they were sufficiently abundant to incite the observed zzso Regardless of the source of ice nucleation activity, the resulting production of zzso ice may provide a means for the zzso to be recruited to the zzso lake ice, thereby increasing their zzso zzso zzso are likewise expected to benefit from their association with the zzso as recipients of organic carbon zzso by their zzso This novel mechanism illuminates a previously zzso stage of the life cycle of the zzso zzso that bloom in Lake Erie and other Great Lakes during winter and offers a model relevant to aquatic zzso having seasonal ice cover around the zzso
