The primary structure of mouse zzso was deduced by zzso sequencing of zzso clones isolated from a mouse zzso zzso zzso The largest zzso with zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso a zzso open reading frame terminated by a zzso zzso and a zzso 3' untranslated end, including one potential zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso contains a zzso zzso acid signal zzso This zzso signal sequence is followed by zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso light and the heavy chain of 23 and 380 zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso active site segments zzso zzso and zzso are part of the heavy chain, as well as a zzso zzso which is not present in any other zzso zzso studied so zzso zzso the zzso expression of the zzso gene during mouse zzso was zzso
