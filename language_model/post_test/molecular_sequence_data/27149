The zzso zzso zzso are zzso that catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso in fatty acid and zzso acid zzso Eleven zzso are now recognized in the zzso human zzso and several zzso have been reported from bacteria, zzso plants, and zzso We performed a systematic comparative zzso study, zzso zzso searches with methods of zzso zzso to investigate the evolutionary history of this zzso zzso analyses indicate origin of the family in the common zzso of zzso zzso and zzso illustrating its essential role in the metabolism of early zzso At least three zzso were already present at that time: ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two gene zzso were unique to the zzso zzso one resulted in the zzso and zzso zzso and another in the zzso and zzso zzso The overall zzso distribution of specific zzso across the tree of life is the result of dynamic evolution that includes numerous rounds of gene zzso and secondary losses, zzso lateral gene transfer events, zzso of cellular zzso and evolution of novel proteins by domain zzso Our finding that zzso zzso species are more closely related to bacterial zzso is consistent with zzso origin of zzso in zzso and further supported by the zzso of all nine previously studied zzso in zzso
