In zzso the fascinating processes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso Interestingly, most of the molecules are zzso of zzso To understand the role of zzso in the aforementioned processes at molecular level, we isolated a zzso that belongs to the zzso family, from a central nervous system zzso library of zzso zzso We monitored the spatial and zzso zzso of the zzso by using Northern zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that this gene expresses abundantly in the zzso zzso zzso while faintly in the zzso and central nervous zzso However, no signal was detected in other zzso including muscle, zzso and zzso Its expression levels in zzso zzso tissue during various stages of maturation as well as through the whole zzso cycle showed that prawn zzso is involved in sexual zzso as the zzso level was observed just after zzso
