We demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is incomplete under normal conditions, resulting in low yields or zzso zzso This phenomenon does not occur if the zzso is zzso nor for zzso zzso zzso Studies on the zzso of H zzso show that the incomplete zzso is due to the extremely slow removal of a zzso group close to an zzso zzso The use of the new zzso protecting group overcomes this problem resulting in rapid and complete zzso
