Following primary infection with zzso virus zzso the virus establishes a zzso infection in zzso The molecular zzso of zzso zzso is not well zzso mainly due to the lack of an adequate animal zzso We report here that we have developed a mouse model for zzso infection that involves zzso zzso of zzso Although infected animals showed no signs of disease, most of the animals could not eliminate the virus early after zzso By zzso we demonstrated that at 33 days zzso zzso viral DNA was still present in more than zzso of the animals zzso zzso DNA was most frequently detected in the zzso zzso zzso followed by the brain stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and brain zzso By in zzso zzso a few cells positive for zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and zzso of a small number of the infected animals as late as 33 days zzso No viral proteins were detected at the site of zzso or in any other tissue by zzso Our results suggest that zzso spreads in mice by both zzso and zzso transport and establishes a zzso zzso zzso
