Association of the zzso zzso factor with the zzso and zzso proteins appears to regulate the activity of zzso and, in turn, affect cell cycle zzso We found, however, that zzso and zzso are only minor zzso proteins in zzso mouse zzso and we sought to identify the major zzso partner protein in these zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso seemed able to bind to the zzso zzso partner, we enriched for proteins that associated both with an zzso site DNA column and with zzso The major species in zzso and early zzso zzso detected with this approach had properties identical to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso replaced zzso as the major zzso protein near the zzso border, zzso with an increase in zzso protein zzso zzso complexes resembled zzso complexes in their ability to bind to zzso zzso and they appeared to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso in late zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso factors are regulated by a succession of partner proteins with which they associate during defined stages of the cell zzso
