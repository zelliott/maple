zzso zzso is a plasma zzso sodium pump that maintains the zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso which in turn controls the cellular resting membrane zzso evidence suggests that the pump is also localized at zzso and regulates synaptic zzso its precise function at the zzso is zzso Here we show that two zzso in the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso dramatically increase the sensitivity to zzso zzso and alter the zzso of zzso zzso receptors at the zzso junction zzso defects can be rescued by zzso zzso proteins which lack its pump activity, suggesting the presence of a novel function for zzso zzso The zzso zzso accumulates at zzso sites and appears to surround zzso receptors to maintain rigid clusters at the zzso Our findings suggest a pump zzso zzso role for zzso zzso on zzso organization and synaptic zzso
