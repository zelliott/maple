A new cocktail has been developed for zzso and zzso of zzso peptides zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso The cocktail zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso water zzso zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso was designed to minimize zzso zzso zzso Application of the new cocktail zzso zzso is demonstrated with the synthesis of a model zzso from the active site of zzso a zzso protein involved in protein zzso bond zzso The model zzso which contains one zzso and two zzso zzso was zzso with several zzso cocktails, including zzso zzso The crude peptides obtained with the widely used cocktails K, R and B were found to be zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso form, whereas no zzso zzso was detected in the crude zzso obtained by zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Also, no zzso zzso was detected when zzso zzso zzso was added to cocktails K, R and zzso however, the yield of the desired zzso was less than with zzso zzso A second 28 zzso acid model zzso of the active site of zzso was also zzso and zzso with zzso zzso The reduced zzso form of the zzso was found to be the major component zzso zzso of the crude zzso obtained by zzso for 3 zzso When the zzso time was extended to 10 zzso the zzso was converted to the zzso zzso form zzso zzso A proposed mechanism for the in zzso zzso of zzso with zzso H is zzso
