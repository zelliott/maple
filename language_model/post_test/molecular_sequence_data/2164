The zzso zzso modification gene was cloned and located by zzso zzso and DNA sequence zzso The zzso gene product, zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso of several zzso zzso The translation start of zzso was deduced by comparison with zzso which encodes a zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso coli zzso zzso has a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cassette zzso zzso and zzso zzso mapping of in zzso zzso zzso were used to examine the relationship between zzso and zzso which encodes a zzso necessary for zzso mismatch zzso The combined results showed that zzso zzso and a gene that encodes a zzso zzso occur very close together, are transcribed in the same direction in the order zzso zzso zzso and likely form a complex zzso containing a weak internal zzso Three additional relationships were demonstrated between zzso and the zzso gene or zzso zzso zzso First, zzso zzso was induced by zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the spontaneous zzso frequency with a spectrum distinct from zzso zzso Third, limitation of zzso bacteria for iron, which causes zzso zzso from zzso to zzso also increased spontaneous zzso zzso These results support the notion that complex zzso organize metabolically related genes whose primary functions appear to be completely zzso In addition, the results are consistent with the idea that mechanisms exist to increase spontaneous zzso frequency when cells need to adapt to environmental zzso
