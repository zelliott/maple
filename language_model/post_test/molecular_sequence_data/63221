zzso an infectious disease with global impact, is caused by zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso functional zzso technologies now offer the opportunity to investigate all aspects of the zzso which has led to an increased demand for comprehensive protein expression clone zzso zzso zzso for zzso would encourage comprehensive analyses of immune responses and zzso functional studies that could lead to improved vaccine and therapeutic zzso Here, we report the production of the zzso clone set for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso collection of zzso zzso This collection includes 3,761 zzso clones from zzso targeted zzso zzso The zzso were captured in a zzso cloning zzso to facilitate zzso transfer of zzso zzso into suitable expression zzso To demonstrate its application, approximately zzso of the collection was transferred into the relevant expression zzso and used to produce a protein zzso by zzso zzso and capturing the proteins in zzso on the array surface with zzso zzso In a second application, a method to screen for protein triggers of zzso receptors zzso was zzso We tested in zzso proteins for their ability to stimulate zzso in zzso zzso This approach appropriately identified zzso and previously zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso fully zzso zzso collection reported here will be useful for zzso functional zzso zzso immune response studies, structure biology, and other zzso
