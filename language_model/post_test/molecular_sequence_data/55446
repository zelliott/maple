zzso is the central free intermediate in the degradation of wood by zzso gut microbes and can reach zzso exceeding those measured for any other biological zzso zzso zzso targeting the largest family of zzso zzso observed in a zzso gut zzso have been used to explore the evolution and representation of these zzso in zzso zzso were cloned from the guts of the higher termites zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso Each gut sample zzso a more rich and evenly distributed population of zzso sequences than observed previously in the guts of lower termites and zzso zzso This zzso the zzso importance of hydrogen for higher zzso gut zzso and may reflect an increased zzso burden, or zzso opportunity, created by a lack of gut zzso The sequences were zzso distinct from previously zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comparisons revealed zzso between host zzso and zzso sequence library zzso zzso This may reflect the combined influences of the stable intimate relationship of gut microbes with their host and environmental zzso in the gut that have occurred over the course of zzso zzso These results accentuate the zzso importance of hydrogen to zzso gut zzso
