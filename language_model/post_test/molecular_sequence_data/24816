zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1) is a zzso factor which binds to the zzso zzso promoter regulatory element zzso In order to clarify the function of zzso we determined the complete human zzso zzso structure and regulatory element in the promoter zzso The gene spans about zzso zzso and has three zzso Its promoter region has multiple zzso boxes, zzso binding site, one zzso response element zzso and no zzso box with multiple zzso initiation sites, which is characteristic of zzso and growth regulating zzso zzso analysis showed that the promoter was more active in zzso cells entered into the cell cycle by serum stimulation than zzso zzso Further promoter analysis revealed that zzso at zzso is essential for full promoter activity, and zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso response element binding protein 1 proteins bind to this zzso These structural characteristics and the promoter function suggest that zzso may play a role in cell cycle zzso
