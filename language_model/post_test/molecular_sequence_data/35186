DNA zzso has been studied in many zzso organisms, in particular zzso and was implicated in zzso and zzso zzso Little is known about the role of DNA zzso in zzso although insects are considered as excellent models for studying the evolution of DNA zzso In the red flour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no evidence of DNA zzso has been found till zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso sensitive restriction zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso in zzso is followed by a global zzso in larvae, zzso and zzso DNA zzso seems to proceed actively through zzso most probably by the action of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a highly abundant satellite DNA located in zzso zzso revealed similar profile of zzso zzso in adults and zzso zzso zzso was not only restricted to zzso sites but was found at zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, complete zzso zzso of zzso satellite DNA was induced by heat zzso The results reveal existence of DNA zzso cycling in zzso zzso ranging from strong overall zzso zzso in zzso to a weak DNA zzso in other zzso zzso Nevertheless, DNA zzso is preserved within zzso during development, indicating its role in zzso formation and zzso It is, however, strongly affected by heat stress, suggesting a role for DNA zzso in zzso structure zzso during heat stress zzso
