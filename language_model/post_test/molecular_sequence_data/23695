DNA zzso are essential zzso in cells due to their ability to join DNA strand breaks formed during DNA zzso Several zzso zzso strains of zzso coli, including strain zzso have been described which can be zzso by functional DNA zzso Here, it is shown that the zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso strain is a zzso to zzso transition at base 43, which results in a substitution of zzso by zzso at zzso zzso The protein product of this gene zzso is accumulated to a similar level at zzso and zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso at 20 degrees C zzso zzso has zzso lower zzso activity in zzso and its activity is reduced further at 42 degrees C, resulting in zzso lower zzso activity than zzso zzso It is proposed that the zzso in zzso affects the structure of the zzso region of zzso The resulting decrease in DNA zzso activity at the zzso temperature is likely to occur as the result of a zzso change that reduces the rate of zzso of the zzso
