DNA was amplified from lung samples from three zzso infected with zzso zzso using zzso zzso designed to the zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the amplification product was determined and indicated lack of sequence variation among these zzso zzso zzso samples at this zzso The data showed that zzso zzso zzso was genetically distinct from zzso zzso isolated from other zzso host zzso
