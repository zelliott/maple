Previously we have zzso using two-dimensional zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso protein increased in zzso carp zzso zzso zzso K, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fisheries zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify the coordinate expression in various zzso of carp zzso with temperature zzso we examined the differences in zzso levels of zzso proteins zzso by both nuclear and zzso genes in fast muscle of carp zzso to 10 and 30 degrees zzso The zzso levels of nuclear genes per unit weight of total zzso were nearly twofold higher in the 10 degrees zzso than 30 degrees zzso zzso However, the transcripts of zzso genes for the 10 degrees zzso carp in terms of the same comparing unit were six to seven times as much as those for the 30 degrees zzso zzso The zzso activities measured at 10, 25, and 30 degrees C were nearly twofold higher for the zzso fish than their zzso zzso Such quantitative and qualitative changes in carp zzso may contribute to extra zzso production required to compensate for energy balance at zzso zzso
