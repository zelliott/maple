The basic zzso domain of zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso a major protein zzso C zzso binds zzso to zzso lipids on the inner leaflet of the plasma zzso interaction with zzso or protein zzso C zzso reverses this zzso Our working hypothesis is that the zzso domain of zzso zzso sequesters a significant fraction of the zzso zzso zzso on the plasma zzso To test this, we zzso three techniques that measure the ability of a zzso corresponding to its zzso domain, zzso to zzso zzso in model zzso containing zzso relevant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we measure zzso resonance energy transfer from zzso to Texas Red zzso zzso to large zzso zzso Second, we detect zzso of zzso in large zzso zzso when zzso zzso binds to zzso Third, we identify line broadening in the electron zzso resonance zzso of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso calculations zzso the zzso relation to atomic models of the zzso and zzso and experimental results zzso resonance energy transfer and zzso at different salt zzso suggest that zzso zzso interactions produce this zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso but not binding of its zzso domain to zzso decreases markedly as zzso sequesters most of the zzso
