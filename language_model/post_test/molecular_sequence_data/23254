We present a theoretical study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was designed to form an zzso triplex by folding back twice on zzso At neutral pH the zzso exists in a duplex hairpin zzso whereas at zzso pH the zzso labeled by an asterisk (*) are zzso forming zzso hydrogen bonds with zzso of a zzso zzso zzso to generate a zzso As a first step in an investigation of the zzso of the zzso transition, we applied the zzso multiple site model of zzso to calculate the zzso zzso for the two zzso Based on these data, a two-state model is used to study the equilibrium properties of zzso Although this model properly describes the thermodynamics of the zzso steps that drive the zzso of the zzso it cannot provide insight into the zzso mechanism of the zzso A series of molecular dynamics simulations using the zzso force field of the zzso zzso package was therefore run to explore the dynamics of the zzso zzso The molecular dynamics method was combined with zzso calculations to determine when a change in zzso state was warranted during a zzso This revealed a sequence of elementary zzso steps during the zzso transition and suggests a strong zzso between zzso and folding in zzso zzso zzso
