The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso process of rod zzso A previous report indicated that experimental zzso zzso zzso could be induced in Lewis rats by zzso with zzso In this study, we identified the zzso site of zzso synthetic peptides and identified pivotal zzso acid zzso using analogue zzso 

Several synthetic peptides derived from zzso plus zzso were injected in Lewis zzso The induction of zzso was examined clinically and zzso In addition, zzso and cellular immunity against peptides was zzso 

The smallest zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso which consists of 13 zzso acid zzso and the core sequence was identified as zzso zzso zzso which consists of 7 zzso acid zzso The lowest dose of zzso to induce zzso was zzso zzso The pivotal zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso are at zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Our findings demonstrated the presence of a potent zzso site in zzso whose potency in Lewis rats was comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso
