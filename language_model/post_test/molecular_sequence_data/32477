zzso surveys for small zzso zzso zzso infections have revealed zzso sheep in several mixed zzso where sheep are kept together with zzso zzso Here we have examined the genetic relationships in zzso pol and zzso surface unit zzso and the growth patterns in goat zzso and sheep zzso zzso membrane cell cultures of zzso zzso obtained from both mixed and single species zzso zzso analyses of pol and zzso zzso revealed that Norwegian zzso derived from both goat and sheep in mixed zzso are distributed into group C, while zzso obtained from zzso sheep flocks cluster in group A, together with zzso representatives of the A1 zzso In this study, the direction of group C virus transmission is proposed to be from goat to zzso The replication efficiency in zzso and zzso cultures and the zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso gave no indication of any zzso zzso No particular zzso sequences of the zzso region or zzso zzso were identified that could be related to zzso zzso This study shows that sheep in Norway zzso zzso belonging to zzso groups A and C, and this provides further evidence for zzso infection being a regular characteristic of zzso which may represent an important source for viral zzso
