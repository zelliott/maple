The zzso regulation of chicken zzso zzso in smooth muscle cells was zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso and was distributed zzso in vascular and visceral smooth muscles in chick zzso In a primary culture of smooth muscle cells, zzso zzso expression was dramatically zzso during zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso region zzso to zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso in differentiated smooth muscle cells but not in zzso smooth muscle cells or chick zzso zzso Like other alpha zzso zzso the promoter region of the zzso zzso gene lacks zzso and zzso boxes and contains binding sites for zzso and zzso The essential difference from other alpha zzso promoters is the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso motif was an essential zzso for zzso zzso in differentiated smooth muscle cells, whereas the binding sites for zzso and zzso were zzso Using specific zzso a nuclear protein factor specifically bound to the zzso zzso motif was identified as serum response zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso expression in smooth muscle cells is regulated zzso in a zzso manner and that serum response factor binding plays a crucial role in this zzso
