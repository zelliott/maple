A fungus with the ability to zzso a zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as its sole source of nitrogen was isolated from soil and identified as zzso zzso zzso Both intact zzso and zzso extract of the strain zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso and produced zzso as an zzso thereby indicating that a zzso and an zzso zzso participated in the degradation of zzso The zzso catalyzing the zzso of zzso was zzso approximately zzso from the zzso extract of strain zzso with a yield of zzso The molecular mass of the active zzso was estimated to be 160 zzso The zzso appears to exist as a zzso each zzso having a molecular mass of 40 zzso The zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso with a zzso activity 2 zzso zzso times greater than for zzso The kinetic parameters for zzso and zzso indicated that zzso isolated from zzso zzso was a cyanide zzso able to zzso a broad range of zzso compounds and zzso as zzso
