In zzso blood zzso 5 zzso factor zzso zzso factor IX zzso factor X zzso protein C zzso and zzso act with two zzso factor V and factor VIII to control the generation of zzso zzso evidence and molecular cloning data have previously indicated that blood zzso involving tissue factor, zzso and zzso is present in all zzso Using zzso zzso we have isolated and characterized novel zzso with sequence identity to the blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso from chicken and the zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparative sequence analysis all support the existence of the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso FX, PC and the zzso domain protein zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso These results strongly suggest that the blood zzso network is present in all zzso zzso and evolved before the divergence of zzso and zzso over 430 million years ago; and that zzso blood zzso may have benefited from two rounds of gene or whole zzso zzso zzso identified in zzso coding for additional zzso zzso and zzso sequences support the possibility of further tandem and large-scale zzso in zzso Comparative sequence analyses of zzso acid zzso in the active site region suggest these additional sequences have evolved new and as yet unknown zzso
