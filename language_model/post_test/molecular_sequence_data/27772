The zzso zzso which zzso to sequence 124 to 137 of zzso zzso was zzso and tested as zzso for protein zzso C zzso Although a typical recognition sequence for zzso consisting of a cluster of basic zzso is found on the zzso side of zzso its zzso was totally prevented by the presence of the two zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Three zzso in which zzso zzso were successively replaced with zzso were studied and the influence of the zzso side chain in modulating zzso by zzso was thus possible to zzso The results show that the presence of a single zzso zzso located in positions zzso or zzso with respect to the zzso zzso can almost totally abolish the positive effect of a highly favorable cluster of basic zzso These observations highlight the role of negative zzso specificity zzso in settling the protein zzso profile of protein zzso zzso
