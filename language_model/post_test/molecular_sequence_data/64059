A strain of zzso zzso was isolated from an invasive alternative host species, zzso zzso Its genetic relationship with strains isolated from a native alternative host, wild zzso a zzso alternative host, zzso and other economically important hosts including cultivated zzso zzso zzso oak, maple and zzso was determined by using sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our zzso analysis revealed that the zzso berry strain is most closely related to the wild grape zzso These two strains are more closely related to the oak, zzso and plum strains than to the mulberry and zzso zzso They are separated from the maple and cultivated grape zzso Our data suggest that suppression of zzso zzso wild zzso and mulberry in the vicinity of susceptible economically important hosts such as oak, zzso and plum may provide an important control measure for diseases caused by zzso zzso
