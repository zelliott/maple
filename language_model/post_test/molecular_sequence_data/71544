We have dissected the zzso II gene of members of the two recently characterized zzso of zzso zzso to obtain further evidence to support this zzso of zzso in this important zzso zzso field gel zzso showed a striking zzso in the molecular zzso of the strains zzso Southern analysis of these zzso gels also showed zzso in the size and number of zzso containing the zzso II zzso Analysis of DNA restriction zzso length zzso of the zzso II gene also showed two principal patterns consistent with the two previously characterized zzso Finally, the sequences of portions of the zzso II genes from members of the zzso zzso groups showed two distinct patterns, again consistent with the previous grouping of this zzso Thus, this work clearly supports previous observations suggesting an ancient divergence of known zzso zzso zzso into two main zzso
