The temperate zzso zzso zzso its DNA into the zzso of zzso zzso strains via zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the attachment sites identified a zzso identity region which surprisingly zzso both the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso of a host zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA segment, covering zzso the zzso zzso and a likely immunity gene contained all the genetic information for faithful integration of a zzso zzso into the zzso zzso A deletion within the zzso gene led to the loss of integration zzso A number of spontaneous deletions were observed in plasmids containing the zzso zzso DNA zzso The deletion sites were localized to the zzso side of the identity region and to zzso or zzso DNA with 3- to zzso repeats from the border zzso A similar type of deletion was previously observed in a spontaneous zzso zzso
