A factor X molecular zzso was identified in a 55-year-old woman at a routine zzso zzso zzso Plasma factor X zzso was normal, whereas factor X activity was decreased when factor X was activated by either the zzso zzso zzso the intrinsic zzso zzso or the factor X zzso from Russell zzso zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso was isolated from plasma by zzso zzso and compared with normal factor X zzso by the same zzso zzso of factor zzso by factor zzso or by zzso in a zzso system showed that the rate of zzso was zzso whereas once produced, factor zzso had a normal zzso efficiency for either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The rate of zzso of factor zzso by zzso III was also zzso zzso zzso of factor zzso by factor zzso or by zzso was the consequence of a zzso decrease in the zzso for the zzso of factor zzso while the zzso of zzso or factor zzso for factor X was zzso We have determined the molecular basis of the zzso in the factor zzso gene by amplification of all eight zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the amplified zzso and subsequent sequence zzso The patient was zzso for a zzso zzso in zzso VIII, resulting in the substitution of zzso by zzso From comparison of three-dimensional models of various zzso zzso it appears that zzso is located within a zzso variable region of factor zzso This observation suggests that the zzso zzso either is responsible for a zzso of the active sites of specific factor X zzso in close proximity to the zzso site, or that the zzso zzso alters the spatial orientation of the zzso site by zzso modifications of factor X zzso
