In this study, each of 60 zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso 1 and zzso sequences was determined from 44 individuals of 14 zzso identified New World sand fly zzso species in Ecuador, and their zzso and zzso genetic diversity was zzso zzso between related species based on the zzso sequence was difficult because of zzso while the genetic diversity of zzso was distinct even among closely related zzso Further, an assessment of zzso ITS sequence diversity in the zzso zzso revealed no correlation between sequence variation and geographic zzso The results strongly suggested zzso to be a more suitable marker than zzso for the zzso analysis of zzso species including closely related zzso Moreover, neither ITS sequence may be useful for the analysis of population structures in zzso zzso
