In the marine zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is a zzso cell zzso zzso protein specifically zzso under conditions of restricted zzso zzso zzso availability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mann, and zzso zzso Carr, zzso zzso zzso zzso We have assessed its use as a potential diagnostic marker for the P status of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso was observed when the zzso concentration fell below 50 zzso demonstrating that the protein is induced at zzso of zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso expression could be specifically detected by use of standard Western zzso zzso techniques in natural zzso samples under conditions in which the zzso ratio was artificially manipulated to force P zzso In addition, we have developed an zzso zzso that can detect zzso expression in single zzso cells both in laboratory cultures and natural zzso We show that zzso raised against zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells, extending the use of these zzso to both major groups of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso demonstrated high zzso acid sequence identity zzso with the marine zzso zzso strain zzso zzso including those zzso in zzso coli zzso known to be directly involved in zzso zzso
