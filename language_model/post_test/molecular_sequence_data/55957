It has been proposed that the structure of the zzso that zzso the triple zzso domain of the zzso collagen genes arose by repeated tandem zzso of an ancestral unit zzso Because these zzso zzso a repeat motif zzso sequence zzso between zzso may have driven the zzso zzso We have characterized a tandem zzso zzso within a zzso zzso of type I collagen from an infant with the lethal form of osteogenesis zzso The structure of the zzso is consistent with the occurrence of an unequal crossover within a 15 base pair region of sequence identity between zzso 14 and 17 of the zzso zzso The zzso produced a new 81 base pair zzso hybrid zzso and complete zzso of zzso 15 and zzso The sequence implies zzso of 60 zzso acid zzso within the triple zzso domain with preservation of the zzso zzso These data suggest that a zzso mechanism that explains the hypothetical evolutionary process is active in cells, but the lethal effect of this zzso raises questions about the role of these events in creating new structures for zzso zzso
