A member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso factor zzso family was identified in zzso zzso contains 7 zinc finger zzso followed by a zzso domain, similar to zzso zzso and other members of the family identified in data bases from zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso binding to different members of the human zzso zzso family showed that this protein can interact through its zzso domain with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso can also zzso and binds to human zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso interacts with human zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso and zzso By itself, zzso did not induce significant zzso zzso when zzso in zzso cells, although it specifically increased zzso induction by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso induction was partially inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso lacking the zzso region inhibited zzso induction by either zzso or zzso zzso specifically associated with the regulatory zzso domain of zzso a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, though zzso and zzso individually were unable to induce zzso in a human cell line, zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in significant zzso zzso zzso of zzso with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins imply strong evolutionary conservation of zzso protein structure and function throughout zzso zzso
