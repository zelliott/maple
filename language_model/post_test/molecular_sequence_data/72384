The zzso (35 zzso corresponding to the basic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso In a previous paper, we have shown that during its binding to the DNA site zzso zzso zzso the zzso structure was converted into zzso from an initial random zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso El zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggested both a high flexibility and a zzso potential in zzso these two properties seeming crucial for the accommodation of the basic zzso of zzso to its specific DNA zzso In this work, we assessed the zzso zzso of zzso through the study of the secondary structures of its zzso and zzso fragments in zzso zzso zzso using zzso transform infrared zzso zzso The zzso results were critically analyzed in light of our previously reported circular zzso zzso and zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon addition of zzso the relative areas of the seven components of the zzso zzso band zzso zzso reflected the conversion of a large amount of random zzso zzso into zzso for the two fragments and zzso This effect was accompanied by more subtle variations of the less populated structures, in agreement with the results of CD and zzso zzso The zzso results stipulated the conservation of the parent zzso secondary structures in both zzso however, zzso and zzso peptides did not display similar zzso stabilization pattern upon additions of zzso to zzso zzso The profile from CD signal at 222 zzso was found zzso for zzso and almost linear for zzso while that corresponding to the parent zzso zzso was just in between those of its zzso Thus, the present study confirms the high flexibility and zzso propensity of the zzso basic zzso and suggests that the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso do not follow the same zzso conversion profile during their zzso with zzso
