Most zzso proteins consist of various zzso with distinct zzso zzso in one common type, the zzso zzso growth zzso module zzso can lead to a variety of genetic zzso Here, we describe as a model system structural and functional consequences of two typical zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso zzso Large zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso Both zzso did not alter synthesis and zzso of the zzso into the culture zzso zzso zzso after rotary zzso and comparison of circular zzso zzso exhibited minor structural differences between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were significantly more susceptible to zzso degradation by a variety of zzso as compared with their zzso zzso Most of the sensitive zzso sites were mapped close to the zzso indicating local structural changes within the zzso zzso zzso Other zzso sites, however, were observed at distances beyond the domain containing the zzso suggesting longer range structural effects within zzso repeated zzso zzso We suggest that zzso degradation of zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso syndrome and related zzso
