Growth factor receptors play an important role in zzso In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of zzso we initiated a study investigating the zzso factors zzso the expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso alpha zzso Here, we demonstrate that the human zzso zzso alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity in a zzso fashion in zzso cells, which zzso with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha promoter contains an important functional site between positions zzso and zzso as identified by deletion analysis of reporter zzso We show that the zzso and B cell zzso factor zzso binds specifically to this zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that a zzso site located upstream of the zzso site between positions zzso and zzso is involved in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso alpha promoter zzso zzso alpha is the major zzso protein zzso form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso Point zzso of either the zzso site or the zzso site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of zzso zzso alpha promoter activity in zzso cells zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that in zzso and B cell zzso zzso forms a novel, specific, more slowly zzso complex zzso when binding the zzso zzso alpha promoter zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with zzso on a zzso zzso binding zzso The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to B cell zzso sites and can be formed by addition of zzso to extracts from certain zzso cell types which do not express zzso including T cells and zzso cells, but not from zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso complex binds to zzso sites found on a number of zzso zzso and its formation requires an intact zzso site adjacent to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells can activate the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso results in a failure to form the zzso complex and in a zzso loss of zzso suggesting that formation of the zzso complex is of functional importance for the activity of the zzso zzso alpha zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso alpha can also active the zzso zzso alpha promoter in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso alpha direct the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso further establish the role of zzso as a key regulator of zzso and point to zzso alpha as an additional important factor in this zzso
