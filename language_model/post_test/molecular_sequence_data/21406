Eight strains belonging to the zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso marina zzso in The Netherlands over the past 25 zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso relationships and ITS zzso these strains were found to belong to two different zzso zzso Five zzso four of them isolated from rotting seeds and one isolated from zzso plants, could not be assigned to a known species and hence belong to a new species for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso Three strains were isolated from zzso plants and were identified as zzso zzso thereby expanding the known habitat range of this species from fresh to zzso zzso The possible role of both zzso species in the decline of zzso marina in The Netherlands and the evolutionary significance of the presence of zzso species in marine environments are zzso
