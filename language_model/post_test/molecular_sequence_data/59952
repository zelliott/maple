Recent theoretical and experimental investigations referring to the origin of zzso are reviewed and integrated into the zzso known state of the zzso Attention is directed to an extraterrestrial scenario, which describes the interaction of zzso polarized zzso radiation with interstellar organic zzso Following this zzso hypothesis, zzso active molecules could be transferred to Earth via zzso We plan to identify any zzso enhancement in organic molecules of the zzso matter in zzso The present preliminary experimental study intends to zzso zzso conditions for the separation of zzso into their zzso constituents on the surface of the comet zzso zzso zzso pairs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been separated with the help of a stationary zzso zzso We are still developing a technique that will enable us to detect any zzso enhancement of specific simple organic molecules both in zzso or zzso matter in zzso and in meteorites found on zzso
