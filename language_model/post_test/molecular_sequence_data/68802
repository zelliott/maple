The zzso resistance gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was zzso The gene was identified as a coding sequence of zzso zzso corresponding to a protein with a calculated mass of zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence suggested that it was the fourth member of a zzso of zzso zzso The resistance gene was not zzso either by zzso to zzso coli or to zzso zzso or by transformation into zzso zzso zzso DNA from strain zzso did not zzso with an zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a zzso location for this zzso The gene was detected by DNA zzso in all 20 strains of zzso zzso tested but not in 179 other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of which 162 were zzso zzso The probe did not zzso in dot zzso zzso with zzso zzso from members of the families zzso and zzso that zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso gene is species specific and may be used to identify zzso zzso
