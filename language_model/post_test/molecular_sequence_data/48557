zzso zzso receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system and play a major role in zzso synaptic zzso All three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso assemble as zzso of four zzso zzso There is good evidence that both zzso zzso and zzso receptors have a zzso zzso zzso and an alternating zzso zzso Recent studies based on presumed structural zzso have indicated that zzso receptors adopt the same zzso Here, we use atomic force zzso imaging of zzso complexes to show that whereas the zzso zzso zzso assembles with an alternating zzso zzso zzso arrangement, the zzso zzso zzso adopts an adjacent zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the two types of zzso zzso zzso are built in different ways from their constituent zzso This surprising finding zzso a reassessment of the assembly of these important zzso
