Most bacterial infections are initiated by the adherence of zzso to host zzso This process involves the interaction of specific bacterial surface structures, called zzso with host zzso In this review, we discuss a group of microbial zzso known as zzso Surface zzso Recognizing zzso zzso zzso zzso which recognize and bind zzso The interaction of bacteria with zzso is believed to contribute significantly to the zzso of a number of zzso including zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso of zzso and zzso exhibit a similar structural organization and mechanism of zzso zzso The zzso domain consists of tandem repeats of a approximately 45 zzso acid long unit which bind to the zzso zzso region of zzso The binding mechanism is unusual in that the repeat units are zzso and appear to undergo a zzso change upon zzso zzso Apart from supporting bacterial zzso zzso is also involved in bacterial entry into zzso zzso zzso A sandwich model has been proposed in which zzso forms a molecular bridge between zzso on the bacterial surface and zzso on the host zzso However, the precise mechanism of bacterial invasion and the roles of zzso and zzso in this process have yet to be fully zzso
