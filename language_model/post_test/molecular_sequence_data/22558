zzso T zzso zzso are critical for the control of human zzso virus, but zzso of virus replication can be undermined by zzso in zzso zzso that lead to virus zzso We analyzed the evolution in zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso and found two principal, zzso opposed evolutionary pathways that exclusively affect T zzso contact zzso One zzso was characterized by acquisition of zzso escape zzso and the other by selection for zzso zzso zzso The pattern of zzso responses to zzso zzso shaped which zzso prevailed in the virus zzso The pathways notably influenced the amount of plasma virus, as patients with efficient zzso selection had lower plasma viral loads than did patients without efficient zzso Thus, viral escape from zzso responses does not necessarily correlate with disease zzso
