zzso zzso of zzso envelope zzso results in zzso changes in zzso that lead to exposure of the zzso zzso domain and fusion with the host cell zzso One zzso at or near the zzso site exposed on zzso subsequent to zzso binding is defined by two human zzso termed zzso and zzso These zzso do not block zzso binding to zzso rather, their binding to zzso is zzso following zzso zzso To determine if synthetic zzso zzso could be found that reflect zzso zzso on the surface of zzso synthetic zzso peptides from 10 divergent zzso zzso were screened for their ability to bind to zzso and zzso in zzso Although zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in our studies zzso selectively bound only to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and not to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso bound none of the peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso zzso and in solution in a competitive zzso but could not bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to human T zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso monkeys that neutralized the zzso zzso MN strain but did not induce zzso that neutralized zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or that neutralized zzso primary zzso These data suggested that the primary sequence of the zzso zzso zzso loop exists in a zzso that zzso a zzso zzso of native zzso exposed subsequent to zzso binding on the surface of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso may provide important information regarding the nature of zzso zzso changes that occur following zzso zzso by zzso
