The ability to specifically zzso gene expression using the zzso zzso in zzso cells has tremendous potential in therapy and in basic zzso However, delivery systems capable of efficient and zzso delivery of zzso to target cells are not yet zzso Here, we report the synthesis and in zzso characterization of ABC zzso zzso that zzso with zzso based on zzso and with each other by zzso zzso The ABC zzso zzso is based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a positively charged zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso of zzso zzso upon a zzso zzso and the zzso domain was coupled to the zzso zzso using a zzso exchange reaction with an zzso zzso zzso on the zzso The peptides were designed to interact zzso with zzso selecting the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso were able to zzso with zzso as demonstrated by dynamic light scattering and gel zzso Complex size was found to be dependent on the amount of zzso used zzso zzso and the length of the zzso zzso block, achieving sizes ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Cell zzso and gene expression zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso are able to transport zzso inside the cell and mediate gene expression zzso with the amount of zzso and gene transfer affected by charge ratio, zzso zzso and the presence of zzso The proposed zzso was able to mediate gene expression zzso of zzso achieving up to zzso zzso zzso zzso
