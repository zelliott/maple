zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in control of zzso and tissue zzso and has been shown to be regulated by a number of cell zzso among those zzso In this study we characterize the zzso induction of zzso in human zzso cell line zzso We found that zzso is tightly regulated in a narrow oxygen zzso After incubation at oxygen zzso of zzso to zzso a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso levels was observed, whereas mild hypoxic conditions of more than zzso did not appear to induce zzso Moreover, increased levels of zzso protein were observed after incubation at low oxygen zzso Through sequence analysis, several putative zzso elements zzso zzso were identified in the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso showed that the zzso zzso to zzso was necessary and sufficient for the zzso zzso By zzso mobility zzso we observed zzso binding of a protein complex to the zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that zzso was specifically recognized by the zzso zzso factor zzso nuclear zzso zzso Taken together, our data demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso through zzso interaction with the zzso site of the human zzso zzso
