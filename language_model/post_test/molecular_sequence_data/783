zzso genes involved in interactions with their plant hosts are expected to evolve under positive zzso selection or balancing zzso In this study a single copy zzso zzso zzso in the plant pathogen zzso zzso was used to investigate the evolution of such a gene across zzso zzso translation zzso factor zzso sequences were obtained to establish zzso relationships among the zzso zzso We amplified zzso zzso from species zzso on hosts from different plant families and orders, across the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences revealed a predicted signal zzso and towards the zzso of the zzso six zzso spaced zzso were identified in all zzso zzso likelihood analysis of synonymous versus zzso substitution rates indicated that positive selection played a role in the evolution of the gene during the diversification of the zzso Fourteen zzso under significant positive selection reside in the zzso 28 zzso acid region, suggesting that this region interacts with host molecules in most zzso zzso zzso pressures on the gene may be either due to the zzso or zzso function of the gene or zzso
