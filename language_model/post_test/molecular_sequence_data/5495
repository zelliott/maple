zzso is an important precursor for zzso and some zzso and is also involved in the zzso zzso of plasma membrane zzso This zzso is zzso from zzso and zzso by zzso zzso an zzso localized in the outer zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso from zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso The activity is dependent on zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The reaction follows a sequential zzso mechanism with binding to zzso before zzso and releasing zzso prior to zzso Unlike most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Its expression is insensitive to the addition of zzso and zzso to culture medium or the transition of growth zzso The primary translate deduced from the zzso zzso zzso comprises 220 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso The sequence contains several zzso regions and resembles that of the human zzso The sequence also contains the local, zzso region found in zzso catalyzing the transfer of the zzso zzso from zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid at position 114 from His zzso to zzso zzso results in a zzso increase in zzso of the zzso for zzso making cells zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso locus in the zzso is zzso indicating that zzso is essential for the survival and growth of zzso zzso
