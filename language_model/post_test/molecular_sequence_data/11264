A second zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso from pea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This new zzso zzso zzso does not zzso a zzso with a transit zzso and therefore is most likely to represent a zzso zzso It is significantly different at the DNA level from the previously cloned zzso pea zzso zzso but retains the features characteristic of zzso from all sources and has zzso activity when expressed in zzso zzso zzso maps to linkage group 6 on the pea zzso map and it seems likely that this is the only locus for this zzso In contrast to zzso transcript levels of zzso increase in the recovery zzso zzso of both drought and chilling by about zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore may play a role in the restoration of the zzso zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso
