zzso zzso A zzso is an zzso serum protein which exists in the body in a complex with zzso zzso zzso It is involved in chronic inflammation and zzso diseases in an as yet unknown zzso Toward an understanding of the possible zzso role of zzso we initiated a study of its association with blood zzso cells with which it may interact functionally in zzso In the following we describe the binding characteristics of zzso human zzso to human zzso zzso zzso zzso and their plasma zzso zzso analysis of zzso binding and displacement zzso revealed zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which might reside in serum following zzso degradation and zzso A formation, was found to inhibit efficiently the binding of the whole protein to zzso The interaction of zzso and of its related peptides while zzso in zzso with human zzso was also zzso The results suggest that zzso may be involved, in an as yet unknown manner, in the zzso inflammatory zzso
