The zzso family contains hundreds of zzso zzso expressed in several zzso and pathological zzso A unique locus termed zzso encodes an envelope zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso expression is regulated by a zzso element consisting of a zzso zzso zzso long terminal repeat zzso zzso promoter adjacent to a cellular zzso zzso a high level of expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso contains binding sites essential for zzso zzso activity in the region from positions zzso to zzso The region from positions zzso to zzso represents a zzso core zzso promoter active in all cell zzso zzso zzso analysis highlighted the complexity of zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso regulatory sites were identified, as were essential sites required for basic activity zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso contain several putative regulatory zzso The upstream zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso the zzso region located between the zzso zzso and zzso was shown to be an upstream regulatory element zzso which is significantly active in zzso zzso This zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses of zzso zzso revealed large differences between zzso of members of the zzso and the zzso These data allowed the identification of a positive regulatory region from positions zzso to zzso a zzso apparent zzso zzso negative regulatory region from positions zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso from positions zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding sites are essential constituents of the zzso zzso
