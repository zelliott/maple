DNA vaccination is a promising approach for inducing both zzso and cellular immune zzso For zzso of zzso diseases the zzso protein is considered a prime candidate, as it is expressed in all zzso zzso Unfortunately, the zzso protein is a very poor zzso of a zzso zzso response, when being used as zzso in DNA zzso Here we demonstrate that after fusion to protein zzso signals such as the zzso zzso virus ferry protein zzso zzso can zzso in zzso from zzso cells to neighboring cells that do not carry the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso fusion shows significantly increased efficiency in inducing a zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the export function of zzso plays a major role in this phenomenon, since zzso can be replaced by classical protein export signals, without zzso the induction of the zzso cellular immune zzso However, all zzso fusion zzso showed significantly elevated protein zzso levels, which might also account for the observed boost in zzso
