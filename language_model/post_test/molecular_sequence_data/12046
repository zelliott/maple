The balance between type 1 and 2 T helper cell zzso production plays an important role in several animal models of zzso and skewed patterns of zzso expression have been described in human inflammatory zzso Many zzso activate signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors, which, in turn, activate zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso We used zzso cell zzso cultures and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso derived from arthritis patients to examine the regulation of zzso production and zzso activity by an inflammatory zzso zzso Exposure to zzso during zzso resulted in an zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso 4, production by zzso cells generated in zzso zzso zzso suppression was zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and it was reversed in a dominant fashion by zzso zzso zzso blocked the sustained activity of zzso factor zzso but not zzso during the zzso period, and zzso activity was zzso regulated by zzso in parallel with their positive or negative regulation of zzso zzso Active zzso but not zzso was detected in cells from inflamed zzso These results suggest a role for altered balance of zzso and zzso zzso activity in the regulation of T cell differentiation and in the zzso of inflammatory zzso
