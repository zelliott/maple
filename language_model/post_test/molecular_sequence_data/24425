We have developed a new method for monitoring the interactions between zzso zzso that involves detection of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between two DNA zzso with different fluorescent zzso The sequences of the zzso are complementary to those of the zzso In this study, we examined the interaction between a portion of the zzso zzso of zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso zzso was designed not to bind to the fluorescent DNA without prior zzso to the target zzso A mixture of zzso and DNA zzso with fluorescent labels was zzso by zzso on a zzso zzso gel and then the gel was analyzed with a zzso imaging zzso zzso was observed only in the presence of target zzso zzso zzso and both of the fluorescent DNA zzso This strategy should be useful for the detection of interactions between zzso acids that cannot be subjected to chemical zzso such as zzso transcripts inside zzso
