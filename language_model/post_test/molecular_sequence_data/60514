zzso zzso from fish are generally thought to inhibit ice crystal growth by specific zzso onto ice surfaces and preventing addition of water molecules to the ice zzso Recent studies have suggested that this zzso results from hydrogen bonding through the side chains of polar zzso acids as well as zzso interactions between the zzso zzso on the zzso side of zzso zzso and the zzso surfaces of zzso In order to better understand the activity of one of the zzso zzso families, namely the zzso type I zzso zzso four zzso peptides having sequences not directly analogous to those of known zzso zzso and containing only positively charged and zzso side chains were zzso Two peptides with regularly spaced zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso activity, albeit weaker than seen in natural zzso zzso by the criteria of freezing point depression zzso zzso and ice crystal modification to a zzso zzso zzso with irregular spacing of zzso zzso were completely zzso Up to now, zzso zzso have not been generally associated with zzso activity, though they have been implicated in some zzso zzso This work also shows that zzso zzso in themselves, when properly positioned on an zzso zzso scaffold, have all the requisite properties needed for such an zzso
