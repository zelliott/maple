A zzso method for the zzso of the zzso DNA molecules produced in zzso sequencing reactions has been zzso A primer zzso is zzso containing a zzso zzso at an internal zzso This primer is zzso in zzso extension zzso and the resulting products are bound to zzso magnetic zzso zzso species such as zzso zzso template DNA, and unincorporated or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be removed by washing the beads after zzso them in the sample tube with a fixed zzso The resulting pure zzso DNA fragments are removed from the solid support by heating in 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso loading dye at 90 degrees C, and may then be directly loaded onto a zzso gel for sequence zzso This method was used to investigate the effect of various zzso upon DNA sequence zzso
