In zzso zzso zzso pathways zzso zzso small zzso to regulate gene zzso specify and maintain zzso structure, and repress viruses and mobile genetic zzso zzso zzso was likely present in the common zzso of modern zzso but most research has focused on plant and animal zzso zzso zzso zzso species belong to a zzso distinct group of economically important plant pathogens that cause billions of dollars in yield losses annually as well as ecologically devastating zzso We analyzed the small zzso components of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each species produces two distinct populations of small zzso that are predominantly zzso or zzso zzso The zzso small zzso were primarily derived from zzso zzso zzso elements and we propose that these small zzso define a zzso of zzso zzso that silence repetitive genetic zzso The zzso small zzso were primarily derived from zzso repeats, including a novel zzso family that is zzso among the three species, and several gene families, including zzso zzso and type III zzso The zzso zzso is predicted to target a family of zzso zzso zzso and we propose that zzso small zzso function at the zzso zzso The functional significance of zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and the association of zzso small zzso with zzso zzso remains zzso but this work provides a framework for testing the role of small zzso in zzso biology and zzso in future zzso
