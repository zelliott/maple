Progressive loss of normal structure associated with zzso is the hallmark of chronic diseases of most zzso To test the hypothesis that measurement of zzso collagen zzso levels would be a useful index to predict future zzso we developed an zzso to zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso factored for zzso zzso using zzso (the zzso zzso We first defined conditions under which the zzso could be used for analysis of zzso biopsy zzso The zzso ratio was then used to determine whether zzso zzso performed at an early stage of inflammation zzso 7) in a model of zzso disease in the rabbit would predict outcome at day 30 as measured by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cortical zzso zzso The zzso value of this zzso was compared to functional zzso zzso and urine zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso parameters also measured at day zzso We found that the zzso ratio alone provided a sensitive and discriminating zzso over a wide range of zzso injury that predicted various parameters of zzso with an average zzso of determination zzso of zzso This zzso power was higher than that found for conventional measures, which tended to have good zzso capacity over limited ranges of zzso zzso The zzso ratio provided significant additional zzso power over and above that available from combinations of conventional functional or zzso zzso We conclude that measurement of the zzso ratio in biopsy samples deserves further assessment as a potentially useful quantitative predictor of outcome that could lead to improved clinical zzso
