zzso the gene modified in the zzso zzso syndrome zzso is shown to span more than 500 zzso of zzso zzso with the transcript beginning 197 zzso zzso of the zzso start zzso The zzso region containing zzso as the only known gene has been extended to zzso 900 zzso by sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are observed at the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso with a large repertoire of repetitive sequences that includes an unusual cluster of four zzso elements zzso zzso identical over zzso zzso Eight zzso accounting for the full zzso zzso zzso have been zzso along with neighboring zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed to amplify each zzso and zzso junction zzso to help discriminate instances of zzso among individuals with overgrowth syndromes and to facilitate zzso analysis of zzso in the zzso
