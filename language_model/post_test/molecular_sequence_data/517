The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of human African sleeping sickness and related animal diseases, and it has over 170 predicted protein zzso zzso zzso is a key regulatory mechanism for cellular function that, thus far, has been studied in zzso principally through putative zzso zzso zzso and observation of the resulting zzso However, despite the relatively large zzso of this zzso and the demonstrated zzso of several zzso zzso zzso very few specific zzso sites have been determined in this zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso approach we performed the first large scale zzso site analyses for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites were determined for a zzso protein fraction of the zzso form of the zzso resulting in the identification of zzso zzso based on the identification of 852 unique zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso detected in this study are predicted from their zzso zzso to participate in a wide variety of biological zzso including signal zzso processing of DNA and zzso protein zzso and degradation and to a minor extent in zzso zzso The analysis of zzso and zzso sites was facilitated by in-house developed software, and this automated approach was validated by manual zzso of zzso of the zzso subset of zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of 44 zzso protein zzso in our data set that could be classified into the major zzso protein zzso groups by applying a zzso hidden zzso model library of the zzso zzso zzso Identification of the zzso zzso sites showed zzso zzso sequence motifs in several zzso zzso zzso supporting the view that zzso signaling is a general and fundamental regulatory process that extends to this highly divergent lower zzso
