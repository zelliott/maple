The zzso response zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been associated with zzso growth of zzso zzso in the previously identified zzso locus within the zzso region lack the zzso control of production of the zzso specific zzso zzso outer membrane proteins zzso and V and W zzso We zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso locus revealed six tightly packed open reading frames zzso one of which was identified as the structural zzso zzso of the zzso outer membrane protein zzso (formerly known as zzso or zzso zzso of large zzso than zzso transcripts strongly supports the conclusion that the zzso gene and zzso to -5 function as an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the adjacent zzso locus was found to be zzso and the corresponding transcripts overlapped about 1,200 zzso This extremely long overlap of the zzso ends of the transcripts produced from face-to-face promoters is a new zzso the longest overlap thus far found has been a few hundred zzso zzso was found to play the major role in regulation of zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso concentration seemed to affect it only zzso
