Many instances of the zzso element in the core promoter of zzso genes have been reported in zzso cells and their zzso but only one has been reported in the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso element of zzso directs zzso by itself and interacts with a nuclear protein designated zzso zzso binding factor zzso Here we show that zzso in a partially zzso sample binds the sequence from zzso to zzso of zzso By employing a selected and amplified binding zzso we have determined the preferred sequence for zzso binding to be zzso zzso zzso (N indicates any zzso zzso affinity of selected sequences to zzso correlated with their zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that the zzso interaction mediates zzso from the zzso in zzso We also suggest that sequences zzso the preferred sequence affect both zzso binding and zzso zzso
