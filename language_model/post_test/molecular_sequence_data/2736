We recently identified a zzso zzso C zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in calf zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso and (1988) zzso zzso In this study we completely zzso a G protein whose properties are quite similar to the G protein mentioned above from the calf zzso membrane and determined partial zzso acid sequences of zzso The zzso was achieved by first treating the membrane with zzso gamma zzso followed by sequential column zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The G protein was zzso in a zzso gamma zzso form and zzso as to the zzso of the zzso gamma zzso zzso G protein standard obtained from calf zzso zzso The zzso G protein could stimulate the activity of a partially zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso From approximately zzso g of membrane protein we obtained about 5 zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso G protein showed a molecular weight of 21 zzso on zzso and one of 25 zzso on gel zzso The partial zzso acid sequences were determined by treating the zzso sample with zzso zzso the zzso zzso fragments on a zzso phase column and then sequencing the zzso fragments with a zzso zzso of the obtained sequences with those of known lower molecular weight zzso proteins suggested that, although structurally similar to zzso gene products, this is a novel G zzso
