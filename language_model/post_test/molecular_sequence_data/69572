A widely accepted model for the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts that they form 12 zzso zzso and that the highly zzso sequence zzso in zzso is zzso We raised a zzso zzso against a synthetic zzso encompassing this zzso sequence and found that zzso treatment increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso only when applied to the zzso zzso This effect was dose dependent and was specifically blocked by competition with the zzso zzso it was due to a decrease in the zzso for the transport of zzso To ascertain zzso orientation, we raised zzso zzso against the last 21 and 25 zzso zzso acids of zzso and zzso respectively, which were previously shown to be zzso These zzso increased DOG zzso when injected into zzso expressing zzso and zzso but not when added zzso zzso by the noted zzso we found sequence similarity between zzso and zzso two of which are known from zzso to form zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso and turn propensity of zzso leads us to propose that zzso fold as zzso zzso zzso This model is consistent with the results of the present zzso studies and also with previously published experimental evidence inconsistent with the zzso zzso
