A novel zzso acid amplification method, termed zzso zzso amplification zzso which zzso DNA with high zzso efficiency, and zzso under zzso conditions, may be a valuable tool for the rapid detection of infectious zzso zzso was developed for human zzso 6 zzso and its reliability was evaluated in this zzso Although zzso products were detected in zzso B and zzso A DNA, they were not detected in zzso and human zzso zzso The sensitivity of the original zzso zzso protocol was 50 zzso In order to increase the zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso was modified by increasing the primer zzso As a result of the zzso sensitivity increased to 25 zzso After these initial validation studies, 13 patients with fever were tested for zzso by viral isolation, zzso analysis, and zzso zzso In three of the eight patients with primary zzso infection, zzso DNA was detected in whole blood by the original zzso zzso protocol in not only the acute phase but also the zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected by modified zzso zzso in all eight plasma samples collected in the acute zzso however, no zzso DNA was detected in plasma samples collected in the zzso zzso Although zzso DNA was detected in both the acute and zzso zzso of zzso samples in patients with past zzso infection, it was not detected in plasma samples that did not contain zzso viral zzso Thus, detection of zzso DNA in plasma by using this modified zzso zzso protocol is appropriate for diagnosis of active zzso zzso
