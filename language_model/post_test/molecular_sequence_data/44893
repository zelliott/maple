The zzso zzso protein of the rolling zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso activities on zzso zzso zzso is also able to perform a zzso reaction on a zzso DNA zzso that contains its zzso Several attempts at capturing zzso zzso zzso were made to identify the mechanism of zzso zzso Whereas zzso did not generate stable complexes with its target DNA, employment of zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso in the target DNA allowed us to follow the process of zzso zzso zzso This reaction occurred through a number of even steps because the zzso of the zzso at the reaction site was retained after zzso strand zzso This finding suggests the existence of a zzso intermediate during the zzso reaction between the protein and its target zzso By zzso zzso at the zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of activity of the zzso protein zzso we showed that the zzso zzso is involved in the zzso attack of zzso to its zzso zzso
