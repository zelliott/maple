zzso 43 zzso is zzso after spinal zzso injury zzso The authors tested whether zzso zzso corresponding to short sequences of rat zzso would reduce the severity of damage in a zzso ex zzso model of zzso Eleven peptides zzso 1 to zzso corresponding to short zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso of rat zzso were zzso Two of these zzso zzso 4 zzso to zzso and zzso 5, significantly reduced the degree of swelling after zzso in this zzso zzso 5 produced the more significant reduction in swelling and was analyzed zzso Treatment with zzso 5 reduced both the level of zzso and the number of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and at the same time reduced the loss of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso In cell culture, low zzso of zzso 5 prevented zzso zzso but did not disrupt gap zzso zzso Higher zzso prevented zzso zzso but also zzso existing gap zzso This study supports the idea that regulation of zzso zzso opening using zzso peptides may be a useful treatment for reducing the spread of damage after zzso
