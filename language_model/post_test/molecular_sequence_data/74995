zzso has previously been recorded in plants only in the zzso zzso formed by symbiotic association between zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso similarities amongst these and animal zzso at the protein and gene level suggested a common evolutionary zzso This suggests that zzso zzso inherited from an zzso common to plants and animals, might be present in all zzso We report here the isolation of a zzso gene from zzso zzso a zzso relative of zzso zzso The gene has three zzso located at positions identical to those in the zzso genes of zzso plant species, strengthening the case for a common origin of all plant zzso zzso The data argue strongly against horizontal zzso gene transfer from animals to zzso The zzso gene has a zzso pattern of zzso and translation, producing zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have also found that the zzso zzso gene is transcribed in roots of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has a role in the respiratory metabolism of root cells of all plant zzso We propose that its special role in zzso zzso has required adaptation of the zzso regulation pathway, to give high expression in the specialized environment of the zzso
