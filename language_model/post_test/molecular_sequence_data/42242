zzso zzso type 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus zzso are well known and ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso has been also prevalent among dogs in zzso In the present study, 24 canine and 8 zzso zzso collected during zzso were compared with 17 zzso or zzso and 7 zzso strains that had been characterized zzso zzso properties were determined by the restriction zzso patterns of amplified genes zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso by the zzso chain zzso zzso properties were determined by zzso zzso with zzso zzso against an zzso zzso Growth characteristics in zzso zzso and canine zzso cells were also zzso zzso and zzso properties of the canine zzso were relatively zzso with one exceptional zzso zzso which was recovered from a typical clinical case of zzso infection but possessed properties similar to zzso rather than zzso and zzso All zzso from zzso cases possessed the same zzso and zzso properties as those of reference zzso isolated in the 1970s, but three of five strains isolated from the feces of clinically healthy cats were likely to be of canine origin because they possessed very similar properties to zzso Although zzso of these novel zzso could not be determined definitely, the results indicate a possibility that transmission of zzso has occurred between these two animal zzso
