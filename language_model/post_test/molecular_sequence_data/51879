Though zzso against zzso appearing in the course of infection are successfully used for the diagnostic purposes, their zzso on the earlier step leads to: zzso to the rapid generation of the zzso by different mechanisms and zzso to inefficiency of zzso One of the causes for zzso seems to be zzso which are induced in the zzso person by the zzso peptides zzso to the zzso class II molecules by their zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso positive zzso are shown to react with human zzso cells expressing surface class II zzso The binding is caused by the zzso preventing the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso Three zzso acid sequences are identified in both zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso these sequences being zzso to zzso zzso or zzso molecules for 50 to zzso Using synthetic peptides it was shown that zzso persons contain zzso which zzso to the zzso peptides of the zzso and of the zzso class zzso It is supposed that such zzso shield the class II zzso on the surface of their own zzso cell which may lead to zzso caused by the zzso zzso
