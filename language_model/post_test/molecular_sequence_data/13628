In an attempt to clone a gene zzso the zzso zzso system from zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso were derived from zzso These plasmids allowed the growth of zzso zzso zzso strains of zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a low zzso zzso The zzso and zzso had an zzso about 7 and 6 zzso respectively, from the zzso of zzso zzso We prepared deletion plasmids from both plasmids and found that the site of genes inserted in the two was not identical and that the active locus corresponded to the structural gene zzso the zzso quarter part of zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso gene was zzso in another zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso in the low zzso zzso It contained only 62 zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and the open reading frame was composed of 98 zzso acid zzso from the zzso quarter part of zzso and 5 zzso acid zzso attached by gene zzso Using the zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso was found to increase the activity of zzso zzso These results show that the zzso side zzso gene product functions as a zzso zzso zzso
