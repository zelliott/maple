We have isolated a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso E zzso zzso E proteins thus constitute an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso E zzso zzso encodes two proteins with a common zzso region and unique zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso exhibits a dynamic pattern of expression during zzso zzso is supplied zzso but at the completion of the zzso divisions and prior to zzso 14, the maternal transcripts are rapidly zzso in all cells except the pole zzso zzso Two modes of zzso expression are observed in the subsequent zzso During cycles 14, 15 and 16 in zzso cells, zzso zzso levels show no zzso zzso zzso expression in these cells is therefore independent of the cell cycle zzso In contrast, expression in zzso embryonic peripheral nervous system cells occurs during zzso as a brief pulse that zzso before and zzso with S phase, demonstrating the presence of a zzso phase in these embryonic neural cell zzso zzso appears not to be expressed in cells that undergo zzso cycles during zzso The structural zzso to human zzso zzso the ability of zzso to rescue a zzso zzso zzso strain, the presence of multiple zzso sequences characteristic of zzso zzso and expression during zzso phase in zzso peripheral nervous system cells all argue that zzso zzso E is a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in embryonic cycles lacking a zzso phase, in contrast to expression during the zzso phase transition in cycles exhibiting a zzso phase, implicates zzso expression in the regulation of the zzso to S phase transition during zzso zzso
