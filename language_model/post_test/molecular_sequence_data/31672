The evolution of new genes can ensue through either gene zzso and the zzso of one of the copies or the formation of a de zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso evolving zzso or zzso zzso zzso Only very rarely are entire genes created de zzso Mostly, zzso sequences are zzso as novel parts of existing zzso such as in the process of zzso zzso zzso become zzso through changes in zzso Here, we report a case in which a novel zzso coding zzso evolved by zzso recruitment into its zzso zzso derived from rat brain small zzso revealed a novel small zzso zzso zzso originating from one of the zzso copies in the rat zzso syndrome zzso We suggest that a zzso substitution in the zzso region led to the expression of a longer zzso zzso designated as zzso Cell culture and zzso experiments confirmed that a single zzso substitution at zzso position 67 zzso the zzso motif within the zzso zzso while zzso zzso sequences provided an alternate zzso zzso The zzso sequence displays putative base pairing to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
