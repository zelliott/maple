To examine if the biological activity of the zzso zzso which is the native zzso of the zzso and viable drug target zzso zzso could be modulated by zzso and if such effects could be zzso zzso we have zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso They were tested for biological activity in competition binding zzso using the zzso animal model in which zzso 2 exhibited a slightly improved binding zzso whereas zzso 1 showed a remarkably reduced binding affinity compared to the parent compound and zzso zzso The structural analysis of these zzso and the parent zzso zzso by zzso and circular zzso indicated that their zzso solutions are mainly populated by random zzso zzso However, in membrane mimic environments a certain proportion of the molecules of all these peptides exist as zzso zzso Interestingly, under these experimental conditions, zzso 1 zzso at zzso exhibited a population of folded zzso zzso From these facts it is tempting to speculate that zzso zzso showing linear zzso structures are more complementary and thus interact more efficiently with the native zzso zzso than folded structures, since zzso 1 showed a significantly reduced binding affinity for the zzso zzso
