zzso is a major obstacle to the zzso analysis of function in cultured zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso rounds of chemical zzso generates zzso cells that can be used as targets for zzso zzso using a specially designed zzso zzso that permits rapid identification of disrupted genes in each cell that bears a zzso of zzso The utility of combined chemical and zzso zzso is illustrated by the identification of novel host genes that are required for zzso sensitivity to anthrax lethal zzso
