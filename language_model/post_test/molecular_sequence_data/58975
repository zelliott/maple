zzso bind to zzso zzso and also interact with zzso such as zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso and a complex of four to six zzso identified in zzso that includes two zzso zzso Here, we report the identification and characterization of an essential gene from zzso zzso zzso a zzso in which zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is defective for cell zzso and zzso suggesting that it is involved in multiple cortical zzso zzso zzso with a role in zzso zzso function, negative interactions have been identified between zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a novel 377 zzso acid zzso with similarity to proteins of the zzso repeat zzso zzso proteins have been identified by sequencing projects in diverse species, and we have isolated a human zzso highly related to zzso zzso zzso which functionally zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins from all species contain zzso sequences identical or highly similar to two zzso sequences from an zzso zzso repeat protein present in the zzso binding zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso is present in a complex which also contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies reveal the presence of zzso in zzso zzso structures distributed throughout the cell, zzso cables that extend the length of the cell, and zzso a zzso band in a small percentage of zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso
