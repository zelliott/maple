The human zzso zzso 1 zzso is the most abundant integral membrane protein in red cells and is responsible for the exchange of zzso for zzso However, the detailed role played by the zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso and membrane trafficking process remains zzso In this paper, we created four zzso in the human zzso zzso by deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to investigate the role of these sequences in functional expression of zzso zzso zzso and its deletion zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso Western zzso showed that deletions of zzso zzso and zzso induced high expression of zzso whereas loss of zzso results in stable low zzso Pulse chase zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso showed that the stability of protein is unaffected by the levels of expression of the zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited lower levels of trafficking to the plasma membrane compared with zzso zzso while the zzso zzso was more highly expressed at the plasma zzso The decreased ability of the zzso to mediate zzso exchange in zzso cells revealed that the deletion sequences have an important role in transport zzso These results demonstrate that the studied zzso in the zzso zzso differently affect the zzso membrane trafficking and functional folding of zzso
