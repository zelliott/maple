We describe and functionally characterize six zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in three zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso studies demonstrated severe zzso zzso zzso dispersed zzso regions and well preserved zzso folds in all three zzso zzso studies were consistent with expression of the fetal zzso at the zzso in one patient, zzso of some channel events in another and zzso expression as well as some shorter than normal channel events in still zzso zzso analysis revealed two zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in each zzso One zzso in each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 7) generates a nonsense zzso that predicts zzso of the zzso zzso in its zzso zzso zzso and one zzso in each generates a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso None of the zzso was detected in 100 zzso zzso studies in zzso cells indicate that the three nonsense zzso are zzso zzso and that surface expression of zzso harboring the zzso zzso is significantly zzso zzso analysis of zzso harboring the zzso zzso show that zzso zzso is zzso benign, zzso zzso zzso burst open duration zzso by slowing the rate of channel closing and zzso zzso shortens burst duration zzso by slowing the rate of channel opening and speeding the rate of zzso zzso The modest changes in zzso zzso are probably overshadowed by reduced expression of the zzso zzso The consequences of the zzso zzso zzso are zzso by persistent expression of zzso changes in the release of zzso zzso and appearance of multiple zzso regions on the muscle zzso
