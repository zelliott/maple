zzso zzso targeting zzso genes were developed to identify species zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Each zzso was tested with 177 bacterial zzso that also underwent zzso analysis by zzso protein zzso These zzso were from clinical and environmental sources and included 107 zzso zzso complex zzso 23 zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso and 9 zzso belonging to nine other zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso were 100 and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity and specificity were 87 and zzso zzso An zzso based on zzso and zzso zzso gene analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I) was useful in identifying zzso I, III, and IV as a group zzso zzso and zzso zzso Another zzso designed to be specific at the zzso level, identified all but one of the zzso and zzso zzso tested zzso zzso and zzso zzso The combined use of these zzso offers a significant improvement over previously published zzso zzso for zzso zzso
