We have obtained a zzso zzso to human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso a zzso zzso human brain zzso library with zzso to bovine zzso The highly zzso zzso sequence of this clone with that of the mouse zzso enabled the identification of this zzso as one zzso zzso As this zzso zzso with a single major zzso species in Northern blots of zzso from human and mouse brain zzso and gave one or two bands in Southern blots of human zzso DNA, it was considered to be specific for zzso Using this zzso as a probe we investigated the levels of zzso expression in ten human zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso was detected in five of the ten zzso cell lines, one of which was zzso zzso cell line and the other four were clones derived from the same tumor zzso 2, 3, and zzso There was a difference in the amount of zzso zzso among zzso zzso and the four zzso cell zzso zzso evaluation of this difference by zzso dot zzso analysis revealed that the amount of zzso zzso expressed in zzso was about zzso and in zzso about zzso the amount expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso levels corresponded to the zzso zzso levels in these cell zzso By Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA the zzso gene was similarly detected in all of these cell lines regardless of the level of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
