The functional organization of the zzso cluster of zzso zzso which codes for the zzso protein and zzso zzso respectively, was studied with the aid of zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was shown previously by zzso mapping that the cluster contains two zzso organized zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso 70 and zzso 54 types, respectively, upstream of zzso and a third unidentified promoter upstream of zzso Data obtained with zzso zzso in the zzso strain confirmed that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso alone were zzso regulated by the cell N zzso zzso of promoter activities showed a high level of zzso from zzso and a low level from zzso under conditions of nitrogen zzso The opposite situation prevails under conditions of nitrogen zzso As a consequence, zzso zzso synthesis is increased under conditions of nitrogen zzso which strongly suggests that zzso plays an important role under these zzso zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso and point zzso strains in zzso were zzso zzso and zzso are not involved in the regulation of zzso zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso probably acts by modulating the zzso N status, and zzso acts by zzso the properties of an unidentified regulator which might be a functional zzso of zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso was characterized zzso A zzso zzso was restored to the strain by zzso from zzso zzso but not by zzso from zzso zzso This zzso strain is not impaired in zzso zzso which is relatively independent of the growth conditions in zzso zzso It is therefore most likely that zzso is required for zzso zzso under conditions of nitrogen zzso zzso mapping and zzso zzso showed zzso was located within a zzso DNA zzso upstream of the zzso start site, zzso to previously described consensus sites for zzso zzso
