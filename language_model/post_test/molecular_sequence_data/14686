A central nervous system zzso disease outbreak caused by small zzso zzso zzso has triggered interest in Spain due to the rapid onset of clinical signs and relevant production zzso In a previous study on this outbreak, the role of zzso in zzso was unclear and zzso zzso zzso likely involved in zzso were not zzso This study aimed to analyze zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal and zzso zzso C4 and zzso zzso order to assess virus zzso in zzso 

Eight zzso zzso affected sheep of the outbreak were zzso Of the 350 clones obtained after zzso amplification, 142 corresponded to zzso samples zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the remaining to zzso zzso blood cells, zzso zzso cells and/or zzso The diversity of the zzso sequences from zzso was zzso between animals and zzso within each animal, except in one animal presenting two sequence types zzso zzso in the zzso (one grouping with those of the zzso indicative of zzso virus sequence zzso zzso sequences were of zzso A, zzso per animal and zzso in the animal zzso No zzso specific signature patterns were zzso 

zzso approach zzso suggested that zzso from zzso zzso cells and peripheral blood zzso cells represented the common ancestors zzso zzso in the animal and that zzso in the outbreak involved zzso after initial infection with an zzso zzso This study demonstrates virus zzso in the zzso and other body zzso in sheep presenting the neurological form of zzso zzso
