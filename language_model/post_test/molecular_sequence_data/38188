We have analyzed the expression and function of the zzso zzso gene zzso a member of the widely zzso zzso family of nuclear zzso The gene encodes two protein zzso only one of which has a DNA binding zzso zzso is transcribed during embryonic and zzso zzso A zzso fusion gene is expressed in the zzso the developing zzso zzso and a subset of other zzso zzso zzso interference indicates a requirement for zzso function during development: disruption of zzso function leads to embryonic arrest due to failure of the zzso zzso process of zzso zzso Animals that survive to zzso arrest as zzso larvae that occasionally exhibit defects in shedding zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso development is defective in these zzso These results further establish the importance of zzso nuclear receptors in zzso and zzso control across zzso distant zzso
