An Egyptian child with zzso major was found to carry two different zzso (I and zzso associated with two zzso zzso Analysis with several zzso and restriction zzso which identify the zzso most common in the Mediterranean area, allowed the identification of only one zzso namely zzso at position 6 of the first intervening sequence zzso In order to characterize the other zzso the beta gene was amplified with zzso chain reaction and zzso A zzso substitution was found at position 130 of the zzso which alters the zzso zzso AG present in the consensus zzso zzso thus producing a beta zzso This zzso was further confirmed by restriction analysis since it creates a new restriction site for the zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that this subject carries the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso frequently observed in Mediterranean areas, and a new zzso at the zzso site of the zzso which has not been described before, associated with zzso zzso This zzso gene can be added to the list of zzso that can be identified by Southern analysis using zzso zzso
