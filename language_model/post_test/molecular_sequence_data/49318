The zzso gene zzso is the founding member of a large family of genes zzso zzso zzso factors that are highly zzso from fly to zzso The family consists of two main zzso with zzso as the ancestral gene for one branch and the recently cloned zzso zzso as the ancestral gene for the zzso We now extend this family with the identification of another novel zzso member, zzso zzso zzso which is zzso aligned with zzso zzso is closely related to the other zzso zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso sharing a high degree of sequence identity with these factors in the functional zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction studies demonstrate that zzso can zzso with zzso and zzso but not with the more distant members of the zzso Like zzso the zzso gene too produces several distinct zzso with differing functional properties through alternative zzso The tissue zzso of these zzso differ and all display highly restricted expression zzso These findings indicate that zzso like its family members, may play important roles in zzso zzso
