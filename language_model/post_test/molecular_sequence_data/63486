zzso and zzso are zzso produced by the plant pathogen zzso zzso As expected from their primary structure, they shared a similar mechanism of action with the better characterized zzso zzso by strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, they displayed zzso activity on human zzso and were able to induce zzso release from zzso the effect was dependent on the concentration of the zzso and the zzso composition of the zzso and, in particular, it increased with the zzso content of the zzso The zzso activity was further investigated on zzso zzso were able to open pores on pure zzso zzso zzso opening was strongly zzso zzso by switching the potential from negative to positive values, an increase in the absolute zzso of zzso current was induced with simultaneous closure of zzso In zzso M zzso both zzso pores had a zzso of 4 and 9 zzso at - 140 zzso and + 140 zzso zzso Studies on zzso selectivity indicated that zzso formed zzso zzso
