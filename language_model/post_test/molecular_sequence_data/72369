The zzso zzso zzso replicates by the rolling circle zzso It encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso termed zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso and shown specifically to relax zzso zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso of the zzso site introduced by zzso have been determined by sequencing and by primer extension zzso The zzso attack exerted by zzso is in the zzso zzso within the sequence zzso Upon zzso zzso protein remains tightly associated with its target DNA, probably through a zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not exhibit zzso with known origins of transfer of plasmids from zzso zzso However, several plasmids from zzso hosts have a region identical or very similar to the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a zzso activity of a zzso protein from a zzso replicating by the rolling circle zzso
