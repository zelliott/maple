The zzso of the molecular structure of the human zzso zzso has facilitated the study of molecular defects associated with zzso zzso In this zzso data are presented on the functional domain structure of the wild type human zzso zzso and on the molecular structure of the zzso zzso from different subjects with the complete form of zzso zzso zzso domain analysis of the human zzso zzso has revealed that a large zzso region constitutes the hormone binding domain and that DNA binding is associated with a central basic zzso In addition, separate zzso that control zzso and nuclear zzso have been zzso Reports on zzso zzso gene structure in individuals with the complete and incomplete forms of zzso zzso indicate that gross deletions within the zzso zzso gene are zzso The locations of the different point zzso reported cannot be assigned to a single site but are spread throughout the zzso binding and DNA binding zzso A point zzso found in the zzso binding domain of the human zzso zzso in a prostate zzso cell line is the cause of the altered steroid binding specificity observed for the zzso zzso in these prostate zzso zzso A considerable variation in the length of one of the zzso repeats has been reported in the zzso zzso regulating domain of the wild type zzso zzso zzso of the length of this particular zzso stretch is correlated with a progressive zzso muscular zzso in a small group of middle aged zzso
