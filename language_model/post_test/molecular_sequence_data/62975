The zzso zzso zzso B and L are members of the zzso family of zzso zzso that have been implicated in the processing of zzso proteins zzso in zzso zzso However, the full identification of the type of zzso expressed in fish zzso zzso and zzso as well as their regulatory mechanisms and specific zzso are not yet zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso K, zzso zzso C, and H have been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and the analysis of their deduced zzso acid sequences revealed highly similar structural features to zzso zzso and confirmed in this species the existence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso While all identified zzso were expressed in zzso zzso the corresponding zzso showed different zzso expression zzso Thus, similar zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso B, C, and Z were found throughout the zzso growth or zzso period, whereas those for zzso H and K appeared to decrease as zzso zzso During zzso zzso a transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and F zzso approximately a zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase, respectively, was detected in zzso zzso within the zzso zzso after hormone zzso zzso with the maximum zzso of the zzso major zzso The specific zzso pattern of expression of these genes may indicate a potential role of zzso zzso and zzso F zzso in the zzso processing events occurring during fish zzso maturation and/or early zzso
