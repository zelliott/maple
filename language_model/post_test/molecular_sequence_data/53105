As an initial step in the study of the role of G proteins in signal zzso in zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso using different experimental zzso Western blots of zzso membrane preparations using zzso and zzso zzso identified a band of approximately 41 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these membrane zzso confirmed the presence of a protein zzso of 41 zzso A zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso product obtained using zzso DNA as template and zzso targeted to zzso zzso zzso was used as a probe to isolate a clone from an zzso zzso zzso zzso A partial sequence for a zzso zzso was obtained from this zzso The sequence was completed using the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso technique with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a 353 zzso acid zzso zzso of 41 zzso more than zzso identical to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence was obtained by zzso using zzso DNA, and revealed a zzso zzso sequence and the presence of three zzso These results provide evidence for the first time of the presence and expression of a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
