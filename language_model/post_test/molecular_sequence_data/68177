A protein S gene zzso zzso by restriction analysis of amplified zzso zzso was investigated in a family with members affected by protein S zzso deep vein zzso and zzso The clinical laboratory findings as well as zzso analysis were consistent with the presence of a type zzso III protein S zzso clearly marked by a zzso zzso thus enabling us to determine the carrier status in several zzso The zzso analysis, extended to zzso zzso after reverse zzso and amplification, demonstrated that the zzso produced by the putative defective gene was present in a subject affected by zzso
