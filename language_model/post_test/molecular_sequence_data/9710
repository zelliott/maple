zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a distant member of the zzso protein zzso zzso family, regulates gene expression in response to various zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso 1 zzso a dual specificity protein zzso that zzso zzso on zzso 183 and zzso 185 zzso Here we show that zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso family, was zzso and activated by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso signaling zzso zzso activity was also zzso by zzso active forms of zzso and zzso members of the zzso small zzso protein zzso Unlike zzso that activates both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso the stimulation of zzso zzso activity by zzso The existence of multiple zzso zzso may contribute to the specificity of the zzso signaling zzso
