zzso of zzso signaling 18 zzso is a zzso protein for the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso that turns off signaling by zzso coupled zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso In the present study, we show that the zzso protein binds to zzso zzso 49 and 218 of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso stimulates the association of zzso and zzso probably by increasing the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso with zzso and zzso oxide, which trigger zzso zzso zzso signaling involving zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso I zzso zzso the zzso of zzso 216 of zzso and the detachment of zzso zzso 216 zzso is able to block zzso binding to zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is more active compared with zzso zzso leading to a more pronounced zzso of zzso release of calcium zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso detachment of zzso activates zzso to block zzso calcium zzso These findings indicate zzso between zzso zzso and zzso pathways at the level of zzso and zzso
