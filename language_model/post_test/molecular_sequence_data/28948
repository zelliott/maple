zzso 4 zzso can act on target cells through an zzso zzso complex consisting of the zzso zzso alpha chain and the common gamma chain zzso An zzso zzso for zzso binding has previously been zzso In this study, the zzso zzso involved in zzso binding were defined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso comprises zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on loop zzso together with zzso on loop zzso as the major binding zzso These predominantly zzso zzso interact with the zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cycle analysis revealed zzso interaction between zzso and zzso side zzso Several zzso zzso involved in zzso binding have been previously shown to be zzso in zzso severe combined zzso The importance of these binding zzso for zzso function is zzso These results provide a basis for zzso the molecular recognition mechanism in the zzso zzso system and a paradigm for other zzso zzso zzso zzso
