The 2A zzso zzso from the zzso family are zzso zzso zzso that perform essential roles during viral zzso involving viral zzso zzso and shutting down host cell protein synthesis through zzso of the zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso B4 zzso zzso also zzso heart muscle zzso leading to zzso dysfunction and the symptoms of human acquired zzso zzso We have determined the solution structure of zzso zzso zzso in an zzso direction to include the zzso eight zzso of zzso zzso which completes the zzso zzso zzso In terms of overall fold, it is similar to the crystal structure of the mature human zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso but the relatively low level zzso of sequence identity leads to a substantially different zzso We show that differences in the zzso loop between zzso and zzso zzso translate to differences in the mechanism of zzso zzso Additionally, the nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation properties of zzso zzso particularly of zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso reveal that the zzso region is exchanging in and out of a zzso in which it occupies the active site with association and zzso rates in the range of 100 to 1,000 zzso This exchange influences the zzso of the active site and points to a mechanism for how zzso can occur efficiently while product zzso is zzso
