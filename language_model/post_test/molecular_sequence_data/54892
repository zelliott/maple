zzso zzso zzso genes constitute with 1200 members the largest gene family in the mouse zzso A mature zzso sensory zzso zzso is thought to express just one OR zzso and from one zzso The cell bodies of zzso that express a given OR gene display a mosaic pattern within a particular region of the main zzso zzso The mechanisms and zzso DNA elements that regulate the expression of one OR gene per zzso - OR gene choice - remain poorly zzso Here, we describe a reporter zzso to identify minimal promoters for OR genes in transgenic mice, which are produced by the conventional method of zzso injection of zzso The promoter zzso are devoid of an OR coding zzso and instead drive expression of the zzso marker zzso For four mouse OR genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one human OR gene zzso a mosaic, zzso pattern of reporter expression can be obtained in transgenic mice with zzso DNA segments of only zzso zzso that are centered around the zzso start site zzso The zzso region upstream of the zzso contains three zzso sequence zzso including zzso zzso binding zzso Such HD binding sites are also present in the H and P zzso DNA sequences that are known to strongly influence OR gene zzso When a zzso encompassing a HD binding site from the P element is zzso nine times and added upstream of a zzso zzso that contains the zzso coding region, we observe a dramatic increase in the number of zzso founders and lines and in the number of labeled zzso By contrast, a nine times zzso zzso with a zzso HD binding site does not have these zzso We zzso that HD binding sites in the H and P elements and in OR promoters zzso the probability of OR gene zzso
