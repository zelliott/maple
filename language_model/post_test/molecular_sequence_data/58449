We investigated the zzso sequence of the steroid 11 zzso gene zzso from the Cape zzso zzso zzso Six zzso previously used in studies on human zzso were zzso to amplify three overlapping fragments zzso B and zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso analysis of the three fragments yielded the sequence of all the zzso of zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso bases shows 57 zzso exchanges when compared to the human resulting in 18 zzso acid zzso For eight of these exchanges we found the zzso acid which is common for human zzso zzso at the corresponding zzso Most of the remaining 10 zzso acid zzso were zzso Eight of the zzso were located in the first four zzso with a cluster in the second half of zzso zzso One substitution was in zzso 5 zzso and the 10th was zzso at the end of the zzso
