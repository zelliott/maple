Although it has been established that zzso expression is regulated at the zzso level, neither the regulatory elements that are responsible for its unique expression pattern nor the relevance of its three distinct zzso start sites zzso zzso and zzso has been fully zzso We studied the contribution of the three start sites to zzso zzso production in zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso In zzso and zzso cells and cell lines most zzso transcripts originate from zzso with the exception of the zzso T cell line zzso in which approximately zzso of zzso transcripts originate from zzso The degree of contribution of zzso is highest in zzso cells and increases in T cells following zzso zzso In zzso evaluation of sequence upstream of the start sites shows that the zzso start site is sufficient for zzso expression in zzso but not in zzso cells, confirms the presence of a zzso site essential for zzso expression of zzso and reveals an zzso site that interacts with both zzso and zzso and activates zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso These findings are the first evidence that zzso factors are involved in the control of zzso zzso
