It has been shown that seed development is regulated by a network of zzso factors in zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the B3 domain factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, molecular and genetic regulation of seed development in zzso is poorly zzso To understand seed development and seed zzso in zzso a large-scale screen was performed using our zzso zzso population, and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso In addition to the severe zzso zzso the zzso zzso also shows a dwarf zzso and abnormal flower zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso encodes a B3 zzso zzso factor with repression zzso zzso with the dwarf zzso of zzso expression of the zzso acid zzso zzso gene zzso is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso in zzso resulting in a decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso application of zzso not only induced zzso zzso but also partially rescued the dwarf zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso binds to the promoter of zzso a zzso gene of rice, via an zzso element, leading to significant zzso of zzso and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the zzso zzso Plants zzso zzso partly mimic the zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso was induced under sugar treatment, and the contents of starch and soluble sugar are altered in the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso directly or indirectly in regulating zzso and zzso zzso and further regulates rice seed zzso and zzso zzso
