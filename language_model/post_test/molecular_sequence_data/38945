The zzso fusion protein zzso has been implicated in zzso trafficking in perhaps all zzso zzso The zzso comatose zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso zzso Our previous work with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has revealed a function for zzso at zzso where it appears to prime synaptic zzso for neurotransmitter zzso To further examine the molecular basis of zzso function and to broaden our analysis of synaptic transmission to other gene products, we have performed a genetic screen for zzso that interact with zzso Here we report the isolation and analysis of four zzso that modify zzso paralysis in zzso including two zzso zzso (one zzso and one zzso and two zzso zzso (both zzso The zzso zzso will contribute to zzso analysis of zzso and the zzso zzso identify gene products with related functions in synaptic zzso Both zzso enhancers result in zzso behavioral zzso when separated from zzso and both map to zzso not previously identified in screens for zzso zzso One of these zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of the calcium channel zzso zzso cacophony zzso Analysis of synaptic function in these zzso alone and in combination will further define the in zzso functions and interactions of specific gene products in synaptic zzso
