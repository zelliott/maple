zzso zzso is the source of numerous zzso infections in humans and therefore deserves close attention as zzso or even zzso resistant strains are increasingly being identified zzso Here we report the comparison of two newly zzso zzso of zzso zzso The human isolate zzso zzso zzso is zzso resistant whereas strain zzso which was isolated from body zzso is zzso zzso As reference for comparison in this analysis, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso The most interesting zzso we observed were that zzso whereas strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso very few zzso zzso elements which could promote expression of downstream zzso strain zzso sequence contains several hundred of them that have played a crucial role in its zzso reduction zzso disruptions and simple DNA zzso zzso strain zzso has low zzso capacities compared to strain zzso Interestingly, the latter has even higher zzso capacities than zzso zzso which has already been reported as a very nutritionally versatile zzso This zzso performance could explain the persistence of zzso zzso zzso strains in environments where nutrients are zzso zzso several processes known to play a key role during host infection zzso formation, iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were either different or zzso the best example of which is iron zzso Indeed, strain zzso and zzso zzso use zzso systems to zzso iron from the environment whereas strain zzso uses an alternate system similar to the zzso Acquisition System zzso Taken together, all these observations suggest that the zzso contents of the 3 zzso compared are partly shaped by life in distinct ecological zzso human (and more largely hospital zzso zzso zzso
