To evaluate whether zzso T cells can be detected in zzso wax embedded human tissue samples using zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were raised against a 13 zzso acid zzso sequence from the zzso portion of the alpha chain of the human zzso zzso 

These zzso specifically detected the native form of the zzso zzso when tested by zzso with zzso T cells, and gave the expected zzso pattern for zzso T cells in zzso zzso Being raised in zzso the zzso zzso were also useful for double zzso for zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso positive cells could also be detected in zzso wax embedded zzso This was achieved without prior treatment of the sections if the tissue had been fixed in zzso zzso When zzso had been exposed to conventional zzso zzso preliminary zzso treatment was zzso 

These findings provide further evidence that zzso against zzso associated zzso capable of reacting on zzso wax embedded zzso can be produced by zzso with synthetic zzso zzso
