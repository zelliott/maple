The orchestrated binding of zzso zzso and zzso to specific DNA sequences in the context of zzso defines the regulatory program of zzso zzso We developed a digital approach to zzso regulatory protein occupancy on zzso DNA in zzso by dense mapping of individual zzso I zzso from intact zzso using zzso parallel DNA zzso Analysis of zzso million zzso across the zzso zzso zzso revealed thousands of protected regulatory protein zzso enabling de zzso derivation of factor binding motifs and the identification of hundreds of new binding sites for major zzso We observed striking correspondence between zzso resolution zzso I zzso patterns and zzso interactions determined by zzso The data also yielded a detailed view of larger zzso features including positioned zzso zzso factor binding zzso Digital zzso zzso should be a powerful approach to delineate the zzso framework of any zzso with an available zzso zzso
