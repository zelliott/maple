zzso zzso zzso zzso are fatal neurodegenerative diseases of man and animals and are transmitted by a zzso pathogen whose identity is currently zzso Our data indicates that zzso a zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso We searched for zzso zzso gene sequences in 10 zzso sheep brains and 10 normal sheep zzso 7 zzso samples infected with chronic wasting disease zzso and 7 normal zzso zzso DNA was extracted from these tissue samples and amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was determined by Southern zzso and DNA sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in 8 of 10 zzso sheep brains and 6 of 7 zzso tissue zzso All normal animal brain samples were zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found in two human zzso diseased zzso brains but not in two zzso normal human zzso DNA sequence analyses of the amplified zzso products from human and animal zzso cases revealed greater than zzso zzso sequence zzso with zzso zzso The presence of zzso DNA in zzso zzso supports our hypothesis that zzso may be involved in the zzso of these zzso
