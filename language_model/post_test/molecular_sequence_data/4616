The zzso domain of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is represented by a segment of 26 zzso zzso We tested whether the zzso of a zzso in the zzso domain changes the affinity of zzso for this binding zzso We monitored the binding of zzso to synthetic peptides by surface zzso resonance zzso an zzso mobility zzso circular zzso zzso and competitive zzso zzso All four experimental approaches showed that binding of zzso to the zzso site is blocked by introduction of a zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso could be a negative feedback loop to turn off zzso zzso
