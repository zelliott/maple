A central question in zzso zzso is how zzso zzso are zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso To address this question, we cloned zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso functional analysis of zzso in zzso identified it as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Together, zzso and zzso converted zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso that contrasts with the generally accepted route to zzso via zzso Although the zzso zzso system can mediate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso through either route, zzso of zzso for zzso zzso was approximately 140 times greater than that for zzso More significantly, when zzso zzso and zzso were present together, zzso zzso was a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby eliminating the entire reaction sequence from zzso to zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso also could not be detected for zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso does not occur, and the zzso zzso can be zzso only from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso consistent with in zzso operation of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso via zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso
