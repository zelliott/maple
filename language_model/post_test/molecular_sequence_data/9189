zzso are important components in host defense zzso The therapeutic use of zzso is limited by their innate toxicity and high cost due to the size and complex zzso zzso In this study, we used linear avian zzso zzso zzso without zzso bonds as model zzso to derive two peptides by the zzso zzso is the zzso truncated sequence of zzso and zzso is the zzso of zzso by the replacement of zzso with zzso zzso showed that these peptides exhibited strong zzso activity against zzso and zzso zzso An exception was that zzso showed weak zzso activity against zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso Two truncated peptides zzso and zzso displayed no or weak zzso which was in accordance with little blue shifts of the peptides in the presence of synthetic zzso zzso CD zzso demonstrated that these peptides appeared to be unfolded in zzso solution but acquire structure in the presence of zzso mimicking zzso zzso kept the zzso activity at high zzso of zzso or low concentration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The peptides zzso bound to zzso charged zzso over zzso zzso which led to greater cell zzso The outer and inner zzso zzso displayed that zzso killed bacteria by targeting the cell zzso These results suggest the peptides derived by zzso of linear zzso may be a promising candidate for future zzso zzso
