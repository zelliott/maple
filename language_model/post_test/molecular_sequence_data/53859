We have analyzed 20 randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso against 36 zzso zzso including 17 zzso undefined zzso 25 zzso zzso and 12 zzso consisting of zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso were useful in identifying unique DNA zzso of all strains zzso We have used zzso techniques to develop a zzso probe, one not necessarily targeting the zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso probe for the biological control agent zzso zzso zzso In the course of these zzso small-scale DNA zzso were also developed for efficiently zzso zzso zzso Various modifications of isolation procedures for soil DNA were zzso and the reliability and specificity of the zzso methodology were tested by specifically detecting the zzso zzso zzso in DNA isolated from zzso
