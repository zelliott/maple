The zzso zzso zzso 5 S zzso precursor is processed by removal of 15 zzso from its 3' end before incorporation into the large zzso zzso zzso 5 S zzso consists of five zzso zzso stem IV and part of V are zzso whereas stem III and the zzso zzso base pair closest to the processing site at zzso 120 are required for processing zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the effects of stem I and loop A zzso zzso selected additions and deletions on 5 S zzso zzso Stem I single zzso generally prevent processing, whereas zzso double zzso restore a range of processing zzso zzso to the processing site, stem I double zzso inhibit zzso In the zzso portion of stem I and loop A, the processing effect of paired sequence changes varies widely in an irregular zzso The zzso zzso pair and zzso zzso least tolerate sequence changes; several zzso clustered close to the stem zzso A boundary stimulate zzso We interpret these results in terms of the zzso zzso path and possible zzso zzso
