In connection with our discovery of a strong zzso activity of zzso A zzso we investigated zzso properties of zzso and a number of its zzso including symmetrical zzso and compared them with the activities of zzso A and zzso The peptides were investigated by using plaque forming cell zzso zzso zzso delayed type hypersensitivity zzso and zzso zzso formation cell zzso zzso zzso and symmetrical zzso exhibit an zzso activity lower than zzso Linear zzso fragments are also zzso At higher zzso of the latter zzso toxic effects zzso
