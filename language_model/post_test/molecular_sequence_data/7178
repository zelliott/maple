The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso which code, respectively, for nitrate and zzso zzso are zzso zzso and their zzso are separated by 1,200 zzso The genes are under the control of the positively acting zzso zzso factor, which mediates nitrate zzso The DNA binding domain of zzso was expressed as a fusion protein with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso shift and footprint experiments have shown that in the zzso region there are four binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso These sites can be represented by the zzso consensus zzso Making use of a zzso expression zzso we have analyzed the role of each of the sites in zzso and zzso zzso The sites were numbered from the zzso zzso It appeared that site 1 is necessary for the zzso of zzso only, while sites 2, 3, and to a lesser extent 4 (which is zzso to and strongly affects zzso act zzso The results also suggest that of the 10 binding sites for the zzso zzso which mediates nitrogen zzso repression, those which are centrally located are zzso zzso The zzso of an unrelated upstream zzso sequence into the zzso region strongly affected the expression of both zzso irrespective of the orientation in which the element was zzso
