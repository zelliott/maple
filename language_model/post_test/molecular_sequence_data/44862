The zzso gene of the pig pathogen zzso zzso encodes zzso a zzso of zzso the zzso zzso regulator of zzso zzso The zzso gone zzso the zzso respiratory deficiencies of zzso coli zzso zzso but also zzso the expression of an otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have distinct but overlapping zzso The zzso gene has been zzso as a zzso fusion and the zzso protein zzso Similar to zzso zzso can acquire a zzso zzso which promotes binding to the zzso box zzso of zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli induced the zzso production of at least five zzso including the zzso gene product, which were not induced by zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed the presence of two zzso boxes situated at zzso and zzso zzso with this zzso expression from the zzso Class I promoter zzso + zzso was efficiently activated by zzso but not by zzso The weaker level of zzso zzso of Class I promoters suggests that there is a poorer zzso contact zzso region 1 zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso at these promoters and that zzso possesses an additional or improved zzso The zzso of zzso is partially characterized by a zzso region around zzso acid zzso which zzso the altered specificity and provides an explanation for the existence of distinct but overlapping zzso and zzso zzso
