In this review, we describe the structure and biological properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the novel members of the zzso zzso zzso which has been identified in the zzso zzso dog, and zzso is a specific zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso elicits a zzso greater effect on a zzso zzso CT zzso than zzso CT, although this zzso has high structural similarity with zzso zzso is expressed and zzso mainly in the central nervous system zzso zzso and zzso zzso In an in zzso experiment, zzso administration of zzso into rats reduced the plasma calcium zzso but did not alter blood pressure, indicating its action as a CT zzso zzso in the peripheral zzso In the zzso zzso is also deduced to be an zzso zzso for the CT zzso zzso has been identified in the pig and dog, and zzso has been identified only in the zzso They are expressed and zzso mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso However, their zzso molecular forms, zzso and biological activity remain zzso
