Upon infection of the tropical zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso are formed on the roots as well as on the zzso Stem zzso appear at multiple predetermined sites consisting of dormant root zzso which are positioned in vertical rows along the stem of the zzso We used the differential display method to isolate and characterize three zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to genes whose expression is enhanced in the dormant root zzso after zzso Database searches revealed that the deduced zzso zzso gene product shares significant similarity with zzso cell wall zzso The zzso zzso and zzso products are similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso clones zzso and zzso were first zzso 1 day after zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were found at low levels in zzso root zzso and were enhanced significantly around 3 days after zzso In addition, a zzso was isolated zzso that zzso to the previously identified zzso gene zzso These studies show that differential display is a useful method for the isolation of zzso zzso
