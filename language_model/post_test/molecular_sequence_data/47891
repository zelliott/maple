The zzso zzso zzso protein and its zzso relative, zzso define a large family of zzso zzso zzso By binding regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions zzso of their zzso zzso zzso and zzso have key zzso roles in early zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is required for repression of zzso zzso to achieve the zzso switch from zzso to zzso 

We report here that zzso and zzso zzso one of three zzso zzso zzso zzso interact with each other in both zzso zzso and in zzso zzso We have delineated the portions of each protein required for this zzso zzso lacking zzso function were derived either by zzso interference zzso and zzso or by use of a deletion zzso zzso The roles of the three zzso genes overlap during zzso zzso In certain zzso animals, the zzso zzso switch was zzso leading to the production of excess zzso and no zzso In other zzso animals, the entire germ line died during zzso zzso This zzso death did not require zzso a zzso required for zzso 

The data suggest that zzso zzso in the zzso switch through its physical interaction with zzso forming a regulatory complex that controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso also function in the switch, but do not interact directly with zzso The three zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso are also critical for zzso zzso We propose that this may have been the primitive function of zzso zzso
