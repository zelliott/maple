To study zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso of zzso zzso and their relationship to resistance to antibiotics that target the large zzso zzso 

Single and dual zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were introduced into a zzso zzso strain with a single functional zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso antibiotics were determined for the engineered zzso The doubling times of the zzso strains were measured to investigate how the introduced zzso affected growth zzso 

Single zzso zzso zzso and zzso and double zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso The zzso zzso resulted in various levels of resistance to zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso zzso showed reduced zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso exhibited decreased zzso to zzso and zzso Moreover, the dual zzso zzso and zzso had zzso on resistance to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play key roles in resistance to clinically useful antibiotics that target the large zzso zzso Furthermore, the double zzso zzso and zzso have combined effects on resistance to zzso zzso
