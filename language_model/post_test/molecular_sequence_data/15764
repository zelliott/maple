The principal objectives of this study were to analyze the structure and coding potential of a long segment of DNA missing from a previously isolated zzso Moss, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cooper (1981) zzso zzso 40, zzso attenuated zzso of zzso virus strain WR and to examine the precise changes in the zzso accompanying the zzso The sequences of a zzso region located at the left end of the standard zzso virus zzso extending from within the zzso terminal repetition zzso of the zzso C zzso to the end of the zzso N fragment, and of a zzso segment from a corresponding region of the zzso zzso were zzso A comparison of these sequences revealed that the zzso contained a deletion of 12 zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso The origin of the inserted DNA was traced to the zzso B region by using zzso zzso indicating that a zzso of unique DNA located adjacent to the right zzso had zzso zzso analysis indicated no extensive zzso zzso zzso additions, or deletions at the boundaries of the zzso zzso zzso of the right end of the zzso zzso indicated that a copy of the zzso DNA was still present and, therefore, the length of the zzso had been increased by zzso zzso The zzso zzso could have formed by a mechanism that resulted in the replacement of a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The DNA missing from the zzso and contained within the standard zzso virus WR zzso contains 17 zzso open reading frames zzso all of which are directed zzso and apparently not required for replication in cultured zzso One deleted zzso has a zzso sequence similarity to another gene zzso a zzso protein present within the zzso suggesting that zzso have previously occurred during the evolution of zzso zzso Another deleted zzso has a zzso sequence similarity to a complement zzso binding zzso The zzso DNA contains two complete zzso one of which has a zzso identity to a zzso gene and a zzso identity to a family of plasma zzso zzso zzso
