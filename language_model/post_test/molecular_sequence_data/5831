zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso protein zzso X rays to zzso A resolution and belong to the zzso space group C2 with unit cell parameters a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso A, and beta zzso zzso zzso One zzso unit of the crystal may contain between 28 and 35 zzso based on reasonable crystal density zzso A zzso function and Patterson synthesis suggest that zzso zzso protein zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso of the viral particle zzso are not zzso in the zzso zzso The assembly of a zzso array in the crystal reflects the absence of any zzso zzso However, it is expected that the zzso interactions seen in the crystal will be preferred and will relate to those found in the immature or mature zzso
