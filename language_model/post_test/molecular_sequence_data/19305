While the zzso zzso comprises one of the best characterized zzso zzso regarding the major zzso complex zzso the organization of this gene complex has never been studied in other zzso and information on zzso zzso zzso than zzso is generally very zzso Here, we describe the characterization of the first zzso class II B zzso sequences from a zzso zzso species, the European zzso zzso zzso zzso We isolated two transcript sequences differing substantially in zzso acid composition and length within the zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of the zzso binding region in this species, we zzso a zzso large zzso from wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified eight distinct zzso All zzso but one were zzso and many of the highly zzso sites corresponded with zzso acid positions known to be involved in zzso zzso The level of variation we found in zzso zzso was similar compared to that previously found in a comparable sample of a wild zzso species, zzso zzso and to that found in zzso zzso Based on the zzso data and the zzso zzso diversity, we conclude that zzso possesses at least two class II B zzso With our new zzso zzso we were able to generate sequences in other species of zzso We provide here a first zzso analysis of this gene in zzso
