The zzso gene maps to the X zzso center region in both mouse and human, and previous analysis of the 3' end of the gene has demonstrated inactive zzso zzso suggesting a possible role in X zzso We have now analyzed the entire mouse zzso zzso The mature inactive zzso transcript is 15 zzso in length and contains no zzso zzso The zzso sequence contains a number of regions comprised of tandem zzso zzso with the human zzso gene demonstrates significant conservation of sequence and gene zzso zzso zzso is not associated with the zzso machinery of the cell and is located almost exclusively in the zzso Together with conservation of inactive zzso zzso these findings support a role for zzso in X zzso possibly as a functional zzso or as a zzso organizer zzso
