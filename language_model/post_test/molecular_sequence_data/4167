Early zzso structural studies of serum zzso were based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies of zzso zzso From the early studies information on zzso zzso chain dynamics and order zzso and zzso organization zzso More recently, selective or complete zzso labeling techniques, combined with zzso zzso zzso have resulted in structural information of zzso zzso Finally, use of zzso three- and zzso experiments have yielded solution structures and zzso interactions of intact zzso zzso zzso and zzso
