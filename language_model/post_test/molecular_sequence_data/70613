A zzso protein zzso isolated and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been shown to enhance clearance of infection following pulmonary challenge with zzso in zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that it was zzso identical to a gene zzso a cell envelope protein of the zzso zzso Rd strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed a zzso zzso rich in basic zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene was relatively zzso among zzso of zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene from 20 different zzso showed that similarity with zzso ranged from zzso (1 zzso to zzso zzso zzso Two zzso forms of zzso a full length zzso protein zzso to zzso and a zzso protein lacking a zzso leader zzso zzso to processed zzso were assessed in zzso studies for the ability to induce an immune response that would be as effective as the native protein in enhancing the clearance of zzso following pulmonary challenge in zzso zzso with the zzso protein that included the leader zzso was more effective in enhancing pulmonary zzso and it induced a better zzso response and higher zzso of systemic and zzso zzso This study has characterized a zzso protein from zzso that shows significant potential as a vaccine zzso
