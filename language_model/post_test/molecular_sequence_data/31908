zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen that causes fatal disease if the host immunity is zzso The mortality rate of systemic zzso is very high; zzso there is a zzso demand for novel zzso In this study, quantitative zzso zzso of zzso zzso during adaptation to fetal bovine serum zzso is zzso Survival in blood is essential for zzso of zzso zzso and a detailed analysis is zzso We cultivated zzso zzso in zzso for zzso and determined quantitative zzso variations of zzso proteins in the cultured cells by using a zzso system with a long monolithic zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso proteins associated with zzso of zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso cycle, zzso zzso and iron zzso Furthermore, we identified possible zzso factors such as zzso (named zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso shortened the lag phase and resulted in a zzso zzso zzso indicating a possible role for quick adaptation to a stressful zzso While further experiments are necessary to prove zzso of the identified factors, systematic identification of candidate zzso proteins in this study will lead to profound understanding of zzso of zzso zzso 

This paper describes zzso zzso of zzso zzso during adaptation to serum, which is an essential process for fatal systemic zzso Using a zzso system with a monolithic zzso zzso column, we have successfully characterized zzso variations of zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso was identified as a novel zzso zzso zzso which could have an important role for zzso of zzso zzso
