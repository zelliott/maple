The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 zzso has been zzso to serve a variety of functions in the virus life zzso Previously, we introduced a large number of zzso into the zzso zzso and determined the effects on virus zzso These studies identified zzso involved in virus assembly and release and envelope zzso incorporation into zzso Here we describe the identification and characterization of viral zzso containing zzso changes in the zzso which compensate for the effects of four of the original zzso on zzso zzso Specifically, zzso at zzso zzso 4 and 6 severely impaired virus assembly and zzso zzso at zzso 4 and 6 reversed the zzso of the zzso acid 4 change while zzso zzso at zzso positions 10, 69, and 97 partially or fully reversed the zzso of the zzso acid 6 zzso A zzso at zzso zzso 62 reversed the effect of a position 34 change which blocks envelope zzso incorporation into zzso and zzso at zzso 27 and 51 reversed the zzso of a position 86 zzso which zzso virus assembly to the zzso In addition to determining the effects of the zzso changes in the context of the original zzso we also introduced and analyzed the zzso changes alone in the context of the zzso molecular zzso The data presented here define potential zzso and zzso interactions which occur in the zzso during the virus life cycle and have implications for our understanding of the relationship between zzso structure and zzso
