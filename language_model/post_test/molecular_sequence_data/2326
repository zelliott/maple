A zzso of the zzso locus was detected in a zzso line zzso established from a zzso leukemia zzso zzso This zzso was associated with the high-level expression of zzso zzso and the zzso gene product, zzso DNA from zzso cells transformed zzso in DNA zzso experiments, and the transformed zzso contained the rearranged zzso zzso The zzso involved one zzso and was present in tissue from the primary tumor from which the cell line was zzso Cloning and sequencing of the rearranged zzso and comparison with the normal zzso demonstrated that the zzso was complex and probably resulted from the integration of a zzso in the zzso locus between a zzso zzso zzso and the first coding zzso and a subsequent zzso zzso between this zzso and another newly acquired zzso also located on zzso zzso These events resulted in the zzso of the coding zzso of the zzso locus away from the zzso zzso zzso region to a new zzso site on zzso zzso zzso of the coding regions of the gene failed to detect zzso in the zzso 13th, zzso or 61st zzso The possible reasons for the complexity of the zzso and the significance of the zzso of the zzso locus to zzso transformation are zzso
