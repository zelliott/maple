DNA zzso among zzso zzso zzso are widely used as genetic markers in zzso cloning zzso New zzso molecular markers do not only facilitate molecular zzso but can also be used to obtain reliable sequence information for zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso markers and a direct sequencing strategy to estimate genetic similarity among zzso zzso zzso zzso at four zzso two from the nuclear and two from a zzso zzso were zzso For each zzso more than 1000 zzso of sequence information was zzso and genetic similarity was calculated from a total of 35 zzso sites using a zzso zzso zzso ranged from zero up to 50 zzso characters among the 72 characters defined by the zzso Separate calculations based on the nuclear and the zzso sequences were performed and revealed a number of common features, including the existence of small clusters of very closely related zzso separated from each other by extensive sequence zzso Our results provide information useful especially to investigators setting up crosses for zzso landing zzso
