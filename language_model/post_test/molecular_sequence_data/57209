The zzso coli zzso protein zzso is a member of the highly zzso family of zzso zzso 60, which assist in the folding and assembly of other zzso Using zzso zzso it is shown that replacement of the absolutely zzso zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso the zzso particle and that the replacement zzso completely blocks its zzso The rank order of effects of these zzso on the stability of the zzso particle zzso with the associated changes in net charge at that zzso Our results show that the N zzso of zzso is a crucial structural element for its zzso
