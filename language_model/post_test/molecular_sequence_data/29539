The sequencing of the human zzso has opened the way for using zzso to identify sets of genes controlled by specific regulatory zzso Here, we review the unexpected diversity of DNA response elements zzso zzso regulation by zzso receptors zzso which control the broad zzso effects of zzso Consensus zzso zzso response elements are found in only a few known zzso target zzso whereas most responsive genes contain only zzso half zzso which may also control regulation by other nuclear zzso zzso can also regulate gene expression in the absence of direct interaction with DNA, via zzso interactions with other zzso factors or by modulating the activity of upstream signaling zzso thereby significantly expanding the repertoire of zzso zzso These diverse mechanisms of action must be taken into account in screening for potential zzso sequences in the zzso or in regulatory regions of target genes identified by expression zzso
