A survey detected zzso zzso yellow vein virus zzso infection in six Chinese zzso zzso To study the diversity of virus zzso among the regions, zzso sequences of four zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined and the zzso acid sequences thus deduced were analyzed using sequence alignments and the zzso method, zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso revealed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso no Chinese isolate was found to cluster with European zzso zzso Chinese zzso proteins clustered into three groups with seven zzso motifs zzso zzso Of the seven, the zzso zzso has not been reported zzso Most Chinese zzso proteins clustered in zzso group, zzso from European zzso zzso zzso containing zzso 5 occurred in most of the investigated regions and were associated with both zzso zzso zzso analyses of these four proteins showed complex patterns of genetic diversity among these Chinese zzso and indicated that the zzso of China and Japan were more closely related and may have a common zzso
