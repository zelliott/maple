The zzso position of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on comparative zzso zzso gene and zzso sequence analyses was found to be controversial, as the strain showed high similarity to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the relationship between the two species was investigated by a zzso study that included, in addition to zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso determination of zzso binding and zzso sequence analysis zzso of zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and DNA zzso B zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed relatively high similarity zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed close zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso similarity between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso In addition, relatively high zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso was found between the zzso Similar zzso and a high zzso binding value zzso confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Based on these results, it is proposed that the species zzso zzso Kim et zzso 2010 should be reclassified as a later zzso synonym of zzso zzso Reuter 1963 zzso zzso zzso
