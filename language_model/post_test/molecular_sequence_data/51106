We have cloned and determined the zzso sequence of a novel zzso zzso designated zzso from rat zzso zzso and kidney with the aid of the zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso contains 737 base pairs zzso the sequence zzso a mature protein of 235 zzso acid zzso partial zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso comparisons showed that zzso zzso shares 87 and zzso sequence identity with rat tissue zzso at zzso acid and zzso acid levels, zzso It encodes a zzso zzso protein whose derived zzso acid sequence matches completely with the partial zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gutman et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Berg et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso by zzso retains the key zzso acid zzso determining zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis with an zzso zzso probe showed that its zzso level in the zzso zzso is decreased dramatically by administration of the beta zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso and Southern zzso of zzso zzso which showed that zzso is expressed at high levels in the zzso zzso and low levels in the kidney but not in seven other zzso including zzso liver, heart, adrenal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cloned from the kidney and zzso zzso show sequence zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
