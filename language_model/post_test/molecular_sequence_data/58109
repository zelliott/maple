The human zzso gene is expressed specifically in B zzso and likely has an important function in zzso zzso A nearly full length human zzso zzso clone was used to isolate zzso clones that span the zzso zzso The zzso gene is spread over 22 zzso of DNA and is composed of 15 zzso The first zzso contains the major zzso start zzso The translation initiation zzso is located in zzso 3, which also encodes a portion of the signal zzso zzso 4 to 10 zzso the seven zzso zzso of zzso zzso 11 encodes the zzso domain, zzso 12 to 15 zzso the zzso domain of zzso and zzso 15 also contains the 3' untranslated zzso A minor form of zzso zzso likely results from zzso of zzso 5 to zzso 8, skipping zzso 6 and zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was used to map the zzso location of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso locus was identified by combining fluorescent images of the probe with the zzso zzso pattern generated by an zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is located within the band region zzso of zzso zzso Two closely clustered major zzso start sites and several minor start sites were mapped by primer zzso zzso to many other zzso zzso the zzso promoter lacks an obvious zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso of DNA zzso of the zzso start sites were zzso and found to contain multiple zzso zzso Potential binding sites for the zzso factors zzso B, zzso and zzso are located within 300 zzso zzso of the major zzso start zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso promoter region was zzso into a zzso zzso zzso and after zzso into B and T cells was found to be active in both B and T zzso Further studies of the zzso gene should lead to a greater understanding of the expression of zzso during B cell development and zzso
