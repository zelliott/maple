zzso is a zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso implicated in long-term zzso zzso forms of synaptic zzso Our previous zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies detected zzso zzso in zzso zzso and cell bodies of zzso in the rat cerebral zzso and zzso This observation suggested that zzso zzso is selectively zzso to zzso where it may be translated locally in response to synaptic zzso To test this hypothesis further, we isolated a full-length zzso clone of the zzso human zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso zzso library, determined its zzso and predicted zzso acid zzso and performed zzso expression studies in cerebral zzso from normal human patients and from patients with zzso disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso The human zzso clone detects a single approximately zzso zzso zzso whose zzso sequence is zzso similar to the rat zzso sequence and zzso similar to its zzso acid zzso zzso studies detect robust zzso of zzso zzso in cell bodies of numerous zzso throughout Layers zzso and in both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso We conclude that zzso targeting of zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso In zzso zzso zzso there is little or no evidence for zzso zzso zzso to zzso while in zzso zzso targeting of zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso Comparative studies in zzso and zzso point to the potential importance of zzso integrity and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso targeting in the human zzso
