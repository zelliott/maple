zzso 3 zzso has been identified and characterized as a zzso membrane protein in zzso and zzso We identified two putative zzso in zzso zzso forms 1 and zzso both with an identical cluster of positively charged zzso acid zzso zzso immediately preceding one of the two predicted zzso zzso zzso In zzso transformed zzso and tobacco zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso 2) sorted zzso from the zzso directly to zzso the first sorting zzso described for any zzso in zzso zzso and zzso were necessary for targeting form 2 to zzso and sufficient for directing zzso zzso to zzso in both cell zzso The N and C zzso of zzso zzso 2) extend into the zzso zzso different from zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, two authentic zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing a membrane zzso targeting zzso the first one defined for a plant zzso and for any zzso zzso exist in plant zzso
