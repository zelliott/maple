The very last member of the zzso gene family of facilitated zzso zzso to be cloned was zzso zzso It has been assigned to the class II of the zzso family on the basis of sequence zzso and its closest family member is zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso is primarily expressed in the small zzso and zzso although zzso has been detected in the zzso and prostate as zzso The protein is expressed in the zzso membrane of the small zzso and zzso and it has a high affinity zzso zzso for zzso and zzso The abundance of the protein in the small zzso does change in parallel with the dietary zzso However, the distribution of zzso along the small zzso does not entirely match with the availability of zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso for this zzso has yet to be zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso there is no evidence for the zzso of zzso to the zzso movement via zzso One area of study in which zzso has provided a useful comparison with zzso has been in the development of the hypothesis that the facilitated zzso zzso may have a selectivity filter at the zzso opening of the zzso zzso which helps to determine which zzso can be zzso If substantiated, the zzso of this mechanism may prove useful in the design of zzso zzso for use in cancer imaging and zzso
