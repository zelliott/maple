The protein zzso from the zzso of zzso coli exhibits both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structure of the protein has been determined in three different zzso as the full-length native zzso as a truncated form lacking the last 21 zzso and as the same truncated form in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is divided into two zzso The zzso domain includes three zzso that are zzso with those of the other zzso to provide all zzso contacts maintaining the zzso zzso The zzso domain, which belongs to the zzso protein zzso family, binds the zzso zzso The overall form of the zzso is zzso and the different crystal structures reveal a flexibility in the relative orientation of the two zzso zzso located at the zzso of the zzso The deletion zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain only, exists in solution as a mixture of zzso and zzso species, and exhibits zzso zzso By contrast, a deletion zzso zzso the zzso domain only is zzso and although it shows zzso activity, it is devoid of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso activities reside in the N and zzso zzso zzso zzso the observed mobility of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso could effectively adapt these two independent folding functions of zzso to zzso zzso
