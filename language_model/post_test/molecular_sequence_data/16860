zzso function is strongly affected by temperature, and zzso from species adapted to different zzso environments often show temperature compensation in kinetic zzso Antarctic zzso zzso live in a habitat of constant, extreme cold zzso zzso 2 degrees zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these species have adapted to this environment through higher zzso rates, lower zzso zzso energies zzso and increases in the apparent zzso constant for the zzso zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso was used to determine which zzso acid zzso found in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso from zzso zzso are responsible for these zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso was measured in eight single and two double zzso and zzso was tested in five single and two double zzso in the temperature range 0 degrees zzso degrees zzso Of the four zzso that had an effect on these zzso two increased zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso and two increased both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The double zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso and zzso to levels not significantly different from the zzso of a warm temperate fish zzso zzso habitat temperature 10 degrees zzso degrees zzso The four single zzso are associated with two zzso that move during the zzso zzso those that affect zzso but not zzso are further from the active site than those that affect both zzso These results provide evidence that zzso cold adaptation in zzso involves changes in mobility of zzso important molecular zzso zzso these changes may alter zzso energy alone or zzso energy and zzso affinity zzso and zzso the extent to which these parameters are affected may depend on the location of the zzso within the mobile zzso perhaps due to differences in proximity to the active zzso
