zzso transfer between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso depends on the physical interaction between both zzso We have applied a random zzso approach with subsequent in zzso selection using the zzso zzso system to obtain zzso of zzso zzso zzso with higher affinity for zzso One zzso showed a zzso enhanced binding using affinity zzso on immobilized zzso A single zzso exchange in the active site was responsible for its increased zzso The zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso complex predicts substantial zzso of zzso interactions in the active site of the zzso with subsequent structural zzso zzso for the first time a point zzso in this important class of zzso is described which leads to greatly enhanced affinity for its protein zzso
