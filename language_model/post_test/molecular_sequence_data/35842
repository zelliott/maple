The zzso of the majority of the zzso protein zzso genes of zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso designated zzso boxes, which specifically bind the zzso protein zzso in zzso To investigate to what extent this global system of zzso regulation has been zzso we have isolated a number of zzso genes of the related zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose counterparts in zzso are controlled by zzso The coding regions of these genes showed a sequence similarity of about zzso when compared to their zzso zzso In contrast, little or no sequence similarity was found between the upstream regions and the intervening sequences of zzso and zzso zzso However, the occurrence and the position of the zzso is zzso The sequence data also show that the physical linkage that exists in zzso zzso between the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso in zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that each of the isolated zzso genes is zzso zzso By sequence comparison we identified a number of zzso sequences in the upstream region of each of the zzso zzso zzso which we designated the X, Z and zzso zzso The last one is highly similar, though not zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region between the genes zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso showed that the zzso box zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso while the X box acts as a zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the existence of a zzso protein in zzso that binds to the zzso box but not to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso did recognize the zzso zzso
