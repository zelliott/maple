The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels plays a vital role in the function of neuroendocrine and cardiovascular zzso In this article, we report on the molecular and functional basis of zzso zzso channel zzso by protein zzso C zzso Specifically, we show that the zzso 81 zzso zzso site at the zzso region plays a critical role in zzso zzso channel zzso by zzso The introduction of a zzso charged zzso at position 81, by converting zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso channel by zzso was prevented by zzso cells with a zzso acid zzso mimicking the zzso zzso region zzso zzso In addition, the data revealed that only zzso and zzso zzso are implicated in this zzso These novel findings have significant implications in the zzso of zzso zzso channel and in the development of zzso zzso zzso
