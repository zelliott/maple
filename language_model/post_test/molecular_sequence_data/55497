zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso acid to produce zzso zzso zzso coding gene zzso of zzso media zzso was zzso zzso and expressed with His tag using zzso expression zzso in zzso coli zzso Higher expression was obtained with zzso zzso zzso induction for 5 h at 37 zzso in LB medium supplemented with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso His zzso zzso was zzso using zzso affinity zzso and characterized for various zzso and kinetic zzso The zzso zzso showed optimal activity at pH zzso and zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso zzso The optimum temperature was determined to be 35 zzso The zzso showed apparent zzso and zzso values for zzso as zzso zzso and 114 zzso zzso The zzso was stable in pH range of zzso and temperature up to 45 zzso zzso metal zzso requirement of zzso was efficiently fulfilled by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cloned gene zzso product showed molecular weight of approximately 51 zzso by zzso which is in agreement with the molecular weight calculated from putative zzso acid zzso This is the first report on expression and characterization of zzso zzso from zzso zzso
