To genetically and functionally characterize zzso of zzso that lead to zzso in a child with zzso zzso zzso 

We identified two zzso zzso in a child with clinical features of zzso zzso zzso one a previously described zzso in the zzso domain zzso and the other a novel zzso leading to zzso of the zzso after the box 1 zzso domain zzso Cell line models were created to examine the ability of the zzso receptors to signal in response to zzso and zzso zzso 

Data from zzso models indicate that zzso zzso does not support significant signaling in response to zzso due to impaired trafficking of the zzso zzso to the cell zzso Alternative zzso agents do not circumvent this block to zzso likely due to the zzso of the zzso In addition, previous data indicate that zzso zzso does not support zzso signaling due to the loss of critical zzso zzso 

This case demonstrates two different mechanisms by which zzso zzso can impair zzso zzso and suggests that zzso in the zzso domain will not be rescued by zzso zzso if they interfere with normal zzso zzso
