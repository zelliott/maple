zzso virus zzso was previously shown to zzso a functional zzso the product of the zzso zzso which is zzso late in infection, after the onset of DNA zzso Here we report that an open reading frame in the zzso zzso designated as zzso encodes a protein that has sequence similarity to zzso and possesses zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in infected cells can be detected as early as 4 zzso after infection and is zzso expressed up to 24 zzso zzso A protein zzso to zzso and retaining the predicted zzso active center is zzso by the recently zzso zzso zzso virus zzso whereas zzso protein is not zzso suggesting that the zzso activity of zzso may be involved in replication of all zzso
