We analyzed a combined data set of two zzso nuclear genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a nuclear zzso gene zzso zzso zzso for 68 bee species and 11 zzso zzso Our zzso sampling included all seven extant bee families, 17 of 20 zzso and diverse zzso zzso zzso included the two families most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso We analyzed the combined and single gene data sets using zzso and zzso methods, which yielded largely zzso zzso Our results provide reasonably strong support for family and zzso relationships among zzso Our data set strongly supports the zzso relationship of the zzso and zzso and places zzso as sister to this zzso zzso Our analyses place the zzso and the zzso zzso bee zzso zzso near the base of the tree with zzso (and zzso in a fairly highly derived zzso This zzso zzso zzso was obtained in previous zzso studies under certain methods of character zzso A more widely accepted tree zzso that places zzso zzso zzso as sister to all other bees zzso zzso is not supported by our zzso The zzso zzso hypothesis may better explain patterns in the bee fossil record as well as historical zzso of certain bee zzso Our results provide new insights into zzso bee zzso and indicate that zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso are useful data sets for resolving zzso zzso in bees and other zzso
