zzso a zzso protein and developing a procedure for its stable production as a biologically active zzso are key steps in its potential application to clinical zzso zzso zzso protein designed to target activated T zzso was found to be a promising zzso for targeted treatment, however was found to be difficult to produce as a biological active zzso Thus, we designed a new version of the zzso zzso in which six zzso acids zzso zzso from the zzso of the large zzso of zzso 3 were zzso zzso expressions, zzso and partial zzso of the zzso yielded zzso batches with consistent zzso We found that zzso causes cell death in a specific, zzso and zzso zzso Cell death due to zzso is caused by zzso This improved and biologically stable zzso zzso protein may be developed in the future for clinical trails as a promising therapy for several zzso involving activated zzso Moreover, this truncated zzso 3 zzso lacking the zzso six zzso acids of its large zzso may be used in other zzso zzso zzso proteins targeted against various human diseases, using the appropriate targeting zzso
