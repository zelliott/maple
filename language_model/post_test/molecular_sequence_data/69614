We have previously presented evidence for two zzso I zzso species in rat skeletal zzso One form of zzso I zzso is selectively expressed in fetal and early zzso life, and the second is present in both fetal and adult zzso These two zzso I receptors were shown to have similar zzso zzso maps but to differ in beta zzso molecular weight zzso for the fetal zzso zzso for the adult type zzso In this study, we have used specific zzso to investigate the structural relationships between the two zzso I zzso zzso I zzso beta zzso zzso were generated against synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso of the cloned human zzso I zzso and the capacity of these zzso to interact with the two zzso I receptors was zzso Both zzso zzso selectively zzso the higher molecular weight fetal zzso and not the adult zzso from rat zzso Human zzso and muscle were shown to contain two receptors similar to those observed in rat zzso In human muscle, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso also selectively zzso the fetal type zzso The presence of a zzso zzso zzso I zzso beta zzso distinct from the insulin zzso beta zzso in human muscle was confirmed by the demonstration of an zzso I sensitive zzso with a beta zzso of this size after insulin zzso zzso These data strongly support the conclusion that the fetal and adult type zzso I receptors differ in primary zzso The fetal zzso zzso to the cloned and zzso zzso I zzso and the primary structure of the adult type zzso has not yet been zzso
