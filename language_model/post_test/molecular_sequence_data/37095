zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso were used to examine the regulation of the two known human zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso amplification across zzso 5 and restriction zzso analysis indicated that zzso cells possess genes corresponding to both the zzso zzso and a more recently characterized zzso zzso that exhibits zzso identity to zzso in the coding zzso These are unlikely to represent zzso because both genes were present in DNA samples from 100 of 100 zzso zzso real-time zzso determined that zzso zzso is expressed at significantly lower levels than zzso zzso in human liver zzso The zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso cultures of zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso This zzso exhibits a significantly decreased zzso zzso and can be activated by zzso to a level similar to that of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in both control and zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating that the induction of zzso by zzso is independent of elevated zzso zzso zzso or zzso induction of zzso zzso was not evident in either control or zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso expression can be induced by zzso and zzso zzso
