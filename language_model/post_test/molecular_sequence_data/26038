The zzso sequence of a small zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso strain of zzso zzso has been zzso The sequence contains only one large zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequence shows zzso to the zzso proteins of some other small zzso zzso In addition there are two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are similar to but not identical with the zzso known from other zzso plasmids to be involved in lagging strand initiation and possibly leading strand zzso zzso zzso functional analysis of zzso has been carried out by assessing the effect of interrupting the sequence at three unique restriction zzso zzso The zzso zzso and its relationship to other small zzso zzso is zzso
