The zzso gene complex is a region on human zzso 12 containing several families of zzso genes including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that the region zzso of zzso contains in addition to the zzso gene the novel human zzso and the zzso and zzso genes within about 100 zzso zzso similarities and zzso arrangement suggest that these genes form a separate zzso of zzso genes within the zzso gene zzso zzso is selectively expressed in zzso cells and to a lower extent in zzso and zzso zzso forms with and without a stalk zzso are zzso During functional maturation of zzso cells the level of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso is found to be not only expressed in zzso cells, but also in zzso cells and in the latter aspect resembles the zzso zzso Whereas zzso full-length zzso and zzso are transported to the cell surface, zzso proteins accumulate in zzso zzso We propose that this family of zzso genes encodes receptors with important immune and/or scavenger functions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
