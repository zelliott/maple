A promoter zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and zzso This promoter lies adjacent to, and outside, the 3' end of an zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame, zzso on the complementary strand which codes for the putative zzso of this zzso zzso A DNA zzso containing zzso and part of zzso was fused to the zzso gene and inserted into the zzso shuttle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transformed with this zzso exhibited zzso zzso However, zzso was only expressed in zzso coli under the control of zzso when zzso was zzso zzso of mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso resulted in the induction of a high zzso and cellular response directed against zzso The zzso expression system may prove to be particularly useful for cloning and expression of zzso genes in the zzso vaccine zzso
