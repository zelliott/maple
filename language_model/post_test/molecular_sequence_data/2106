The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso regional amplification yielding zzso zzso circles varying in size from zzso length to very high zzso A comparison of the base sequence of the five plasmids zzso with the region of the zzso from which they were zzso indicated that the amplified zzso segments were determined by a zzso process near or within two structurally distinctive zzso One of these, consisting of nearly uninterrupted strings of zzso and zzso zzso tandem zzso site direct repeats, could form an extended hairpin loop with only a few zzso It was found at or near the zzso exchange point of all of the zzso An extended zzso sequence containing zzso direct repeats was the primary 3' site of zzso Base sequence changes were found in the vicinity of exchange zzso Most notable of these was a G zzso and T to C transition within a section of the zzso region likely to form a hairpin loop, suggesting the involvement of a mismatch zzso mechanism in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified as a likely candidate for the site of replication zzso A nearly identical sequence was found common to all of the corresponding plasmids of zzso zzso and was reported near the presumed replication origin of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A search of zzso revealed a remarkable association of the consensus zzso zzso with the plus strand of zzso zzso
