A functional replication origin was zzso using zzso zzso corresponding to three sequence zzso within the zzso zzso Type 1 zzso replication zzso the zzso zzso region zzso the zzso binding site for the viral replication zzso protein E1 zzso and a binding site for the viral zzso zzso and replication zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso origin depended on zzso expression of both the E1 and zzso proteins and on the presence of both the zzso and zzso indicating that it is functionally analogous to the authentic zzso zzso In addition, zzso testing of zzso combinations revealed that the zzso was also essential and that a functional origin required at least one copy of all three zzso While the zzso and zzso are zzso zzso the function of the zzso zzso could be at least partially zzso with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the role of this element is primarily AT zzso rather than zzso A stringent requirement for the zzso was also observed in the context of an authentic minimal origin sequence confirming that it is an intrinsic property of the zzso origin and not simply an artifact of the zzso zzso This study indicates that the minimal functional zzso origin shares the zzso modular organization characteristic of other simple zzso replication zzso The zzso system described now provides a convenient approach to define the physical and functional zzso between the three zzso in a systematic zzso
