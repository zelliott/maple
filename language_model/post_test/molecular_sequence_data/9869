The zzso zzso zzso communicates with the nucleus through the unfolded protein response zzso which senses zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso and leads to increased zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso As a key regulatory step in this signaling pathway, the zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso becomes spliced by a unique mechanism that requires zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso is initiated upon zzso of zzso a zzso zzso that lies in the zzso and/or inner nuclear zzso We show that zzso is a zzso zzso in addition to being a zzso it is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso specifically at both zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso completes zzso we therefore have zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso
