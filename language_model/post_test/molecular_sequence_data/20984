zzso is a zzso zzso modification reaction affecting the zzso stability, and subsequent zzso of these zzso zzso zzso affect taste characteristics in citrus making the associated zzso particularly interesting targets for biotechnology applications in these zzso In this work, a zzso zzso zzso gene was identified, zzso and introduced into the zzso zzso protein expression system utilizing zzso designed against a predicted zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso with a predicted zzso of zzso and is zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso A number of compounds from various zzso zzso were tested, and the zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not zzso the zzso zzso zzso occurred at the 3 zzso position as confirmed by zzso and TLC analyses with certified reference zzso The optimum pH was zzso with a pronounced buffer effect noted for reactions performed in zzso zzso The zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso which is a product of the zzso Treatment of the zzso with a variety of zzso acid zzso compounds suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important for zzso The thorough characterization of this zzso zzso zzso zzso adds to the growing base of zzso knowledge, and will be used to further investigate zzso zzso
