Despite the intense interest in the zzso regulation and evolution of the zzso zzso the long standing question of why most zzso zzso metabolize zzso by zzso rather than zzso remains zzso One such zzso is the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso analysis and zzso zzso we find that in zzso zzso expression of the genes zzso the zzso of the zzso acid cycle and the proteins of the electron transport chain is programmed in a way that favors the zzso of zzso via the zzso acid cycle rather than its reduction to ethanol by zzso Moreover, the results indicate that zzso may be channeled into zzso rather than ethanol, thus preventing the zzso of zzso a pivotal product required for zzso zzso The studies also point out that the regulatory machinery controlled by zzso was most probably the target of evolutionary pressure that directed the flow of zzso into respiratory metabolism rather than zzso This finding has significant implications for the development of metabolically engineered zzso zzso for fuel production from cellulose zzso
