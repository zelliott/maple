zzso zzso 68 zzso zzso mouse is an animal model of zzso infection in man and domestic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso ticks has been considered a close relative of zzso but different in some features of infection in zzso and in zzso Previous comparison of zzso with zzso has revealed their diversity in immune evasion protein zzso In this study, zzso and zzso restriction profiles of the zzso zzso disclosed absence of the deletion that has been identified previously at the left end of zzso of zzso zzso 76 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A 22, zzso zzso portion of zzso zzso sequence was zzso analyzed and compared with that of zzso zzso sequences of 21 genes of zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences revealed their identity to those of zzso except for differences in 15 zzso and 8 zzso acids in 5 genes and their zzso zzso Due to these differences, immune evasion protein zzso and structural proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, are predicted to have a reduced zzso and surface exposure zzso with their zzso zzso These differences obviously contribute to some different zzso features of these viruses and could explain the weaker zzso of zzso in comparison with zzso
