Human zzso zzso zzso L was zzso at acid pH by a zzso zzso The zzso rate decreased with increasing zzso of a small synthetic zzso suggesting that zzso stabilize the active zzso The zzso zzso rate constant increased with organic zzso content of the zzso consistent with internal zzso zzso disrupted by the organic zzso also stabilizing the zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso is accompanied by large structural changes, a decrease in zzso content being especially zzso The high zzso energy of the reaction at pH zzso zzso zzso supported such a major zzso change zzso The acid zzso of zzso L was zzso consistent with the zzso being needed for proper folding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso D was shown to cleave zzso but not active zzso zzso suggesting a potential mechanism for zzso regulation and turnover of zzso L inside zzso
