zzso from zzso snails are indispensable tools for distinguishing various zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso and synthesis of zzso zzso may yield novel zzso of higher potency and zzso We incorporated additional positive charges into zzso and analyzed their binding to zzso Introduction of zzso or zzso zzso instead of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso or zzso substitution in zzso zzso increased the affinity for both the zzso and zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect was most pronounced for zzso with zzso and zzso enhancement for the respective sites, resulting in the most potent zzso blocker of the zzso zzso among those zzso Similarly, zzso substitution in zzso zzso a blocker of zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to increase the affinity for this zzso and endowed zzso with the capacity to distinguish between zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso also zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso present on identified zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso affected only slightly the potency of zzso to block zzso on zzso with low sensitivity to zzso zzso but gave a zzso enhancement of blocking activity in cells with high sensitivity to zzso zzso the introduction of an additional positive charge in the zzso of zzso targeting some muscle or zzso zzso made them more zzso towards the respective zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso the contribution of the zzso positive charge to enhanced affinity towards zzso zzso was rationalized with the aid of computer zzso
