The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an outer membrane protein zzso zzso which serves as the zzso for a zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The gene consisted of zzso zzso zzso 263 zzso zzso Since the first 20 zzso acids most likely constitute the signal zzso mature zzso would consist of 243 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate that zzso is unique among zzso zzso so far zzso but may be zzso related to zzso of enteric bacteria and is zzso to an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso
