Two DNA typing methods, zzso restriction zzso length zzso analysis and zzso amplified zzso length zzso analysis, were used to study the genetic relationships among 90 zzso zzso zzso Both methods were found to be highly zzso generating a zzso with 2 main zzso The division of the zzso zzso population into 2 subspecies was supported by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso strains were found in all main zzso suggesting horizontal transfer of the zzso zzso In contrast, 2 zzso traits, complement resistance and adherence to zzso cells, were strongly associated with 1 of the 2 zzso The branch depth suggested that zzso adherent strains zzso from a common zzso more recently than did zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest the existence of zzso of zzso zzso that differ in zzso and they may have implications for vaccine zzso
