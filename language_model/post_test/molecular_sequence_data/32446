Human zzso zzso II zzso is a zzso zzso found mainly in the brain, small zzso and zzso In the brain, it zzso zzso liberating free zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to be zzso in models of stroke and other zzso In zzso it is known as zzso membrane zzso a cancer zzso Recently, human zzso zzso III zzso a zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid identity, was zzso While zzso is recognized as an important pharmaceutical target, no zzso study of human zzso is available at zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso and characterization of zzso human zzso We show that zzso lacks zzso zzso activity, its activity is dependent on zzso and it is effectively inhibited by several known zzso of zzso In comparison to zzso zzso has lower zzso activity, different pH and salt concentration zzso and distinct zzso zzso indicating that these zzso might play different biological zzso Based on a molecular model, we provide interpretation of the distinct zzso specificity of both zzso and examine the zzso acid zzso responsible for the differences by zzso zzso These results may help to design potent and selective zzso of both zzso
