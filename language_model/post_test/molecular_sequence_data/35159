zzso zzso a zzso zzso antibiotic, harbors remarkably specific zzso activity toward strains of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso gene cluster results in the formation of zzso which is devoid of zzso zzso Here we describe the in zzso zzso zzso analysis, and X-ray zzso structure of the zzso zzso Unlike all other known small zzso zzso which act upon diverse zzso in zzso the zzso zzso is zzso limited in zzso scope and functions only on zzso and close zzso The crystal structures of two related zzso zzso solved to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal a deep, narrow zzso zzso functioning as the binding site for zzso The narrowness of this cavity provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of the extreme zzso zzso Analysis of a panel of point zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso allowed the identification of zzso of structural and zzso zzso These findings further our understanding of one set of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso a rapidly growing sector of natural products zzso
