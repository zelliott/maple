In the present study, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was studied by zzso zzso as well as zzso and molecular dynamic zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was above 10 zzso And the maximum zzso concentration zzso of zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso which was much higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could inhibit zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso by 1, zzso appears to occur moderately before entering the cell but much strongly after penetration of the virus into the zzso In zzso simulations indicated that the binding site of zzso was located at the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with interaction energy zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had important roles during the binding process and are fully or partially zzso in various zzso zzso Based on spatial and energetic criteria, zzso zzso with the binding between zzso and zzso zzso zzso presented here may suggest that zzso possesses zzso properties, and therefore is a potential source of zzso ingredients for the pharmaceutical zzso
