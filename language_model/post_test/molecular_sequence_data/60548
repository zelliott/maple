Two distinct zzso with zzso activity were isolated from a zzso hydrolysate of bovine zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso after which the peptides in the two active zzso obtained were separated by zzso liquid zzso and zzso by zzso tandem mass zzso The major component in each active zzso zzso and zzso was further zzso and the zzso activity of these components was tested against several zzso Depending on the target bacterial strain, these peptides exhibited minimum zzso zzso between 8 and 99 zzso zzso zzso exhibited a consistently higher zzso activity than zzso although both peptides showed a comparable zzso zzso A method of in zzso zzso zzso on a zzso membrane to obtain a fraction enriched in the most active zzso domain is zzso The zzso and zzso activities are discussed in relation to the structure and zzso of the zzso
