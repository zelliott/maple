zzso zzso regulates growth and development in zzso We isolated and characterized a rice zzso dwarf zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a putative zzso zzso which zzso with the rice zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso In zzso a zzso for zzso zzso zzso was highly accumulated in a zzso form and zzso increased its zzso whereas zzso was rapidly zzso by zzso through zzso in the wild zzso We conclude that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso signaling and that regulated degradation of zzso is initiated through zzso zzso and zzso by an zzso zzso
