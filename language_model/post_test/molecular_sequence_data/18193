The zzso sequence of a 1 zzso region of pea zzso DNA upstream from the gene zzso zzso zzso f has been zzso An open reading frame of 231 zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso is separated by 205 zzso from the coding region of zzso The open reading frame is zzso to open reading frames located in a similar position with respect to zzso in zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso rice, wheat and zzso zzso The sequence around a zzso zzso zzso in a putative zzso region of the zzso resembles sequences present in zzso b from zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the open reading frame may zzso a zzso zzso possibly a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates the presence in pea zzso of a complex pattern of transcripts containing zzso Large transcripts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are zzso
