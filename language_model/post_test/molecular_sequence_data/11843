Two zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso A zzso respectively, were isolated from a zzso library derived from zzso extracted from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed properties typical of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso cellulosic zzso The zzso sequences of zzso and zzso revealed open reading frames of 1875 and zzso base pairs, respectively, coding for proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced primary structure of zzso revealed a zzso acid sequence that exhibited identity with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso Family zzso A zzso reiterated zzso which was zzso to duplicated zzso zzso previously observed in zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B, was located at the C zzso of zzso zzso contained two regions that exhibited sequence identity with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Family 11 zzso and were separated by a duplicated zzso sequence that exhibited strong zzso to the C zzso of zzso Analysis of truncated derivatives of zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso sequence constituted the zzso domain, while the zzso domain was not essential for the retention of zzso zzso Similar deletion analysis of zzso showed that the zzso zzso domain zzso exhibited zzso activity, but the corresponding putative zzso zzso domain did not function as a zzso Fusion of the reiterated zzso zzso sequence zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso zzso generated a hybrid protein that did not associate with zzso but bound to zzso and zzso zzso that are components of the zzso zzso complexes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The role of this domain in the assembly of the zzso complex is zzso
