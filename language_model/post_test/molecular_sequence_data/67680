The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1/3 zzso cleave zzso at zzso zzso along the zzso zzso zzso PCs are zzso related to bacterial zzso and are zzso as zzso They contain zzso zzso zzso that function as dedicated zzso that facilitate folding and regulate zzso of zzso zzso through zzso zzso Previous studies identified a zzso zzso zzso that functions as a pH sensor in the zzso of zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso at zzso within the zzso zzso Although this zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso nonetheless activates at zzso within the dense core zzso zzso Here, we analyze the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso zzso and examine why zzso and zzso differ in their zzso zzso zzso analyses establish that while both zzso and zzso are enriched in zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso content in zzso is zzso greater than that in zzso which may augment its pH zzso zzso and molecular dynamics establish that zzso zzso significantly unfolds zzso when compared to zzso to enhance zzso We further demonstrate that zzso and zzso are sufficient to zzso zzso sensing on folding and zzso of their zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso transfers zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso and in zzso Since zzso lack zzso and zzso PCs evolved from zzso not zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso enrichment may have enabled zzso to evolve to exploit pH zzso to activate within specific zzso
