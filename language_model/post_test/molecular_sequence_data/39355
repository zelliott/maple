Clinical stage zzso is an established indicator of breast cancer zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso platform containing zzso genes was used to identify molecular differences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples were collected from patients with zzso or zzso breast cancer, and normal breast tissue was collected from women without invasive zzso zzso genes were zzso in zzso tumors and 22 in zzso tumors when compared to normal zzso and 20 of them were zzso expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, 58 genes were specifically altered in zzso and expression of 6 of them was tested by real time zzso in another cohort of patients with zzso or zzso breast cancer and in women without zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso were zzso expressed on both zzso and zzso tumors as compared to normal zzso Increased zzso levels were detected only in zzso tumors and may represent a molecular marker of this zzso A clear difference in gene expression pattern occurs at the zzso zzso however, most of the zzso expressed genes are zzso in tumors of both zzso zzso and zzso compared to normal breast zzso
