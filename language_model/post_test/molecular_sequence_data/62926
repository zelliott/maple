Different strategies have been used to increase the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso as a vaccine zzso The selected zzso zzso comprises 15 zzso acids zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso in tandem with a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso zzso Several presentations, including zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso beads or to other zzso carriers, have been zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the different presentations of the zzso zzso have been compared with regard to zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso version of the zzso zzso to zzso protein was a better zzso than the zzso alone and showed a higher zzso than other zzso presentations or than the zzso alone zzso to zzso The zzso version, either alone or zzso to zzso enhanced zzso toward zzso zzso sequences relative to zzso zzso In addition, fine zzso mapping of the entire zzso sequence by zzso from the different zzso groups was performed by the spot synthesis zzso zzso showed that the zzso acids involved in molecular recognition were zzso or zzso with particularly strong recognition of the zzso region zzso However, zzso toward the zzso sequences did not completely correlate with recognition of particular zzso acids in the primary zzso These results can find application in the development of zzso vaccine zzso
