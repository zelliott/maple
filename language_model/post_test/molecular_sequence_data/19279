In this paper, we investigated the action of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the Chinese bird zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso channels of adult rat zzso root zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso could reduce the peak currents of zzso zzso channels zzso approximately 100 zzso and zzso zzso channels zzso approximately 55 zzso whereas no effect was detected on zzso zzso zzso The comparative studies indicated that the selectivity of zzso on zzso channels was higher that of zzso and approximately the same as that of zzso zzso is the first discovered toxin with the cross channel activities from the zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso
