zzso expression is zzso and zzso regulated at the zzso and spatial zzso In a previous transgenic mouse analysis, the expression pattern of the zzso zzso gene was zzso by a reporter gene driven by a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso expression of the zzso gene during zzso the mouse zzso promoter was systematically analyzed in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified a minimal promoter zzso containing a zzso protein zzso site upstream of the zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity in a zzso zzso The zzso site was necessary for both zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso bound to its zzso site in the zzso promoter and that the binding was zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso cells, and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells was able to increase the expression level of the zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso promoter in rat zzso zzso cells and zzso canine kidney cells was zzso ranging from 20 to zzso of the activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso the mouse zzso reporter gene in zzso cells, but not in zzso canine kidney zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso of the mouse zzso gene in a cell zzso zzso
