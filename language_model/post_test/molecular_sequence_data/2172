Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified and cloned into zzso zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments, zzso zzso maps of the zzso clone zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the other zzso were zzso Southern zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the clones demonstrated that both zzso code for the three zzso zzso By zzso zzso analysis, the zzso initiation sites, some of the processing sites within the primary zzso and the boundaries of the mature zzso and zzso zzso molecules were zzso Both zzso are transcribed in zzso zzso of the two zzso indicated that they are not zzso The most striking difference between the zzso is the existence of three putative zzso initiation sites in one zzso zzso and only one such site in the other zzso zzso The regions surrounding these zzso transcript end sites share a high level of sequence similarity to each other and to the zzso promoter regions of other zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso 130 zzso of the two zzso zzso genes indicated zzso sequence zzso There are a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene and 10 additional sites of zzso sequence zzso
