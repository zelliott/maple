A zzso clone zzso a zinc finger protein zzso was isolated from a zzso cell expression library using a positive regulatory element zzso to zzso of rat zzso alpha 1 zzso gene zzso as a zzso The clone is apparently an extended one of zzso originally isolated as a negative regulator of zzso 2 gene zzso zzso et zzso (1991) Science zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes zzso zzso zzso It contains 7 zzso motifs arranged in two widely separated zzso A zzso zzso region is observed at the C zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso fused to a reporter zzso gene indicated that the zzso protein enhances or zzso the promoter activity of the gene depending on the quantity of zzso and on the cell zzso The zzso of zzso is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in liver, zzso or zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that the gene zzso zzso is present as only one copy or two at zzso Another zzso clone obtained by using the same probe was identified as zzso zzso zzso Olson, zzso & Kingston, zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso of the zzso enhanced or zzso the promoter activity of zzso depending on the cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
