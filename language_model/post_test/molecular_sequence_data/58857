Heat shock zzso factors zzso of higher zzso respond to physical and cellular stress signals by zzso binding to a specific site on DNA, and zzso genes zzso the heat shock zzso In this work, limited zzso was used as a zzso probe of the domain organization of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso possess an internal zzso region located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeats, suggesting that this is a less structured region compared to those defined for zzso zzso and zzso For a few zzso sites, the zzso form of zzso is more accessible to zzso than the zzso form, providing an additional diagnostic marker for zzso changes in zzso or modification between the zzso and activated forms of zzso
