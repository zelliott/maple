We have investigated the influence of structures in the zzso zzso loop and stem on the ability of the zzso to discriminate among zzso We had previously shown that zzso zzso when placed in the structural context of zzso from zzso coli, zzso efficiently between the zzso zzso as required by the zzso zzso Thus, this zzso read zzso and zzso but did not read zzso and zzso whereas in mycoplasma zzso the same zzso did not discriminate among the zzso zzso We have now determined the reading properties of three constructions based on zzso containing the zzso zzso in different structural zzso In one of these zzso zzso the zzso loop and stem are the same as in mycoplasma zzso The second zzso zzso has an zzso stem identical with the mycoplasma zzso whereas in the last zzso zzso the only difference from zzso is that the zzso in position 32 of the zzso loop has been replaced by zzso These zzso were tested for ability to read zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso system that allowed us to monitor separately the reading of each zzso We found that the zzso zzso when present in zzso zzso among the zzso zzso whereas in the zzso zzso and zzso the same zzso had lost its ability to zzso it behaved as in mycoplasma zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso 32 of the zzso loop of zzso decisively influences the reading properties of the zzso zzso
