A zzso broad host range zzso zzso was constructed by inserting the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso site of the zzso zzso Using this zzso a zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso previously cloned in the zzso zzso zzso was located by deletion to a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso gene revealed an open reading frame zzso a 580 zzso acid zzso with molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed strong zzso with the zzso family of zzso zzso This, together with its sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso suggests that the zzso belongs to this family of zzso
