The zzso zzso zzso g 4, a putative zzso is known to exhibit frequent sequence zzso However, the previously reported zzso sequences are truncated at the N zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms by which these sequence variations are zzso 

Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and zzso were performed to obtain the full sequence of the zzso g 4 zzso and zzso was also used to clone the zzso g 4 zzso zzso In addition, zzso g 4 protein zzso were analyzed by two-dimensional gel zzso 

Nine additional zzso acid zzso at the N zzso of zzso g 4 were identified, and 2 genes zzso zzso g 4, both of which consisted of 5 zzso were zzso zzso of 34 clones of zzso g 4 zzso obtained by zzso revealed 14 zzso In particular, zzso g 4 sequences showed frequent clusters of variations in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso sequences may imply that zzso sequences are edited after zzso More than 10 spots were identified between pH 5 and 7 upon two-dimensional gel zzso indicating that multiple zzso of zzso g 4 are produced at the protein zzso 

zzso zzso among individual cockroaches, the existence of multiple genes and sequence variations caused by zzso editing produce sequence diversity of zzso g 4, which may influence its zzso The sequence information obtained in this study will be helpful for the zzso of the zzso zzso and thereby aid in the development of zzso and zzso
