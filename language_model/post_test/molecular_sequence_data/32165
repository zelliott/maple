zzso bacteria contain multiple zzso pathways that facilitate the zzso of proteins across the outer zzso The zzso zzso zzso system is composed of two essential zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso beta barrel protein that is thought to transport the zzso across the outer zzso A putative zzso system was previously described in the zzso of the zzso of zzso coli zzso strain zzso We found that the two components of this system, which we designate zzso and zzso are not predicted to belong to either of the two major zzso of zzso systems zzso and zzso based on their zzso Nevertheless, we obtained direct evidence that zzso and zzso constitute a bona fide zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso into the zzso environment in zzso coli zzso requires zzso and that when zzso was produced in an zzso coli K-12 strain, its zzso was strictly dependent on the production of zzso Furthermore, using zzso as a model system, we show that protein zzso via the zzso zzso is extremely zzso
