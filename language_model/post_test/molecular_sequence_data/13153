Nuclear zzso B zzso zzso DNA binding factor is an zzso zzso factor that responds to various cellular zzso zzso of cortical zzso B DNA binding activity were measured in a controlled lateral cortical impact model of traumatic brain injury zzso in zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso we found that zzso B DNA binding activity in cerebral zzso zzso to the injury site increased at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after zzso zzso activity peaked at 3 days after injury and subsided by 10 days after zzso These data indicate that zzso produces transient increases in zzso B DNA binding zzso Further insights into the role of zzso B in zzso may provide new therapeutic opportunities for head zzso
