Three human zzso genes zzso 3 highly related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All 3 zzso proteins bind to the same zzso but with differing zzso and stimulate a number of biological responses including zzso zzso and growth zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso alpha can be isolated from culture medium zzso by zzso melanoma cells and that continuous zzso of zzso alpha contributes to the transformation of immortalized zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine whether zzso beta or zzso have similar effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso clones expressing either human zzso beta or zzso exhibited enhanced ability to form large colonies in soft zzso and tumors in nude zzso The clones expressing the zzso beta or zzso zzso formed tumors within 2 months after zzso the tumors were highly pigmented and expressed zzso zzso beta or zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso medium from zzso clones expressing zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were examined for the ability to induce zzso in the rat zzso strong zzso responses were zzso This zzso response was blocked by zzso to the respective zzso zzso but not by normal rabbit zzso By contrast, zzso responses were observed in only 2 of 12 zzso implants zzso containing medium zzso by zzso clones expressing the zzso resistance marker zzso
