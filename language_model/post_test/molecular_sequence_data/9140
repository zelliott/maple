Across zzso individuals must respond to a dynamic social environment of challenges and opportunities on multiple biological levels, including behavior, hormone profiles, and gene zzso We investigated the response to a complex social environment including both territorial challenges and zzso opportunities in the African zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso a species well-known for its zzso zzso Male zzso zzso are either socially dominant or subordinate and can transition between the two zzso We used this transition to simultaneously study changes in zzso zzso behavior, testosterone and zzso levels, zzso zzso and zzso expression of three genes involved in testosterone zzso We have found that males immediately become aggressive and increase testosterone levels when they become dominant in this paradigm of challenge and zzso zzso behavior and zzso increase slightly later but are also zzso within zzso zzso in steroid hormone levels are accompanied by an increase in expression of zzso acute regulatory protein zzso the zzso zzso during testosterone zzso as well as an increase in zzso maturation as measured by zzso zzso zzso behavior was found to correlate with female zzso suggesting that males were able to perceive zzso zzso Our study demonstrates the rapid plasticity at multiple levels of biological organization that animals can display in response to changes in their complex social zzso
