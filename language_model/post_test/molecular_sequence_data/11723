zzso is a zzso zzso giant protein zzso approximately zzso that consists predominantly of two classes of approximately 100 zzso acid zzso class I and class II, that repeat along the zzso zzso is found inside the zzso in close proximity to both zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso studies have found that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso In the present work we investigated whether this zzso interaction is functionally significant by studying the effect of zzso on zzso interaction in an in zzso zzso zzso where zzso labeled zzso filaments are sliding on top of a lawn of zzso zzso We used genetically expressed zzso fragments containing either a single class I motif zzso zzso a single class II motif zzso zzso or the two motifs linked together zzso zzso Neither zzso I nor zzso II alone affected zzso sliding on either myosin, heavy zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, the linked zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed with full-length myosin, heavy zzso and zzso zzso The degree of zzso was largest with zzso zzso intermediate with heavy zzso and smallest with zzso In zzso binding zzso and zzso analyses revealed that the zzso is most likely caused by interaction between the zzso filament and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso relevance of the novel finding of zzso zzso by zzso fragments is zzso
