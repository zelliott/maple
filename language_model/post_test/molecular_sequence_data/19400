Only limited but contrasting reports are available on zzso based population structure of zzso zzso Further, there is complete lack of information on zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso drug resistance genes to trace the origin and spread of the drug resistant zzso zzso zzso we scanned zzso zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso repeats with minimum of 8 unit array zzso Only 13 such repeats were detected in this region as compared to zzso zzso repeats present in zzso zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed here the zzso sequence of 110 Indian zzso zzso zzso for four of these zzso zzso zzso in the nearest regions at zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two in the farthest regions at zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the four zzso were found to be highly zzso in the population where number of zzso varied from 4 to 10 with the median values of zzso at these zzso The expected zzso zzso at these zzso ranged from zzso to zzso We did not find any association between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso There was a regional variation in the zzso zzso which was not associated with the reported prevalent rates of drug resistance or malaria zzso In conclusion, the level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is as high as in zzso zzso These results will be valuable in understanding the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso as well as for designing the malaria control zzso
