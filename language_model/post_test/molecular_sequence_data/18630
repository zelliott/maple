zzso zzso are commonly used to produce desired flavors in zzso zzso zzso manufacturing zzso However, the choice of zzso is critical because it determines the final profile of fatty acids released and the zzso flavor of the zzso We previously constructed a zzso library from marine zzso to explore the novel zzso which have unique properties useful in zzso zzso 

A novel zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library and was expressed highly in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso belongs to zzso zzso family IV, the molecular weight of zzso zzso was estimated at 36 zzso by zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was stable under alkaline condition and the optimal temperature was zzso It had a high specific activity zzso zzso toward zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was enhanced by zzso and was not significantly inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso This zzso also showed high zzso specificity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso It seems that zzso has safety for commercial zzso flavor production and food manufacturing zzso 

The ocean is a vast and largely unexplored resource for zzso According the outstanding zzso of zzso and it produced zzso acid and zzso acid more efficiently than other free fatty acids in zzso zzso This novel zzso may be used to impart a distinctive and desirable flavor and odor in zzso flavor zzso
