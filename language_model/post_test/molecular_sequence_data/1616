We describe a syndrome of zzso bleeding episodes, zzso heart disease and facial zzso in a newborn infant, and trace the cause to zzso on zzso 22 that involve the gene for zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso Human Genome zzso gene symbol zzso a critical component of the von zzso factor zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso in transformed zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed a C to T transition in the patient's remaining zzso zzso predicting a novel zzso to zzso substitution zzso in the zzso zzso domain of a zzso zzso We characterized the zzso zzso zzso by expression in a cell line zzso alpha zzso that zzso expresses two other components of the zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging of zzso zzso alpha IX cells demonstrated that zzso zzso beta abrogates surface assembly of the complex, consistent with zzso flow zzso studies in the zzso Based on sequence zzso to the known crystal structures of two other zzso repeat zzso the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso we propose a new structural model of zzso zzso The model zzso earlier assumptions about zzso interactions in the zzso region of zzso zzso and predicts a zzso patch the burial of which may contribute to proper zzso of the fully assembled zzso zzso zzso
