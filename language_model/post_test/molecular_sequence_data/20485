zzso zzso zzso zzso base zzso repair in DNA by removing a wide variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we tested the role of excised base on zzso zzso zzso After the reaction, zzso produced two zzso free damaged base and zzso containing zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso at a similar or slightly increased efficiency than it does zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso under similar zzso zzso binding experiments by surface zzso resonance zzso zzso suggested that both the zzso zzso have a similar equilibrium binding constant zzso towards zzso but under zzso zzso condition there is apparently no effect on zzso zzso however, the turnover of the zzso under zzso zzso condition is higher for zzso than it is for zzso zzso binding experiments by zzso zzso further showed that the zzso of zzso from its product, zzso containing DNA, is faster than the overall turnover of either zzso or zzso zzso We thereby conclude that the excised base plays a critical role in product zzso and, zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso Thus, the results provide the first evidence that the excised base rather than zzso could be zzso for zzso zzso
