zzso zzso protein 3 zzso is an zzso protein of the innate immune zzso It zzso zzso zzso resistance to infection by diverse enveloped viruses both in zzso and in zzso including influenza zzso West Nile virus, and dengue zzso zzso prevents zzso entry of these viruses by blocking complete virus envelope fusion with cell zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso is present in zzso species, this locus has not been zzso identified or functionally characterized in avian zzso Here, we show that the zzso locus exists in chickens and is zzso with the zzso locus in zzso The chicken zzso protein restricts cell infection by influenza A viruses and zzso to a similar level as its human zzso Furthermore, we show that chicken zzso is functional in chicken cells and that zzso of zzso expression in chicken zzso results in enhanced infection by influenza A zzso Chicken zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in all zzso zzso whereas zzso is only expressed in the zzso of zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite being highly divergent at the zzso acid level, zzso proteins of birds and zzso can restrict replication of viruses that are able to zzso different host species, suggesting zzso proteins may provide a crucial barrier for zzso zzso
