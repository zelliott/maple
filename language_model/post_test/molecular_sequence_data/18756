An zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from zzso heated soil at Mount zzso New zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso was shown to belong to subdivision 4 of the zzso zzso and to be most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stained zzso and were zzso and zzso The major fatty acids detected were zzso zzso zzso and zzso when standard zzso extraction protocols were zzso Analysis of the total cell zzso acid hydrolysate also detected zzso and zzso zzso which made up approximately zzso of the total membrane zzso These lipids included zzso zzso acid and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso and the primary respiratory zzso was zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso zzso with an optimum temperature of 65 zzso and at pH zzso with an optimum growth pH of zzso zzso tolerance was up to zzso zzso zzso displayed a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso grew on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sources included zzso zzso zzso zzso extract and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The distinct zzso position and the zzso characteristics separate strain zzso from all other members of the class zzso and indicate that it represents a novel species and zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
