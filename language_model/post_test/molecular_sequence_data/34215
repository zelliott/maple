Multiple zzso with consensus zzso zzso zzso on proteins are closely related to protein zzso However, there is no effective method for targeted analysis of such zzso The challenge for analysis of these classes of proteins by zzso is how to selectively enrich peptides containing consensus sequence from protein zzso Although enrichment of peptides containing one type of zzso acid zzso was successfully achieved by chemically labeling followed by zzso isolation, however, it is almost impossible to label and isolate signature peptides containing multiple zzso with consensus sequence by chemical zzso zzso we developed an zzso approach based on the specific recognition between zzso and its zzso to enrich such zzso This approach was realized by modification of a zzso in the consensus sequence via zzso that can recognize the sequence followed by the isolation of the modified zzso zzso protein zzso was used to validate this approach and zzso peptides containing consensus motif were identified with selectivity of zzso Those peptides resulted in the identification of 88 proteins with consensus sequence from serum zzso As this zzso zzso enrichment approach allows targeted analysis of a subset of proteins with consensus zzso it will have broad application in biological zzso
