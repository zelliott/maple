zzso zzso zzso I contains 14 distinct zzso including zzso a component of about 43 zzso The corresponding zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso matching the zzso sequence of two zzso fragments isolated from zzso Gene zzso leads to a lethal zzso that is rescued by a zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso gene fused to the zzso promoter, which allows the synthesis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso II in the presence of zzso A screening for zzso rescued by the presence of zzso identified a nonsense zzso zzso zzso the protein at zzso acid position zzso zzso pulse labeling showed that this zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis without significant effects on the synthesis of 5 S zzso and zzso These properties establish that zzso is an essential component of zzso zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso has a strongly zzso zzso domain, and shows no zzso to entries in current sequence data banks, including all the genetically identified components of the other two zzso zzso zzso zzso mapped next to zzso zzso the largest zzso of zzso zzso These genes are zzso transcribed and may thus share upstream regulatory elements ensuring their zzso
