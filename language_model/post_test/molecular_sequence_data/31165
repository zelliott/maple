Two zzso clones which cover a zzso region containing the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso have been zzso The location of the zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso species within the zzso was zzso The complete sequences of the genes corresponding to the zzso alpha zzso and to a small zzso zzso as well as two internal transcribed zzso were obtained by sequencing a zzso and a zzso zzso A locus containing sequences related to the zzso alpha zzso has been zzso zzso data and structural characterization of this locus strongly suggest that this region contains a zzso alpha zzso zzso
