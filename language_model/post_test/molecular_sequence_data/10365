zzso zzso zzso convert the energy generated from photosynthesis or zzso into zzso These zzso termed zzso are structurally highly zzso In zzso coli, zzso consists of a membrane portion, zzso made up of three different zzso zzso b and c) and an F1 portion zzso five different zzso in the zzso alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta zzso The minor zzso zzso delta and zzso are required for the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso is in close contact with the zzso zzso gamma and c zzso The structure of the zzso zzso provides clues to its essential role in this complex zzso 

The structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has been solved at zzso A resolution by multiple zzso zzso The structure, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso chain and 14 water zzso refined to an R value of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a novel fold with two zzso The zzso domain is a beta sandwich with two zzso zzso The zzso domain is formed from two alpha zzso arranged in an zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso from each zzso form the central zzso zzso in the zzso domain and can be described as an zzso zzso There is an extensive zzso contact region between the two zzso providing a stable zzso The individual zzso of the crystal structure closely resemble the structures determined in solution by zzso zzso 

zzso alignments of a number of zzso zzso from diverse sources suggest that the zzso domain, which is absent in some species, is not essential for zzso In the crystal the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso make a close zzso interaction across a zzso twofold zzso This region has previously been proposed as the contact surface between the zzso and gamma zzso in the complete zzso zzso In the crystal structure we observe what is apparently a stable interface between the two zzso of the zzso zzso consistent with the fact that the crystal and solution structures are quite similar despite close crystal zzso This suggests that a gross zzso change in the zzso zzso to transmit the effect of zzso zzso to the zzso domain, is unlikely, but cannot be ruled zzso
