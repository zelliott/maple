zzso zzso is commonly found in the environment and in association with various bovine body sites and is a major cause of bovine zzso Moreover, zzso zzso is known to produce a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso agents that generally inhibit closely related bacterial zzso In this respect, zzso zzso strain 42 has previously been shown to produce a novel zzso zzso named zzso zzso This paper reports that, in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso strain 42 produces a second zzso that zzso the zzso of metabolically active, susceptible target bacteria and which has therefore been named zzso Isolation of the native active zzso agent revealed that zzso is a zzso Da zzso that is zzso to sequence analysis by zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to generate a zzso zzso of zzso zzso 42 and sequencing of DNA zzso the zzso site revealed, in addition to the structural gene zzso several open reading frames likely to be involved in zzso zzso transport and producer zzso zzso and possibly in regulation of the zzso gene zzso In addition, a pair of direct repeats that may be involved in zzso acquisition were zzso indeed, zzso could be identified in 18 % of tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was used to confirm that zzso does indeed zzso the precursor of zzso that an unusually short leader sequence of only six zzso acids is zzso during processing of the mature zzso and that zzso is zzso zzso modified to form a zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a unique zzso zzso belonging to the same family of zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
