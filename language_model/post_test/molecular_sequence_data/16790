Gene zzso in mouse embryonic stem cells is an important genetic approach that allows simultaneous zzso of genes and generation of corresponding zzso zzso We designed a selection scheme with drug selection markers and zzso technology which allows screening of gene trap events that responded to a signaling zzso in a zzso zzso Nine hundred zzso gene trap clones were zzso and 258 were classified as gene traps induced by in zzso zzso zzso of the in zzso zzso gene traps were also responsive to zzso acid zzso In zzso analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso gene traps trapped zzso regulated zzso consistent with the observation that genes induced by zzso acid treatment are likely to be zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso gene zzso system described here can be used to enrich in zzso for traps in genes of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso reporter is extremely sensitive and can be used to explore zzso regions that are not zzso with zzso as a selection zzso
