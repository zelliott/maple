Five novel complementary DNA zzso clones which are zzso expressed between two closely related T zzso cell clones were isolated using zzso differential zzso zzso cells, from which the zzso were isolated, have characteristics of zzso at an intermediate stage in development and cause prominent zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso A sister cell zzso zzso derived from the same zzso has a distinct zzso and causes more aggressive, diffuse zzso Four of the five novel genes are expressed in normal zzso activated zzso cells, or zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence and predicted protein sequence are presented for one of the novel zzso zzso This novel zzso clone detects zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The predicted protein has four putative zzso zzso The expression of the transcript is zzso in zzso cell hybrids formed from zzso cells fused with three different T zzso cell lines which lack zzso zzso complementary to the novel zzso zzso This zzso regulation suggests that the expression of the gene is regulated by zzso zzso
