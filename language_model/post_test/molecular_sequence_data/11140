zzso transmission involves the regulated zzso of zzso filled with zzso Classical zzso are zzso in the zzso and so must be transported into synaptic zzso Although the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso have been identified, the proteins responsible for packaging the primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso remain zzso Studies in the zzso zzso zzso have implicated the gene zzso in the release of zzso Here we show that the sequence of zzso predicts a protein with ten zzso zzso that the gene is expressed by zzso zzso and that the protein zzso with synaptic zzso Further, a rat zzso of zzso is expressed by central zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport in zzso cells with zzso and zzso specificity similar to those previously reported for synaptic zzso from the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso for zzso shows that there are differences in the zzso dependence of zzso and these presumably account for the differences in zzso Thus zzso is the first of a new family of neurotransmitter zzso
