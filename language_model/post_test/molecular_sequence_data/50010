The zzso regulatory protein zzso is the key zzso of induced heat shock protein gene expression in response to elevated temperature and other zzso Our previous studies identified zzso zzso modification of zzso as an important regulator of the zzso activity of this zzso The underlying molecular mechanism by which stress leads to zzso of zzso was zzso zzso by previous studies indicating zzso zzso at zzso 307 of zzso a site very near the zzso site at zzso zzso we examined the role of this zzso event in regulating zzso modification of zzso Using a combination of zzso and in zzso zzso experiments, our results indicate that zzso at zzso 307 stimulates zzso of zzso Our results also reveal a role for a zzso zzso zzso sequence in the zzso region of zzso in zzso its zzso zzso Based on these data, we zzso that zzso at zzso 307 could stimulate zzso zzso by causing a zzso change that zzso the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso
