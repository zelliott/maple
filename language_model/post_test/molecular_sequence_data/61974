zzso transfer of nutrients from plant host to pathogen represents a most revealing aspect of the zzso lifestyle of plant zzso Whereas much effort has been focused on zzso and zzso zzso the identification of other significant zzso is equally important for comprehensive characterization of zzso interactions between plants and zzso zzso zzso zzso a strategy of targeted gene zzso we generated a zzso strain zzso defective in zzso zzso in a zzso plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain had severe defects in carbon zzso as it could use neither zzso nor zzso acids for sustained zzso Although the zzso zzso were able to grow on potato zzso zzso zzso they displayed zzso in growth and failure to zzso The zzso zzso of zzso could be entirely ameliorated by zzso in chemically defined minimal zzso Furthermore, zzso was the one and only zzso that could restore rhythmic growth and zzso of zzso Despite the profound defects in carbon source zzso in zzso the zzso strain exhibited normal zzso proceeded normally in its life cycle, and produced abundant zzso Analysis of plant zzso at the peripheral zone of zzso infection sites revealed a zzso reduction in zzso zzso This study provides strong evidence for a role of zzso as a significant transferred zzso from plant to zzso zzso
