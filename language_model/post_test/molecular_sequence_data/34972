zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that plays crucial roles in important cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation of specific cell zzso Previously, we showed that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso through a novel mechanism that involves the zzso zzso of multiple sites in the zzso domain of zzso by protein zzso zzso We have now examined the interaction and cooperation of zzso zzso and zzso in more zzso We show that zzso and zzso are direct physical binding partners whose interaction is zzso by sequences located in the zzso and central zzso of zzso and the zzso part of zzso In addition to zzso zzso recruited to zzso zzso also zzso zzso at sites that have previously been shown to plays key roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, a zzso zzso differentiation process indicating that the cooperation of zzso and zzso is functionally zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso a related zzso family member whose zzso sequences differ significantly from that of zzso is unable to interact and cooperate with zzso Instead, our data suggest that zzso zzso with the protein zzso zzso to induce zzso of zzso Overall, our data identify zzso as a novel regulator of zzso and zzso different protein zzso in the cooperation of zzso with zzso and zzso
