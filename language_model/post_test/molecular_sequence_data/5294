zzso potato plants were generated which express a zzso zzso corresponding to the 8 zzso protein and coat protein zzso genes of potato virus X zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso isolated from these plants indicated that both the 8 zzso protein and the zzso are translated from this zzso zzso zzso of both of these proteins in transgenic plants was demonstrated by Western zzso analysis, and suggests that translation of zzso takes place either by initiation by internal entry of zzso or by a zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso with zzso transcripts of the zzso construct in the presence or absence of a stable hairpin structure at the zzso zzso suggesting that the former model is more zzso Similar results were obtained when a DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso leader sequence was placed between two reporter genes in the transient zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso expression may take place from the zzso zzso as well as from the zzso zzso
