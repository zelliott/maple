zzso in zzso levels have been implicated in a wide range of psychiatric zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso the precursor of zzso As such it is a potential major candidate gene in psychiatric zzso The zzso zzso and zzso regions of the human zzso gene have been zzso Twelve zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso was zzso zzso to that of the zzso Compared to the zzso the regulatory region of the human zzso gene had an zzso of approximately zzso zzso of random DNA beginning at zzso zzso and extending to zzso zzso This displaced the zzso response element zzso occurring at zzso zzso in the rat to zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso at zzso in the rat was missing in the zzso However, within the DNA insert there was a zzso zzso region containing multiple zzso repeats plus additional zzso zzso This could produce several staggered regions of the sequence zzso similar to a zzso consensus sequence of zzso The zzso regions zzso and 3' to each zzso were zzso This showed a zzso zzso Val zzso zzso in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso and 6, were completely zzso and examined for zzso This identified two zzso consisting of G -- zzso and G zzso A zzso 2 zzso apart in zzso zzso The 3' end of zzso 5 showed an extensive zzso zzso repeat that was markedly zzso These zzso allow the zzso gene to be examined for a possible role in psychiatric zzso
