zzso a type II zzso zzso system from zzso zzso recognizes the sequence zzso The system has been cloned into zzso coli in multiple steps: first the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso a zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Next the zzso protein zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso a strain expressing the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso end of the gene were then zzso and used to locate zzso and the gene was isolated and cloned in a subsequent zzso The zzso sequence of the system has been determined, and several interesting features have been zzso The genes are zzso zzso with zzso preceding zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is compared to those of other known zzso A third gene zzso a protein with sequence similarity to known C elements of other zzso systems is found upstream of zzso This is the first instance of a C gene being associated with an zzso system where the R and M genes are zzso In addition, open reading frames zzso resembling genes involved with DNA mobility are found in close association with zzso These may shed light on the evolution of the zzso zzso
