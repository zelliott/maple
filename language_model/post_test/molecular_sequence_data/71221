The structure of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso solution containing zzso zzso was determined by nuclear magnetic zzso The zzso which comprises the zzso domain and six zzso of the zzso domain of zzso assumes a zzso characterized by two zzso connected by a zzso The zzso of the turn are zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are adjacent to the two zzso sites zzso and zzso The zzso is in a trans zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids zzso is well determined (the root mean square zzso for the backbone zzso calculated for a family of 18 nuclear magnetic resonance structures is zzso zzso Recently, two molecular models of the zzso domain of zzso were proposed in which a zzso zzso is composed of a left-handed coiled zzso of zzso The two models differ by the relative orientation of the zzso The model proposed zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Jones, 1996, zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the coiled zzso is stabilized by a zzso zzso is similar to the zzso zzso structure of the cartilage zzso membrane protein determined recently by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1996, Science zzso In the model proposed by Adams et zzso zzso Adams, zzso Arkin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1995, Nature zzso zzso zzso the zzso in the coiled zzso have a different relative orientation, zzso are rotated zzso by approximately 50 zzso It was possible to overlap and connect the structure of zzso derived in the present study to the two zzso zzso models zzso In this way two models of the whole zzso in its zzso form were zzso When our structure was connected to the zzso zzso model, the inner side of the zzso domain of the zzso (where the zzso face one zzso was lined by polar zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the five zzso side chains were on the outer zzso On the contrary, when our structure was connected to the other zzso model, in the inner side of the zzso domain of the zzso the five zzso zzso formed a highly charged zzso
