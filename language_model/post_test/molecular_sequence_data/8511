zzso zzso have been used in most human gene therapy trials that have been zzso Many of these therapies have focused on the introduction of genes into zzso stem cells with the goal of obtaining expression in the mature T zzso zzso It has proven difficult to achieve expression in the zzso zzso although several groups have demonstrated low expression of zzso genes in the zzso zzso In this study we used an in zzso zzso organ culture in which zzso cells can develop into T cells and all intermediate stages can be studied and manipulated to investigate the fate of a zzso introduced zzso coli zzso gene in this zzso Here we show that certain conditions can zzso zzso T cells, three different zzso T cell clones and zzso zzso zzso T zzso with high zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with the zzso gene does not inhibit T and zzso cell differentiation of zzso cells in fetal zzso organ cultures zzso The zzso gene also is functionally expressed at all stages of development, although the expression decreases somewhat during zzso This experimental system, combining zzso and zzso zzso provides a genetic tool for the study of human T cell zzso
