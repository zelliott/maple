The survival motor zzso zzso gene is the putative disease gene for human spinal muscular zzso zzso an zzso zzso disorder characterized by progressive zzso of lower motor zzso Two copies of the zzso zzso and zzso are present in the same zzso zzso region in zzso However, only the zzso gene is affected in zzso The zzso zzso zzso a novel protein of unknown zzso To gain insights into the role of zzso in zzso we have identified the zzso gene zzso in the zzso and investigated zzso expression in the zzso of zzso monkey and humans by zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso specifically recognized a single protein identical to the in zzso translation products of human and rat zzso zzso The zzso gene transcript and product were widely but zzso expressed throughout cerebral and spinal zzso zzso The zzso protein was localized mainly in the zzso of specific zzso systems, and it was particularly expressed in lower motor zzso of newborn and adult zzso Likewise, a strong zzso signal was detected in zzso IX of the spinal zzso zzso These results support the relevance of zzso for the motor zzso function and the zzso role of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso associated with zzso
