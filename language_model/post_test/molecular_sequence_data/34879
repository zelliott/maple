The zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, a member of the zzso zzso activates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced under conditions of zzso external pH and zzso zzso zzso conditions raise the expression level up to 10 zzso To characterize the binding mechanism of zzso procedures for the zzso of this zzso protein and its zzso into zzso were zzso The binding sites of zzso upstream of the zzso promoter region were determined by in zzso zzso protection zzso Two regions were protected during zzso zzso one from zzso to zzso zzso designated zzso and another one from zzso to zzso zzso designated zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso was further characterized by zzso zzso indicating that zzso was able to bind to both DNA zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso confirmed that both sites, zzso and zzso are essential for zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, these experiments revealed that binding of zzso upstream of the zzso sites is necessary for repression of zzso expression at neutral pH and under zzso zzso Based on these results, a model for zzso regulation of the zzso zzso is proposed, according to which zzso is involved in the formation of a repression complex under zzso zzso This complex is dissolved by binding of zzso to zzso under inducing zzso Upon binding of zzso to zzso zzso expression is zzso
