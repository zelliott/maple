An zzso zzso between zzso 7 and 8 of the zzso C gene zzso previously zzso with Southern analysis, was zzso for detection with zzso zzso were rapidly typed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas Southern analysis revealed two zzso the smaller fragments generated with zzso allowed the resolution of three zzso that were previously scored as a single zzso and increased the zzso of the system from zzso to zzso After a set of reference families was zzso with the zzso zzso a linkage map around the zzso gene on zzso 6 was zzso This included the zzso cluster and the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso lies 22 zzso zzso to zzso and between zzso and zzso at distances of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
