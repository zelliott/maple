Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso from within the zzso zzso steroid 16 zzso zzso zzso gene family, were zzso into zzso cells in order to study zzso activities of the expressed zzso zzso zzso was shown previously to zzso the growth hormone dependent and zzso zzso zzso in adult male mice zzso et zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso was identical with gene zzso within the zzso zzso zzso There was zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence identity, respectively, between zzso and zzso zzso We expressed both zzso by zzso their zzso into zzso cells and found that steroid 16 zzso activity was zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso In addition to testosterone, zzso and zzso were zzso specifically at the 16 zzso by the expressed zzso zzso The results indicated that a broad steroid zzso specificity with high zzso and zzso at that position was a characteristic of zzso zzso We constructed and expressed zzso between the two zzso and found that the presence of about two-thirds of the zzso zzso zzso from its zzso was necessary for the zzso zzso to maintain steroid 16 zzso zzso
