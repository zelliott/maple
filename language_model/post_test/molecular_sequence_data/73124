A zzso zzso zzso protection zzso was employed to study the binding of a delta agent zzso zzso transcript containing the zzso domain to the zzso zzso zzso dependent protein zzso of zzso cells, zzso (also known as zzso zzso or zzso zzso In a control reaction, this zzso identified a major portion of the same zzso binding site in VA zzso as deduced previously using a zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, zzso zzso Although delta agent zzso contains extensive secondary structure throughout the zzso region, we found a remarkable specificity in its zzso zzso The same region was protected by intact zzso and by a zzso acid zzso zzso containing the two zzso motifs zzso but lacking zzso zzso Two specific opposed, continuous segments of delta agent zzso zzso about zzso zzso were obtained zzso Each is more than twice as long as those protected in VA zzso (about 25 zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso in delta zzso zzso The zzso region of delta agent zzso also contains a characteristic zzso structural element that may be involved in binding zzso
