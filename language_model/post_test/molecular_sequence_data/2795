The role of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso gene in viral zzso and zzso was examined using classes of zzso deletion zzso with and without zzso zzso gene zzso zzso cells did not form the zzso zzso and nuclear structures normally observed late in infection with zzso zzso virus, and the cells failed to lyse even at 2 weeks zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso we suggest zzso may be facilitated by zzso exhaustion of the host nuclear zzso and may require a function resident in the zzso region of zzso this portion of the zzso is also essential for formation of the zzso zzso zzso Additional changes in zzso were correlated with the level of zzso fusion protein zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso which encodes 51 zzso zzso acids of zzso fused to zzso caused zzso zzso of zzso structures at sites corresponding to the zzso bodies of zzso viral zzso zzso body zzso which associate with the zzso bodies in zzso infections, were also formed in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso did not associate with zzso bodies in zzso infections, and were zzso attached to zzso bodies in cells infected with zzso having simple zzso deletions zzso by zzso Loss of the outer membrane increased sensitivity of the zzso bodies to disruption by physical zzso a partially attached membrane afforded some protection from zzso
