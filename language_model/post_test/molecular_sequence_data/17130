zzso zzso or eggshell protein zzso is an important zzso event contributing to the formation of a protective zzso or eggshell in zzso Although the survival of the developing or developed zzso in the environment before zzso relies on the protection of the zzso the identity of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso protein zzso has never been identified in any insect zzso In this report, we describe the determination of partial zzso sequences of a novel zzso zzso zzso through zzso of a zzso zzso zzso active zzso specific zzso of the zzso in the zzso through zzso analysis, zzso processing of zzso zzso through comparison of the accurate mass of its intact mature zzso with molecular mass of its deduced zzso acid zzso isolation of its zzso based on zzso zzso partial zzso acid zzso evaluation of its zzso profile in developing zzso and application of the primary zzso zzso zzso sequence in predicting potential zzso zzso in other zzso
