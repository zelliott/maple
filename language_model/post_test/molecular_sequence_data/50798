zzso computer models of the rat zzso D3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been constructed based on the zzso zzso for zzso another zzso protein containing seven zzso zzso presumed to be arranged in a similar spatial zzso Models were assembled by aligning the putative zzso zzso of the zzso receptors with those of zzso using sequence similarities, and then zzso these zzso zzso on to the zzso zzso These models explore the potential hydrogen zzso zzso and stacking interactions within the zzso which may be important for maintaining the zzso of these zzso and thereby provide target sites for zzso zzso zzso interactions between the zzso zzso and these receptors appear to account for the zzso although not the zzso of these zzso zzso for the different zzso zzso zzso Such models will be useful for establishing zzso relationships between zzso and the zzso zzso and may ultimately provide a template for the design of zzso zzso
