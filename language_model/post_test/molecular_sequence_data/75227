We have determined the DNA sequence of zzso 1 and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso b gene of the zzso laboratory strain 74A and the natural isolate North zzso In contrast to a previous report, we find that this zzso contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso bases in frame with the upstream zzso The putative zzso protein resembles those of other zzso zzso with respect to zzso calculated zzso point, and proportion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, no zzso acid sequences resembling the zzso characteristic of zzso zzso were zzso zzso with the previous finding that this zzso is capable of zzso in zzso in the absence of zzso the observations discussed here raise the possibility that other zzso with long, zzso zzso may also be capable of zzso zzso in zzso
