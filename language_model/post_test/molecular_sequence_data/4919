To regulate zzso gene expression in many cell types, members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors cooperate with basic zzso zzso zzso which show only limited intrinsic DNA binding zzso We investigated the DNA binding properties of zzso in zzso and show that the inherent zzso of the zzso site is one of the principal structural characteristics recognized by zzso zzso of the apparent zzso zzso of zzso complexes with several DNA sequences revealed that zzso bound with high affinity to DNA sequences containing a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso site which did not affect the zzso of the DNA changed the free energy of binding only zzso However, reducing the intrinsic zzso of the DNA binding site through an zzso substitution increased the zzso binding concentration of zzso by almost one order of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed markedly reduced zzso binding to DNA containing zzso On binding to zzso the maximum zzso at 275 zzso in the CD spectrum of DNA containing a zzso site was red shifted by 4 zzso and its intensity reduced significantly, while a slight blue shift of zzso zzso was observed for a zzso DNA sequence with reduced zzso zzso zzso analysis by circular zzso zzso revealed that the DNA in the zzso complex was bent by 49 degrees , while the DNA in the complex with the zzso zzso was largely zzso
