Three zzso factor zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso by zzso zzso at two separate sites in the zzso degradation domain zzso of their alpha zzso We compared in zzso zzso by zzso zzso human zzso of zzso and zzso peptides corresponding to the two sites in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 248 and 215 zzso The increase in the length of peptides representing the zzso site from 19 to 20 to 35 zzso reduced the zzso values to zzso zzso zzso to zzso of those for the shorter zzso whereas those representing the zzso site were zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso whereas those of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso identical values being found for the zzso zzso zzso and its N site zzso The zzso values for the C site zzso were about zzso times higher but only zzso of those for the zzso N site zzso and this marked difference suggested that the zzso may become bound first to the zzso site of an zzso and that this binding may enhance subsequent binding to the zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso for oxygen determined with the zzso zzso and both its zzso as zzso were all about 100 zzso being zzso of those reported for the three zzso with a zzso zzso Even this value is high compared with tissue zzso levels, indicating that zzso are effective oxygen zzso
