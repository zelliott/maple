zzso is the basis by which zzso organisms of the same species distinguish self from zzso Relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying zzso reactions in lower zzso zzso zzso is a colonial zzso a sister group of zzso that exhibits a genetically determined natural transplantation reaction, zzso zzso between colonies leads to formation of zzso with a common zzso whereas rejection occurs between incompatible zzso Using genetically defined lines, zzso sequencing, and zzso we identified a single gene that encodes zzso and determines zzso outcomes in this zzso This gene is significantly zzso in colonies poised to undergo fusion and/or zzso is highly expressed in the zzso and is functionally linked to zzso zzso These findings establish a platform for advancing the science of zzso
