zzso DNA sequence data were obtained for eight species of zzso zzso endemic zzso and one winged close relative in order to study their colonization history and modes of diversification in the zzso zzso zzso to most other insular zzso the zzso estimates we recovered for zzso do not follow the progression rule of island zzso The penalized likelihood age estimates of colonization of the zzso exceed the age of the emerged islands and underscore the potential role of now sunken zzso for the early evolution of zzso The zzso proposes one zzso origin for zzso zzso but zzso tests suggest a larger contribution of zzso zzso on older zzso zzso habitat preferences were reconstructed as ancestral while shifts to zzso zzso were reconstructed as having evolved independently on different zzso zzso and patterns of diversification rate were found to differ between older and younger zzso Our analyses reveal that the colonization sequence of islands and timing of colonization of zzso could be linked with the geological and volcanic history of the islands in a rather complex zzso Even though most islands appear to have been zzso soon after their zzso there are notable zzso from the pattern of sequential colonization expected under the progression rule when considering only the extant emerged zzso zzso of diversification rate variation on older and younger islands zzso to the volcanic activity or remnants of such activity, while the pattern of independent evolution of restricted habitat preferences in different islands suggests that habitat shifts could also have contributed to species diversity in zzso
