The zzso zzso gene is expressed abundantly in the fetal liver and zzso zzso in the adult liver, but can be zzso during liver zzso and in liver zzso Previous studies identified three zzso zzso zzso and zzso upstream of the mouse and rat zzso genes and a single zzso upstream of the human zzso We have compared the sequences upstream of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our analysis demonstrates that the previously identified human zzso is the counterpart to mouse zzso This comparison also reveals that a functional zzso counterpart to the zzso E1 is absent due to a deletion that removes the core region of this zzso Furthermore, our studies identify a novel human zzso corresponding to zzso zzso Despite the overall similarity of zzso between human and zzso we found differences in zzso factor binding sites between these zzso A zzso binding site is zzso but two other motifs in zzso zzso one that binds orphan nuclear receptors and a second that binds zzso zzso are not zzso in zzso The human counterpart to the zzso zzso site can bind zzso zzso Despite the overall sequence similarity in zzso between mice and humans, the difference in factor binding sites in zzso as well as the absence of E1 in zzso indicates that different mechanisms regulate zzso zzso in these different zzso
