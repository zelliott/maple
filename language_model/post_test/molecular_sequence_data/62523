zzso zzso a zzso zzso present in zzso zzso and blood, plays important roles in host defense and zzso Indeed, zzso has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and manifest a potent zzso activity against human zzso virus and human zzso The zzso sites on the cell surface appear to be zzso and other as yet undefined zzso Here, we isolated a zzso 105 zzso molecular mass protein from cell extracts and identified it as human zzso zzso interactions ( approximately 240 zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were further illustrated by surface zzso resonance zzso The interaction of zzso with the cell zzso zzso was then demonstrated through competitive binding studies between zzso and the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso which binds specifically zzso zzso independently of zzso Interestingly, binding competition studies between zzso and various zzso derivatives in zzso zzso cells suggested that the zzso site is located in both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso whereas the basic zzso region is zzso On intact cells, zzso zzso with surface zzso and together they become zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso by an active zzso zzso a small proportion of zzso appears to zzso in the nucleus of zzso Finally, the observations that zzso of zzso is inhibited by the zzso zzso and the lack of zzso zzso in zzso cells despite zzso zzso point out that both zzso and zzso are implicated in the mechanism of zzso zzso
