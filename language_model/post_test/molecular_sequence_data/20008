The mouse zzso gene contains 5 zzso zzso with zzso zzso a 117 zzso acid zzso that is processed to yield a 28 zzso acid mature zzso The current study examined if zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso in response to zzso and zzso in zzso as previously reported in the zzso In the process of establishing a quantitative real-time zzso system to accurately assess the changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels, we observed that primer sets located in zzso and zzso amplified a zzso transcript that contained the entire zzso 2 zzso zzso and sequence analysis of zzso products using multiple primer sets located throughout the zzso gene suggested that the zzso zzso contains zzso and zzso but lacks zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in stomach zzso while expression levels were zzso and zzso greater than that of the native zzso transcript in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels increased in the zzso after 24 h zzso and decreased in the zzso and zzso of zzso obese zzso These changes may be due to the changes in circulating insulin or zzso since both decreased zzso zzso expression in a mouse zzso cell line zzso and in primary mouse zzso cell zzso The fact that zzso zzso zzso levels are dependent on energy intake in the zzso and zzso suggests that this transcript may zzso a zzso important in zzso the neuroendocrine response to zzso zzso
