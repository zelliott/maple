The dog is an important model for studying organ zzso In order to develop a zzso typing system, a zzso analysis of the canine DR region of the zzso was zzso Southern analysis suggests the presence of two zzso genes in most dogs and all have one zzso zzso One dog out of 200 examined contains only one zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped in one zzso zzso zzso One zzso gene zzso was localized to two overlapping zzso zzso Another zzso gene zzso was localized to two overlapping zzso zzso zzso analysis of the two zzso genes suggests that one gene is intact zzso and one gene is a zzso zzso because it lacks a zzso zzso signal for zzso 3 and lacks zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 sequence data from zzso allow amplification of the zzso zzso 2 which, in turn, can serve as a basis for developing a typing system for zzso
