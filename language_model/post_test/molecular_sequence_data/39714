zzso response factor zzso is a crucial zzso factor for zzso gene zzso We investigated zzso function in adult skeletal muscles, using mice with a zzso zzso disruption of the zzso zzso zzso mice displayed severe skeletal muscle mass reductions due to a zzso muscle growth zzso resulting in highly zzso adult zzso zzso zzso also failed to zzso following zzso Muscles lacking zzso had very low levels of muscle zzso zzso and skeletal zzso zzso transcripts and displayed other zzso to the gene expression program, indicating an overall zzso of zzso zzso This loss of zzso zzso together with a decrease in zzso zzso contributed to zzso growth zzso as suggested by the extensive zzso disorganization found in zzso zzso However, we observed a zzso of zzso 4 zzso and zzso growth factor 1 zzso expression in zzso zzso which could also account for their defective growth and zzso Indeed, our demonstration of zzso binding to zzso 4 and IGF-1 promoters in zzso suggests a new crucial role for zzso in pathways involved in muscle growth and zzso
