The highly zzso Clara cells play a pivotal role in protecting the lung against inflammation and zzso zzso This study reports the zzso cloning of a novel protein required for Clara cell physiology in mouse lung zzso The zzso lethal zzso zzso zzso contained a nonsense zzso in the previously hypothetical gene zzso on zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso levels were indistinguishable from wild type, zzso zzso exhibited decreased expression of the truncated zzso suggesting protein zzso During late zzso zzso was widely expressed in the zzso of lung zzso cells, whereas zzso expression was restricted to the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso did not affect early steps in lung zzso growth, or cellular zzso Rather, zzso lungs demonstrated severe zzso enlargement of the zzso respiratory zzso at zzso Clara cell zzso was evident from decreased zzso zzso and zzso protein levels, enlargement and disorganization of the zzso complex, and formation of zzso zzso zzso Additional support for a role in the zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel protein required for organization and/or function of the zzso apparatus in Clara cells in mouse zzso
