We have zzso zzso and disrupted the gene zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is close in size and exhibits a high degree of secondary structure zzso to human zzso zzso There exist two regions of extended primary sequence identity between zzso zzso and human zzso zzso the first comprises zzso involved in hydrogen bonding to zzso zzso zzso and the second is a zzso region which, in the human zzso forms part of the A protein binding zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks two zzso just following the zzso cap structure which are present in all other zzso zzso examined to date, and the region which zzso to the binding site for the human zzso protein zzso weight of zzso is more divergent than in other zzso A putative upstream zzso signal is zzso in sequence and location among all zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with the exception of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso designated zzso reveals that this zzso is indispensable for zzso
