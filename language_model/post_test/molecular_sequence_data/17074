Using a zzso reverse zzso system, we have identified the zzso sequences required of an engineered zzso zzso for efficient incorporation into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso an zzso functionally active zzso zzso gene retaining the first 198 zzso terminal zzso and the last zzso 3' terminal zzso of the zzso zzso segment, we have determined the zzso sequence required by a zzso to be zzso zzso to zzso and zzso incorporated into an infectious zzso The zzso sequence retains 96 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and a predicted zzso zzso Within these 96 zzso we have identified three zzso zzso at positions zzso that are essential for the incorporation of in zzso zzso into new zzso progeny viral zzso This study establishes a firm foundation for additional investigation into the assortment and zzso mechanism of all 10 zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso
