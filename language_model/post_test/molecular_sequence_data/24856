The analysis of the incorporation of zzso precursors into zzso indicates that the zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso of various zzso groups, which is similar to the zzso of other zzso zzso zzso zzso use the appropriate zzso zzso as a primer and add zzso units from zzso and zzso units from zzso to assemble the zzso zzso zzso are formed by addition to the starter unit zzso or zzso of 12 zzso zzso in the order zzso zzso zzso A, zzso Within the zzso gene cluster for a zzso zzso the central zzso segment was found to be required for zzso zzso by zzso analysis of strains containing deletion or zzso zzso in this zzso A complete sequence analysis of the zzso segment indicated that this segment encodes zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes are organized into two zzso blocks of zzso From the results of sequencing analysis, a feature of the two regions, zzso and zzso is that they zzso four kinds of large zzso zzso containing 55 zzso which possess putative fatty acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to contain two, three, or four zzso zzso and 2 contain two and four zzso respectively, whereas zzso 3 and zzso 4 each contains three zzso The 12 zzso zzso to the 12 cycles required for synthesis of the zzso zzso
