zzso zzso is both a human respiratory pathogen and zzso zzso while zzso zzso the closest zzso relative of zzso zzso is arguably a strict zzso zzso A zzso zzso has historically differentiated zzso zzso from zzso zzso but the recent recognition of significant zzso zzso zzso colonization has decreased this zzso zzso Given this and the potential of zzso between the species, we examined the distribution of zzso and molecular traits between collections of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains separated within a zzso obtained by zzso sequence analysis zzso All strains zzso with a probe to zzso a gene zzso an zzso A zzso of zzso zzso clustered apart from strains that did not zzso with the zzso Other traits also zzso significantly along this division, suggesting a separation of the zzso Of note, the LOS genes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were approximately 2, 6, and 54 times, respectively, more prevalent in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso In contrast to species zzso zzso zzso was evidenced by the inability of single gene sequences to zzso separate the species and by the zzso distribution of some zzso traits across the species dividing zzso Together, these data support the historically accurate and pragmatic division of these species while recognizing their potential for zzso Future comparative zzso studies identifying common and distinctive genes could be useful in evaluating their role in the zzso or virulent growth, respectively, of zzso zzso
