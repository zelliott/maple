The zzso community composition of activated sludge from a zzso wastewater treatment plant zzso zzso was investigated by using the zzso approach, combining different molecular techniques such as zzso zzso gel zzso zzso clone libraries and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Most of the sequences retrieved in the zzso and the clone libraries were similar to zzso members of different zzso The most abundant sequence recovered from zzso in the clone library corresponded to a zzso from the zzso cluster zzso zzso of the zzso and the library included members from other groups such as the Alpha, zzso and Delta zzso of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso clone library, we basically found sequences related to different orders of zzso zzso in correspondence with the recovered zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso stained cells from two different activated sludge samples after a mechanical zzso disruption revealed a mean cell count of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Around zzso of zzso counts zzso value from both zzso zzso with a zzso specific zzso zzso were the dominant bacterial group zzso of zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso contributed to lower proportions (between zzso of zzso zzso zzso accounted only for zzso of zzso zzso In addition, specific zzso for amplification of the zzso zzso zzso gene were used to detect the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielding positive zzso only for zzso This, together with negative in zzso zzso with zzso for well-known zzso bacteria, suggests that zzso is performed by still zzso zzso In zzso the combination of the three approaches provided different and complementary pictures of the real zzso composition and allowed to get closer to the main zzso involved in key processes of zzso activated zzso
