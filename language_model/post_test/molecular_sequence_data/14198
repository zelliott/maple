An zzso zzso that specifically zzso the zzso backbone of zzso zzso was isolated from culture zzso of a soil zzso zzso Internal zzso sequence information was used to clone and zzso express the gene in zzso zzso The molecular mass of the isolated zzso was zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso mass predicted from the zzso acid zzso The zzso pH and temperature zzso for the zzso were zzso zzso and 48 zzso zzso The native and zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso or zzso from the upstream zzso end, typical of an zzso zzso A second zzso zzso gene zzso was also cloned and zzso zzso was similar in size zzso zzso and zzso activity to zzso but differed in its pH optimum zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are predicted to belong to the zzso zzso zzso family zzso 43 based on activity, sequence zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the native zzso for zzso gum zzso zzso were 19 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of these zzso is well suited for the study of type II zzso structures and provides an important tool for the investigation of the biological role of zzso in zzso zzso gum zzso zzso was used as a model to investigate the use of these zzso in defining type II zzso zzso Exhaustive zzso of zzso resulted in a limited number of zzso products with a zzso of zzso zzso
