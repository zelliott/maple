A zzso of 15 zzso acids derived from the cereal zzso cell wall protein zzso sharing a significant zzso with zzso virus nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso T cells from juvenile zzso and adult zzso zzso arthritis zzso An zzso of the V alpha 2 gene family was found in the zzso from patients who responded significantly to the zzso To investigate in more detail the zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso we established zzso zzso lines and clones from a zzso positive zzso patient with zzso zzso The zzso clones were zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso was investigated by zzso chain reaction zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso sequences from different clones demonstrated that the clones were identical and used the V alpha zzso alpha 6 combined with V beta zzso beta zzso gene zzso Interestingly, direct sequencing of the V alpha 2 family zzso product obtained from zzso prepared from freshly isolated zzso zzso cells identified the same zzso sequence as that used by the zzso suggesting the zzso of zzso zzso T cells bearing V alpha zzso alpha 6 gene zzso The present data suggest a recruitment and expansion of a zzso zzso zzso and also support the hypothesis that zzso diseases can be triggered by protein zzso with crucial zzso acids zzso to zzso
