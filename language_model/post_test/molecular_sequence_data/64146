In an effort to understand the mechanism of radical formation on zzso zzso the formation of zzso on zzso was initiated by reaction with hydrogen zzso in the presence of the spin trap zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso were then subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso was reacted with hydrogen zzso zzso in the presence of zzso a zzso zzso zzso could be detected by zzso zzso To verify that zzso zzso of the protein free zzso had been formed, the reaction zzso were analyzed by flow injection zzso zzso mass zzso zzso The zzso mass spectrum of the zzso sample shows one zzso each on both the alpha chain and the beta chain of zzso which zzso in mass to the addition of one zzso zzso The nature of the zzso formed on zzso was explored using zzso techniques followed by liquid zzso zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso zzso The following sites of zzso addition were identified on zzso zzso of the beta chain, and zzso zzso and zzso of the alpha zzso Because of the zzso interaction of zzso and zzso the zzso electron is apparently zzso on both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso stacked pair zzso
