The zzso of zzso sake zzso zzso is zzso by two genes located on its zzso These genes designated zzso and zzso were cloned in zzso coli zzso zzso on an zzso zzso zzso zzso inserted in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the originally cloned zzso revealed that both genes are required for the formation of a functional zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed as a single transcript of approximately zzso zzso starting 34 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The proteins derived from zzso and zzso share only zzso zzso with other zzso The genes zzso the zzso are scattered with multiple direct and zzso repeats of 9-12 zzso However, comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed equal distribution of zzso zzso acid zzso and suggests that the genes have a common zzso zzso deletions or insertions resulting from the presence of the repeats were not zzso The zzso sake zzso was zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Its two genes can be used to replace zzso reporter genes to develop zzso zzso and zzso systems for zzso in meat zzso
