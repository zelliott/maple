In an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso zzso infected at high temperatures with zzso T4 zzso late T4 zzso and consequently progeny production are dramatically zzso This zzso is due, in part, to insufficient activity of zzso 70 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 170 (1988) zzso which is necessary to initiate early T4 zzso zzso however, we found that, in this zzso host, late T4 zzso is also impaired when the temperature is raised from 30 to 42 degrees C late after infection, when T4 zzso is directed by the zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso Here, we show that a T4 gene that we call zzso zzso zzso located at 14 zzso on the T4 map, is responsible for the zzso of late T4 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso T4 deletion zzso that lack the zzso gene can produce progeny in the zzso host, but the zzso zzso provided in trans from a zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso We have cloned and zzso this T4 gene and zzso the zzso protein in a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso The Mr of the zzso protein deduced from the zzso sequence is zzso Gene zzso is zzso with several other, yet unidentified zzso both from an early promoter downstream from the late zzso gene zzso the small outer zzso zzso and from the late zzso promoter further zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
