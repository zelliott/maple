zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso domain of Alzheimer's zzso zzso protein precursor zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with a truncated form of zzso protein zzso The fusion protein was zzso from the cell culture medium using an zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain was separated from the protein A portion by zzso with human zzso at the engineered recognition zzso followed by zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain strongly inhibited zzso the zzso constant zzso for bovine zzso was zzso zzso zzso M, comparable to those of the zzso forms of zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso protein contained three zzso zzso bonds, which were determined to be located between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, zzso These positions are highly zzso to those of zzso bonds in bovine pancreatic zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso protein was abolished by zzso with zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso By this mild reduction, all the zzso bonds were completely zzso These results clearly indicate that the zzso bonds play an important role in the function of the zzso domain of zzso
