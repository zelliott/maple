zzso switching of zzso mating type zzso genes is a highly efficient gene conversion process initiated by a zzso zzso The use of a zzso HO zzso gene has made it possible to analyze the zzso progression of molecular zzso during zzso When zzso switches to zzso zzso a 3' zzso end of zzso zzso DNA invades the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso copying of new DNA zzso These early steps of zzso can be detected by zzso zzso When zzso is initiated in a strain carrying the zzso zzso base pair substitution zzso located 8 zzso to the right of the HO zzso zzso site, the zzso zzso is frequently included in zzso DNA formed between zzso and zzso and zzso mismatch zzso We have followed the zzso of mismatch repair of the zzso zzso by determining the DNA sequence of the zzso early zzso of zzso zzso correction of zzso DNA is quite rapid zzso zzso 6-10 zzso compared to the 60 zzso required to complete repair of the zzso zzso zzso repair occurs soon after the zzso zzso strand invades zzso and forms zzso zzso Moreover, nearly all the correction events are restorations, in which the invading zzso strand is corrected to the zzso of the resident zzso zzso This rapid restoration ensures that the net result will be a gene conversion at the zzso zzso Rapid and preferential mismatch repair of zzso DNA has important implications in understanding zzso zzso
