In the earliest stages of its development the chick zzso is a flattened disc at the surface of the zzso It gradually increases in diameter, partially because the cells are rapidly proliferating, but also because the cells at the periphery (the margin of zzso are zzso in a zzso zzso These cells zzso the inner surface of the zzso membrane as their zzso In the normal zzso these cells at the edge of the spreading zzso are the only cells which are attached to the zzso zzso This investigation is concerned with the possible role played by zzso in the interaction between these zzso cells and the zzso zzso Chick zzso zzso by the New zzso technique have been treated with synthetic peptides that mimic the adhesive recognition signal of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso cell zzso zzso caused the edge cells of the zzso to zzso within minutes, and the expansion of the zzso was inhibited for about 4 zzso After this period there was gradual recovery and the cells zzso and spreading zzso zzso of the margin of the zzso by scanning electron zzso showed that cell processes were lost soon after treatment with zzso but zzso with zzso and the resumption of zzso the cell processes zzso The zzso zzso (with the zzso acids G and D zzso produced a brief zzso of zzso but after an hour these zzso spread at the same rate as zzso zzso zzso with zzso demonstrated that zzso was not only present at the interface of the edge cells and the zzso zzso but also between the zzso and the zzso These results indicate that tissue movement during zzso spreading is dependent upon zzso and that the specific zzso zzso acid zzso and presumably the zzso family of zzso is involved in this embryonic zzso zzso
