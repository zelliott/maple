zzso zzso is a zzso of uncertain zzso which mediates growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso and DNA was zzso by zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso using universal zzso zzso and six clones zzso from each of three separate zzso were zzso All clones yielded an essentially identical sequence of zzso zzso In zzso zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso zzso designed using the derived zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the sequence was indeed from zzso zzso cells and not from other components of zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was aligned with zzso from a range of other zzso and zzso analyses were carried out using several zzso zzso zzso zzso consistently and zzso grouped within a novel zzso that contains zzso from an apparently zzso group of zzso zzso assigned to the class zzso zzso zzso is evidently misplaced in the zzso zzso and the authors propose its inclusion in a new zzso zzso
