zzso from zzso zzso zzso belongs to family 12 of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso model structure showed that the zzso acid zzso zzso may directly affect the zzso of zzso activity since it is located at the distance of hydrogen bond formation from zzso that plays the role of a general acid in zzso The gene zzso the zzso was cloned into zzso zzso After the deletion of two zzso a zzso construction was obtained allowing the zzso expression in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso Both the wild type and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli with a yield of up to 1 zzso and then isolated in a highly zzso zzso The zzso specific activity against soluble zzso was not changed after a single zzso acid zzso However, the zzso of activity of the zzso zzso was shifted from pH zzso to zzso compared to the wild type zzso The shift in the zzso zzso to more neutral pH was also observed on zzso zzso in the process of zzso zzso of denim zzso Similar situation featuring the effect of the zzso zzso located near the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso activity zzso has previously been described for zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso belonging to the zzso and zzso families function by a rather similar mechanism of zzso
