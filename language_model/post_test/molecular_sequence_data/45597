We found an infectious zzso and zzso necrosis virus zzso sequence within the shrimp zzso in populations of zzso zzso from Africa and zzso zzso is a zzso DNA virus that has caused severe mortality and stunted growth in zzso zzso Recently, zzso sequences were found in samples of zzso zzso from Madagascar and zzso These sequences vary considerably zzso and zzso zzso from that of zzso found in association with viral zzso Laboratory zzso were carried out with zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine if either of these zzso sequences is zzso We used juvenile and adult zzso zzso containing the zzso sequences from four geographic regions to generate zzso and zzso for zzso zzso pathogen free zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as indicator zzso During the 2-4 week zzso none of the indicator shrimp showed signs of infection or zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso examination of the indicator shrimp were negative for zzso infection, indicating that the Africa type zzso sequences are not zzso With the shrimp containing the Madagascar type zzso sequence zzso as type zzso we performed zzso walking at the 3' end of the zzso sequence and found that this zzso sequence is part of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequence was cloned and zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso sequence contains shrimp zzso zzso Also, its translated zzso acid sequence was highly similar to a zzso This result provides molecular evidence that the type A zzso sequence is shrimp zzso This sequence was found in the zzso zzso collected from Africa and zzso
