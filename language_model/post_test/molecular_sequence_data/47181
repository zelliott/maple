The zzso gene zzso was identified from the zzso zzso zzso single zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso An zzso zzso containing the truncated zzso gene was detected by zzso with an zzso expression zzso zzso the remaining portion of the gene was amplified by reverse zzso An open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of 246 zzso acids zzso with Mr zzso Da was zzso The zzso region contained the putative late zzso zzso initiation zzso The 3' end, downstream of the translation stop zzso lacked an obvious putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso are greater than zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso is a member of the group II nuclear zzso zzso
