zzso zzso the insect equivalent of zzso links the nervous system and immune system in zzso This study examines the underlying molecular mechanisms zzso second zzso systems) zzso zzso effects on insect immune zzso At low zzso zzso zzso zzso spreading and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas at high zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso spreading and zzso Similarly, zzso concentration had differential effects on two zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso Low zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso but only high zzso of zzso zzso zzso led to an increase in both zzso and zzso We identified an zzso zzso zzso in this species zzso and confirmed that it is expressed in zzso After zzso expression in zzso cells, the zzso zzso produced the same zzso zzso responses on zzso zzso and zzso as had been observed in zzso These findings support earlier work showing that zzso has both zzso and zzso effects on immune responses, depending on the zzso zzso Our evidence suggests that these zzso effects are zzso by an zzso zzso signaling through zzso zzso and zzso second zzso zzso Stress zzso have complex effects on immune function in animals across zzso This complexity may be zzso in part, by zzso connections between zzso zzso protein receptors and second zzso zzso
