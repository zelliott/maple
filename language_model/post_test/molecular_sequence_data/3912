We introduced a targeted single base deletion at zzso 307 of the zzso gene in mice, similar zzso being known to cause zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicate that the zzso in mice zzso for the zzso 307 zzso appears more rapid than that in the naturally occurring zzso zzso the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso displays a dominant negative zzso in combination with that due to zzso zzso is the most prevalent cause of registered visual handicap in those of working age in developed countries, the 50 or so zzso so far identified within the zzso gene accounting for up to zzso of dominant cases of the zzso Given the sequence zzso that exist between the zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso this disease model, the first to be generated for zzso zzso using gene targeting techniques, should in principle be of value in the zzso in mice of zzso capable of targeting transcripts derived from the human zzso
