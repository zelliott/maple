An efficient zzso coli expression system was constructed for the production of a zzso form of zzso protein having the additional five zzso acid zzso zzso at the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso to 6 zzso His tag and inserted into an zzso bacterial expression zzso zzso zzso After expression in zzso coli, the zzso product was zzso by zzso affinity column zzso The zzso product showed expected zzso sequence and specific binding to the zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso and its zzso on the binding activity of zzso zzso was examined and found that only zzso zzso effectively inhibited the DNA zzso The concentration of zzso zzso that inhibited 50% of DNA binding was around 100 zzso Furthermore, we identified zzso of zzso zzso as the essential zzso of DNA zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso the binding to zzso
