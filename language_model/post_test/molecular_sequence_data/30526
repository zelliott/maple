The primary structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso were reported in the preceding paper zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both of them have eight zzso in a zzso composed of 55 zzso acid zzso with a sequence showing no extensive zzso to other known zzso zzso To locate the four zzso bridges in the zzso native inhibitor I was zzso with zzso to yield zzso zzso The peptides were separated from each other by zzso zzso A core zzso still containing six closely located zzso zzso zzso and zzso was further zzso with zzso zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso bond was split by applying manual zzso degradation to the core zzso zzso acid composition analyses of the resulting zzso peptides allowed us to define the whole zzso bridge structure in the parent zzso The zzso relation between the zzso zzso and the zzso site suggested that the zzso zzso inhibitor may be classified as a member of the zzso inhibitor zzso
