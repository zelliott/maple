A highly significant cholesterol quantitative trait locus zzso zzso was identified on zzso 1 in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was located over the gene for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was associated with increased plasma zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso has zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso are known on the basis of zzso acid zzso at four zzso Analysis with partial zzso zzso strains possessing zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is unique in the ability to increase cholesterol among the three zzso zzso and that the zzso substitution at zzso 61 may be crucial as far as cholesterol metabolism is zzso We also investigated the question of whether the zzso gene is responsible for the cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso that had been identified previously on zzso 9 in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso three different zzso zzso with two successive zzso acid zzso were revealed among the zzso However, we could not correlate zzso zzso with the occurrence of zzso in these three sets of zzso zzso
