zzso activity is thought to play a regulatory role during early kernel development by converting zzso originating from source leaves into zzso to support cell division in the zzso and zzso zzso are regulated at the zzso level by small protein zzso zzso We found that in zzso zzso zzso an zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is expressed early in kernel development, between 4 and 7 d after zzso zzso activity is reduced in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso is attenuated by zzso with zzso The presence of a putative signal zzso zzso experiments, and zzso fluorescent protein fusion experiments indicate that the protein is exported to the zzso Moreover, association of zzso with the zzso fraction by zzso A zzso suggests that zzso interacts with an zzso zzso during early kernel zzso zzso was localized to the zzso surrounding region by in zzso analysis, suggesting that this region forms a boundary, zzso zzso zzso activity to allow different zzso and zzso zzso zzso
