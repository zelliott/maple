A zzso for mature human zzso zzso was directly joined to a sequence zzso the signal zzso of the middle wall protein zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso This hybrid gene was placed downstream from the multiple promoter region of the zzso gene on a low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 carrying the zzso produced zzso zzso of active human zzso in the zzso A zzso zzso 47 zzso obtained on zzso with zzso produced an increased amount of the zzso (6 zzso When the fused gene was inserted into a high zzso expression zzso zzso and then introduced into the zzso a large amount zzso zzso of the zzso was produced in the zzso The zzso showed approximately the same specific activity and molecular weight as those of the natural zzso The zzso showed higher sensitivity to various antibiotics than the original strain, and altered cell wall and zzso membrane protein zzso The results of zzso analysis suggested that a single zzso is responsible for the above zzso and zzso of human zzso
