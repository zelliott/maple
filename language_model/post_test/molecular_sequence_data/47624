zzso a member of the Ras zzso of zzso zzso zzso a cascade that begins with the zzso of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso We have previously determined the structure of zzso and found that the regions involved in zzso zzso I) and regulator zzso zzso actions are partially zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso 36, zzso Recently, we used a zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso to define the binding surface on zzso which includes the zzso strand and a portion of zzso I zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso Here we describe the backbone dynamics of three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at three magnetic field zzso zzso values of the generalized order parameters zzso and zzso local correlation time zzso and exchange rate zzso were obtained using the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso I were found to exhibit zzso zzso motions on a zzso time scale, whereas those in zzso II experience zzso motion on the zzso time scale and chemical zzso exchange on a zzso time zzso The zzso region of zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso the time scale of motion in the zzso is reduced in zzso and zzso Overall, significant flexibility was observed mainly in the regions of zzso that are involved in zzso interactions zzso I, zzso II, and zzso and flexibility was reduced upon interaction with a protein zzso These results suggest that protein flexibility is important for zzso binding zzso
