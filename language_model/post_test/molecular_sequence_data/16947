zzso zzso zzso form a zzso zzso intermediate with zzso which is subsequently transferred to a zzso protein targeted for zzso While all zzso proteins comprise a zzso domain where the zzso zzso is formed, several zzso zzso zzso have zzso extensions proposed to control zzso recognition, zzso or zzso chain zzso Here we present the novel solution structure of the class II zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The structure shows the zzso zzso domain adopts an zzso fold typical of other zzso zzso This domain is physically separated from its zzso domain by a zzso flexible zzso The zzso domain adopts a zzso bundle that we have identified as an zzso domain zzso zzso chemical shift zzso experiments show this zzso domain interacts in a zzso manner with zzso This zzso structure of zzso was used to identify other zzso class II zzso zzso including human zzso that likely have a similar architecture and to determine the role of the zzso domain in zzso zzso chain zzso
