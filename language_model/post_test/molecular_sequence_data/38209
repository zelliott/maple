A novel zzso zzso to zzso a zzso short tandem repeat on the human Y zzso was identified and characterized in the present zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid and deletion panels in a zzso approach, we found out that the new zzso is located in zzso while its Y counterpart mapped to zzso This zzso locus zzso called zzso and its Y zzso constitute one more example of similarity outside the zzso regions between the two human sex zzso zzso data showed high levels of zzso in the zzso regions of zzso and zzso that differ primarily by the presence of a zzso motif in the Y zzso Both zzso were detected in zzso DNA, suggesting that a putative zzso from the X to the Y occurred before the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were investigated, respectively, in zzso Y and 337 X zzso from distinct human populations zzso zzso consistently displayed greater zzso component of the zzso of the zzso zzso than zzso as expected due to the zzso lower effective population size of Y zzso relative to the zzso The zzso diversity of zzso measured by zzso locus diversity as well as by zzso size zzso was lowest in zzso while very low diversity of zzso was seen in zzso Since our African data are based on a small sample, further studies will be necessary to evaluate better this zzso
