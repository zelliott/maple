To characterize the zzso bacterial isolate zzso from in zzso grapes zzso zzso 

Two bacterial strains that survived in covert form in grape cultures were isolated from the spent alcohol used for zzso the tools of which one zzso was characterized zzso The present study describes characterization of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colonies of zzso displayed consistently zzso zzso rods zzso zzso substantiated by zzso zzso thread zzso Older cultures zzso zzso showed emergence of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso The growth and zzso were modified by growth medium and incubation temperature with the optimum around 37 degrees zzso Identification attempts involving zzso zzso zzso or fatty acid profiling approaches brought in mixed and zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso was not successful with the standard zzso zzso and zzso but with zzso and a modified primer zzso The identity of the isolate was established as zzso zzso based on partial zzso zzso sequence data from eight single colonies with zzso zzso zzso as the closest match zzso zzso tests on zzso employing spore suspension in zzso ethanol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso in alcohol for 1 month, and that at 2 or 4 months revealed zzso ethanol as more zzso than lower levels, zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso showed substantial general colonization of zzso roots and medium but low zzso zzso 

The rare type of zzso consistently zzso bacterial isolate zzso was identified as zzso zzso based on zzso zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and survived in covert form in grape zzso zzso zzso ethanol appeared more zzso than lower zzso 

zzso of an unusual zzso zzso zzso observation that some bacteria may fall outside the zzso of standard zzso zzso zzso zzso of the threats of covert bacteria in plant tissue cultures and zzso lateral transmission of spore zzso and the revelation that zzso ethanol may not be the most effective zzso concentration for all zzso
