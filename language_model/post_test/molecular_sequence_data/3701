zzso of group A zzso zzso to zzso is zzso by an interaction between human zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell surface M zzso zzso belongs to a family of proteins that contain structurally related short consensus repeat zzso zzso and regulate the zzso of the complement components zzso and/or zzso zzso possesses four zzso zzso and the aim of this study was to characterize their interaction with M zzso Following confirmation of the zzso zzso interaction between zzso and human zzso we demonstrated that zzso protein binds soluble zzso zzso protein and to a zzso construct containing only zzso 3 and zzso zzso protein did not bind to soluble zzso zzso zzso proteins that had the third and/or fourth zzso zzso replaced with the corresponding zzso from another complement regulator, zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular modeling of zzso zzso 3 and 4 revealed a cluster of positively charged zzso between the interface of these zzso zzso similar to the verified M protein binding sites on the plasma complement regulators factor H and zzso zzso The presence of excess zzso protein did not inhibit the zzso activity of zzso and the presence of excess zzso did not inhibit the ability of zzso to bind zzso protein by zzso In conclusion, 1) adherence of zzso zzso to zzso is M protein dependent and 2) a major M protein binding site is located within zzso 3 and 4, probably at the interface of these two zzso at a site distinct from the zzso and zzso site of zzso
