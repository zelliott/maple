zzso is a scaffold protein that contains an zzso zzso domain zzso that zzso zzso filaments and interacts with the small zzso zzso zzso also binds to the small zzso zzso and to zzso and zzso proteins to regulate the zzso zzso We have zzso a novel zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has widespread tissue distribution, is a zzso for the insulin zzso and binds zzso Unlike zzso zzso does not interact with zzso zzso of zzso zzso clusters of short zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso This difference may be attributable to a short zzso zzso extension present on zzso which resembles a zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extension to zzso causes an apparent zzso of zzso induced by the zzso in zzso and in cultured cells, suggesting that the zzso extension of zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso Lastly, we could not detect zzso zzso zzso by the zzso extension of zzso as would be expected with a conventional zzso zzso but it did interact with zzso zzso
