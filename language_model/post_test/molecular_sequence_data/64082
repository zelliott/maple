The zzso zzso complex is a zzso protein complex containing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Current models predict that this complex functions primarily in zzso zzso Surprisingly, every zzso of this complex presents zzso at the protein and gene zzso This raises the intriguing possibility of functional specialization resulting from incorporation of unique gene products into the zzso The zzso zzso proteins represent one class of alternative zzso of the human zzso zzso The members of this family in human cells are zzso expressed depending on cell type and on zzso zzso We zzso evidence supporting the view that the alternative zzso of the complex that have arisen during zzso evolution zzso unique functional zzso
