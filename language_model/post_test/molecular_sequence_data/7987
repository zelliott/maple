zzso zzso DNA sequences were determined for 17 strains belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and these sequences were analyzed by zzso zzso The resulting data confirmed the existence of the zzso zzso and zzso but suggested that the zzso zzso should be split into two zzso We propose that a new zzso the zzso zzso should be created to accommodate 11 species that were previously zzso species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (with two subspecies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and one species that previously was placed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso should be the type species of the zzso zzso At this time the zzso zzso zzso is restricted to a single species, zzso zzso
