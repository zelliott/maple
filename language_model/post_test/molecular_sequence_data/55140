In the zzso of zzso bee zzso zzso we identified a novel unique zzso zzso named zzso consisting of 27 zzso acid zzso and two zzso zzso After identifying its primary structure, we zzso zzso by zzso zzso synthesis using two different approaches for zzso zzso The zzso folding of fully zzso linear zzso resulted in a mixture of three products differing in the pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso bond formation significantly improved the yield of desired zzso The synthetic zzso possessed zzso activity against both zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso activity against zzso zzso and no zzso activity against human zzso We zzso two zzso zzso zzso through one native zzso bridge in different positions and having the remaining two zzso zzso by zzso The analog zzso through a zzso zzso bridge showed reduced zzso activity compared to the native zzso while the second one zzso was almost zzso Linear zzso having all four zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso was also zzso That was in contrast to the linear zzso with all four zzso zzso zzso which exhibited remarkable zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by several zzso acid zzso either from the zzso or zzso resulted in significant loss of zzso zzso Study of zzso zzso cells treated by zzso using transmission electron zzso showed leakage of bacterial content mainly from the holes localized at the ends of the bacterial zzso
