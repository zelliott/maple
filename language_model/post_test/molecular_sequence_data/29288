zzso G and zzso are bacterial zzso proteins expressed at the surface of group C and G zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso are found in both zzso The third zzso module of protein G from the group G zzso strain zzso zzso and the second zzso module of protein zzso from zzso strain zzso zzso exhibit 59% sequence identity and both fold to form zzso bundle structures that are very stable against zzso zzso zzso binds human serum zzso with higher affinity than zzso but zzso shows substantially broader zzso specificity than zzso The zzso nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation zzso reported here, show that the two zzso zzso exhibit mobility on the zzso time scale in directly corresponding regions zzso and zzso Most zzso in zzso were seen to be involved in zzso exchange processes on the zzso time scale, whereas for zzso such motions were only identified for the beginning of zzso 2 and its preceding zzso Furthermore, and more importantly, zzso exchange and zzso transfer experiments reveal large differences between the two zzso zzso with respect to motions on the zzso time zzso The high degree of similarity between the two zzso zzso with respect to zzso structure and stability, and the observed differences in zzso binding affinity and binding specificity to different zzso suggest a distinct correlation between zzso binding affinity and binding zzso Finally, it is noteworthy in this context that the module zzso which has broad zzso zzso is expressed by group C and G zzso known to zzso all zzso species, whereas zzso with the zzso module has been isolated only from zzso
