zzso factor zzso is involved in expression regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in the immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to be expressed in zzso zzso Four new mouse zzso were zzso Of these, two were zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso and contained zzso zzso The zzso alpha was shown to contain an additional fragment, which zzso to an zzso located in the zzso of mouse zzso No zzso was found in human zzso The zzso alpha zzso proved to lack an zzso coding for a zzso of the zzso zzso This deletion results in a loss of the first zzso of the domain, and the zzso protein is devoid of affinity for zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to contain untranslated regions between zzso zzso and zzso The regions zzso to zzso zzso and zzso located between zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso Human zzso was not found to contain zzso zzso On evidence of these and published data, it was assumed that a set of zzso zzso is present in the cell, reflecting the complexity of expression regulation of zzso and the zzso of its zzso
