The zzso sequence of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso was determined from zzso clones derived from zzso zzso extracted from infected zzso A single open reading frame in the sequence was found to zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence contains ten potential sites for zzso zzso and one major zzso region located 35 zzso acids from the zzso zzso which appears to be the zzso domain of zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence with the zzso zzso of other zzso indicated that the zzso zzso protein is most closely related to the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso
