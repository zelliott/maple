In this study, we investigated a potential requirement of zzso signal zzso systems for acid resistance in zzso zzso In comparison to a zzso strain, zzso strains with zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso were impaired in their ability to grow at pH zzso The growth of zzso zzso strains was similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA array analyses and zzso reporter zzso indicated that zzso gene zzso was altered in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains compared to the parental zzso zzso These results indicate that intact zzso and zzso zzso zzso are required for acid resistance in zzso zzso
