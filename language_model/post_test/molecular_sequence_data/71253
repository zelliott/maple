The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso arrests the cell cycle in zzso phase, through an activity that can be overridden by direct interaction with the zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame that shares a high degree of identity with the zzso coding zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in normal human zzso with highest levels in zzso and zzso within the zzso By use of zzso in zzso zzso with a human zzso zzso probe, we assigned zzso to zzso 7, band zzso This zzso region is frequently deleted as part of the zzso and zzso 7 abnormalities of human acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso syndrome zzso We analyzed zzso copy number by zzso in zzso zzso in zzso blasts from nine patients with abnormalities of the long arm of zzso 7, and in each case one zzso of the zzso gene was zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein has shown that it zzso regulates cell zzso which suggests that this gene is a candidate zzso of zzso zzso Further study will be needed to determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso as a tumor zzso in acute zzso with deletions of the long arm of zzso 7 or in other types of human zzso
