zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso generates a zzso of peptides differing in molecular mass by 13,000 zzso indicating a structural repeat within the zzso A number of peptides bind zzso with the smallest having a molecular mass of 17,000 zzso zzso Our zzso zzso also show that a zzso of 14,000 zzso does not bind zzso Using the full-length zzso sequence zzso zzso Rapp, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Stewart, zzso (1989) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso and protein sequencing techniques, we have determined that zzso begins at zzso 89 while zzso begins at zzso zzso Therefore we have localized 27 zzso acids which are essential for zzso binding zzso This region is at the end of the zzso zzso from the repetitive zzso region predicted from the zzso zzso and displays high sequence identity with regions in the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
