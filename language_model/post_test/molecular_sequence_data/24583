A zzso zzso strain M, newly isolated from processed seafood zzso zzso zzso produced an zzso zzso The zzso designated to as zzso (the mature form of zzso selectively zzso the zzso side of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso of zzso 27 zzso acids of zzso zzso was found to be similar to those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the complete primary structure and precursor of zzso its gene zzso was cloned and zzso The gene zzso was found to zzso for a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso from 64 to 90 completely coincided with the zzso 27 zzso acids of the zzso suggesting that the zzso 63 zzso acids region of zzso (the precursor form of zzso might be processed zzso Moreover, the whole zzso acid sequence deduced from the primary structure of zzso shows significant similarity to those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggested that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, differs from zzso and zzso zzso in the processing site and the zzso zzso
