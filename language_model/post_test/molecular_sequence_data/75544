The zzso organization of the zzso coli zzso genes zzso zzso by zzso was zzso The use of different zzso zzso zzso zzso in blots containing isolated in zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The treatment of cells with zzso just before zzso isolation showed the zzso of these zzso to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso ends of the zzso transcripts were zzso and zzso zzso from the putative initiation zzso of zzso based on a primer extension method of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso combined with zzso of the zzso structural protein zzso by zzso confirmed that major control of zzso expression occurs within a zzso zzso zzso located 433 base pairs upstream of the start of zzso A second zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso coli zzso of different origin expressed zzso less total zzso and zzso less zzso zzso than zzso in identical cell zzso The zzso zzso had a different zzso promoter, with the zzso zzso beginning 264 zzso upstream from the start of zzso We showed by zzso zzso that cells harboring zzso compared with zzso have similar zzso levels of the zzso transcript but they lack a consistently zzso zzso zzso We propose that one reason for the disparate levels of zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso coli is dissimilar levels of zzso zzso in part the transport genes zzso and zzso
