In order to understand the structure and function of zzso zzso reveal the effect of the zzso in zzso and find the zzso marker correlated with meat traits, the zzso of zzso gene was cloned and zzso from muscle of zzso black zzso by zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso The structure and function of zzso were analyzed by zzso and the gene expression profile in different zzso was examined by real-time zzso The results showed that the full sequence of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso containing 76 zzso sequence of zzso zzso and 120 zzso sequence of 3' zzso and coding region zzso zzso zzso encodes 153 zzso zzso The zzso point zzso of the protein is zzso and the molecular weight is zzso zzso There were one zzso site at the third zzso acid and one zzso site at the zzso zzso zzso The percentage of alpha zzso was zzso The alignment similarities of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso with those of zzso human, zzso and mouse were zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the similarities of zzso acid sequence were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso possesses the typical metal binding zzso zzso The zzso tree based on zzso protein sequence detected the closest relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso expression zzso which was detected in brain, heart, zzso liver, zzso zzso large zzso small zzso spinal cord, muscle, zzso and zzso In particular, high expression levels of zzso zzso were detected in zzso small zzso and zzso but low expressions were observed in heart and muscle zzso
