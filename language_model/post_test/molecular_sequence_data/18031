A zzso zzso zzso with specificity for zzso B surface zzso has been produced by genetic zzso The light and heavy chain variable region zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and inserted into zzso expression zzso containing the human zzso and gamma 1 constant region zzso The zzso genes were zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso levels ranged from zzso The zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso B surface zzso and zzso effectively with the parental zzso zzso zzso for binding to these zzso zzso zzso is the first clinically relevant, genetically engineered zzso zzso and may represent an improved agent for the prevention of zzso B virus zzso
