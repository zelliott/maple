To better understand the mechanism of steps in early zzso by zzso zzso II zzso zzso we investigated the molecular zzso of transcript slipping within complexes assembled on promoters containing a zzso zzso bubble from -9 to zzso zzso zzso occurs when an zzso transcript contains a repetitive sequence that allows the transcript to slip back and pair with the template strand of the DNA at a new register before zzso zzso We established the contributions of individual zzso factors, DNA zzso and zzso length to slipping on a zzso template using a highly zzso human pol II zzso zzso We found that transcripts slip at a very defined point in the zzso reaction, after pol II completes zzso bond synthesis at register zzso This point is set by the position of the zzso active site on the DNA template, as opposed to the length of the transcript, as well as by a repetitive zzso sequence that must occur from zzso to zzso Interestingly, slipping at this juncture is induced by zzso protein and zzso factor zzso and requires a zzso box but not a zzso factor zzso recognition zzso We propose a model in which zzso complexes, upon completing zzso bond synthesis at register zzso enter one of two branches in which they either complete productive synthesis of the transcript or undergo multiple rounds of transcript zzso
