zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso cell surface zzso involved in cell zzso cell zzso cell migration, zzso presentation of zzso zzso and growth factors to the corresponding zzso and zzso of zzso at the cell zzso as well as in signaling for cell zzso The zzso gene contains 20 zzso that are alternatively zzso giving rise to many zzso zzso perhaps including zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso were used to detect zzso zzso and zzso protein in sensitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines as well as their parental counterparts, zzso The full length zzso zzso zzso was obtained from the total zzso isolated from zzso cells by zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence and open reading frame were confirmed by restriction zzso analysis and zzso sequencing, and then inserted into the zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso was zzso into zzso cells using zzso After zzso the positive clones were obtained by zzso zzso The changes of the zzso and zzso genes and protein levels were detected by zzso and gelatin zzso zzso The number of the cells penetrating through the artificial zzso membrane in each group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was counted to compare the change of the invasion capability regulated by the zzso zzso and zzso were investigated by Western zzso to approach the molecular mechanisms of zzso and zzso expression regulated by the zzso 

Sensitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells did not contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence was successfully cloned into the zzso zzso zzso and identified by the two restriction zzso It was confirmed that the reconstructed zzso contained the gene sequence of zzso that was composed of zzso 1 to 4, 16 to 17, and 1 to 205 bases of zzso zzso The new gene sequence was sent to zzso for publication, and obtained the registration number zzso The zzso level of the zzso of the zzso gene and the zzso protein were zzso respectively, by zzso and flow zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso The zzso of the cells and the activity of zzso and zzso were clearly activated by zzso treatment, and blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso against zzso and the inhibitor of zzso signaling pathway, could strongly block the expression of zzso 

A new zzso was expressed in zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression zzso zzso was cloned and constructed zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso could interact with the new zzso and regulate the expression of zzso and zzso which could increase the invasion capability of zzso cells through the zzso signaling zzso
