zzso acid zzso is an essential bacterial membrane zzso zzso wall zzso that is attached to the membrane via a zzso zzso According to the currently accepted structure of zzso zzso the zzso is comprised of several repeating units, each of which starts with zzso and ends with zzso with the zzso anchor predicted to be zzso where zzso is zzso However, this zzso anchor has not been detected in zzso zzso Furthermore, the currently accepted structure does not explain the zzso zzso properties of zzso and predicts a molecular weight for zzso that is larger than its actual observed molecular zzso To resolve these problems, we used mass zzso to analyze the structure of zzso isolated from several zzso zzso Our study found that the zzso zzso strain produces zzso that is more representative of zzso than that previously characterized from the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso fragments obtained after zzso acid and nitrous treatments showed that the fragments were consistent with an zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso which is the minimal structure for the zzso zzso Based on these data, we propose a revised model of zzso zzso its zzso repeating unit begins with zzso and ends with zzso and its zzso anchor is zzso a common zzso anchor found in zzso zzso This new model accurately predicts the observed molecular zzso The revised model should facilitate investigation of the relationship between zzso structure and its zzso
