zzso determination is important for genetic zzso in zzso zzso The detection of altered zzso amplified zzso zzso fragments zzso to zzso zzso or point zzso has increased the possibilities of carrier zzso However, problems may occur because of alternative zzso zzso Here we present a family with a zzso patient zzso by a deletion of zzso 45 to zzso At the zzso level we detected a corresponding altered zzso which served for carrier zzso The mother and the sister of the patient showed the same altered zzso zzso zzso as the patient and are therefore zzso In the mother two additional altered zzso zzso fragments were zzso obviously resulting from alternative zzso in the normal zzso The grandmother and two other related females of the patient possess only the normal zzso zzso In a further female we detected an altered zzso zzso to an zzso deletion of zzso zzso This zzso is created either by alternative zzso or a new zzso zzso the carrier status of this female is still ambiguous indicating problems in carrier determination by the method of zzso zzso zzso
