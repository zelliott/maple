In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso segment of the X zzso of zzso zzso is juxtaposed to an zzso portion of the zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by a series of zzso techniques has permitted us precisely to locate the zzso zzso of this zzso in the zzso region of zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso junction revealed that the zzso zzso zzso is joined to zzso repeats, which represent a previously zzso satellite DNA in zzso zzso These repeated sequences have been estimated to account for about 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The repeats are located mainly in the Y zzso and in the zzso of the right arm of zzso 2 zzso where they are zzso with the zzso zzso
