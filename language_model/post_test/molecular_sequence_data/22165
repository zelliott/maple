zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso cause zzso and head and neck zzso and low-risk zzso zzso zzso cause benign zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso binds all zzso tumor zzso protein zzso family members with higher affinity than zzso The zzso zzso protein has been reported to target zzso family members for degradation and to zzso zzso Here we tested the hypothesis that the low-risk zzso protein has an intrinsic ability to decrease expression of zzso family zzso First, we introduced a zzso zzso site into zzso zzso zzso and showed that, in human zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the level of zzso protein but not zzso zzso Second, we analyzed the ability of zzso zzso zzso to destabilize the other zzso family members, zzso and zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso decreased the level of zzso zzso This decrease was inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso was necessary but not sufficient to decrease the level of zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso correlated with a decrease in the expression of zzso a differentiation zzso We suggest that the shared activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to destabilize zzso and decrease or delay differentiation may be related to the role of zzso in the zzso life zzso The added ability of zzso zzso to regulate zzso and zzso may be related to zzso zzso
