This study describes the occurrence of unique zzso zzso zzso zzso genes at a depth of zzso m from the zzso zzso zzso field at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Western Pacific, zzso The zzso genes were obtained from microbes that grew in a zzso in zzso growth chamber deployed for 3 days on a zzso and from the zzso water of drilled holes at 5 degrees C and natural zzso zzso at 7 degrees zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso were not closely related to cultivated species or environmental zzso Moreover, samples of microbial communities were examined by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis of zzso zzso gene fragments obtained from the zzso zzso after a zzso incubation revealed the occurrence of bacterial zzso bands affiliated with the zzso and zzso and zzso as well as the occurrence of zzso zzso affiliated with the zzso and of a unique zzso sequence that clustered with zzso The zzso bands obtained from drilled holes and natural zzso zzso from 7 to 300 degrees C were affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The dominant zzso bands retrieved from the zzso water of zzso pipes at 3 and 4 degrees C were closely related to zzso obtained from the Arctic zzso Our results suggest the presence of zzso corresponding to a unique zzso lineage not detected previously from other geothermal zzso
