zzso zzso disease zzso is a chronic zzso inflammatory disorder of the zzso The zzso remains unknown, but zzso is zzso and multiple factors including zzso zzso and zzso components play a zzso zzso zzso zzso mice infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed as an animal model to imitate naturally occurring inflammatory events and associated key features of chronic inflammatory responses in zzso In this study, we have combined mass zzso zzso and zzso to analyze serum samples of zzso mice infected with zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed that zzso zzso infection dramatically changed numerous zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso cycle, zzso cycle, fatty acid metabolism and zzso zzso with the majority of zzso being zzso In particular, there were notable effects of gut zzso on the blood zzso in infected zzso In addition, the zzso approach identified a number of zzso originating from zzso including zzso complement zzso and zzso with diverse biological functions with potentially important implications for the progress of zzso In zzso the strategy of zzso a relevant animal model and sensitive mass zzso profiling may offer a new perspective to explore zzso and provide zzso insights into zzso
