The existence of a zzso zzso of the major basic protein zzso found in human zzso zzso was initially hypothesized from structural similarities at the electron microscopic zzso The results presented in this study have extended these observations by describing the zzso of a mouse zzso zzso and the cloning of the gene zzso this zzso zzso zzso Using protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso an zzso zzso has been identified on the basis of strong zzso zzso sequence zzso with the mature human zzso zzso Since zzso results from a zzso zzso of a precursor zzso this sequence conservation suggests that the mouse zzso protein is processed by a similar zzso The gene zzso zzso was isolated using a zzso zzso clone as a zzso probe in low criteria screens of mouse zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure and zzso sequence of the zzso zzso are well zzso with the human zzso although zzso alignments of the zzso proteins show that extensive sequence conservation occurs only in the mature portion of the zzso zzso zzso data demonstrate that this gene is zzso active in zzso containing zzso zzso cells, such as zzso bone zzso zzso Southern blots using the zzso gene at reduced stringency reveal the potential existence of a second, more divergent zzso sequence in the zzso This suggests that, as with guinea zzso the mouse zzso may also zzso the zzso major basic protein from more than one zzso
