A zzso zzso a zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso coli, was induced by treatment of zzso zzso 299 with zzso A zzso strain of zzso coli HB 101 carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a low toxic zzso analogue zzso zzso which was zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was less than zzso and zzso of the normal zzso in the rabbit zzso loop test and in the rabbit skin zzso test, zzso The zzso acid composition of the zzso zzso zzso was the same as that of the normal B zzso Though the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was identical to normal zzso by DNA analysis, the A1 zzso of the zzso zzso differed from the normal A1 zzso in one zzso acid at position zzso namely it had zzso instead of zzso acid from the N zzso These data suggest that zzso acid at position 112 from the N zzso of the A1 zzso is important for the A zzso to express its biological zzso
