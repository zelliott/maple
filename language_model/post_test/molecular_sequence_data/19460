zzso zzso peptides that undergo an electron transfer reaction without zzso in a linear zzso trap can be subjected to zzso zzso zzso upon transfer from the linear zzso trap into an adjacent mass zzso as demonstrated here with a hybrid triple zzso zzso trap zzso The zzso can be promoted by use of a DC offset difference between the zzso trap used for reaction and the zzso trap into which the products are injected of zzso zzso which gives rise to energetic zzso between the transferred zzso and the zzso gas employed in the linear zzso trap used for zzso zzso Such a process can be executed routinely on hybrid linear zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso and is demonstrated here with several model peptides as well as a few dozen zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso precursor zzso that survive electron transfer frequently provides structural information that is absent from the precursor zzso that zzso spontaneously upon electron zzso The degree to which additional structural information is obtained by zzso zzso of the surviving zzso charged zzso zzso depends upon zzso zzso Little or no additional structural information is obtained from small peptides zzso zzso due to the high electron transfer zzso zzso efficiencies noted for these peptides as well as the extensive sequence information that tends to be forthcoming from zzso of such zzso zzso zzso of the surviving electron transfer products provided greatest benefit for peptides of zzso zzso
