zzso zzso zzso is characterized by a number of features, including zzso zzso zzso by zzso compounds and zzso zzso by its zzso which zzso a special zzso to interact with zzso charged zzso This situation may reflect the presence in zzso zzso zzso of several basic zzso that are not zzso in the majority of other protein zzso Some of these zzso notably zzso in the zzso rich zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso rich zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso have been shown by zzso studies to be implicated to various zzso and with distinct roles in zzso recognition, zzso by zzso and by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso data provide a rationale for the zzso zzso showing that several of these basic zzso are clustered around the active site where they make contact with individual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso They can also mediate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of regulatory elements present in the zzso in the N terminal segment of the zzso zzso and possibly in other proteins interacting with zzso Our data also disclose a unique mode of binding of the zzso zzso which bridges across the zzso zzso making contacts with both the lower and upper zzso of zzso
