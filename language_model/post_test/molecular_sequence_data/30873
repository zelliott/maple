zzso zzso in zzso results in the conversion of an zzso zzso to a hormone zzso and a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso five zzso sites have been located as hormone zzso in zzso of different animal zzso To search for donor sites, we treated bovine zzso with zzso to specifically modify zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso according to the principle of zzso determination developed by us zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso After digesting zzso with zzso zzso zzso peptides were separated from other peptides by zzso them on immobilized zzso and from each other by zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso The zzso patterns showed about 10 zzso zzso Among them, four different peptides were zzso by repeated zzso zzso The results of partial sequencing of the four peptides by manual zzso degradation disclosed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso are available for zzso as donor zzso These results strongly suggest that only specific zzso zzso behave as zzso
