zzso disease, an zzso error of zzso zzso results from zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso Six zzso A gene zzso that cause zzso disease were investigated to assess the role of zzso repetitive elements and short direct and/or zzso repeats in the generation of these zzso zzso The zzso of five partial gene deletions and one partial gene zzso were determined by either cloning and sequencing the zzso gene from an affected zzso or by zzso chain reaction amplifying and sequencing the zzso region containing the novel zzso Although the zzso A gene contains 12 zzso repetitive elements (representing approximately zzso of the zzso zzso gene or approximately 1 zzso zzso only one deletion resulted from an zzso zzso The remaining five zzso involved illegitimate zzso events between short direct repeats of 2 to 6 base pairs zzso at the deletion or zzso zzso Of these zzso one had a 3' short direct repeat within an zzso element, while another was unusual having two deletions of zzso zzso and 14 zzso separated by a zzso zzso zzso These findings suggested that slipped zzso or zzso exchanges involving short direct repeats were responsible for the generation of most of these gene zzso There were no zzso repeat sequences or alternating zzso regions which may have predisposed the gene to these zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso (or their respective zzso zzso and zzso occurred within or adjacent to the direct repeats at the zzso zzso in three and four of the five zzso A gene zzso respectively, suggesting a possible functional role in these illegitimate zzso zzso These studies indicate that short direct repeats are important in the formation of gene zzso even in human genes like zzso A that are rich in zzso repetitive zzso
