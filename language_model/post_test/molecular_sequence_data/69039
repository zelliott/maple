It is well-established that zzso zzso T cells can activate mature B cells in a zzso zzso zzso We have used this system to investigate the effects of T zzso signals on immature B cells zzso from the zzso of zzso mice, since these cells are unresponsive to many zzso zzso and are exquisitely sensitive to zzso We show that immature B cells can be induced to zzso by zzso zzso fixed zzso and zzso cells, although the latter induce a greater response than the zzso zzso to zzso partially blocked stimulation by zzso cells, whereas zzso to zzso and zzso had no effect on responses to zzso zzso This suggested that molecules in addition to zzso contribute to the capacity of T cells to induce B cell zzso one likely candidate being the zzso for zzso We therefore generated mouse zzso zzso zzso which express zzso zzso zzso These zzso also induced proliferation of immature B cells, which is enhanced by zzso Unlike the situation with mature B cells, both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of immature B cells by zzso zzso However, this zzso was reversed by zzso which zzso with signals delivered through zzso to render immature B cells zzso to negative signals delivered through zzso Taken together these data suggest that immature B cells can be activated by T zzso contact signals and that zzso zzso in the presence of zzso are capable of zzso the negative signals generated via zzso and zzso receptors expressed by these zzso
