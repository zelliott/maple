Band 3 performs the same structural and functional activities in adult brain as it does in zzso It ages as cells and zzso age Our studies, to date, indicate that the zzso transport ability of band 3 decreases in brains and zzso from old zzso This decreased transport ability precedes obvious structural changes, such as band 3 degradation and generation of zzso and is the earliest change thus far detected in band zzso The following changes occur in zzso zzso and brain band 3 with zzso 1) a decreased efficiency of zzso transport zzso zzso in spite of an increase in number of zzso binding sites zzso zzso 2) a decreased zzso zzso 3) zzso labeling in zzso 4) an increased degradation to smaller fragments as detected by quantitative binding of zzso to band 3 breakdown products and zzso zzso and 5) a binding of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The latter three findings indicate that zzso changes zzso In addition, the zzso zzso band 3, zzso an as yet undefined change that results in binding of zzso zzso to aged band zzso zzso changes in zzso include decreased brain and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso 113 and 45 zzso band 3 zzso due to the zzso site being already occupied, increased degradation of band 3, zzso in band 3 recognized by zzso and decreased zzso and zzso transport by blood zzso Band 3 in zzso of zzso patients has a different zzso identity from normal band 3 as evidenced by the binding of zzso described in this zzso zzso may be zzso zzso in the brain because zzso accumulate damage throughout the lifetime as they do not zzso or undergo cell zzso We suspect, and our data zzso that the same zzso of zzso occurs in all cells, but that the manifestations differ due to different cell proteins and zzso
