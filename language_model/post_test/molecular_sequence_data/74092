The importance of the zzso zzso zzso domain 5 zzso to envelope function has been examined by zzso scanning zzso and subsequent characterization of the zzso effects on viral entry and envelope zzso processing, and zzso as well as zzso association with zzso With respect to the zzso zzso zzso effects on viral entry fall into three zzso zzso functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso is attributed to a combination of deleterious effects on processing, zzso association, and membrane zzso In the case of the zzso zzso zzso the introduction of the zzso zzso zzso results in substantially increased envelope processing and a gain of zzso The effects of the zzso are interpreted with respect to the structures of zzso and zzso The extent of sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso underscores the importance of this domain to envelope function and suggests that zzso is an attractive and novel target for future drug discovery zzso
