The comparatively good fossil record of zzso zzso allows rates of zzso change to be estimated over the past 260 million years and compared with rates of molecular zzso zzso analysis of zzso data, based predominantly on skeletal zzso and zzso distance and maximum likelihood analyses of molecular data, from the first 380 bases from the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso for 10 species of zzso produce zzso zzso The molecular sequence chosen is demonstrably far from zzso and sister groups have divergence times ranging from about 15 to 260 zzso zzso analysis allows the great majority of molecular and zzso zzso to be placed in one of 18 independent geological time zzso providing a direct measure of rates of evolution for periods in the geological zzso Because most molecular fixed point zzso in our sequences cannot be polarized zzso by zzso comparison zzso the zzso states effectively zzso distance and zzso analyses both tend zzso to root the zzso tree on the longest internal zzso A zzso identical to that derived from zzso data is, however, obtained using zzso zzso and also zzso analysis where zzso rooting is restricted to more zzso zzso This is taken as the correct zzso for assessing rates of zzso Overall, both zzso and molecular changes show a moderately strong correlation with time zzso but a weaker correlation with one zzso zzso significant differences in evolutionary rate are found between some, but not all, zzso comparisons of sister lineages for both molecular and zzso zzso The molecular clock rate for zzso is three times faster than that for zzso and irregular zzso zzso rank correlation test, which requires only relative magnitude of changes to be known, suggests that zzso change has a slightly better correlation with time than does molecular change, averaged over all ten zzso However, when just zzso are considered an extremely good correlation is found between the number of molecular changes and time zzso whereas zzso change remains poorly zzso Thus, molecular rates approximate to a zzso model within restricted zzso zzso but vary significantly between zzso zzso results over all zzso produces a correlation that is no better than the correlation between zzso change and time zzso
