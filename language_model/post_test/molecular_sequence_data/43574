The sequence connecting zzso D and E of the D1 protein in zzso II zzso is longer than that found in the corresponding loop of the L zzso in the zzso reaction zzso This sequence was zzso in order to determine its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso including point zzso and deletions of different size, of the zzso region and the putative zzso area in the zzso loop of the D protein were constructed in zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the functional and structural properties of zzso and turnover of the D1 protein were zzso Our results demonstrate that deletion of either the zzso sequence zzso or the putative zzso region zzso zzso of the D1 protein resulted in severe zzso on the function of the QB electron zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso of the zzso with deleted zzso region remained functional enough to support zzso growth whereas deletions of the putative zzso region prevented zzso zzso Although enhanced degradation rates of the zzso D1 proteins under zzso growth conditions demonstrate that neither the zzso sequence nor the putative zzso region are required for D1 zzso it became clear that the extension in the zzso loop of the D1 protein is essential for proper zzso assembly and zzso zzso Moreover, modifications of the zzso loop resulted in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso indicating that neither light intensity, as such, nor the activity of the electron transfer chain are the only zzso in regulation of zzso gene zzso
