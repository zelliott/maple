A water soluble zzso a major component of the zzso fraction of rat heart cells, was zzso using either reverse phase zzso or zzso affinity zzso procedures and zzso The protein has an apparent Mr of 24 zzso as judged by zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, however, the protein occurs as a zzso (Mr between 400 and 650 zzso of the zzso 24 zzso species and could be selectively enriched by zzso of the zzso fraction on 10 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso 24 zzso zzso were used to investigate its tissue zzso Besides the heart, where it is very abundant, the 24 zzso protein is expressed also in other red muscles and in zzso but was not zzso in stomach, zzso liver, and zzso The zzso acid composition of the protein and the partial zzso acid sequence of various zzso fragments was zzso A search for zzso of the primary structure of known proteins has shown that the 24 zzso protein is zzso similar, if not identical to zzso In fact, the two proteins were found to be indistinguishable also by zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the lens protein alpha zzso is a major zzso component of heart zzso
