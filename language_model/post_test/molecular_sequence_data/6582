The zzso zzso changes induced by the binding of zzso human zzso A to zzso were appreciably different from those induced by zzso C, reflecting mainly interactions involving the single zzso of zzso C, zzso zzso A bound tightly and rapidly to zzso and zzso zzso with zzso equilibrium zzso of approximately zzso M and association rate zzso of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These affinities are at least zzso higher than previously reported zzso The zzso of binding to zzso were consistent with a simple zzso zzso reaction zzso indicating that zzso A, like chicken zzso and zzso C, binds to zzso with no appreciable zzso adaptation of either reacting zzso zzso A bound more zzso to zzso and zzso B, C and zzso with zzso equilibrium zzso of zzso zzso The weaker binding to zzso B was largely due to a considerably reduced association rate constant zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso of zzso B markedly restricting the access of zzso A to the active zzso The lower affinities for zzso and zzso C and H were due partly to lower association rate zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but primarily to higher zzso rate zzso The mode of binding of zzso A to zzso zzso indicated that there is appreciably less space around the zzso zzso of zzso in the complex with zzso A than in the complexes with chicken zzso and zzso zzso An zzso truncated form of zzso A, lacking the first six zzso had considerably lower affinity for zzso than the full-length zzso consistent with an intact zzso region being of importance for zzso zzso
