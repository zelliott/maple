Group I zzso are the major zzso of grass zzso but their biological function is zzso These proteins are shown here to be structurally related to zzso which are able to induce extension zzso of plant cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso possess potent zzso activity, as measured in wall extension and wall zzso zzso This activity is selective for grass cell walls and is, at least partly, due to the action of zzso group I zzso We propose that group I zzso facilitate invasion of the zzso tube into the maternal zzso by loosening the cell walls of the grass zzso and zzso Additionally, the presence of related zzso in zzso zzso of rice, zzso and soybean implies that zzso zzso may function to loosen walls in growing zzso zzso as zzso
