zzso zzso are the zzso agent of the zzso disease, zzso Among four zzso zzso subspecies, zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso only for zzso individuals, while all four subspecies are zzso for zzso This study zzso zzso and zzso approaches to identify seven zzso zzso zzso proteins and the corresponding Type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins were predicted to zzso two zzso a zzso binding zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was regulated by the zzso regulator zzso zzso infection of mice with zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso system or zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso spread to systemic zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in increased zzso zzso into the mouse zzso zzso is a zinc zzso that is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso likely results in increased production of zzso and increased zzso at the infection site in skin that limits the zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso strains contain a zzso in zzso predicted to abolish its zzso Loss of zzso function may have contributed to evolution of highly virulent zzso
