zzso features of the DNA segment zzso containing the complementary zzso responsive element zzso has been studied by zzso and molecular dynamics calculations with a view to see the role of zzso structure in specific DNA zzso From the low field zzso zzso zzso zzso the DNA sequence is seen to exist as a duplex with zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso however show that zzso zzso exhibits substantial dynamism even at 1 degree zzso Several extra cross peaks, more than the expected number, are seen in particular regions in all the zzso These observations indicate that the duplex zzso slow transitions between zzso and zzso states due to zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso those transitions a restrained zzso dynamics has been performed for zzso using zzso force zzso zzso zzso at regular intervals have been zzso and we see that the dynamism in the zzso results in substantial fluctuations in the different zzso zzso The mismatch sites are seen to exhibit the highest degree of zzso with the bases stacking in and looping out of the zzso The sugar geometry is seen to be fairly steady around the S domain for most of the zzso
