A zzso zzso zzso has a characteristic zzso circular zzso spectrum in zzso Upon the addition of salt, the zzso spontaneously assembles to form a zzso zzso The membrane does not zzso in heat or in zzso or alkaline solutions, nor does it zzso upon addition of zzso zzso zzso or a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a network of interwoven filaments approximately zzso zzso in zzso An important component of the stability is probably due to formation of complementary zzso bonds between zzso and zzso side zzso This phenomenon may be a model for studying the zzso peptides found in certain neurological zzso It may also have implications for zzso and zzso zzso
