zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso one specific for zzso zzso and the other for zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and its activity is inhibited by UMP and activated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso is similarly zzso by zzso zzso but its activity is not sensitive to these or other potential zzso Each of the two zzso consist of two unequal zzso as is the case for other microbial zzso however, the large zzso for the zzso zzso is smaller than that for the zzso zzso zzso of the derived zzso acid sequence for the cloned large zzso of the zzso zzso with those for zzso from zzso zzso showed significant similarity throughout the zzso except at the zzso zzso which was identified by other laboratories to contain the binding site for the zzso zzso Unlike the results previously reported for zzso from an enteric zzso the kinetic properties of the zzso zzso were not affected by growth of zzso zzso at temperatures near the minimal growth zzso Furthermore, zzso studies showed that the zzso stability of cloned zzso was identical regardless of the growth temperature of zzso zzso between 42 degrees C and 63 degrees zzso The zzso stability of cloned zzso was not affected by expression at 37 C in zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso for zzso and other proteins were higher in extracts of cells grown at higher zzso These results indicate that cellular factors, probably zzso are necessary for zzso stability of proteins at and below the optimal temperature for this zzso
