The zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso concentrating ability within zzso zzso zzso We sought to develop zzso zzso against human zzso zzso for use as zzso in zzso studies of the zzso as well as potential tools in the assessment of zzso expression in benign and zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the second zzso and to the zzso zzso of zzso were produced and zzso as zzso to develop zzso zzso which were tested by Western zzso using zzso prepared from zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso containing the gene for the full-length zzso or a control zzso Western zzso showed a major band with molecular weight zzso of approximately 97 zzso and several minor bands with zzso of approximately 160 zzso 68 zzso 30 zzso and 15 zzso all specific for zzso zzso zzso was performed in various types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Strong zzso was observed in zzso zzso intermediate zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cancer, and no zzso in zzso cell cancer or in zzso zzso The zzso was specific for the zzso zzso in each of the zzso and was most intense in the zzso portion of the cell zzso Overall, our observations indicate that the zzso zzso are specific for zzso and will be invaluable zzso for investigating the role of zzso in zzso zzso
