zzso treatment of advanced zzso cancer patients generally results in an initially beneficial response, but the treated patients develop zzso resistant disease in which no zzso therapy is currently zzso Recent studies have revealed that zzso 6 zzso is a growth factor for zzso zzso cell zzso and certain zzso zzso Further, zzso has been shown to block zzso induced by zzso transforming growth factor zzso and certain cancer zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to determine whether zzso is a growth factor for two human prostate cancer lines and whether it protects the tumor cells from drug-induced cell zzso Two zzso prostate cell lines were used in this study, namely zzso and zzso and these have been shown to be relatively resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both cell lines express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso to the cell lines resulted in a significant zzso of cell growth up to day 2, and when additional zzso was added at day 2 the zzso persisted for 4 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso resulted in zzso in zzso in both cell lines, whereas the combination of zzso and zzso or zzso resulted only in additive zzso zzso treatment revealed that zzso zzso was required to achieve zzso whereas either sequence of zzso resulted in zzso with zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso treatment of tumor cells zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso The present findings demonstrate that zzso is an zzso growth factor for zzso and zzso prostate zzso Additionally, the zzso of this zzso protects the tumor cells against the zzso effect of zzso and zzso and its zzso zzso the cells to zzso Overall, the studies suggest that agents that can zzso or inhibit protective factors in tumors may overcome drug zzso
