The activity of many zzso zzso channels and cell surface receptors is modulated by small molecules and zzso but an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is zzso For zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso coupled sites in the zzso zzso binding domain zzso zzso assembly regulates the rate of entry into the zzso state, which occurs when the zzso interface zzso and the channel zzso Studies on zzso receptors have defined the zzso zzso assembly as a key functional unit that controls zzso and zzso Here we use zzso zzso to probe the energetic effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso stability in solution, using a zzso zzso that zzso zzso Our results show that sodium and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity as much as zzso and that removal of either zzso or zzso zzso the zzso The zzso of a similar zzso mechanism for zzso of zzso zzso receptors by zzso was also zzso Our results indicate that zzso can contribute substantial free energy to active state stabilization in both these zzso and provide quantitative zzso of the energetic consequences of zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso zzso
