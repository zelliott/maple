The coral skeleton consists of zzso deposited upon an organic zzso primarily as zzso Currently zzso from zzso zzso is the only soluble protein component of the organic zzso that has been characterized from a zzso Three genes related to zzso were identified in the coral zzso zzso 

One of the zzso genes zzso encodes a clear zzso zzso while the others zzso 1 and zzso 2) zzso larger and more divergent zzso All three proteins are predicted to be zzso and share common structural features, most notably the presence of repetitive motifs containing zzso zzso In zzso zzso reveals zzso but partially zzso spatial expression of the genes in patterns consistent with distinct roles in zzso Both of the zzso genes are expressed exclusively in the early stages of zzso while zzso continues to be expressed in the adult, consistent with the situation in the coral zzso 

Comparisons with zzso suggest functional convergence in the two zzso zzso zzso proteins may be the zzso counterparts of zzso whereas the zzso proteins combine characteristics of two distinct proteins involved in zzso zzso Database searches indicate that, although sequences with high similarity to the zzso are restricted to the zzso more divergent members of this protein family are present in other zzso and some other zzso We suggest that ancestral zzso may have been zzso recruited to roles in zzso in the zzso when the zzso first zzso zzso the evolution of the broader zzso family will require wider sampling and expression analysis in a range of zzso and other zzso
