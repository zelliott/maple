Gene therapy is a growing topic in the medical zzso Since the safety system of gene therapy has not been sufficiently established, its clinical use is zzso Recently, we developed a zzso gene regulation system based on a new concept, zzso or Drug and Gene zzso System Responding to Cellular zzso We hoped here to apply this zzso concept to gene therapy for virus zzso In the present study, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of the functional zzso which are able to discriminate normal and human zzso virus type 1 zzso infected zzso In the zzso concept, certain zzso signals, which are extraordinary activated in the target disease cells specifically, are used as a trigger to activate a zzso zzso Thus, we paid attention to zzso zzso as a target signal in this case, because zzso zzso is essential for the proliferation of zzso This zzso is therefore an indicator of zzso zzso Two types of zzso were designed and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso with radical zzso as a functional gene zzso The grafted zzso possesses a zzso protein zzso domain zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso for cell zzso which are connected with zzso backbone via a consensus zzso sequence for zzso zzso zzso At first, the zzso were evaluated to see whether they possess DNA binding ability and zzso zzso responsibility using gel zzso zzso The results suggested that a zzso could form a stable complex with DNA and release the DNA specifically responding to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it was shown that this controlled release of DNA by the zzso zzso zzso intelligent zzso actually regulated the gene expression in the zzso zzso This system would be a useful tool for gene therapy in zzso infection, and this methodology will be zzso if the zzso zzso is replaced by another zzso zzso which is critical for the replication of a corresponding zzso
