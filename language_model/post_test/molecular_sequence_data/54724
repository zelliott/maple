zzso zzso are popular floral crops, and development of new zzso is economically important to zzso industries zzso Analysis of zzso genes could facilitate zzso zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso end sequences zzso can provide the first glimpses into the sequence composition of a novel zzso and can yield molecular markers for use in genetic mapping and zzso 

We used two zzso libraries zzso using the zzso and zzso restriction zzso of zzso zzso to generate zzso sequences from zzso zzso clones zzso and zzso from the zzso and zzso libraries, respectively), at a success rate of zzso A total of zzso zzso were generated, representing zzso zzso or about zzso of the zzso zzso The trimmed sequences ranged from 123 to zzso base pairs zzso in size, with an average edited read length of zzso zzso When these zzso were subjected to sequence zzso searches, it was found that zzso zzso were predicted to represent zzso regions, whereas zzso zzso contained repetitive zzso Most of the repetitive DNA sequences were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), whereas only zzso were DNA zzso Further, 950 potential simple sequence repeats zzso were zzso zzso were the most abundant repeat zzso zzso zzso repeats were the most frequent zzso representing zzso zzso of all identified zzso zzso analysis revealed that more zzso mapped to the zzso sequences of zzso than to those of grape or zzso and even fewer mapped to the rice zzso This work will facilitate analysis of the zzso zzso and will help clarify similarities and differences in zzso composition between zzso and other plant zzso 

Using zzso analysis, we obtained an overview of the zzso zzso in terms of gene zzso the presence of repetitive DNA and zzso zzso and the extent of zzso with other plant zzso This work provides a basis for future physical mapping of the zzso zzso and advances our knowledge zzso
