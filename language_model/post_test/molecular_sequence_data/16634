Human zzso reverse zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in human, has been identified as the zzso factor in zzso activity, but its detailed mechanism of zzso regulation remains zzso In this investigation, a novel human gene zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was isolated from zzso cell based on zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso open reading frame zzso a predicted protein of zzso zzso zzso which is functionally zzso in general zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was detected in cells and expressed an zzso native zzso distributing mainly in cellular zzso Its interaction with zzso promoter was identified and the DNA binding potential was credited to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells presented marked zzso of zzso promoter and zzso both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso protein might be a zzso regulator and take part in the zzso of zzso
