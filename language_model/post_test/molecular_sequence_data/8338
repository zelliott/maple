Previous work on the zzso regulation of the mouse zzso promoter had indicated a major role for the zzso B zzso factor in the induction of the gene by zzso However, similar studies using the human promoter failed to establish a role for this zzso We measured the nuclear migration of zzso B and the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso T zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso under different zzso conditions, seeking to establish a zzso zzso of zzso B and zzso of zzso zzso correlated zzso under the following conditions: zzso zzso of zzso B by zzso zzso induction of zzso synthesis by zzso zzso partial induction of zzso zzso by various zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso B zzso by a zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso had no effect on zzso B zzso We conclude that zzso B zzso is necessary, but not sufficient for the zzso induction of the zzso gene by zzso in zzso or by zzso zzso and zzso in T zzso
