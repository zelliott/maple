The zzso zzso protein is a potent zzso essential for virus zzso We reported previously that zzso zzso peptides containing zzso zzso zzso region zzso a possible zzso region, and zzso zzso zzso zzso a nuclear targeting and putative zzso acid binding region, possess minimal but distinct zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso greatly enhances zzso We zzso that zzso zzso peptides with an inactive region II and a functional region III can behave as dominant negative zzso We zzso minimal domain peptides containing single zzso zzso for zzso acid zzso within region II that are zzso among different zzso zzso We identify four zzso acid zzso whose substitution within zzso minimal domain peptides leads to defects in zzso Some of these zzso are zzso in several zzso zzso since they strongly inhibit zzso by zzso zzso protein added to cells or expressed from zzso zzso zzso zzso of integrated zzso is blocked by some zzso zzso zzso These results suggest an attractive approach for the development of an AIDS zzso
