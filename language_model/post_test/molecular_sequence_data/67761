zzso zzso receptors zzso play an important role as zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In insects, zzso are the site of action of commercially important zzso and, as a consequence, there is considerable interest in examining their functional zzso However, problems have been encountered in the successful functional expression of insect zzso although a number of strategies have been developed in an attempt to overcome such zzso Ten zzso zzso have been identified in the model insect zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a similar number have been identified in other insect zzso The focus of the present study is the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are distinguished by their sequence similarity to one another and also by their close similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A full-length zzso clone zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and the properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso examined in a variety of cell expression zzso We have demonstrated the functional zzso as zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso by their zzso with the molecular zzso zzso Also, using a similar approach, we have demonstrated the functional expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with substantially higher apparent affinity for zzso than is seen with other zzso zzso In addition, specific zzso binding of zzso was detected in both zzso and zzso cell lines when zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso of additional zzso (including zzso with zzso and zzso prevented specific binding of zzso in cell lines, suggesting that zzso with other zzso zzso can block maturation of correctly folded zzso in some cellular zzso 

Data are presented demonstrating the ability of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to generate functional zzso and also zzso zzso
