The majority of zzso infections worldwide occur in Africa, where zzso B viruses are rare and zzso zzso are zzso zzso and vaccine studies need to focus on viruses derived from African patients, and infectious zzso molecular clones can be useful zzso To clone non-B zzso and zzso viruses from patients, we cultivated zzso from the plasma of a Kenyan long-term zzso zzso DNA was cloned into a zzso which was zzso into zzso zzso progeny virus was zzso in zzso zzso analyses revealed that both the patient's plasma zzso zzso and the cloned DNA zzso were zzso between zzso D and zzso zzso C sequences comprised the zzso and zzso zzso The cloned virus used the zzso zzso and did not form zzso in zzso This infectious zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular clone obtained from a Kenyan long-term zzso promises to be useful to study zzso and vaccine zzso
