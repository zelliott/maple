We developed a metal zzso zzso zzso for zzso detection by zzso An zzso probe was separated into two zzso bearing zzso zzso at the gap zzso Duplex formation with the DNA target was possible only if zzso zzso were added, but a zzso substitution opposite the gap point prevented duplex zzso Here we demonstrate the application of this approach for zzso detection zzso within the zzso zzso gene on a zzso
