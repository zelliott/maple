The embryonic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to aggregate, which was shown by the finding that the Hill zzso zzso was greater than zzso in the upper part of the oxygen equilibrium zzso Here, we have undertaken a detailed primary structure analysis of the zzso zzso zzso young zzso complement, which we hoped might provide clues into the zzso that cause zzso and a high embryonic zzso The zzso zzso embryonic zzso complement is principally four major zzso each with a different zzso zzso Two early expressed zzso contain the same embryonic zzso chain, zzso zzso but two separate zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso prime zzso and zzso both of which are zzso zzso The later two expressed zzso contain the same adult zzso but different zzso zzso The latest expressed zzso contains the same zzso chain, zzso as the two early expressed forms, but the third expressed zzso contains a unique zzso chain which we have termed omega zzso A protein database similarity search using the first 54 zzso zzso acids of the zzso showed a range of sequence identities of zzso to all known zzso zzso zzso including the other zzso zzso The closest identity, reflected by both the highest percentage identity and zzso score, was with the embryonic zzso of the zzso While the primary structures of the zzso reported here do not explain the low zzso affinity in embryonic zzso blood, the finding of the similarity with the bird zzso sequence with one of the zzso chains has implications on zzso zzso zzso How many other zzso and zzso zzso are harboring a zzso zzso in their zzso
