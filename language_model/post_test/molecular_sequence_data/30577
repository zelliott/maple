In most highly structured native zzso as well as in zzso the zzso in zzso of the various zzso zzso toward zzso is widely zzso The present work demonstrates that of nearly 70 zzso zzso present in rat zzso there is one, zzso number 5 from the zzso end, which has in zzso the highest affinity toward zzso being the first one to be zzso In fact, when zzso zzso zzso animals were injected with zzso and killed shortly after, we isolated from zzso zzso poorly zzso zzso (about 1 zzso zzso zzso nearly zzso of the zzso of which was found as zzso Although zzso zzso of this protein gave several fragments after gel zzso only one of these, with apparent mass 27,000 zzso contained zzso This zzso was isolated and fully zzso Twelve cycles of automated zzso degradation were zzso the sequence found, zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso This portion of the zzso chain contains several zzso zzso which may well all be potentially involved in the early zzso of the zzso The observation that the removal of seven zzso acids from the zzso zzso is accompanied (at the fifth zzso by the total disappearance of zzso in the resulting shortened zzso suggested that the fifth zzso was the only one zzso under these zzso A second, more quantitative experiment was performed on zzso obtained from zzso animals whose death was postponed 24 h after the injection of zzso In this case the zzso was found not only in a single zzso zzso zzso zzso but also in other discrete species of lower molecular zzso The mixture of these peptides was subjected to seven steps of manual zzso zzso zzso before and after partial degradation were run in parallel on a zzso gel and the distribution of zzso zzso Besides some change in the background, the two profiles were identical except for the absence of the zzso zzso This proves that all the zzso present in the zzso species was localized at the fifth zzso the same site at which the hormone zzso is zzso zzso under normal zzso This result is not unexpected and is in zzso with the known properties of zzso which has a zzso chain designed for efficient synthesis of the hormone even at low levels of zzso
