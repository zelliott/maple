The zzso and zzso genes are expressed during the formation of the zzso and auditory zzso To zzso the function of zzso and zzso during this process, we have zzso mice carrying a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain of these zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso mice revealed zzso deficiencies in the zzso and cochlear zzso In zzso zzso animals zzso zzso and a subset of cochlear zzso responsible for the zzso of outer hair cells were drastically zzso The peripheral targets of the respective zzso showed severe zzso zzso A comparative analysis of zzso from zzso zzso zzso revealed a moderate reduction of zzso zzso and a specific loss of cochlear zzso zzso inner hair zzso No nerve zzso were detected in the sensory zzso containing inner hair zzso A zzso study of zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice showed that some zzso and cochlear zzso initially reached their peripheral targets but failed to maintain zzso and zzso zzso and zzso receptors are therefore required for the survival of specific zzso populations and the maintenance of target zzso in the peripheral sensory system of the inner zzso
