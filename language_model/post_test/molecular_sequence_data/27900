Two zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso as does the previously reported clone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data are consistent with zzso zzso and zzso zzso being zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso We have also isolated the zzso clone corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thought to be essential for zzso function were identified in the predicted zzso acid sequences of both zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses indicate that these zzso are expressed during secondary zzso appearing on day 4 of growth and increasing on days 5 and zzso
