The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso which efficiently incorporates a single zzso cluster with zzso and zzso properties that are typical of natural bacterial zzso Using this synthetic protein scaffold, we have investigated the role of the zzso zzso acids in the assembly of the zzso zzso In a zzso fashion, we truncated zzso to a zzso acid zzso zzso which incorporates a cluster zzso identical to zzso but in lower yield, zzso relative to zzso zzso consists solely of zzso zzso consensus zzso core motif observed in natural protein zzso Initially, all of the zzso zzso acids were zzso for either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso on the basis of analysis of natural zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso incorporated little zzso zzso 6 and zzso zzso A systematic study of the incorporation of a single zzso into each of the four zzso positions indicated that placement either in the second or in the sixth core motif zzso zzso restored the zzso cluster binding capacity of the peptides to the level of zzso zzso of an zzso into the fifth zzso which in natural zzso is predominantly occupied by a zzso resulted in a loss of zzso zzso The substitution of zzso zzso and zzso into the second core motif position illustrated the stabilization of the zzso cluster by bulky zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the incorporation of a single zzso into the second core motif position in a zzso acid zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the level of zzso cluster binding relative to that of the zzso zzso The protein design rules derived from this study are fully consistent with those derived from natural zzso sequence analysis, suggesting they are zzso to both the de zzso design and zzso redesign of natural zzso
