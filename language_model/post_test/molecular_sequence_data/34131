zzso protein has an important role in zzso DNA repair by zzso zzso zzso filament formation on zzso DNA zzso protected by replication zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In human, cellular response to DNA damage includes zzso of zzso by zzso zzso at zzso zzso To address how this zzso zzso zzso function, we used an amber zzso technology to substitute zzso 104 with chemically stable zzso analogue zzso zzso The zzso retained zzso activity characteristic of unmodified zzso but showed lower affinity for zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso specifically targets and wraps zzso While zzso is confined to zzso region, unmodified zzso readily zzso into zzso zzso The zzso substitution also increased the zzso zzso rate and allowed overcoming the zzso effect of zzso We propose that zzso at zzso enhances zzso zzso activity of zzso by attenuating zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity are zzso
