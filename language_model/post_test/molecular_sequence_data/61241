zzso receptors are zzso channels gated by zzso zzso zzso zzso There are relatively few known types of zzso zzso In zzso they include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors are related in evolutionary terms, while zzso and zzso receptors form separate zzso There have been seven cloned proteins identified to date as members of the zzso zzso family in a wide range of cells and zzso We have carried out zzso investigations and sequence comparisons of each of the seven zzso in order to examine the putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso locations of zzso bridges are consistent with there being two separate zzso folding zzso Assessment of the putative zzso regions was used to select small zzso zzso acid segments in zzso regions for raising zzso against each of the zzso zzso zzso To test the specificity of these novel zzso zzso zzso and their presence in cardiac and smooth muscle, sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso was undertaken in zzso rat heart, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
