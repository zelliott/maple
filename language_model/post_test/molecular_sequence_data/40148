zzso zzso is presumed to be zzso with its human host and is a highly diverse gastric pathogen at genetic zzso zzso origins of zzso zzso in the New World are still zzso It is not clear how different waves of human zzso in South America contributed to the evolution of strain diversity of zzso zzso The objective of our zzso study was to gain fresh insights into these issues through mapping genetic origins of zzso zzso of native zzso (of zzso zzso and their zzso comparison with zzso from Spain, and zzso 

For this purpose, we attempted to dissect genetic identity of strains by fluorescent amplified zzso length zzso zzso analysis, zzso sequence typing zzso of the 7 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the sequence analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The whole zzso zzso zzso from these strains was analyzed using zzso and the geographic type of zzso zzso motif zzso was determined by gene zzso We observed that while European zzso zzso zzso in native Peruvian zzso approximately zzso of these strains represent a zzso with an zzso ancestry zzso All of these strains however, irrespective of their ancestral affiliation zzso a complete, zzso type zzso and the motifs surrounding zzso This indicates a possible acquisition of zzso by the zzso strains from the European zzso during decades of zzso 

Our observations suggest presence of ancestral zzso zzso zzso in Peruvian zzso which possibly managed to survive and compete against the Spanish strains that arrived to the New World about 500 years zzso We suggest that this might have happened after native Peruvian zzso zzso strains acquired zzso zzso either by new acquisition in zzso strains or by zzso in zzso positive zzso zzso
