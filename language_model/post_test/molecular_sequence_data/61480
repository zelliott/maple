zzso plays a pivotal role in the regulation of reproduction in all zzso and binds to nuclear hormone zzso one of zzso zzso zzso Although avian and zzso zzso receptors zzso have been well zzso detail structure and function of zzso zzso zzso in wild zzso is poorly studied zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel zzso zzso from the Korean frog, zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso encodes a protein of 711 zzso acids which shows approximately zzso overall identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso demonstrates that zzso is expressed in all the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that this zzso specifically binds to a zzso response element zzso and transient zzso studies demonstrate that zzso significantly activates the zzso of a zzso containing reporter zzso Finally, zzso zzso demonstrates the zzso of this protein in nucleus, zzso and plasma membrane in zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso encodes a classical zzso zzso and molecular characterization of zzso may provide us new information about the evolution of steroid hormone zzso
