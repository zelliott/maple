Base zzso zzso and zzso are observed at the zzso locus in DNA sequences involved in class switch zzso zzso These zzso are dependent upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and present all the characteristics of the ones observed during V gene zzso zzso zzso that they could be generated by the same zzso zzso It has been proposed, based on the V gene zzso pattern of patients with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome who are deficient in DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso that this zzso could be responsible for a large part of the zzso occurring on zzso zzso Here we show, by analyzing switched memory B cells from two zzso patients, that pol zzso is also an zzso zzso during zzso in both the switch region of tandem repeats as well as upstream of it, thus suggesting that the same zzso zzso zzso are involved, together with zzso in both zzso
