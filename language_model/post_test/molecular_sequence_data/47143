Numerous zzso zzso protein sequences zzso have been reported from zzso However, the relationships among these proteins remain zzso Here, expression of several zzso transcripts in the gut of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso To assess potential functional diversity, multiple zzso zzso sequences were compared with known functional zzso of zzso zzso These zzso included the zzso loop, zzso and zzso zzso and the pro zzso Four groups of zzso were defined based on variable characteristics in the zzso loop region, which incorporates a portion of the zzso zzso Further diversity was observed in zzso acids expected to contribute to the zzso zzso In addition, short signature sequences near the zzso active site region characterized known zzso of zzso from the orders zzso and zzso The criteria established were used to identify two predicted zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as potential zzso and provided a basis to evaluate zzso status of other zzso zzso in the zzso analyzed suggests substantial functional diversity in zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso suggest that the selective amplification and evolution of distinct zzso lineages has contributed to differences in zzso among species and groups of zzso zzso zzso is one potential factor promoting zzso diversification in these zzso
