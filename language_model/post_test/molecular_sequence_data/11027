The human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by one of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso is reported to be essential for zzso gene expression and replication in infected zzso Observations suggest that several cellular factors cooperate with zzso in this zzso zzso binding zzso zzso is reported to be one such cellular factor that specifically suppresses zzso zzso of zzso replication in zzso Here we have cloned a novel factor, zzso interacting protein zzso from the zzso which interacts with mouse zzso zzso contains several zzso zzso sites and zzso with zzso in zzso The fact that zzso activity is altered zzso by the zzso and an additional zzso binding protein has not been reported zzso We provide evidence that expression of zzso enhances the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso Our results suggest that zzso may have a key role in suppressing the zzso zzso
