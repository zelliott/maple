zzso fusion induced by zzso zzso virus zzso requires the action of four viral membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the binding of zzso to one of its zzso such as the zzso entry zzso or zzso The related animal zzso zzso virus zzso encodes a zzso set of zzso and its zzso can also use zzso as an entry zzso We show here that zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso cannot substitute for zzso zzso in inducing fusion with target cells expressing zzso zzso zzso molecules composed of zzso and zzso sequences can substitute, provided the first 285 zzso are from zzso zzso Because the first 261 zzso were sufficient for zzso zzso this suggested that zzso acids zzso contain a region required for cell fusion but not for zzso zzso zzso from zzso acids zzso failed to identify a specific zzso critical for cell fusion, except possibly for zzso acids zzso which also influenced zzso zzso Instead, presence of a flexible stalk between the membrane and zzso domain appears to be required, perhaps to enable zzso changes in zzso on zzso binding and subsequent interactions of undefined regions of zzso with the other zzso required for membrane zzso
