The zzso coli zzso zzso functions in zzso retention and regulation of zzso zzso zzso retention is accomplished via the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the first step of this reaction the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in synthesis of the activated zzso zzso while in the second step this activated zzso is transferred to a unique zzso zzso of the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is accomplished through binding of the zzso to the zzso control region of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso or activated zzso functions as the zzso in this DNA binding zzso The activated zzso is a mixed zzso and thus zzso In efforts to develop tools for structural and zzso studies of the zzso regulatory zzso two zzso of the zzso a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso have been zzso and functionally zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicate that both zzso bind with high affinity to the zzso and that both are inactive in zzso transfer to the zzso zzso zzso studies of their zzso properties indicate that while the zzso is a weak zzso zzso the zzso closely mimics the zzso zzso in zzso of assembly of the zzso repression zzso zzso of these studies also provide further insight into the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso
