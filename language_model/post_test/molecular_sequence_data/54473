Through zzso zzso overly sensitive 3) zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso that are weak zzso of the strong zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso characterization identified zzso insertions in the zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these two weak zzso zzso which results in physical separation of a tandem repeat from the zzso region of the zzso zzso The tandem repeat is approximately zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso and functions as an zzso element to promote reporter gene zzso A putative small zzso target region about zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso is heavily zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is significantly reduced in the small zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso in this region is zzso by small zzso Analysis of zzso expression in zzso suggests that zzso zzso in the putative small zzso target region zzso zzso expression in zzso The DNA zzso zzso zzso has nearly complete loss of total zzso zzso in the putative small zzso target region and is hypersensitive to salt zzso The putative small zzso target region and the tandem repeat are essential for maintaining zzso expression patterns crucial for salt zzso
