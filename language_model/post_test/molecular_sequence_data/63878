The Han Chinese is the largest single ethnic group in the world, consisting of ten Chinese zzso With the exception of the zzso branch, the genetic structure of this group has been studied zzso and Y zzso and zzso zzso data have demonstrated a coherent genetic structure of all Han zzso It is therefore believed that the zzso branch, being members of an old branch of the Han Chinese, despite being scattered in and around zzso Province where members of the zzso and zzso are more prevalent than Han Chinese, is no zzso We have studied 470 individual samples (including 195 zzso from zzso populations and other ethnic groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from six areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the north of the zzso zzso zzso Region of zzso Both zzso and the Y zzso were typed in these zzso High zzso of the Y zzso zzso zzso and zzso which always present at a high frequency among the populations of the southern minorities, were found in zzso zzso Only zzso populations in zzso and zzso maintain the Han frequent zzso zzso zzso lineages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso exhibiting a pattern similar to the neighboring indigenous zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso principal component zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the other Han zzso and other ethnic groups in East Asia indicated that zzso populations are much closer to the southern minorities than to the other Han zzso zzso analyses confirmed this zzso In conclusion, we argue that zzso populations did not descend from Han Chinese, but from southern zzso The ancestral populations of zzso people were assimilated by the Han Chinese in terms of language, culture, and zzso and, consequently, the zzso people became an exceptional branch of Han zzso coherent genetic zzso
