We have constructed a map of the duplicated regions of zzso zzso zzso Seven out of 12 zzso contain an almost identical 9 zzso long segment starting from the zzso This segment is bordered by a long terminal repeat zzso Two of the zzso share sequence similarity that extends over a total of 20 zzso The other zzso also contain duplicated regions of zzso zzso zzso regions contain unique genes and genes from zzso zzso All duplicated segments are in the same orientation with respect to the zzso probably as a result of genetic zzso We map the only two copies of zzso in the zzso in zzso zzso gene sequences that zzso zzso and zzso peptides are associated with the zzso of zzso zzso as in zzso zzso The ubiquity of these sequences in zzso zzso and the propensity they have to zzso proteins with zzso zzso make these genes ideal candidates for fast evolving zzso genes involved in the adaptation of a species to its zzso
