We determined zzso sequences of the nuclear zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso region in 103 individuals of 25 zzso species zzso zzso from 11 locations in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were highly zzso among the species with few zzso The zzso region showed length variation among zzso Both zzso and zzso showed highly varied sequences among zzso The noticeable zzso regions among zzso sequences are present in some zzso species, separating species into two types having long or short zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso possesses both types of zzso in each zzso these results seem to indicate that the zzso type was the zzso and the short type was produced through deletion in many zzso zzso One species, belonging to zzso zzso possessed an zzso sequence in zzso and zzso formed a zzso zzso zzso zzso in a species were not zzso zzso sequence features were observed, enabling molecular identification of zzso zzso
