We show, using gel zzso that crude zzso coli cell extracts contain a protein which binds specifically to DNA fragments carrying either end of the zzso zzso zzso We have identified this protein as zzso a factor involved in several zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that induction of a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso occurs at a lower temperature than that of a zzso strain, and that spontaneous induction of zzso is increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso using either crude extracts or zzso zzso indicate that binding on the left end of zzso occurs at a site which zzso a weak zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso may zzso zzso growth by influencing the binding of zzso or other zzso to the zzso binding zzso in a way similar to its influence on zzso binding in zzso zzso
