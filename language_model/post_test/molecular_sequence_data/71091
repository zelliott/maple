The zzso protein of the budding zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso factor and is associated with the zzso during the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso is not tightly associated with small nuclear zzso particles but is associated with a protein complex consisting of at least eight protein zzso By sequencing components of the zzso complex, we have identified zzso as a component of the zzso complex, zzso zzso could directly interact with zzso and was required for zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso The zzso DNA binding motif at the zzso zzso of zzso was required for cellular growth but not for interaction of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso We have identified a small region of 30 zzso acid zzso near the zzso zzso required for both cell viability and zzso zzso zzso was associated with the zzso in the same manner as zzso zzso zzso with or immediately after zzso of zzso The zzso zzso inhibited binding to the zzso of zzso zzso and at least three other components of the zzso complex, suggesting that the zzso complex is likely associated with the zzso and functions as an integral zzso
