zzso which specifically zzso zzso into zzso plays an important role in the metabolism of zzso Large amounts of zzso are stored in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which are not only vital to their extraordinary stress resistance, but also provide a source of energy for development after zzso is zzso In the present study, a mechanism for the zzso regulation of zzso was described in zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso was identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed only in zzso zzso Further analyses revealed that zzso can bind to a specific zzso segment of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in the release of zzso with coarse shells in which two zzso proteins were zzso Western zzso showed that the level of zzso was increased and zzso was induced in these zzso zzso compared with zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is a key regulator of zzso expression which, in turn, plays an important role in zzso metabolism during the formation of zzso zzso
