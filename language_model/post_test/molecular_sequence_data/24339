The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned gene also allowed growth of a zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicating that it encodes a product able to complement the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso DNA zzso contains a complete zzso of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso shares significant zzso with the products of the zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso A sequence resembling the zzso zzso motif identified in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso gene as the binding site for the zzso zzso factor zzso by the zzso gene was found at the promoter zzso In addition, upstream of the zzso the zzso half of a gene of the same orientation, zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso involved in both zzso processing and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso organization of the zzso gene pair is similar to that found in several other zzso species, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso except that in some of them the zzso gene appears in the reverse zzso
