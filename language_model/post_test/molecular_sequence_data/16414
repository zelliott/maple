A variety of zzso proteins target specific protein zzso C zzso zzso to particular zzso locations or zzso signaling complexes, thereby achieving a high degree of zzso specificity by zzso the zzso in proximity to specific zzso zzso is widely expressed in smooth muscle zzso but little is known about its targeting and zzso zzso We have used a zzso zzso approach to identify zzso proteins in vascular smooth muscle of the rat zzso zzso of approximately 32 and 34 zzso in the zzso fraction were found to bind zzso in a zzso zzso Although of similar molecular weight to zzso a known zzso zzso these proteins were separated from zzso by zzso and differential zzso extraction and were not recognized by an zzso to zzso The zzso proteins were further zzso from the zzso fraction and identified by de zzso sequencing of selected zzso peptides by tandem mass zzso as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Their identity was confirmed by Western zzso with zzso zzso and the demonstration that zzso zzso zzso binds zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso but absence of zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso zzso was specific since no interaction was observed with zzso zzso zzso or zzso Bound zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso was also shown to interact with zzso zzso but not other zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is both an zzso protein and a zzso for activated zzso and other zzso zzso and likely serves to zzso activated zzso that zzso to the nucleus in the vicinity of specific nuclear zzso including zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso have been implicated in regulation of gene zzso stable interaction with zzso zzso may be an important step in this zzso
