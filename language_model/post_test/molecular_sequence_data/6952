zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is selectively recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to this zzso has been shown to be localized in the zzso sequence zzso zzso et zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened to investigate if their vascular and visceral smooth muscles were stained by zzso zzso In all the specimens tested, zzso analysis of tissue extracts zzso with zzso zzso revealed a single zzso chain having the same zzso mobility as bovine alpha zzso zzso The binding to zzso and zzso tissue extracts was inhibited by the synthetic zzso zzso but not zzso as occurs in zzso alpha zzso zzso expression was found in vascular and visceral smooth muscle cells of the species zzso The media of small and large blood vessels was zzso by zzso zzso In the stomach and zzso the outer zzso and inner circular layers of the zzso and of the zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso layer were zzso A more restricted expression of this zzso was detected in turtle zzso zzso zzso visceral smooth muscle cells, which may be related to the involvement of the zzso system in respiratory zzso These data suggest that in zzso evolution alpha zzso zzso arose earlier than previously zzso
