zzso bud zzso zzso zzso by limb bud zzso cells cultured at high density or on collagen zzso This zzso zzso influence has been zzso to function in zzso in regulating the spatial patterning of cartilage and soft zzso tissue in the zzso We have developed a method for preparing zzso medium containing zzso zzso Using a simple zzso we have investigated some characteristics of the zzso products and their effects on limb bud zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso medium was tested on limb bud zzso cells cultured on collagen zzso The zzso influence involves enhanced cell spreading and is alleviated by agents, such as zzso D, that induce cell zzso zzso resembles zzso medium in its ability to inhibit zzso and promote cell spreading in collagen gel cultures of limb bud zzso zzso However, Western zzso analysis shows that the zzso activity of zzso medium is not due to zzso in the zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso domain block the zzso effect of zzso but not that of zzso zzso On the other hand, an zzso to an zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso medium may be zzso by an zzso and by a cell surface zzso zzso zzso but it does not depend directly upon zzso cell zzso
