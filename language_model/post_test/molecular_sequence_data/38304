The transcript zzso factors zzso and zzso of zzso coli are involved in the regulation of zzso zzso The surface charge distribution analysis of their three-dimensional structures revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso contain a small and large basic zzso zzso To zzso the functional role of basic patch, zzso zzso proteins were engineered in which the size and charge distribution of basic patch were modified and characterized zzso We found that zzso zzso lacking basic patch or carrying basic patch of decreased size bind to zzso zzso and induce transcript zzso reaction in minimally zzso zzso zzso complex zzso with the same efficiency as the wild type zzso However, they exhibit substantially lower zzso and zzso activities toward extensively zzso and arrested zzso and display decreased efficiency of zzso to the zzso zzso Unlike wild type factors, basic zzso zzso zzso are unable to complement the zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso The large basic patch is required but not sufficient for the induction of zzso zzso reaction and for the zzso of arrested zzso Our results demonstrate that the basic patch zzso are not directly involved in the induction of transcript zzso reaction and suggest that the primary role of basic patch is to anchor the nascent zzso in zzso These interactions are essential for the zzso and zzso activities of zzso factors and, apparently, for their in zzso zzso
