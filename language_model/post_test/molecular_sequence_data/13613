zzso gene transfer into zzso cells was used as a model for investigating the regulation of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso alpha zzso from rat was introduced into zzso monkey kidney cells, and zzso were selected by their ability to survive in normally zzso zzso of zzso The overall specific activity of zzso in the zzso of zzso was not significantly different from that in control cells, suggesting that there was a partial replacement, rather than an addition, of introduced alpha 1 for the zzso zzso in the functional zzso zzso with specific zzso confirmed the similarities in overall alpha abundance between control and zzso zzso zzso analysis of total zzso however, revealed a higher abundance of the zzso zzso total alpha 1 in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso and introduced zzso compete for a limited amount of zzso with rapid degradation of zzso zzso
