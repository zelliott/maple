In zzso zzso three zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso I and II, the products of the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, are closely related proteins that require partial zzso for activity in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso III is active in zzso without zzso treatment, and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for its zzso In the cell, the three zzso have different zzso zzso zzso I and II make only a small portion, zzso zzso of the cellular zzso In zzso media, zzso zzso I is required for normal zzso zzso zzso II is required for normal zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso III is required for the synthesis of zzso of the cellular zzso including the zzso in the bud scars and lateral zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso III are resistant to zzso and zzso zzso killer zzso they lack zzso zzso and under certain circumstances, they are zzso for zzso The available data suggest that many zzso have more than one zzso zzso and that these zzso are related to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso
