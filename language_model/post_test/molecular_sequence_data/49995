A zzso regulator of the zzso family zzso by zzso zzso was characterized in zzso coli and in zzso zzso the regulator responded specifically to zzso zzso and zzso and was named zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed that zzso binds to an adjacent divergent promoter possessing an zzso zzso region of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso reduced the protein affinity for zzso zzso zzso of four zzso and six zzso zzso of zzso showed that the zzso zzso at positions 77, zzso and zzso zzso in many of the zzso zzso regulators, were essential for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 73, 87, 90, zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso zzso at 90, zzso and 142 were required for full induction by all three zzso
