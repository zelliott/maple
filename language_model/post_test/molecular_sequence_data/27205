zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis is the first zzso protein identified in zzso zzso Although different zzso proteins from zzso share low sequence zzso their zzso zzso structures exhibit highly zzso typical zzso zzso Interestingly, our studies reveal that zzso not only shares low sequence zzso but also presents a totally distinguished structure compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso structure predictions combined with CD and zzso zzso studies all demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data and zzso zzso shift zzso analyses indicate that there is a residual secondary structure at the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the regulatory cap zzso of the zzso that interacts with zzso and brings the zzso to the zzso for zzso In the present paper, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies imply that the zzso of zzso ranging from zzso 30 to 59, binds to zzso probably through a zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis clearly shows that the zzso family belongs to a unique and divergent evolutionary branch, suggesting that it is the most ancient and deeply zzso family among zzso zzso This might explain the structural distinction between zzso and other zzso zzso zzso
