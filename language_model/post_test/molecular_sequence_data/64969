In zzso infection of developing fetus by zzso virus zzso causes cell division zzso of critical precursor cells in zzso zzso birth defects and induction of zzso in cell zzso The underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso abnormalities are not zzso Here, we identified a novel interaction between RV zzso zzso protein and a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso library zzso zzso in zzso and subsequent zzso do occur in specific cell types when the zzso gene is knocked out or, its regulatory function is zzso Our analysis found that full-length zzso binds zzso and in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso Furthermore, during RV infection as well as cellular expression of zzso alone, we identified a discrete zzso of cells containing zzso DNA content, indicating that these cells are arrested in the cell cycle following S phase, suggesting that cellular expression of viral zzso during RV infection zzso zzso Previous reports by others established that RV infection leads to zzso in cell zzso These observations together taken to the fetal zzso level, favor the idea that RV zzso by binding to cellular zzso zzso cell cycle aberrations resulting in the zzso and zzso growth zzso and programmed cell death during RV infection in zzso which commonly is referred to as zzso zzso
