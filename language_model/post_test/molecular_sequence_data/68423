More than 50 zzso zzso genes have been described in the zzso These genes were identified using several different zzso systems and characterized under a variety of experimental zzso The diversity of these approaches has made it difficult to compare results and identify common responses to the zzso As a first step toward characterizing the zzso regulation of these genes by zzso we have examined their zzso activity throughout third zzso zzso and zzso development using a single collection of staged zzso We see four coordinate changes in zzso gene activity during third zzso zzso development, at zzso zzso approximately 100 zzso zzso zzso and approximately 114 zzso after egg zzso A dramatic transition in gene expression occurs at zzso formation, after which the zzso zzso pulse zzso successive waves of zzso Our results suggest that several increases in the zzso zzso during third zzso zzso and zzso development program a precise zzso progression of gene activity that could direct the appropriate behavioral and zzso changes at the onset of zzso
