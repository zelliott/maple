It is generally accepted that zzso sexual selection drives rapid divergence of zzso zzso among isolated zzso The mode of selection operating upon zzso can be explored by comparing patterns of population divergence in genetic and zzso zzso We collected zzso zzso zzso from eight localities across the species zzso zzso of zzso genetic zzso at zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene were very zzso Following geometric zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to be highly divergent among the populations surveyed, whereas head zzso had not zzso as zzso However, zzso comparisons of zzso and zzso showed that zzso divergence in both zzso and head shape was significantly lower than that experienced by neutral genetic zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso are currently experiencing a period of stabilizing selection, the mode of selection expected for zzso that function in species recognition via a zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that although zzso zzso can clearly diverge among genetically isolated zzso divergence is not necessarily as rapid as commonly argued, and continuous directional sexual selection may not always zzso the evolutionary divergence of male zzso
