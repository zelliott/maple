zzso zzso are short zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso which inhibit zzso expression and replication by blocking the binding of the zzso regulatory protein zzso to the authentic zzso zzso In previous studies, zzso zzso expressed from a zzso zzso promoter were moderately effective at zzso zzso in isolated human T cell lines and less effective at zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso T zzso In this study, a series of modifications was introduced into the zzso expression cassette in order to improve their zzso These modifications included the addition of sequences which are predicted to have zzso secondary structures and addition of a zzso zzso processing zzso zzso decoy zzso expressed in zzso cells from modified zzso expression zzso yielded five- to zzso more zzso transcripts than unmodified zzso expression zzso zzso zzso as measured by a flow zzso method to zzso zzso viral zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso populations of zzso cells expressing a modified zzso transcript that contains a zzso zzso processing site and zzso zzso and 3' to the zzso zzso Similar modifications to the zzso expression cassette also increased the zzso concentration of a random test zzso indicating that this improved expression system may also be useful for zzso and zzso based gene zzso zzso
