zzso of viral DNA into a zzso of the infected host cell is required for efficient replication of a zzso zzso and this reaction is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso As IN plays a pivotal role in establishing infection during the early stages of the zzso life cycle, it is an attractive target for therapeutic zzso However, the lack of effective zzso drug therapy against this zzso has led to the testing of other novel approaches towards its zzso In these studies, a panel of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso IN zzso has been used in the construction of zzso variable zzso fragments zzso The zzso zzso produced by these zzso and derived zzso bind to different zzso within zzso We now demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso which bind to IN zzso and zzso zzso results in resistance to productive zzso zzso This zzso of zzso replication is observed with zzso localized in either the zzso or nuclear compartment of the zzso The expression of zzso zzso in human zzso cells and peripheral blood zzso cells appears to specifically neutralize IN activity prior to integration and, thus, has an effect on the integration process zzso These data support our previous studies with an zzso reverse zzso zzso and demonstrate further that zzso expressed zzso can gain access to viral proteins of the zzso zzso zzso This panel of zzso IN zzso also provides the tools with which to dissect the molecular zzso directly involved in integration within zzso zzso
