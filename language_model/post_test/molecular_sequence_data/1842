zzso contain several zzso zzso zzso whose products show sequence similarities to zzso found in complex I zzso zzso of zzso and zzso However, it is still unclear whether the zzso zzso gene products actually form a single large protein complex or exist as smaller independent zzso To address this, we have constructed a strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the C zzso of the zzso zzso was fused to an zzso tag to aid zzso Three major zzso complexes were resolved by blue native zzso gel zzso with approximate apparent molecular masses of zzso zzso and 110 zzso zzso sequencing and mass zzso revealed that the zzso complex contained ten zzso zzso gene zzso zzso fragmentation experiments indicated that the zzso complex was composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to that found in the minimal form of complex I found in zzso coli, except that the electron input module was not zzso The difference in size between the zzso and zzso complexes is attributed to differences in the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the complex, either zzso or zzso zzso We have also detected the presence of two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are unrelated to zzso in the zzso complex I but which have zzso in the closely related zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso The presence of these additional zzso might reflect the use by the zzso and zzso complexes of a different, so far unidentified, electron input zzso
