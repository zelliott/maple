The zzso of zzso and zzso fatty acid binding proteins zzso and zzso was detected during hibernation in brown zzso tissue zzso of zzso ground zzso zzso zzso using a commercial rat zzso zzso Full length zzso zzso zzso and zzso were subsequently retrieved from a BAT zzso zzso These zzso were used to probe Northern blots of total zzso from zzso of zzso versus zzso ground zzso zzso zzso transcripts increased in zzso skeletal muscle and heart of zzso animals whereas zzso zzso which are normally expressed exclusively in zzso zzso increased in both BAT and heart during zzso It is proposed that the increased expression of zzso and zzso during hibernation zzso the rate at which fatty acids can be transported to the zzso for zzso particularly in support of the huge increase in zzso by BAT and rapid increase in heart rate that are required during zzso from zzso zzso of the deduced zzso sequence of ground zzso zzso with that from other zzso also revealed three unique zzso acid differences which may be important for protein function at low body temperatures during zzso
