A high sensitivity method for detecting low level zzso is under zzso A zzso reaction is performed in which a restriction site is introduced in zzso DNA by zzso of specific zzso zzso of zzso DNA by the zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso for products with zzso within the recognition zzso After zzso zzso are identified by a zzso detection reaction zzso This zzso zzso was initially used to detect zzso error in known zzso zzso zzso error was measured in low zzso K zzso buffers containing zzso zzso and zzso as well as otherwise identical buffers containing zzso zzso conditions were zzso to minimize zzso error using perfect match zzso at the zzso I site in the zzso tumor zzso gene at zzso zzso However, since zzso do not always occur within pre-existing restriction sites, a generalized zzso method requires the introduction of a new restriction zzso In principle, zzso with mismatch zzso can alter specific bases in a sequence and generate a new restriction zzso However, extension from 3' mismatch zzso may generate zzso zzso We tested conversion of the zzso I zzso site to a zzso I site zzso zzso was unsuccessful using a natural base T mismatch primer zzso zzso was successful when modified zzso containing the 6 zzso H zzso zzso c zzso zzso base at zzso were used in three cycles of zzso zzso prior to conversion zzso using the 3' natural base T zzso The ability of the zzso analog zzso to access both a zzso and zzso zzso appears to greatly facilitate the zzso
