The zzso zzso early region 3 zzso zzso of zzso zzso binds major zzso zzso class I zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso I complex is retained in the zzso through an zzso retention signal at the zzso of zzso This retention of class I zzso blocks zzso of zzso cells by zzso T zzso zzso Animal models infected with Ad zzso lacking zzso support a role for zzso in zzso a zzso zzso zzso binds with different zzso to different class I zzso and portions of the zzso sequence are highly variable among Ad zzso in different zzso zzso 11, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso this raises the possibility that certain human individuals may be more susceptible to productive or persistent infection by particular zzso of zzso depending on the zzso of the individual and the type of zzso To begin to address this possibility, the zzso gene from 17 very diverse zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction, and the DNA sequences were zzso The zzso zzso sequence was zzso identical to that of zzso Surprisingly, we found complete conservation of the zzso acid sequence of zzso from all but one of the clinical zzso one isolate had a conservative Ala to Val zzso zzso from zzso clinical zzso representing distinct zzso zzso zzso with class I zzso Our data indicate that there is very strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the sequence of zzso in zzso The only known function for zzso from different Ad zzso is binding to class I zzso It is interesting to consider, therefore, what selective pressure operates to maintain the sequence of zzso among zzso within a zzso and yet allows for very significant divergence in the sequence of zzso among zzso in different zzso The possible role of zzso class I zzso in this selection process is zzso
