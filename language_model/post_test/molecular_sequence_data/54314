The zzso loop is a unique structure in the domain III of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the role of zzso loop on zzso activity of zzso toxin was zzso 10 zzso in zzso loop were zzso with zzso using zzso zzso zzso All zzso were capable of producing zzso crystal and expressing a protein sized zzso The zzso zzso and zzso enhanced toxicity against zzso zzso larvae dramatically, while most of the rest zzso possess a reduced toxicity at different zzso Indoor zzso result revealed that zzso zzso and zzso had a zzso and zzso increasing in toxicity against zzso zzso larvae compared with the zzso strain, zzso On the contrary, zzso experienced a significant reduced zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein demonstrated that the side chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extended to the surface of the zzso and might participate in the interaction between the protein and its zzso whereas side chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso preferred the inside of the zzso and which might be critical to the stability of the protein zzso Our study for the first time clarified the special properties and the functions of the zzso loop in domain III of zzso These findings also provided the latest biological evidence for the recognition and binding mechanism of the domain III in zzso and its role in maintaining the structure stability of zzso
