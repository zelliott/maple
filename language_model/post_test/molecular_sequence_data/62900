zzso root formation, the primary way plants increase their root mass, displays zzso plasticity in response to environmental zzso The zzso lateral root formation zzso zzso blocks the initiation of lateral roots, thus greatly altering root system zzso We have zzso cloned the zzso gene and have further characterized its zzso The zzso zzso protein is zzso among plants and has no similarities to proteins from other zzso The gene is present in a single copy in zzso Using zzso reporters for zzso gene zzso we have determined that the zzso protein is nuclear localized and that the gene is expressed in most plant zzso however, zzso expression and zzso zzso location are not regulated by zzso These findings taken together with further genetic and zzso characterization of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso functions independent from zzso signaling and instead functions in maintaining the zzso in the zzso competent state needed for lateral root zzso Our results provide genetic evidence that the zzso shares properties with zzso and that this tissue plays a central role in creating the zzso plasticity needed for root system zzso
