zzso X syndrome is the most common form of zzso mental zzso caused by the loss of function of the fragile X mental zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein involved in zzso transport and/or zzso zzso However, the binding specificity between zzso and its various partners including interacting proteins and zzso targets is essentially zzso Previous work demonstrated that zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso is structurally and functionally zzso with its zzso zzso Here, we perform a forward genetic screen and isolate 26 zzso zzso at 13 zzso acid zzso in the zzso coding zzso Interestingly, all zzso zzso identified affect highly zzso zzso in the N terminal of zzso zzso and zzso analyses reveal altered zzso and synaptic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso analyses of interaction with zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso in the nervous system demonstrate that some of the zzso disrupt specific zzso zzso Thus, our zzso analyses establish that the N zzso of zzso is critical for its zzso zzso
