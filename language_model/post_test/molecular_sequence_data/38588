zzso zzso from bovine zzso was zzso characterized as a zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso It was found that zzso bovine zzso zzso and a synthetic bovine zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso at the positions zzso had a high affinity to a zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso of zzso were bound to a zzso of zzso with a binding constant of zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso acid zzso induced a zzso change of zzso In addition, the zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso was found to be responsible for binding to zzso because zzso no binding of zzso and two zzso zzso to zzso was zzso and zzso a synthetic fluorinated zzso zzso and zzso zzso were bound significantly to zzso A similar binding of zzso to human zzso zzso was also observed under the same experimental zzso Data provided here suggest that zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and zzso the specific binding of zzso to zzso may zzso the zzso activity of zzso in zzso
