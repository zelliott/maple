zzso proteins function in the recruitment of proteins for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we studied the role of zzso a zzso zzso protein of the tomato pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a significant delay in the production of zzso symptoms on tomato plants and was impaired in invasive growth on zzso zzso and on living plant zzso To search for target proteins recruited by zzso a combination of sodium zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso was used to compare proteins in zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso approach identified 41 proteins differing significantly in abundance between the two zzso 17 of which were more abundant in the zzso zzso suggesting a possible regulation by zzso zzso Interestingly, several of the identified proteins were related to zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an impairment of the zzso strain in directional growth and in the structure of the zzso suggesting a role of zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso regulates protein turnover and zzso in zzso
