zzso zzso in zzso tissue culture cells has detected the binding of a zzso protein at zzso of the zzso zzso zzso start site, on a zzso direct repeat motif abutting a zzso positioned over the inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso the active promoter is bound by a zzso initiation zzso We have characterized and zzso a protein zzso that binds specifically to this direct repeat motif zzso present at zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso start zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that both direct repeats interact in zzso with a nuclear protein of approximately 120 zzso zzso We zzso zzso through multiple rounds of zzso DNA affinity zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso 120 zzso zzso binds the zzso motif efficiently as a zzso or zzso In zzso zzso of zzso activity with the zzso motif by transient zzso competitions in different zzso cell lines suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso has been detected zzso in zzso but is functional in zzso as a zzso DNA binding protein and zzso only in the cells that have the inactive zzso zzso We discuss the possibility that an zzso process is required for zzso protein to bind DNA and function in zzso
