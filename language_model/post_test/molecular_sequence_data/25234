We have studied the elements involved in the zzso zzso zzso extinction of zzso zzso We show that zzso driven by a zzso pair DNA zzso of the zzso promoter of the human zzso zzso gene is zzso upon zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso of the DNA binding activity of zzso factors involved in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso promoter showed zzso a zzso expression of the zzso binding proteins and zzso a decrease in DNA binding activity of two zzso factors, zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso was zzso after 1 h of zzso treatment whereas zzso was zzso at the protein and zzso levels only after 5 h of zzso zzso These results suggest that different zzso acting via different zzso factors, are involved in the zzso extinction of zzso zzso
