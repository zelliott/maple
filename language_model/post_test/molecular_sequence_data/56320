We have examined the chicken Very Low zzso zzso II zzso zzso gene locus in transgenic zzso A DNA zzso composed of the transcribed region, 16 zzso of zzso zzso and 400 zzso of 3' zzso sequences contained all the information sufficient for zzso zzso expression of the zzso II zzso The zzso region contains a zzso zzso zzso coinciding with a zzso site at zzso zzso In transgenic mice, the zzso at zzso zzso is used for zzso the expression to a lower maximum zzso The zzso might be used for modulating zzso II gene zzso and may be involved in the rapid zzso of the expression after hormone zzso
