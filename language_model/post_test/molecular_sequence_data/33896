zzso in zzso within the zzso zzso are implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso neurotransmitter and an important member in the zzso zzso To explore the role of zzso zzso in genetic zzso of zzso syndrome, we carried out the genetic and functional characterization of sequence zzso in zzso zzso which encodes the main zzso zzso in zzso in individuals with zzso zzso syndrome zzso and normal controls zzso 

zzso regions of zzso gene were screened using zzso zzso strand zzso zzso followed by direct zzso zzso zzso were zzso by restriction zzso zzso and studied using zzso zzso zzso and membrane protein pull-down for zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso involving a highly zzso zzso zzso was identified in 11 zzso individuals with zzso syndrome and four in the zzso The zzso frequency for zzso was zzso folds higher in the zzso syndrome zzso compared with the control cohort zzso although the difference did not reach statistical significance in the current zzso zzso A zzso zzso showed that zzso conveys a significant increase zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso membrane pull-down analysis showed a similar increase zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein in the membrane fraction of zzso zzso cells compared with that in the wild type zzso 

These results indicate that zzso is a functional zzso zzso that is presented in a small number of individuals with zzso zzso Further studies on possible changes in zzso transport in the zzso of zzso syndrome are zzso
