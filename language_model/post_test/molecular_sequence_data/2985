zzso contain several zzso zzso proteins or peptides zzso that exert zzso action against zzso These zzso antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria by zzso zzso zzso interest in their activity has been generated in recent years due not only to their likely important role in innate host defense against infection, but also their possible use as therapeutic agents in treating infections caused by zzso zzso We have studied the zzso properties of human zzso zzso G zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso zzso contains at least three zzso regions that by themselves can exert zzso action against zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso Only one of these zzso defined by zzso zzso of full-length cat G, has zzso action against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Due to the zzso zzso action of this zzso we have sought to define the zzso acids within its primary sequence required for this activity and have developed zzso with improved zzso This review emphasizes the importance of both zzso and zzso as necessary characteristics for the zzso action of zzso It also proposes the strategy that naturally occurring large human zzso can be dissected to smaller zzso and then modified to enhance their activity in zzso This approach could prove beneficial to those interested in developing zzso peptides as therapeutic zzso
