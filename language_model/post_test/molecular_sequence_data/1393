The zzso hormone zzso regulates a diverse set of genes that control processes from embryonic development to adult zzso Upon binding of zzso hormone, the zzso zzso releases zzso proteins and zzso a zzso change that allows for the interaction of zzso proteins necessary for gene zzso This interaction is zzso by a zzso zzso termed the zzso box, found in many zzso Recent work has demonstrated that zzso assembled zzso complexes can elicit specific biological zzso However, the mechanism for the selective assembly of these zzso complexes has yet to be zzso To further understand the principles underlying zzso zzso zzso we designed a zzso in zzso binding zzso to measure the equilibrium affinity of zzso zzso to a library of potential zzso in the presence of different zzso including the zzso zzso hormone zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using this zzso method several zzso zzso boxes capable of zzso with zzso zzso at zzso relevant zzso were identified including ones found in traditional zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and those in zzso known to repress gene zzso including zzso and zzso In addition, it was discovered that the zzso zzso binding patterns vary with zzso and that this differential binding can be used to predict biological zzso Finally, it is demonstrated that this is a general method that can be applied to other nuclear receptors and can be used to establish rules for nuclear zzso zzso
