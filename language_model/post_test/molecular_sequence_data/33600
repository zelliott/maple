Abstract zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso recycling reaction for most higher zzso To date, studies on zzso in higher plants have focused largely on zzso and agricultural plants, and there is virtually no information on the molecular characteristics of zzso in zzso The present study reports the cloning and characteristics of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso ex zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein of 215 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The predicted 3-D structure of zzso showed a typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction revealed that the zzso was a zzso expression gene in zzso zzso The expression level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso did not show significant change under high temperature zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli following zzso with affinity zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity zzso zzso per zzso and high affinity (a zzso of zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso was a zzso zzso and retained zzso of its initial activity at 55 degrees zzso The present study is the first to provide a detailed molecular characterization of the zzso in zzso zzso
