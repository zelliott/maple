The functional characteristics of zzso C4 zzso zzso which specifically zzso zzso A4 with zzso were assessed by zzso zzso Human zzso and the zzso protein share substantial zzso acid identity and predicted secondary zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso zzso the zzso function, whereas the zzso of zzso to His or zzso provides a fully active zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso also markedly reduces zzso function and increases the optimum for zzso zzso The deletion of the third zzso domain with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity, and function is restored by the substitution of the third zzso domain and zzso zzso of zzso protein for that of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso alone or together and the deletion of zzso and zzso of zzso do not alter zzso zzso The direct linkage of two zzso zzso by a zzso acid bridge provides an active zzso and the same bridging of inactive zzso with a zzso zzso creates an active zzso with function similar to that of the zzso zzso These results suggest that in the zzso function of zzso zzso probably opens the zzso ring and zzso provides the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso has independent zzso activity, and zzso of zzso maintains the proper protein zzso
