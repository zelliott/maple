A zzso zzso gene from a zzso zzso reference strain was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso It zzso a zzso zzso class D zzso zzso that shared zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso This work suggests that zzso zzso may produce the zzso of zzso compromising the efficacy of zzso in clinically relevant zzso zzso
