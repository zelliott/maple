This work reports the cloning and sequence determination of the horse alpha zzso of the zzso zzso a marker of zzso zzso A zzso clone of zzso base pairs was zzso It encodes a protein segment of zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso domain with 10 potential sites of zzso a zzso domain of 32 zzso and a zzso zzso tail of 24 zzso A zzso analysis of this zzso shows close similarity zzso with that of zzso zzso
