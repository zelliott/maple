zzso cloning experiments with restriction zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso 1, which expresses high levels of zzso into the zzso cloning zzso gave a zzso zzso zzso which zzso four entire zzso zzso zzso an zzso family zzso and zzso of unknown zzso The deduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso shared structural and functional zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The overlapping promoter organization of zzso and zzso although much shorter in zzso zzso than in the other zzso species, suggested similar zzso regulatory zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso coli zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso containing either zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso and induction experiments showed that the zzso gene of zzso zzso 1 was zzso in the presence of zzso and was activated when a zzso zzso was zzso Moreover, transformation of zzso zzso 1 or of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso containing zzso from zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso for zzso zzso 1, thus underlining the role of an zzso protein in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso Fifteen other zzso zzso clinical zzso with zzso of either low-level zzso zzso expression or high-level zzso zzso expression zzso the same zzso organization, with the zzso and zzso genes surrounding zzso the organization of these genes thus differed from those of zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are located downstream from the zzso zzso Finally, an identical zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as being zzso zzso in zzso zzso and this is zzso evidence of a zzso origin of the zzso zzso
