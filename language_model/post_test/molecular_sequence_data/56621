We have examined zzso I hypersensitive sites in the zzso region of the rat zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso We have found two zzso zzso sites in regions that map between zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso from the cap zzso Both hypersensitive sites are found in zzso plasmids but not in linear or relaxed DNA zzso The position of the hypersensitive sites of the zzso sequence of the rat zzso zzso gene in zzso plasmids correlate with the zzso sites first determined by Becker et zzso The hypersensitive regions in the zzso plasmids include the zzso zzso sites in zzso but extend somewhat upstream and downstream from zzso Computer analysis of the zzso DNA region of the gene suggests that the DNA zzso spanning zzso zzso to zzso forms a potential hairpin loop with 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso on zzso plasmids carrying the zzso region of the rat zzso zzso gene suppresses both in zzso zzso zzso zzso We have also shown that the DNA region containing the zzso zzso zzso site in the position between zzso and zzso zzso from the cap site may form zzso after zzso with zzso
