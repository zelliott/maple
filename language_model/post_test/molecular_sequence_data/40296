zzso are zzso channels that facilitate the zzso of water and small, zzso zzso molecules across cellular zzso One distinct zzso zzso contains pure water channels, whereas a second zzso contains channels that conduct small zzso such as zzso in addition to zzso zzso between these zzso is central to zzso function, though the contributions of protein structural motifs required for selectivity are not yet fully zzso To address this question, we zzso engineered three signature zzso acids of the zzso zzso into the zzso coli water channel zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso channels showed a decrease in water zzso but not the expected increase in zzso zzso Using X-ray zzso we determined the atomic resolution structures of the zzso zzso The structures revealed a channel surprisingly similar in size to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with measured rates of transport showed that, as the size of the selectivity filter region of the channel approaches that of water, channel zzso dominated water zzso zzso In contrast, the major zzso of selectivity for larger zzso molecules such as zzso was channel zzso zzso Finally, we find that, although the selectivity filter region is indeed central to zzso zzso other structural elements that do not directly interact with the zzso such as the loop connecting zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso between zzso C4 and zzso play an essential role in zzso zzso
