Alzheimer's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized zzso by a loss of zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso While most previous studies on the zzso of zzso have focused on zzso cells and direct zzso zzso few have focused on the role of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso In the present study zzso oxide release from cultured rat zzso was examined by exposing the cells to synthetic zzso peptides zzso zzso and beta zzso alone and in combination with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 100, 500, or 1000 zzso Assessment of zzso release of zzso oxide was based on the zzso zzso for zzso in the culture medium and zzso for zzso oxide zzso Of the zzso tested, only zzso zzso zzso induced zzso oxide release from zzso beta zzso did not stimulate zzso oxide release by itself, but it did induce zzso oxide release when zzso with zzso zzso 500, and 1000 zzso In contrast, beta zzso did induce zzso release of zzso oxide by itself, and this effect was enhanced significantly by zzso with zzso zzso zzso These findings warrant a further investigation into the role of zzso in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease via zzso oxide toxicity induced by the synergistic action of zzso and a zzso zzso
