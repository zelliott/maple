zzso zzso cell signaling pathways play fundamental roles in many aspects of plant growth and zzso A pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to activate the cell separation process that leads to organ zzso Another pair of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso act as zzso of zzso potentially by modulating zzso zzso zzso of these zzso to and from the cell surface may be regulated by zzso zzso a membrane trafficking regulator that is essential for organ zzso We report here the characterization of CAST AWAY zzso a zzso zzso zzso that acts as a spatial inhibitor of cell zzso zzso of zzso suppresses the zzso defects of zzso zzso flowers and restores the discrete identity of the zzso network in zzso zzso zzso After organ zzso enlarged zzso zones with obscured boundaries are found in zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is a zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso at its zzso zzso promotes association with the plasma zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have detected interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso at the plasma membrane of zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso regulates cell separation signaling directly and zzso A model zzso the potential roles of zzso zzso signaling and membrane trafficking during organ separation is zzso
