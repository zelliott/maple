zzso an abundant storage protein in soybean seeds, is comprised of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of genes zzso these zzso is zzso and temporally regulated in soybean zzso Both the zzso and zzso genes have been isolated and fully or partially characterized by DNA sequence zzso Each has been transferred to transgenic plants and was found to be expressed in zzso and tobacco plants in a regulated manner as in soybean zzso Both the zzso and zzso proteins were accumulated only in transgenic seeds during zzso stages of seed development and assembled into zzso forms with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso genes were also introduced on the same zzso into transgenic zzso When the promoters of the two genes were zzso to each other, there was an increase in the expression of the zzso zzso suggesting that there is a strong zzso sequence in the zzso zzso that can affect expression of the zzso zzso A series of deletion zzso was constructed in the zzso promoter, and each was introduced into zzso zzso The DNA sequence approximately 250 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site contains sufficient regulatory information for expression of the zzso zzso The sequence about 200 zzso upstream contains four zzso repeats A zzso that may play an important role in regulating expression of the zzso The function of this DNA sequence zzso to zzso was tested in a zzso gene construct containing the zzso zzso promoter, the zzso coding zzso and the 3' zzso region of the zzso zzso A dramatic enhancement of the zzso gene expression (at least zzso resulted when this DNA sequence was inserted into the zzso promoter at a position 90 zzso upstream of the zzso start site, regardless of the orientation of the zzso There was a two- to zzso enhancement when the element was placed zzso to the zzso coding region and no enhancement when placed downstream of the 3' zzso zzso The enhancement was observed only in seeds during zzso stages of seed zzso This indicates that the zzso DNA sequence can function as a strong zzso element that controls zzso and temporally regulated gene zzso This element is defined as a zzso and zzso regulated element zzso
