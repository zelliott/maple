Human zzso stem cells zzso can be genetically modified with viral zzso and hold promise as a cell source for zzso medicine, yet how zzso respond to viral zzso zzso remains poorly zzso leaving the safety concerns zzso Here, we explored the responses of zzso against an emerging DNA viral zzso zzso zzso and discovered that zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso genes associated with five signaling zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso a zzso that generally recognizes zzso zzso was apparently zzso by zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso array data showed that zzso zzso triggered robust zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not of other inflammatory zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso activated the signaling molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factor 3) downstream of zzso while zzso the zzso gene with small interfering zzso considerably abolished zzso expression and promoted cell zzso These data zzso for the first time, that a DNA viral zzso can activate the zzso zzso in zzso and lead to a zzso expression profile distinct from that in immune zzso These findings underscore the importance of evaluating whether the zzso signaling cascade plays roles in the immune response provoked by other DNA zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso barely disturbed surface marker expression and induced only transient and mild zzso responses, thereby easing the safety concerns of using zzso for zzso zzso
