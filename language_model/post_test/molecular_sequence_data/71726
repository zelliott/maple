In zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were converted into zzso To assess whether zzso peptides could be produced during zzso zzso zzso zzso was cultured in batch in zzso media containing 5 or zzso zzso dehydrated zzso for 20 h and then was in zzso mode for 50 zzso After harvesting the biomass zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso at zzso zzso the zzso was analyzed to determine protein consumption and zzso production by zzso The proteins in the zzso showed an zzso degradation with a constant increase in the production of zzso Four major zzso were collected and were analyzed by zzso mass zzso zzso of fermented peptides were compared with sequences of known zzso zzso On the basis of their molecular zzso two zzso acid sequences were zzso The presence of sites containing the zzso sequence of zzso zzso suggests that these zzso may have zzso zzso
