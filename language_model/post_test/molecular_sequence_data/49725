zzso from many diverse organisms play a number of important roles during the development of the nervous zzso zzso knowing the molecules that control zzso cell function will further our understanding of the mechanisms that control nervous system zzso We have isolated a novel gene in zzso zzso that is expressed in a subset of the peripheral zzso We call this gene zzso zzso zzso as the zzso that express this gene do so during a time when they mark the entry and exit point of zzso at the zzso zzso This subset of peripheral zzso act as intermediate targets during zzso and migration of the sensory zzso in zzso Fire exit has been cloned and found to zzso a novel zzso zzso Fire exit belongs to a group of proteins identified in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso databases which contain four predicted zzso zzso and a shared zzso zzso zzso that remove the fire exit protein have no obvious disruption to zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso expressing the Fire exit gene bridge the transition zone between zzso and zzso and play a role in sensory zzso zzso zzso it appears that, while the zzso that express this protein mediate zzso guidance, Fire exit itself plays a zzso part in this zzso A role for Fire exit in zzso development may be suggested by its evolutionary relationship to a family of zzso proteins called zzso and suggests that Fire exit may function in zzso transport during zzso zzso
