A zzso number zzso gene of the zzso zzso lethal zzso zzso was isolated and named zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso gene was located on zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso activity was contained in a zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso DNA zzso was determined and turned out to be identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso A binding site for zzso Factor 1 was located in the coding sequence of the zzso zzso which has been known to be a part of the B domain of zzso autonomously replicating sequence 1 zzso Our results suggest that zzso might be important for the zzso of the zzso zzso gene in addition to having important roles in the stimulation of replication at the zzso zzso
