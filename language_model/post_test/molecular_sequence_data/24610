The zzso maintenance zzso zzso a family of six zzso zzso found in all zzso are essential for DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso Delta H contains a single zzso of zzso with zzso properties similar to those of the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein contains a putative zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, the roles of the zinc finger domain in zzso function were examined using zzso zzso and zzso proteins expressed and zzso from zzso zzso The protein with a zzso in the zinc motif forms a zzso complex similar to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, is impaired in zzso zzso activity and zzso DNA zzso and it does not possess zzso zzso These results illustrate the importance of the zzso domain for zzso zzso function and suggest a role for zinc binding in the zzso zzso complex as well, since four out of the six zzso zzso proteins contain a similar zzso zzso
