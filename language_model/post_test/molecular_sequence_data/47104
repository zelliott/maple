It has been reported that the region zzso of the zzso protein from brown zzso tissue zzso zzso has an important role in the control of its zzso zzso zzso Thus the deletion of zzso zzso leads to the loss of the zzso regulation of the zzso while the complete deletion of the segment leads to the formation of a zzso The region displays sequence zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The present report analyzes the structure, by zzso and circular zzso of a 20 zzso acid zzso zzso containing the zzso of zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso adopt an zzso zzso The zzso is at the zzso end of the sixth zzso zzso The functional significance of this zzso has been examined by zzso zzso of the protein expressed zzso in zzso zzso in the structure or orientation of the region leads to an impairment of the regulation, by zzso and fatty zzso of the transport zzso zzso is one member of the family formed by the carriers of the zzso inner zzso The family is characterized by a zzso structure with three repeated segments of about 100 zzso acid zzso Two of the zzso have also been performed in the first and second zzso zzso and the effect on zzso function is very zzso We conclude that the three zzso zzso contribute to the formation of the gating domain in zzso and propose that they form a zzso pocket that zzso the zzso zzso of the bound zzso
