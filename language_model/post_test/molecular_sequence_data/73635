The zzso gene family is a family of divergent zzso genes which are related to the zzso zzso zzso gene and has been reported to be expressed primarily in the zzso and zzso zzso We have previously identified a new member of this family, zzso We now report that this gene is expressed in normal zzso cells and leukemia cell lines with zzso zzso We used an zzso zzso targeted against the translation start site of zzso zzso to inhibit its expression in a human zzso cell line zzso which expresses zzso at a high zzso The zzso zzso efficiently reduced the zzso zzso while control zzso including a zzso zzso identical to the zzso sequence except for four zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression decreased the zzso efficiency by approximately zzso compared with zzso The zzso treatment caused zzso as shown by the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso treatment was associated with a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso is expressed in zzso cells and that the zzso of its expression results in the decreased levels of zzso and zzso zzso with an accompanying induction of zzso
