Eastern zzso encephalitis virus zzso is a zzso virus that can cause both human and zzso encephalitis with high case fatality zzso zzso can also be widespread among birds, including zzso ostriches, zzso zzso zzso cranes and zzso The zzso protein of zzso and other zzso is an important zzso protein that elicits zzso of diagnostic zzso While many therapeutic and diagnostic applications of zzso zzso zzso have been reported, the specific zzso on zzso protein recognized by the zzso responses of different susceptible zzso including avian species, remain poorly zzso In the present study, the avian zzso zzso zzso zzso response was mapped to linear zzso zzso using zzso zzso in chickens and ducks following zzso with zzso zzso zzso protein and a series of 42 partially overlapping peptides covering the entire zzso zzso zzso We identified 12 and 13 peptides recognized by the chicken and duck zzso response, zzso Six of these linear peptides were commonly recognized by zzso zzso in both avian zzso Among them five zzso recognized by both zzso the zzso located at zzso acids zzso and zzso were zzso among the zzso zzso complex, but not other associated zzso whereas the zzso at zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso were specific to zzso zzso zzso The five common zzso zzso were not recognized by avian zzso against Avian zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The identification and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso may be aid the development of diagnostic tools and facilitate the design of zzso vaccines for zzso These results also offer information with which to study the structure of zzso zzso zzso
