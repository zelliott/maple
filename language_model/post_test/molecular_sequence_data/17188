The blends of flavor compounds produced by fruits serve as biological zzso used to attract living zzso including zzso They include hundreds of zzso and vary in their characteristic fruit flavor zzso The molecular mechanisms by which fruit flavor and aroma compounds are gained and lost during evolution and zzso are largely zzso Here, we report on processes that may have been responsible for the evolution of diversity in zzso zzso zzso fruit flavor zzso Whereas the zzso profile of cultivated zzso species is dominated by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso fruit of wild zzso species emit mainly zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are not found in the cultivated zzso We used zzso zzso analysis to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in cultivated zzso and showed that the zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli cells is capable of generating both zzso and zzso when supplied with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of additional genes that are very similar to zzso from both the wild and cultivated zzso species zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that only zzso is exclusively present and highly expressed in the fruit of cultivated zzso zzso It encodes a protein truncated at its N zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso experiments suggest that a change in zzso zzso led to the zzso zzso encountering both zzso and zzso allowing it to produce zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso affected the expression of a zzso zzso gene that differs from that in the cultivated species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It encodes an zzso capable of catalyzing the zzso of the typical wild species zzso such as zzso and zzso and caused the loss of these compounds in the cultivated zzso The loss of zzso also further influenced the fruit flavor profile because it was no longer available as a zzso for the production of the downstream compounds zzso and zzso zzso This phenomenon was demonstrated by cloning and characterizing a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso that encodes the zzso catalyzing the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso The findings shed light on the molecular evolutionary mechanisms resulting in different flavor profiles that are eventually selected for in zzso zzso
