The zzso screening of a zzso zzso expression library prepared from an adult T cell leukemia zzso cell line, zzso was performed with zzso class zzso in the serum of an ATL patient by the zzso method to analyze the repertoire of zzso molecules in zzso Ten different zzso 7 previously reported and 3 newly identified, were zzso One of the identified zzso was zzso to the recently reported zzso zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso zzso a protein binding to a possible zzso element of the long terminal repeat of the human T zzso virus type I zzso The obtained zzso was expressed as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso protein was prepared by subsequent treatment of the fusion protein with zzso zzso of zzso serum samples from ATL patients, zzso zzso carriers and normal donors against the zzso protein was examined by Western zzso zzso zzso out of 30 samples zzso from ATL patients, zzso samples zzso from zzso carriers and zzso samples zzso from healthy donors showed positive zzso indicating the zzso of zzso The development of ATL may be related to higher production of zzso against zzso
