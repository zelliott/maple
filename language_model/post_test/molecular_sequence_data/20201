zzso plant growth is dependent on a functional shoot zzso zzso zzso that provides cells for continuous development of new aerial zzso However, how the SAM is zzso maintained during zzso development remains largely zzso We report here the characterization of a new SAM maintenance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest zzso that shows a primary zzso zzso at the adult zzso The zzso gene encodes a novel zzso finger zzso and is expressed most intensely in the shoot zzso We show that, in the zzso zzso the primary SAM develops normally during the juvenile zzso stage, but cell layer structure becomes zzso after entering the adult zzso stage, resulting in a dysfunctional SAM that cannot initiate floral zzso The zzso SAM zzso completely at the stage when the zzso begins to zzso producing adult plants with a primary zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso a putative zzso zzso is required for zzso SAM maintenance by controlling proper cellular zzso
