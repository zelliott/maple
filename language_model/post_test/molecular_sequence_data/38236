The zzso factor zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso of this zzso system, zzso zzso to the membrane and zzso in the electron transfer from zzso to molecular zzso A zzso or absence of zzso is the most common zzso form of chronic zzso disease zzso We have cloned and characterized the zzso gene from four zzso zzso a zzso clone and zzso DNA from normal zzso The gene is zzso base pairs long and includes 11 zzso It is zzso zzso in sequence to at least one zzso that maps to the same region of zzso zzso zzso more than half zzso of the zzso zzso gene consists of repetitive zzso In particular, the density of zzso sequences is high zzso zzso there are 21 zzso repeats zzso through 10 zzso These findings are consistent with the observation that zzso events between the zzso gene and its highly zzso zzso account for the majority of potentially lethal zzso in zzso chronic zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso of sequence zzso of the start of translation revealed a high zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso establishes a foundation for detailed molecular analysis of zzso zzso patients as well as for the study of the regulation of the zzso gene and zzso both of which are present as full-length transcripts in normal zzso
