The zzso zzso of zzso coli takes up iron in the zzso form and stores it within its central cavity as a hydrated zzso oxide zzso The mechanism by which zzso of iron zzso occurs in zzso is largely unknown, but previous studies indicated that there is zzso activity associated with a site capable of forming a zzso zzso within each zzso zzso zzso Wilson, Andrews, Harrison, zzso Thomson and Moore zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report zzso zzso experiments based on a putative zzso site located within the zzso zzso The data reveal that this zzso zzso is located at a site within the zzso bundle of each zzso of zzso thus identified as the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso form of the zzso bears a remarkable similarity to the zzso sites of the zzso zzso of methane zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Details of how the zzso zzso of zzso is involved in the zzso mechanism were investigated by studying the zzso of iron zzso zzso by zinc zzso zzso Data indicate that zinc zzso zzso bind at the zzso zzso of zzso in preference to iron zzso resulting in a dramatic reduction in the rate of zzso The mechanism of iron zzso zzso is discussed in the light of this and previous zzso
