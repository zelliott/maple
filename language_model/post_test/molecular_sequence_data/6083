zzso zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso dependent zzso is thought to be rate limiting for the zzso transition during the zzso cell zzso Previously, we showed severe zzso in zzso E protein expression in human zzso zzso cell lines and in surgical material obtained from patients with various zzso To understand the functional basis of these zzso we zzso here the regulation of zzso E in breast cancer zzso We find that while zzso E protein and its associated zzso activity in normal cells are cell cycle zzso in tumor cells it remains in an active complex throughout the cell zzso We also zzso zzso E for possible deletions which could result in its zzso function and found two novel truncated zzso in its coding zzso These zzso forms of zzso E were detected in several normal and tumor cell lines and tissue zzso However, Western zzso analysis indicated that only the multiple zzso of zzso E protein were expressed in tumor but not the normal tissue zzso suggesting post zzso regulation of zzso zzso Lastly, in zzso analyses indicated that these truncated zzso forms of zzso E are zzso active in their ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso these observations suggest the presence of more than one form of zzso E zzso in all cells, normal and zzso Once translated in tumor cells, the protein products of these truncated forms could give rise to a zzso active form of zzso E containing zzso
