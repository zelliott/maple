The X protein of zzso B virus zzso stimulates zzso of a large number of viral zzso This protein zzso the activity of the zzso zzso through a specific zzso element, termed X responsive element zzso zzso of zzso exhibit zzso activity which is further zzso by zzso zzso binds multiple cellular zzso factors one of which is the zzso We have constructed the DB gene containing the zzso domain of the zzso This gene efficiently zzso the zzso activity of the zzso by competitive displacement of the zzso zzso Under these conditions, X was found to have only a partially zzso effect on transcription, suggesting that the zzso proteins are required for the activity of zzso In contrast, an zzso hybrid protein that binds to the zzso is a strong zzso factor and acts without additional zzso zzso Furthermore, studies of X zzso revealed that the zzso of the protein is required for this zzso These data show that X directly stimulates the cellular zzso machinery, possibly by zzso interaction with the zzso zzso
