An zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library constructed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by differential screening with the zzso and zzso male zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso message from the zzso but not from male zzso adults, zzso zzso adults or zzso last zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that this message is expressed only during zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso zzso to the zzso zzso adult zzso showed that only zzso cells express the zzso zzso The 960 zzso zzso zzso is nearly zzso containing a single open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso acid zzso with a zzso signal sequence and two potential zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fact that zzso zzso codes for the 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by the zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis suggests that the zzso gene is a single copy gene and zzso analysis using the zzso and 3' end zzso of the zzso indicates that the zzso gene is zzso within the coding zzso
