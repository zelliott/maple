A highly active, large-scale preparation of zzso zzso complex has been obtained from the zzso purple zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been characterized using mass zzso zzso and zzso analysis as well as inhibitor zzso About 35 zzso of pure complex can be obtained from 1 g of membrane zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso have been used to obtain the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso of 310 zzso for the zzso protein is the most positive zzso potential for this protein in a zzso complex so zzso The zzso complex from zzso zzso is very stable and consists of three zzso and a zzso zzso The complex appears as a zzso in solution and contains six zzso molecules per zzso which are tightly zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso site is highly zzso High zzso zzso convert the complex into an zzso zzso form that has lost the zzso protein as well as the zzso and the zzso zzso
