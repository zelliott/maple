A zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of an zzso Based on the zzso zzso sequence as well as zzso and zzso properties the isolate was identified and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso gene along with its indigenous promoter was zzso amplified and after cloning expressed in zzso zzso In zzso coli the zzso zzso was found in the zzso in the zzso and in the zzso zzso The specific activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso after 24-hour zzso was very high, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in LB and zzso zzso zzso This activity was clearly exceeding that of the native zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso one from zzso zzso zzso The result shows that the original zzso zzso promoter and the signal zzso gave a very high zzso zzso expression in zzso coli and hence made the production in zzso coli zzso
