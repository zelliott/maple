A comparison was undertaken of zzso promoters in zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso using the level of zzso expressed from the zzso gene as a measure of promoter zzso In this study a comparison was made of the zzso virus zzso P zzso and P zzso the major late promoter of zzso virus, P zzso zzso the abundant inclusion body zzso and the zzso zzso P zzso and P zzso In zzso virus zzso the zzso P zzso promoter expressed one-third to one-half the level of zzso expressed by the P zzso zzso In comparison with the P zzso promoter, the zzso P zzso promoter expressed four to five times the level of zzso In zzso zzso zzso activity expressed was equal for the P zzso and P zzso zzso zzso expressed by P zzso and P L were one-half and one-fifth that level, zzso The zzso regulation of the promoters was maintained in both zzso virus and zzso zzso The P zzso promoter of zzso has the zzso sequence characteristic of late zzso promoters at the zzso initiation zzso In an attempt to enhance the utility of this promoter for the expression of foreign genes in zzso and zzso virus zzso the effect upon promoter function of changing the G of the zzso to A, zzso or C was determined using transient expression zzso with zzso zzso zzso of A, zzso or C for the G abolished promoter zzso Because of its zzso function, the level of expression and the presence of the zzso oriented late P L promoter, the zzso P zzso promoter will be valuable for the expression of foreign genes in zzso zzso
