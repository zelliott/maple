zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso gene zzso they were closely related to zzso species zzso zzso belonging to the class zzso family zzso The closest relatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data, including major fatty acid profiles, supported the assignment of our strains to the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences of five zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the results of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of our strains from each other and from the five zzso species with zzso published zzso No zzso or zzso genes could be zzso while zzso zzso gave zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso data, three novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
