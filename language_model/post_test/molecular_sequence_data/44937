zzso molecules are essential for tissue zzso and are also related to cancer invasion and zzso Although normal zzso express zzso and zzso the activity and expression of zzso and zzso in melanoma cells are still zzso We measured the zzso zzso activity of human normal zzso zzso and the melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso The melanoma cells showed stronger zzso zzso activity than did the zzso despite the lower expression of zzso and zzso in the melanoma zzso This result suggested that melanoma cells expressed other types of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso to amplify multiple zzso zzso we performed a zzso chain reaction zzso with the first strand of zzso generated by reverse zzso of the zzso of the melanoma cells, and we isolated two known zzso fragments, zzso and zzso and six novel zzso fragments, zzso zzso The reverse zzso using specific zzso of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the melanoma cells expressed more kinds of zzso molecules than did the zzso Such zzso may play an important role in melanoma zzso zzso
