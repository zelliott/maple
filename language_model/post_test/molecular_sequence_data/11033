We have cloned the zzso containing the complete coding region of the human zzso related zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso The human zzso protein displays high similarity zzso identical zzso acid zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression revealed the presence of zzso zzso in a variety of human zzso predominantly in brain and zzso This expression pattern is different from all other known zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene are the primary cause of zzso a zzso disorder of the central nervous zzso The zzso protein zzso and the zzso gene product are zzso membrane proteins belonging to the zzso of zzso containing an zzso cassette zzso All known zzso zzso represent only one-half of a functional zzso They are expected to form zzso either as a zzso or as a zzso zzso is a potential zzso partner of zzso or other zzso zzso The zzso gene is a candidate for a modifier zzso accounting for the zzso varying clinical courses of zzso observed even within a zzso
