zzso oxide zzso is zzso in vascular zzso cells, and appears to play an important role in the control of blood pressure and zzso zzso A detailed understanding of the regulation of NO synthesis by zzso cells has been hampered by the lack of molecular clones for zzso NO zzso we now report the isolation and characterization of such zzso The zzso NO zzso present in zzso cells and in brain share common zzso and zzso zzso We zzso NO zzso from bovine brain, and determined the zzso acid sequence of several zzso zzso These sequence data were zzso to design zzso NO zzso zzso zzso which were used to isolate clones zzso NO zzso from a bovine zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso A full-length NO zzso zzso clone was isolated, representing a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 133 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso NO zzso zzso differs at numerous zzso from the sequence determined for the zzso bovine brain zzso and shows zzso sequence identity with recently isolated molecular clones for zzso zzso and rat brain NO zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern blots zzso with bovine brain and zzso NO zzso zzso zzso identify distinct bands, indicating that these zzso are the products of different zzso zzso treatment of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which results in a marked increase in NO zzso activity, is associated with a decrease in the abundance of the zzso zzso NO zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
