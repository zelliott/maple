It has recently become clear that the zzso the most prominent nuclear zzso harbors diverse functions beyond its classic role in zzso zzso To gain insight into zzso functions, we have zzso amplified zzso from zzso zzso zzso using a novel approach involving zzso cell sorting zzso The resulting protein fraction was analyzed by mass zzso and used for the generation of zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso Here, we report the identification and molecular characterization of a novel, ubiquitous zzso which in most cell types appears to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed that this zzso termed zzso is highly zzso during evolution and shows in most cells analyzed a dual zzso pattern, zzso a strong enrichment in the zzso part of zzso and in distinct zzso zzso zzso with proteins zzso zzso and zzso respectively, have further shown that the zzso pattern of zzso zzso with certain clusters of late replicating zzso zzso experiments have revealed that protein zzso zzso with large zzso particles but is absent from zzso zzso We propose that in addition to its role in zzso zzso protein zzso has functions in the replication or zzso of certain zzso zzso
