zzso functions to control cell division and development through interaction with members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a cell zzso manner, and its zzso leads to its release from zzso Although it is known that zzso physically associates with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso complexes through a zzso zzso motif located in the zzso domain, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso via zzso remain poorly zzso Recent genetic evidence indicates a requirement for zzso zzso complexes in zzso zzso In this work, we provide direct zzso evidence for the involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso While zzso of zzso zzso can reverse the cell cycle arrest properties of zzso in zzso cells, we find that zzso in which the zzso sequence of the zzso motif is replaced by four zzso zzso is largely zzso to zzso by zzso zzso indicating a role for this motif in zzso zzso without a requirement for its tight interaction with zzso zzso We identified four zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are efficiently zzso by zzso but not by zzso in zzso and are also zzso in tissue culture zzso Growth suppression by zzso containing zzso zzso in these four sites is not reversed by zzso of zzso zzso In model zzso zzso region zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso is strictly dependent upon an intact zzso zzso but zzso of this site in the absence of an zzso motif can be partially restored by replacement of zzso by zzso This suggests that one role for the zzso motif is to facilitate zzso of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso via direct zzso and that the zzso motif of zzso plays a role in its zzso by zzso in the absence of stable zzso
