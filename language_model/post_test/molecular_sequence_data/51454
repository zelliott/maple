A relaxed zzso energy map for zzso zzso was zzso with the molecular mechanics program zzso All zzso angles of the three linkage bonds were driven by 30 degrees increments while two primary alcohol groups were held at three staggered zzso The zzso energy of all other parameters was zzso The side groups were retained at the same relative positions on the two rings in this first part of the study so our results are directly zzso to the study of zzso zzso with identical repeating zzso The low-energy zzso did not lead to viable zzso The zzso linkage zzso angles defined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso at zzso degrees and zzso degrees, respectively, with accessible zzso at other staggered zzso As observed in zzso the preferred zzso angle at central linkage bond defined by zzso zzso was zzso An analysis of all zzso of staggered side groups showed that the zzso and zzso groups had little effect but the zzso group showed a preference for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rings were started at the low-energy zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso 265 zzso that was retained except when the linkage zzso created severe zzso zzso
