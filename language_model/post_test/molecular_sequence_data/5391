zzso the main zzso synaptic zzso in the zzso is released from zzso and evokes responses in zzso retinal zzso zzso bipolar zzso which zzso both zzso and zzso types of zzso zzso In the present study, to zzso the functional roles of zzso receptors in synaptic transmission, we have identified a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined its zzso with respect to zzso cells in the outer zzso layer of the goldfish zzso by light and zzso zzso zzso We screened zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso of goldfish zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso zzso zzso was found in discrete clusters in the outer zzso zzso The cones contacted in this manner were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso cones, which were strongly zzso to zzso zzso zzso 43 and zzso to goldfish red and zzso zzso and zzso zzso cones, which were zzso zzso to zzso 43 but strongly zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso of goldfish retinal zzso with zzso revealed a single protein at zzso zzso 110 zzso zzso of zzso zzso with either the zzso rat zzso or its goldfish zzso reduced or abolished zzso in retinal sections and zzso zzso we have detected and localized genuine goldfish zzso in the outer zzso layer of the goldfish zzso We characterized contacts between zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso in the electron zzso zzso was localized to zzso central zzso of zzso in ribbon zzso of red cones, zzso zzso in other cones and zzso and zzso making zzso zzso junctions in rods and zzso the zzso structures are best identified as zzso of zzso zzso The results of our studies indicate that in goldfish zzso zzso zzso are zzso to all types of zzso and that transmission from zzso to zzso is zzso at least in part by zzso receptors containing zzso zzso
