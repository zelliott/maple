A molecular zzso that zzso among strains of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso was developed by identifying DNA restriction site zzso in the highly variable transcribed zzso region between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to amplify this region from zzso DNA using zzso within zzso regions of the zzso and zzso zzso This amplified region was zzso using a series of restriction zzso and zzso zzso of restriction zzso length zzso obtained by separate zzso with zzso and zzso allowed the 7 strains examined to be divided into 4 genetic zzso This zzso provides a more precise and zzso method of strain identification than whole zzso methods and should be useful as a method for studying the epidemiology of zzso zzso strains in human zzso The genetic zzso detected supplies strong evidence that direct sequence analysis of the region could provide extremely precise and potentially definitive identification of zzso
