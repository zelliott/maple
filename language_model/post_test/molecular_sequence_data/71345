A zzso was identified in normal zzso zzso by differential zzso zzso In zzso zzso has detected this zzso exclusively in the zzso cells on the normal and zzso zzso zzso side of the basement membrane and thus was named zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso No zzso expression was detected in the zzso breast zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso including an zzso zzso signal with a calculated molecular mass of 46 zzso The predicted sequence of the new protein shares zzso sequence identity and zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso To determine whether zzso can zzso the in zzso growth and progression of human breast zzso we zzso a full-length zzso zzso into human breast cancer cells and studied the zzso growth of zzso zzso control clones in the zzso fat pad of zzso nude zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the invasion of the cells in the in zzso invasion zzso When injected zzso into nude mice, the primary tumor volumes, zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso were significantly inhibited in zzso clones as compared with zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cells may prevent breast cancer zzso progression leading to zzso
