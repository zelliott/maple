zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from bovine zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso was calculated to be zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso rapidly zzso the zzso zzso and was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of the first 26 zzso of the zzso was zzso This sequence is highly zzso to the sequences in the zzso of pig kidney zzso We screened a bovine kidney zzso zzso library using a DNA probe that originated from rat zzso and we determined the bovine kidney zzso structure and deduced the zzso acid zzso The zzso is composed 1934 zzso and encodes 433 zzso acids in the coding zzso The zzso was strongly stained in the zzso zzso of the rat kidney in an zzso zzso Vitamin zzso protein which is known to be a zzso to zzso existing in the zzso zzso was zzso in a limited zzso manner by bovine kidney zzso These results suggested that zzso contributes to the processing of zzso absorbed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso also zzso an zzso synthetic zzso of bovine zzso II zzso at a position between zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso II has zzso zzso binding sites and zzso sites for both zzso and protein zzso zzso This suggests that zzso plays an important role in zzso and degradation of zzso II, which is abundant in the zzso compartments of zzso
