According to the similarity of the zzso acid sequences in their zzso zzso zzso protein zzso have been classified into the five main groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso group, represented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso are poorly characterized in plants except for a few zzso In this study, in order to gain a better understanding of plant protein zzso in the zzso group, three zzso zzso novel protein zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from zzso and characterized by molecular and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso contained all 12 zzso zzso zzso which are characteristic of the zzso zzso protein zzso A cell zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso fusion protein had protein zzso activity toward a conventional protein zzso zzso basic zzso whereas that from zzso coli harboring a fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not show any protein zzso zzso A zzso tree for 17 protein zzso from various organisms showed that the zzso are more closely related to the protein zzso in a particular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and animal zzso zzso than to the authentic zzso protein zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
