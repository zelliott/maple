zzso plays an important role in loading the zzso complex onto zzso and is essential for the establishment of zzso zzso We have identified and analyzed the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the sequence analysis of zzso and of other putative plant zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso finger, which is not found in their zzso and animal zzso zzso is identical to zzso and zzso show early zzso zzso and formation of giant zzso zzso A role for zzso in zzso cohesion was established by using conditional zzso and examining zzso zzso zzso zzso lines showed sterility, arising from the following defects in zzso zzso zzso failure of zzso zzso loss of zzso cohesion, mixed segregation of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which included defects in zzso organization and cohesion in zzso I, is distinct from that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which retains zzso cohesion up to zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and defects in zzso axis formation, in the zzso of zzso zzso These results demonstrate a role for zzso in zzso cohesion and zzso organization, and show that the machinery responsible for the establishment of cohesion is zzso in zzso
