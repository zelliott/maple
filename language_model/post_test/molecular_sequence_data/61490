In search of key zzso in zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the membrane fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by screening a directional zzso library derived from the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso gene is located on zzso 9 of zzso zzso contains one zzso of zzso zzso and is transcribed into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative protein of 362 zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso which clearly belongs to the type I zzso zzso Only a 35 zzso zzso was detected in the zzso using a specific rabbit zzso zzso has a zzso sequence near its zzso that is related to the zzso coli, zzso and human zzso zzso which is the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli with a zzso of 63 zzso 19 zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso 49 zzso of zzso formed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso active site demonstrated that the zzso zzso was processed into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and revealed the crucial role played by each zzso in zzso processing and zzso Using indirect zzso zzso zzso was zzso with an zzso zzso marker, but not with a zzso vital zzso This zzso zzso zzso is the first type I zzso identified in the zzso zzso zzso
