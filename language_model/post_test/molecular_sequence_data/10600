The zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso family has been implicated in the zzso inflammatory diseases multiple sclerosis zzso and experimental allergic zzso zzso To determine the role of individual family members in zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso were zzso with rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice developed zzso sustained zzso disease with average maximum clinical scores of zzso and disease zzso (a measure of day of onset and sustained disease zzso ranging from zzso to zzso with central nervous system zzso inflammation and zzso zzso mice were primed so that their zzso zzso proliferated in response to zzso zzso and the mice produced zzso zzso However, zzso mice were quite resistant to zzso with low average clinical scores zzso an average disease index of 61, and the negligible zzso inflammation and zzso zzso T cells transferred zzso to zzso zzso zzso mice were susceptible to zzso though less than zzso with an average maximum clinical score of zzso and disease index of zzso These data zzso T cell production of zzso in zzso zzso and support a major role for zzso a minor role for the zzso complex, and by zzso no role for zzso
