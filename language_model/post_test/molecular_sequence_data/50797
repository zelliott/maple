zzso of membrane zzso zzso the B zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso of a number of zzso including one of 42 zzso zzso with a similar molecular mass are zzso in response to zzso stimulation in other cell types and have been identified as zzso zzso termed zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso constitute a family of related zzso at least three of which have molecular masses of zzso zzso In this paper we show that zzso zzso zzso the zzso basic protein zzso activity characteristic of zzso zzso in both mature and immature zzso B cell zzso This zzso activity zzso on three different columns with a 42 zzso protein that was zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and which reacted with a panel of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso with the zzso zzso zzso showed that these B cell lines expressed both 42 zzso and 44 zzso forms of zzso zzso only the 42 zzso form was activated and zzso to a significant zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso with zzso zzso also resulted in selective zzso zzso and zzso of the 42 zzso zzso zzso This suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso could be due to stimulation of zzso by zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was only partially blocked by a zzso zzso the zzso analogue zzso zzso In contrast, zzso 3 completely blocked the ability of zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso activity and induce zzso zzso of zzso Thus zzso may activate zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso
