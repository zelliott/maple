Human zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which is principally found in the liver and plays important roles in the biological zzso of vitamin zzso and in the zzso of zzso zzso We have applied a systematic analysis of hydrogen bonding patterns in 11 zzso and zzso zzso crystal structures to construct a zzso model of zzso zzso of vitamin zzso structures into the active site of this model identified potential zzso contact zzso in the zzso the zzso sheet, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression in zzso cells confirmed that these positions affect zzso activity, in some cases shifting metabolism of zzso zzso to favor zzso or zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso hairpin help define the shape of the zzso binding cavity and that this structure interacts with zzso in the zzso zzso directed toward the zzso strand suggested a possible zzso interaction centered on zzso and a structural role for zzso contact zzso zzso and zzso
