The influence of low pH on zzso gene expression in zzso zzso was investigated by the use of differential zzso zzso phase cultures were exposed to pH zzso for various zzso and zzso was isolated and reverse zzso The zzso zzso were subjected to zzso and the products were resolved by zzso Several zzso products were induced after exposure to pH zzso One of these products, a zzso zzso fragment, showed sequence similarity to bacterial zzso genes of the zzso zzso whose genes zzso the various zzso of the zzso With the zzso zzso differential display product as a probe, zzso with total zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso verified the acid zzso of this zzso The increase in zzso zzso induced by low pH was accompanied by an increase in the activity of the zzso in membrane zzso The full-length zzso zzso was zzso and its genes were in the order of zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained no i zzso but was preceded by a 122 zzso zzso space, which contained putative extended zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso from cultures that were shifted from pH zzso to pH zzso 5, and held for 0, 30 or 45 zzso revealed that the zzso start site did not change position as a function of culture pH or time after exposure to pH zzso The primary structure and genetic organization indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso is a typical zzso zzso The similarity to zzso zzso and the acid zzso of this zzso suggest that it may function in the zzso zzso of zzso and maintenance of zzso zzso Finally, the use of differential display zzso was an effective approach to identify genes in zzso zzso induced by an environmental zzso
