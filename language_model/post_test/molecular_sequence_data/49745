zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a specific zzso zzso and shares two receptors zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso insulin release while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To generate a large pool of zzso selective zzso for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, zzso relationship studies were performed on zzso zzso and a zzso selective zzso zzso Chemical modifications on this analog that prevent zzso expression were zzso removed to show that a zzso zzso would retain zzso zzso An efficient zzso expression system was then developed to produce and screen hundreds of zzso zzso The 11 zzso found on the zzso analog were systematically replaced with zzso or zzso zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso were sufficient to provide most of the zzso zzso zzso extension with the zzso sequence from zzso led to potent zzso zzso with improved selectivity zzso zzso zzso at positions 19, 27, 29, and 30 of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso generated additional zzso selective zzso We have generated the first set of zzso zzso selective zzso zzso which exhibit activity profiles that suggest therapeutic utility in the treatment of zzso
