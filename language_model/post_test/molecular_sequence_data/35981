The zzso zzso sequence is a universal zzso site of various zzso proteins that interact with zzso zzso zzso In order to design zzso zzso protein antagonists, the determination of the biologically active zzso is a zzso We present a method that yields detailed insight into the zzso factors which govern the binding of the zzso to their receptors by systematically scanning the zzso space accessible for the zzso sequence zzso The investigation is based on the zzso controlled design of zzso zzso zzso and their structural determination, coupled with biological zzso For this purpose, a whole set of zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso and their three-dimensional structures in solution analyzed by modern two-dimensional zzso techniques in combination with restrained and free molecular dynamics zzso Their biological activity was compared with that of linear zzso in zzso zzso of tumor cell zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso An up to zzso and in part selective, increase in activity was observed for two zzso zzso Most other peptides showed a decreased activity which, however, was useful to correlate activity with rather small variations in zzso zzso comparative studies of the systematically designed zzso and the corresponding zzso activities offer an access to lead structures for a rational indirect drug design of zzso and zzso pharmaceuticals with strong interfering activity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
