Patients with zzso zzso C after liver transplantation usually have a high viral load and are generally resistant to zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unclear whether zzso viral zzso determines the effectiveness of combination therapy, especially in patients with a high viral zzso The aim of this study was to identify the viral factors associated with a sustained zzso response zzso to zzso therapy in patients with zzso zzso C after zzso liver zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso C received combination therapy of zzso plus zzso zzso was achieved in 7 of the 23 patients zzso zzso factors for zzso included a 2 zzso decline in zzso C virus zzso zzso at 2 weeks after the start of therapy and disappearance of zzso zzso at 4 or 24 weeks after the start of zzso As the zzso high viral load showed no association with zzso we asked whether other viral factor was associated with the response to the combination therapy in transplant zzso We found the several novel defective zzso clones in 4 of 12 recipients' zzso All defective zzso clones had deletions in the envelope zzso Interestingly, no patients with defective clones showed a prompt decrease in zzso zzso after the start of zzso plus zzso zzso Thus, early decline in serum zzso zzso after treatment was closely associated with zzso The circulating defective zzso clones are present and might be associated with the response to the combination therapy in patients with zzso zzso after liver zzso
