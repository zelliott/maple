zzso zzso elements zzso primed with zzso zzso are a diverse group of reiterated sequences related to zzso viruses and widely distributed among zzso As shown in previous zzso in many primates and zzso this class of elements has remained zzso active, as reflected by increased copy number and high sequence diversity within and among zzso 

Here we examine whether zzso sequences may be suitable molecular zzso for investigating the zzso of groups known to have high element zzso As a test we characterized zzso occurring in a sample of extant members of zzso zzso zzso and African elephants, zzso and zzso The zzso complement in this group is even more diverse than previously suspected, and there is sequence evidence for active expansion, particularly in zzso Many of the elements characterized have protein coding potential suggestive of zzso 

In general, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the complement had a single origin within zzso zzso
