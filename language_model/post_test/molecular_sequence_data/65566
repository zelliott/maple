Critical to the proper maintenance of zzso zzso integrity are the zzso tight junctions zzso zzso modifications of essential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute and possibly disrupt zzso zzso Our previous work has shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso and zzso zzso resulting in diminished barrier tightness and enhanced zzso migration across zzso in the setting of human zzso zzso encephalitis zzso To determine whether zzso can directly zzso zzso zzso we examined zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso We found that zzso predominately zzso two sites on zzso zzso and zzso and one site on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed for these sites, allowing the detection of zzso zzso at zzso and zzso and zzso at zzso from full-length zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells and mouse brain zzso zzso zzso Finally, these zzso zzso demonstrated enhanced zzso of brain zzso cells in the mouse model for zzso and human zzso brains featuring zzso cell zzso across disrupted zzso Our results demonstrated the direct zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso at specific sites, which was increased in zzso brain zzso These zzso could be useful zzso for monitoring zzso dysfunction in zzso
