The immune system zzso rapid zzso after zzso or zzso bone zzso transplantation with the zzso of tolerance to zzso Administration of drugs such as zzso that inhibit zzso zzso deletion zzso the zzso of the immune zzso In the absence of a peripheral regulatory T cells eliminated by the zzso regimen, systemic zzso with pathology similar to zzso disease often zzso Moreover, the resolution of zzso is dependent on the zzso of zzso regulatory T zzso This study examined the specificity and function of this regulatory population assessed ex zzso that plays a critical role in zzso the zzso T zzso response in zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that both the zzso regulatory and zzso zzso T cells recognize a common zzso zzso framework zzso a zzso derived from the zzso zzso presented by major zzso complex class II zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso compartment revealed two zzso of zzso T cells that zzso require the zzso and zzso zzso domain of this zzso Regulatory function is associated with the cells that require the zzso zzso zzso This population expresses the zzso nuclear zzso factor and plays a critical role in zzso tolerance to zzso zzso complex class II zzso In addition to suppressing the production of type 1 zzso these regulatory T cells can direct the zzso death of the zzso zzso zzso This study also suggests that the development of functional regulatory activity is an active response initiated by the presence of zzso zzso that can present the target zzso zzso zzso complex class II zzso to the regulatory T zzso Moreover, this process can be zzso by zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso leading to the development of functional regulatory zzso zzso
