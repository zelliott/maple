zzso of the zzso zzso domain in the insulin zzso is located in the almost perfectly zzso zzso motif of all zzso zzso and the function of the motif has not been zzso In this zzso zzso is universally zzso in all protein zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso zzso of zzso dependent protein zzso However, while other universally zzso zzso acid zzso are involved in zzso only zzso is zzso To determine whether this motif was not also involved in zzso zzso was replaced either by zzso zzso or zzso acid and zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso activity, while zzso zzso showed normal zzso zzso These zzso receptors had no effect on insulin zzso These results suggested that the universally zzso zzso in all protein zzso which was not required for zzso action of zzso dependent protein zzso was essential for the zzso zzso activity of the insulin zzso
