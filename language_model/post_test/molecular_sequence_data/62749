A zzso prediction method was employed to identify three zzso zzso in zzso protein B zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso of zzso located in these zzso has led to the identification of two zzso zzso acids 53 to 57 and 240 to zzso which are involved in binding to human zzso zzso These two zzso are zzso in an alignment of different zzso sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating a general functional role of the zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso in both binding zzso led to a decrease or abolition of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins by circular zzso did not provide any evidence for structural zzso due to the zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso was devoid of any zzso activity, and zzso zzso by the zzso showed strong zzso activity against the zzso strain, as well as against several zzso zzso zzso I zzso
