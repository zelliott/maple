The extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso has an open reading frame zzso a protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso family present in many zzso The protein named zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to the zzso family proteins from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and it forms a zzso and interacts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in this strain, which did not drastically zzso during zzso in a rich zzso The expression of several genes was altered upon disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found six zzso promoters in in zzso zzso zzso involving DNA fragments containing the upstream regions of the genes exhibiting decreased expression in the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso is a zzso zzso The consensus zzso zzso zzso site predicted upon zzso sequence alignment is zzso This sequence is unique compared with the known consensus binding sequences of zzso family zzso A putative zzso zzso sequence resides at 18 to 19 zzso downstream of the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes found in this study comprise clustered regularly zzso short zzso repeat zzso zzso ones, and the genes of a putative zzso regulator, a protein containing the zzso zzso domain of DNA zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of unknown zzso These results suggest a role for zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso and imply the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso
