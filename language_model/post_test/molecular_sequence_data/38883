A differential protein display screen resulted in the identification of a zzso protein which strongly accumulates during the zzso of zzso zzso cultures grown under standard zzso After partial determination of the zzso sequence by zzso analysis of zzso fragments, pairs of zzso zzso were deduced and used to amplify parts of the sequence coding for the zzso These zzso products were zzso to select specific zzso and zzso clones from DNA libraries of zzso zzso A subsequent zzso analysis revealed that the zzso protein is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso capable of coding for 240 zzso zzso The first three zzso zzso appear to be removed zzso The deduced zzso sequence shows significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in age-related zzso reactions protecting aging cultures against increasing zzso zzso
