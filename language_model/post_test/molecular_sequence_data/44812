The zzso of new blood vessel formation zzso is an effective means of limiting both the size and zzso of solid zzso The leading zzso compound, zzso has proven to be effective in in zzso and in animal model studies, and is currently being tested in phase III zzso clinical zzso Despite many detailed pharmacological studies, little is known of the molecular mode of action of zzso Using a zzso of the zzso parent compound, the zzso zzso zzso we have zzso a zzso protein that is selectively and zzso bound by this natural zzso This zzso binding protein was found to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is highly zzso between human and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso a zzso related zzso zzso zzso function is essential for zzso growth in zzso We demonstrate that zzso selectively zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso The binding is highly specific as judged by the failure of zzso to inhibit zzso in zzso zzso these results identify zzso as an important target of study in the analysis of the potent biological activities of zzso
