Members of the copper zzso zzso zzso family from zzso plants, and zzso including human are required for cellular zzso of the essential metal zzso Based on zzso data, zzso have three zzso zzso and have been shown to zzso in the zzso Among individual members of the family, there is little zzso acid sequence identity, raising questions as to how these proteins adopt a common fold, zzso and participate in copper zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso and the zzso unfolded protein response, we demonstrated that at least half of the third zzso domain zzso plays a vital role in zzso structure and zzso The results of our analysis showed that zzso contains two functionally distinct zzso One face bears a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso which we showed to be essential for zzso zzso Moreover, we showed that zzso constraints reach past the zzso itself including zzso acid zzso that are not zzso throughout the zzso zzso A second face of zzso contains three zzso acid positions that, when zzso to zzso cause predominantly abnormal zzso but are still partially functional in growth zzso zzso These zzso cluster on the face opposite to the zzso face of zzso where they may mediate interactions with the remaining two zzso zzso Taken together, our data support zzso as being buried within zzso zzso where it plays an essential role in zzso zzso
