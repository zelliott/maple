By screening of a zzso zzso expression library with the serum from a dog affected with visceral zzso a zzso clone with sequence zzso to the zzso gene family was zzso From analysis of the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso it was estimated that the zzso zzso zzso contains 7 zzso genes zzso zzso The full-length coding region of the zzso gene located at the zzso of the cluster was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso shows a high level of sequence identity with members of the zzso protein family from other zzso zzso The complete protein zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso coli as zzso proteins and used as target zzso in zzso zzso against a collection of zzso from dogs with visceral zzso zzso percent of the zzso recognized the zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso during canine zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso from zzso acid 156 to zzso as the zzso region of the zzso This region, which is the less evolutionary zzso region of the zzso was recognized by zzso of the visceral zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and particular protein zzso may be useful in zzso zzso for canine zzso
