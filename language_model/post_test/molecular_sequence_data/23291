We investigate the zzso structure of a large group of zzso the so-called sandwich zzso The analysis of a large number of such proteins has led us to propose a set of rules that can be used to predict the possible arrangements of strands in the two zzso forming a given sandwich zzso These rules imply the existence of certain zzso zzso zzso common to all sandwich zzso Furthermore, they dramatically restrict the number of permissible zzso For example, whereas for proteins consisting of three strands in each zzso 180 possible strand arrangements exist a zzso our rules imply that only 15 of them are zzso Five of these predicted arrangements describe all currently known sandwich proteins with six zzso
