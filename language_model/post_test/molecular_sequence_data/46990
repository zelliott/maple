Numerous zzso of the zzso blood group system, discovered by Levine and zzso in 1939, have been detected and more than zzso zzso have been zzso By performing the molecular genetic analysis of the zzso as well as the zzso in both zzso zzso it was zzso that zzso zzso were generated by gene conversion or zzso zzso or zzso For understanding the generation of many zzso zzso and zzso zzso in detail, it is necessary to analyze not only the zzso and zzso genes but also the structure and the physical distance between both these zzso zzso In order to achieve the zzso purpose, the zzso region between the zzso and zzso genes were amplified by the long zzso zzso Therefore the full zzso region was determined to be zzso zzso in length and contained the zzso consensus sequences and the putative zzso zzso It was probable that the zzso of both zzso genes occurred within about 12 zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso region provides new information for the research on the zzso region, the molecular evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the deletion of the zzso gene in zzso blood group zzso
