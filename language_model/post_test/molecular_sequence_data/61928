In a search for previously unknown genes that are required for zzso development in zzso a zzso sequence was identified in a zzso zzso zzso library and in zzso DNA zzso The zzso is zzso zzso and contains intact open reading frames for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as nearly identical zzso long terminal repeat zzso As determined by in zzso zzso the zzso appears to be a major tissue for zzso expression in both zzso and adult zzso Several viral transcripts were found by Northern zzso in the adult zzso The zzso was found at the same zzso locus in zzso from four fish, suggesting that it is an zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that it is closest to, yet distinct from, the cluster of zzso leukemia zzso zzso suggesting that this virus represents a new group of zzso
