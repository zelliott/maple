zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each of which can bind solely to the zzso sequence zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso is presented zzso It folds into a compact zzso structure zzso a zzso zzso zzso packed against two zzso which is characteristic of the zzso zzso Special structural features of zzso include zzso boxes for both zzso a zzso in the second zzso and an additional short zzso zzso coupled with a zzso structure in a zzso Two hydrogen bonds which restrict the positions of zzso were zzso zzso resonance assignments for zzso zzso with zzso revealed that the overall folding is maintained in the zzso The candidate zzso involved in the interactions with zzso were identified by chemical shift zzso zzso They are located in the central and peripheral regions of the zzso surface composed of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso interactions with zzso are performed by the zzso in the central region of the zzso surface, while specific interactions are performed by those in the peripheral zzso It was also found that zzso has the ability to inhibit the formation of the zzso zzso
