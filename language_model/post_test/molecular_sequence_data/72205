We have cloned the human zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso symbol zzso from a liver zzso zzso This zzso encodes a protein of 262 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 29 zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso in zzso coli yielded an active zzso which was zzso to zzso Northern zzso analysis of human zzso showed strong expression in liver, heart, brain, and zzso and a lower expression in skeletal zzso The gene was assigned to zzso zzso by the use of hybrid cell lines and by zzso in zzso zzso Most patients presenting with zzso zzso syndrome type 1 zzso or zzso disease) have a greatly reduced zzso zzso the gene zzso this zzso is a likely candidate for zzso Since the zzso locus maps else where in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso by zzso 22 are not a major cause of zzso
