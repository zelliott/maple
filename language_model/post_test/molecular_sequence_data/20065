zzso oxide zzso has emerged as a key zzso involved in many zzso processes in zzso To characterize roles of NO in tolerance of zzso zzso zzso to salt stress, effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants with an impaired in zzso NO zzso zzso activity and a reduced zzso NO level was zzso zzso zzso plants displayed a greater zzso to zzso ratio in shoots than zzso plants due to enhanced zzso of zzso and reduced zzso of zzso when exposed to zzso zzso of zzso seeds was more sensitive to zzso than that of zzso seeds, and zzso plants exhibited higher survival rates than zzso plants when grown under salt zzso zzso plants had higher levels of hydrogen zzso than zzso plants under both control and salt stress, suggesting that zzso is more vulnerable to salt and zzso stress than zzso zzso zzso of zzso plants with zzso inhibitor and NO scavenger reduced zzso NO levels and enhanced zzso increase in zzso to zzso zzso Exposure of zzso plants to zzso inhibited zzso activity and reduced quantity of zzso zzso leading to a decrease in zzso NO levels measured by zzso fluorescent zzso Treatment of zzso plants with NO donor sodium zzso attenuated the zzso increase in zzso to zzso zzso zzso these findings provide direct evidence to support that disruption of zzso NO production is associated with salt tolerance in zzso
