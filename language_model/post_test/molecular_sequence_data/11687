zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso 2) is a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso distributed in zzso zzso has been found to zzso a wide variety of zzso and nuclear zzso which are intimately involved in regulation of DNA, zzso and protein zzso and zzso We therefore addressed the hypothesis that zzso transformation of upper zzso tract zzso to zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso might be associated with altered zzso zzso 

To this end, we subjected surgical specimens of zzso tumors and of normal zzso zzso to zzso zzso We then zzso zzso activity in zzso and zzso of these specimens using a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We found that zzso activity was significantly elevated in both nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compartments of zzso tumors, relative to normal zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity in the cellular zzso fraction of zzso tumors was associated with less differentiated zzso grade zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso and a poor clinical outcome zzso zzso zzso zzso cumulative survival analysis revealed greatly reduced survival in the zzso activity patient group, with high statistical significance zzso zzso zzso 

These preliminary data reveal that zzso transformation of the upper zzso tract zzso is associated with altered zzso zzso The results further suggest that zzso of this protein zzso may play a significant role in the zzso of zzso and that zzso activity may be a zzso indicator in this zzso
