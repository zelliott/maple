The tendency of species to retain their ancestral niches may link processes that determine community assembly with zzso histories that span geological time zzso zzso history is likely to have had a particularly strong impact on zzso forests because of the influence of the Great American zzso zzso which followed emergence of a land connection between North and South America zzso Here we examine the community structure, ancestral niches and ancestral zzso of the zzso zzso woody plant zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso We find that zzso of the variation in zzso traits, a strong zzso of community structure, is explained by zzso origins in zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso evolution models for a regional sample of 152 species indicate that ancestral zzso niches are associated with zzso habitat zzso and hence local community structure and zzso even millions of years after zzso into new geographic zzso
