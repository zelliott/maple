The zzso and human zzso represent the first two zzso complexes of which protein components were identified solely by mass zzso zzso In this chapter, the different approaches used for the zzso of these protein complexes, the zzso analysis of the zzso and some functional characterization strategies adopted are zzso Even though from the time of analysis up to 2005 much has been achieved in terms of zzso techniques, zzso protein analysis and sequence information in public databases, the key knowledge gained from the very early complex analyses still hold true zzso The analysis of protein complexes is a powerful approach for understanding the organization of proteins and how they act in units to exert their biological zzso The analysis also creates hypotheses for the role of novel proteins in the context of the cellular function of the protein complex under zzso However, the work on the zzso described in this chapter also illustrates the relative ease of protein identification by zzso and the difficulty to provide detailed functional information for the vast amount of data generated in such a zzso
