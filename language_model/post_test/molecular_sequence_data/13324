The intense charge transfer complex between the zzso of zzso and the oxidized zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is discharged by the zzso zzso with irreversible zzso of the zzso zzso transfer complex formation is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for zzso zzso the zzso complex is also zzso whereas the comparable zzso species is zzso Complete zzso of the zzso with zzso requires 1 zzso of zzso and apparently 3 molecules of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the crystal structure of zzso complexes argue that zzso zzso zzso proceeds through the zzso prosthetic zzso zzso of zzso followed by isolation of zzso zzso from the modified zzso zzso showed that zzso results in labeling the zzso base, zzso zzso modification is accompanied by the release of zzso A mechanism for zzso is proposed involving generation of a zzso salt which efficiently captures the zzso zzso
