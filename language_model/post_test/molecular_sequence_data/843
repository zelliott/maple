zzso is involved in zzso formation in the zzso network zzso system and during zzso zzso recruitment to zzso is zzso by the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso domain zzso which forms a zzso zzso TD binds zzso zzso which have short zzso zzso either the zzso zzso and/or the zzso however, the importance of the TD binding sites for these motifs has not been tested in zzso We investigated the importance of the TD in zzso function by generating 1) zzso in the zzso HC gene zzso to disrupt the binding sites for the zzso and zzso zzso and 2) four zzso zzso zzso of zzso We found that TD is important for the retention of resident zzso zzso and zzso of zzso however, the known zzso binding sites are not necessary, because zzso caused little to no effect on trafficking pathways involving zzso The zzso TD was able to interact with the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, and zzso zzso by zzso formed zzso zzso These data suggest that additional or alternative binding sites exist on the TD zzso to help facilitate the recruitment of zzso to sites of zzso zzso
