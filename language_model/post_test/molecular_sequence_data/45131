Secondary T cell responses are enhanced because of an expansion in numbers of zzso zzso zzso Using major zzso complex class II zzso we have tracked zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso memory T cells in normal and in zzso zzso zzso memory T cells were zzso after zzso for more than 200 days, although zzso was zzso Memory cells generated in zzso knockout mice by zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells survived in the absence of zzso and proliferated when zzso with zzso (plus zzso in a zzso zzso However, differentiation of the memory cells into zzso zzso cells did not occur in the absence of zzso The data indicate that memory cells can be generated without passing through the zzso cell zzso
