The crystal structure of rat zzso zzso zzso has been determined in complexes with each of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso at resolutions of zzso A and zzso A, zzso Comparisons with the structure of the bovine zzso complex show that the zzso interactions in rat zzso are dominated to a much greater degree by attractive and repulsive zzso zzso zzso structural zzso in the zzso regions of the interface formed with zzso is reflected in significantly weaker zzso relative to bovine zzso The primary active site loop of zzso adopts slightly different zzso when bound to rat and cow zzso reflecting a broader entrance to the binding pocket in the zzso Tight zzso of each loop zzso to the respective active sites then gives rise to significantly different overall zzso of the inhibitor when bound to the two zzso The crystal structures of zzso bound to these protein zzso are excellent models of the zzso complexes, which permit zzso of zzso interactions both N and zzso to the zzso bond, while maintaining identical reaction zzso They will be uniquely useful to the zzso analysis of zzso rat zzso zzso
