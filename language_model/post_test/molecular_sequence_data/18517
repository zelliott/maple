The symptoms of zzso zzso infection are caused by toxins expressed from its 19 zzso zzso locus zzso zzso integration of the zzso is suggested by its single zzso location and the zzso specificity of its different genetic zzso However, the zzso is zzso present, even among closely related zzso and thus resembles a mobile genetic zzso Our aim was to explain these apparently conflicting observations by reconstructing the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso analyses and zzso of the regions spanning the zzso were performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso chosen from a collection of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the core zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated an eventful evolutionary history, with distinct zzso zzso acquired zzso specifically after zzso In particular, our data suggest a relatively recent zzso acquisition in zzso zzso zzso and losses of the zzso DNA have also occurred, via long zzso zzso events involving zzso zzso zzso The most recent loss event occurred zzso years ago within a zzso 1 zzso The genetic organization of the zzso 3 zzso was unique in containing a zzso integrated novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of which were found at multiple zzso zzso zzso elements were zzso but zzso and occasionally contained genes zzso resistance to clinically relevant zzso The evolutionary histories of two contrasting but clinically important genetic elements were thus zzso the zzso mobilized rarely via zzso zzso and zzso mobilized frequently through zzso
