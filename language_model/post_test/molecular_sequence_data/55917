The zzso delta virus zzso is a zzso zzso that contains a zzso activity that is similar to the zzso activity found in certain plant zzso However, the sequences surrounding the zzso site are unrelated to the zzso or hairpin zzso zzso and it is considered to be a distinct zzso zzso We made zzso changes within two regions of the smallest zzso zzso sequence that has optimal activity and zzso analyzed the data at different temperatures to determine the potential roles of the zzso We distinguish between those changes that affect the rate of zzso and those that promote the formation of inactive zzso We find that zzso zzso to zzso downstream from the zzso site, which can form a hairpin structure, are zzso for zzso activity but that they enhance the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso form Watson and zzso base pairs that are important for activity, but the actual sequence is not zzso In contrast, the zzso between zzso and zzso are important for activity, and they may be involved in significant zzso zzso
