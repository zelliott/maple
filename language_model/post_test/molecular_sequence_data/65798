Previous studies have shown that translation of zzso for zzso zzso zzso is alternatively initiated from zzso and a downstream zzso initiation zzso Evidence presented here shows that unlike an zzso initiation zzso efficiency of this zzso initiation zzso is significantly affected by its sequence context, in particular the zzso at positions zzso to zzso relative to the initiation zzso zzso (R represents A Or zzso and zzso appear to be the most and least favorable sequences at these positions, zzso zzso of the native context sequence zzso to zzso from AAA to zzso reduced translation initiation from the zzso zzso up to zzso and resulted in loss of zzso zzso although an zzso initiation zzso is, in general, unresponsive to context changes in zzso an AAA zzso to zzso to zzso zzso still reduced its initiating activity up to zzso under similar zzso these results suggest that sequence context is more important for translation initiation in zzso than previously zzso
