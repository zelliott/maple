zzso infection by zzso strain zzso is zzso in both mice and rabbits and causes fatal encephalitis in approximately 50% of zzso In addition, it spontaneously zzso with high frequency relative to other zzso strains in zzso We zzso the zzso strain zzso and compared its coding protein sequences with those of six other zzso zzso Most of the 74 predicted protein sequences are zzso only zzso are less than zzso zzso Eight proteins were identified to be unique for zzso based on sequence zzso bit score ratio zzso These include five proteins showing significant variations zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two truncated proteins zzso and zzso and one zzso containing an extended open reading zzso The zzso strain also has unique features in its zzso sequence and zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso These data are indicative of strain variation but need further work to connect observed differences with zzso zzso
