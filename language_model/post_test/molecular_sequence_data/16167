We have isolated six independent zzso clones zzso zzso zzso or eggshell proteins from a zzso zzso zzso zzso A linkage may of five of the clones spanning 35 zzso pair zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The region contained two eggshell protein genes closely linked, separated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso The two genes of the cluster were arranged in the same orientation, that is, they were transcribed from the same zzso The sixth clone probably represents a third copy of the eggshell gene that is not contained within the zzso zzso The zzso end of the zzso transcribed from these genes was defined by primer extension directly off the zzso The zzso cap site sequence was zzso to a zzso zzso zzso cap site zzso where zzso indicates any zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that there were no zzso in these zzso The DNA sequences of the three genes were very zzso to each other and to a zzso zzso zzso differing only in three or four zzso A multiple zzso box was located at positions zzso to zzso and a zzso sequence was located at zzso upstream of the eggshell zzso zzso zzso of sequences in regions further upstream with zzso and zzso sequences revealed several very short elements that were zzso One such element, zzso recently shown to be an essential zzso element for zzso zzso gene promoter function, was found at a similar position in all three zzso
