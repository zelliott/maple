G zzso inwardly zzso zzso channels zzso are activated by a direct interaction with zzso zzso and also by raised internal zzso Both processes require the presence of zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso region of zzso mediates the zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso channels and the zzso zzso zzso Within this region, zzso has an zzso at position zzso whereas zzso has an zzso at the equivalent position zzso A single point zzso zzso in zzso abolished the zzso zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso a nearby negative charge, zzso had no zzso The reverse zzso in zzso zzso was sufficient to restore zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not alter either the single channel properties or the ability of these channels to be activated via the zzso zzso zzso dramatically increased the open probability of zzso channels in the absence of zzso or zzso but did not zzso further zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso is not acting simply to promote zzso binding to zzso We conclude that zzso 226 in zzso plays a crucial role in zzso gating of zzso zzso
