zzso zzso zzso zzso is a valid target for zzso zzso however, potent zzso zzso suitable for clinical use are zzso Because the majority of described zzso zzso bind in the zzso pocket of the zzso domain, we have characterized this pocket in zzso using zzso zzso zzso studies, and molecular zzso zzso of the gatekeeper zzso a key structural zzso influencing inhibitor zzso rendered the fusion zzso zzso sensitive to zzso by zzso in the zzso range, while zzso inhibited the zzso zzso at zzso zzso In contrast, both wild type and zzso zzso were insensitive to zzso Computer modeling indicated that zzso solutions obtained with a zzso model representing the intermediate zzso of the zzso zzso domain reflected closely experimental zzso The good agreement between experimental and virtual results indicate that the zzso molecular models described here are useful tools for the rational design of zzso selective zzso In addition, zzso compounds may have potential as templates for zzso zzso
