We report the amplification of bacterial genes from zzso surface and subsurface sediments by the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso amplification of indigenous bacterial zzso zzso DNA genes was unsuccessful when subsurface zzso containing approximately zzso zzso was added directly to a zzso zzso However, when 10 zzso of zzso was zzso with approximately zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso Southern zzso of the zzso amplification product improved sensitivity to zzso to zzso cells from samples zzso with zzso zzso zzso but controls with no zzso added showed that the zzso was partially inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA extraction was combined with gel zzso partial zzso in the presence of zzso to render DNA from indigenous bacteria in surface or subsurface zzso samples zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso gene could also be amplified from indigenous bacteria by using zzso zzso when zzso conditions were modified by increasing zzso and primer zzso zzso zzso of the zzso amplification products from surface and subsurface sediments revealed zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso The procedures for DNA zzso zzso and zzso amplification described here demonstrate that the zzso is a potentially useful tool in studies of zzso and zzso DNA from indigenous microbial communities in zzso and groundwater zzso
