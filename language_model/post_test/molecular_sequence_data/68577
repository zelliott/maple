The heart expresses the three zzso zzso receptors zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso We have examined the zzso relationship between the expression of zzso transcripts for zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso and their receptors in the heart during the development of cardiac zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso Progressive cardiac zzso was accompanied by increased zzso zzso prevalence throughout the heart and increased zzso zzso in the left zzso The most striking observation was the gradual disappearance of zzso transcripts (the putative zzso zzso in all zzso this was in marked contrast to the increase in zzso levels for zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso zzso Our observations have important therapeutic implications if the transcript changes are mirrored at the zzso protein level because zzso the apparent zzso of zzso may enhance the local action of zzso peptides on the heart, and zzso the loss of zzso particularly if it is zzso may reduce the rate of elimination of the zzso zzso restricting the therapeutic potential of specific zzso zzso designed to reduce zzso zzso
