Cellular handling of zzso molecules is an important mechanism for the regulation of appropriately sensitive zzso zzso Until now, our understanding of the cellular handling of the zzso zzso zzso has been largely limited to following a zzso zzso through the zzso In the present work, we report the application of unique zzso zzso zzso directed toward zzso zzso which permitted the zzso of this zzso independently of its occupation with zzso The zzso zzso zzso were also useful in Western zzso and zzso of this zzso zzso zzso receptors remained on the surface of both zzso stable rat zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cell line zzso cells and native rat pancreatic zzso cells and did not zzso zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso cells resulted in the prompt zzso of a subset of surface zzso representing those that were occupied with zzso zzso receptors remained on the surface, zzso by the zzso signaling zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso treatment did not stimulate zzso zzso After zzso we observed substantial zzso recycling to the plasma zzso These insights provide the first evidence that zzso zzso zzso occurs as a direct result of an induced zzso change and presumed zzso interaction, rather than as an effect of a signaling zzso
