A vast amount of information has accumulated which supports the view that zzso and starch are zzso of two zzso yet highly zzso zzso pathways taking place in the zzso and zzso zzso However, several lines of experimental zzso indicate that, essentially identical to the case of zzso zzso starch formation in the zzso zzso may involve the direct import to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso units derived from the zzso zzso This evidence is consistent with the idea that synthesis of a sizable pool of zzso takes place in the zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso basically in agreement with recent investigations dealing with zzso zzso in bacteria and animals, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are most likely playing a role in zzso of zzso units derived from the starch breakdown in the zzso thus making up a regulatory starch turnover zzso According to this new view, we propose that starch production in the zzso is the result of a flexible and dynamic mechanism wherein both zzso and anabolic reactions take place simultaneously in a highly interactive zzso zzso is seen as an intermediate component of a zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, is connected with other zzso zzso The possible importance of zzso turnover as a way to control starch production is exemplified with the recently discovered zzso zzso an zzso likely having a dual role in controlling levels of zzso linked to starch zzso and diverting carbon flow towards other zzso zzso
