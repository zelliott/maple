The zzso nuclear pore complex zzso is comprised of approximately 50 unique zzso collectively known as zzso Through zzso of rat liver zzso we have isolated zzso potentially novel zzso and have begun a systematic characterization of these zzso Here, we present the characterization of zzso a novel zzso with a predicted molecular mass of 96 zzso zzso is generated through an unusual zzso zzso that involves synthesis of a zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso of the precursor yields two zzso zzso a previously characterized zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso and functional analyses demonstrate that both the zzso precursor and the previously characterized zzso zzso independently from an alternatively spliced zzso are zzso zzso in zzso This zzso zzso for zzso and zzso is zzso zzso as the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also produced through zzso zzso of a precursor zzso Using zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso side of the zzso at or near the zzso zzso The correct targeting of both zzso and zzso to the zzso side of the zzso was found to be dependent on zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso process may regulate zzso zzso Finally, by zzso zzso a complex containing zzso zzso and at least two zzso related proteins was identified, revealing that a major zzso of the zzso is zzso between zzso and zzso
