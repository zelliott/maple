A zzso that expresses a zzso for very low density zzso zzso was isolated from a rabbit heart zzso library and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso revealed that the zzso encodes a protein with striking zzso to the low density zzso zzso zzso Like the LDL zzso the mature protein consists of the following five zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids including an zzso repeat of 40 zzso acids zzso to the zzso binding repeat of the LDL zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to the zzso growth factor precursor including three zzso zzso a region immediately outside of the plasma membrane rich in zzso and zzso 22 zzso acids zzso the plasma zzso and 54 zzso acids including the zzso sequence that is required for zzso of the LDL zzso in coated pits and that projects into the zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso bound and zzso zzso zzso zzso and intermediate density zzso but did not bind LDL with high zzso The zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso are highly abundant in heart, muscle, and zzso zzso zzso zzso amounts of the zzso were present in zzso Based on the structural features, zzso zzso and tissue expression of the zzso we suggest that this zzso zzso may mediate zzso of zzso zzso zzso enriched with zzso in zzso zzso that are active in fatty acid zzso
