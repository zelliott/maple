In this paper we describe a pair of novel zzso zzso isolated from the zzso plant zzso zzso consisting of a zzso element zzso zzso zzso and its autonomous partner zzso zzso zzso These two elements have highly similar long terminal repeat zzso sequences but differ in the presence of the typical zzso coding regions zzso zzso most of which are missing in zzso Moreover, zzso contains two additional open reading frames in zzso orientation localized between the pol gene and right zzso zzso transcripts were detected in all zzso tested zzso flower buds and zzso which, together with the high sequence similarity of zzso in individual zzso indicates their recent zzso zzso The autonomous elements are similarly abundant zzso zzso as zzso ones zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso elements are also present in other zzso species, mostly in zzso zzso regions of all zzso The only exception is the zzso of the short arm of the Y zzso in zzso zzso which is known to lack the terminal zzso An interesting feature of the zzso elements is the presence of a tandem repeat zzso which is more amplified in the zzso zzso
