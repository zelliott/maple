We have characterized a cluster of zzso zzso genes located at zzso on the zzso zzso zzso near the heat shock zzso zzso These zzso designated zzso Ds in the zzso zzso gene zzso are closely linked within a approximately zzso DNA zzso The gene family has a minimum of eight zzso genes organized in divergent zzso Two of the genes are probably zzso zzso in that their open reading frames are shorter than functional zzso and no zzso from them have been detected thus zzso The zzso acid sequence identity among the functional genes ranges from 53 to zzso in zzso zzso The zzso regions are much more AT rich zzso than the coding regions zzso consistent with being zzso sequences in zzso zzso The zzso size for each gene suggests that these genes are probably expressed individually from separate zzso This is the first documentation of definitive physical linkage of a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes are zzso zzso and a zzso of sequence similarity exists among the zzso zzso zzso The patterns of sequence similarity in zzso comparisons of the family members suggest that gene conversion may have played a role in the evolution of this zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso D genes provide a unique system for studying zzso gene regulation, in zzso zzso functions, and evolution of zzso zzso with a global zzso The zzso D genes in other organisms should be zzso and can be isolated directly from zzso zzso for functional analyses at the gene and protein zzso
