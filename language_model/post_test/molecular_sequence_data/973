Group II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lack a zzso protein that is present in group I zzso but have an unrelated envelope fusion protein named zzso In contrast to zzso the F protein has to be activated by a zzso zzso mechanism to become zzso In several zzso viral fusion zzso the zzso zzso generates a new N zzso which forms the so-called fusion zzso This fusion zzso zzso in the cellular zzso thereby zzso zzso of the viral and cellular membrane upon sequential zzso changes of the fusion zzso A similar zzso has been identified in zzso F proteins at the N zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso The role of individual zzso acids in this putative fusion zzso on viral zzso and propagation was studied by zzso zzso F proteins with single zzso acid changes as well as an F protein with a deleted putative fusion zzso were introduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso None of the zzso analyzed had an major effect on the processing and incorporation of F proteins in the envelope of zzso Only two zzso one with a substitution for a zzso zzso zzso and one with a deleted putative fusion zzso were completely unable to rescue the zzso zzso Several zzso zzso for other zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso had only an effect on viral zzso In contrast to what was expected from zzso virus fusion zzso zzso zzso for zzso did not show any zzso
