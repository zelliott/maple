The gene zzso the major envelope zzso of the zzso isolate was engineered for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from permanent Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Cellular production methods were scaled up and a method for zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso conditions were selected in order to preserve the native structure of the zzso zzso exhibits a molecular weight of 120 zzso in reduced or zzso zzso zzso thus the zzso chain is zzso zzso zzso has the predicted molecular weight of the zzso zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso in a zzso buffer at neutral pH yields a molecular weight estimate of approximately 120 zzso zzso zzso closely resembles authentic viral zzso by several physical, chemical, and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso viral zzso and a human zzso zzso zzso that maps to a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso molecular complex with soluble zzso human zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso binding is high affinity zzso approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso
