zzso bacteria are known to play important roles in the biology of insects, but the current knowledge of bacterial communities associated with mosquitoes is very limited and consequently their contribution to host behaviors is mostly zzso In this study, we explored the composition and diversity of zzso bacteria in relation with zzso zzso Wild Aedes zzso and Aedes aegypti were collected in three different geographic regions of zzso zzso methods and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were the major zzso zzso bacterial zzso were dominated by zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso Common zzso bands belonged to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso Double infection by zzso inherited zzso zzso prevailed in zzso of males zzso and zzso of females zzso few individuals were found to be zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity zzso and Simpson zzso differed significantly per habitat whereas zzso zzso zzso was zzso Overall, the bacterial composition and diversity were influenced both by the sex of individuals and by the environment inhabited by the zzso the latter might be related to both the vegetation and the animal host populations that Aedes used as food zzso
