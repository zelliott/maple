The zzso zzso channel zzso serves as a common zzso core in various zzso zzso zzso channels, and it is through assembly with zzso zzso zzso which are zzso cassette (ABC) zzso that zzso channel zzso can be zzso In this regard, zzso has been shown to physically associate with zzso to form the pancreatic zzso zzso While cardiac zzso channel activity can be zzso by zzso of zzso with a distinct zzso zzso zzso no direct proof has been provided for physical association between these two zzso zzso we tested, by a zzso procedure in conjunction with an zzso zzso physical association between zzso zzso and zzso From a mixture of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso was not zzso by the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso recognized zzso only when zzso formed a complex with zzso A zzso deletion zzso lacking 37 zzso acids from the zzso still zzso with zzso indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso is unnecessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking more zzso zzso regions, including the zzso zzso domain, failed to zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso together with the zzso domain are required for channel zzso These deletion zzso supported cellular distribution of zzso Thus, the present study provides direct evidence for physical association between zzso and zzso essentially zzso the cardiac zzso channel in zzso The demonstration of complex formation between zzso and zzso indicates that the structural basis for channel function may rely on direct physical interaction of the two zzso
