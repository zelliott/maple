Four zzso related proteins that belong to the zzso family were identified in cold zzso wheat zzso zzso Two soluble forms with molecular masses of 34 and 36 zzso were found to bind zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These two forms are similar to the previously reported zzso in several plant zzso The other two forms, with molecular masses of 39 and zzso zzso were found associated with the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both forms are intrinsic membrane proteins and their association with the membrane is calcium zzso This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the presence of these zzso forms in zzso zzso zzso by two phase zzso demonstrated that the zzso form is localized to the plasma zzso zzso analysis showed that the protein level of both zzso and zzso increases gradually reaching a maximum level after one day of low temperature zzso The protein zzso was similar in both hardy and less hardy zzso suggesting that the zzso is not correlated with freezing zzso The results are discussed with respect to the possible role of these new intrinsic membrane zzso in low temperature signal zzso zzso
