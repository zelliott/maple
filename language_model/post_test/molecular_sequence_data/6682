Previous studies in transgenic mice and cultured cells have indicated that the major zzso function for zzso cell expression of the zzso genes is provided by the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso gene expression within cultured mouse zzso cells is highly dependent on zzso To examine the requirement for this factor in zzso we used zzso zzso in embryonic stem cells to generate mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso The most dramatic aspect of the zzso zzso mice was an absence of circulating zzso which led to the death of most animals due to zzso In contrast, the effect of loss of zzso on the zzso lineage was surprisingly zzso Although zzso exhibited severe anemia and zzso zzso changes, probably compounded by zzso zzso surviving adults exhibited only mild changes consistent with a small decrease in the zzso content per zzso zzso zzso mice responded to anemia with zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain synthesis was zzso and switching from fetal to adult zzso progressed zzso Although these findings are consistent with the substitution of zzso function in zzso by one or more zzso zzso gel shift zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso zzso mice failed to reveal novel complexes formed on an zzso binding zzso Thus, regulation of zzso gene zzso through zzso binding sites in zzso is more complex than has been previously zzso
