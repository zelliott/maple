The zzso gene has been isolated by the zzso zzso and is localized at zzso zzso a frequent site for zzso zzso in various zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso is zzso with zzso D1 and zzso in zzso of various zzso The mechanisms of zzso regulation remain zzso The zzso region zzso of the zzso gene is long, encompasses several upstream zzso and is predicted to fold in a strong secondary structure, suggesting that its translation might be regulated by an internal zzso entry zzso Here we show that initial experiments using zzso and zzso reporter zzso supported this zzso However, the application of in zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso revealed promoter activity of the zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso DNA zzso normal and zzso forms of zzso zzso fragments cloned in a zzso expression zzso and direct zzso zzso analysis revealed that upstream zzso triplets in the zzso of the zzso transcript abrogate zzso Alternative zzso mechanisms in specific cell types and/or zzso stage may evade this translation zzso Control experiments suggest that the zzso from zzso virus, when inserted at the zzso of a zzso zzso is also able to function as a cryptic zzso
