To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron zzso acquisition in zzso plants, a zzso analysis of gene expression during zzso zzso stress was conducted using a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by zzso zzso Of these zzso a putative basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso named zzso was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was induced exclusively by zzso zzso and not by deficiencies in other zzso zzso of the barley zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso was also induced by zzso zzso An in zzso search revealed that zzso is highly zzso among zzso plants, which include zzso zzso and zzso The zzso amplification and selection of targets zzso technique revealed that zzso bound zzso to the sequence zzso and the zzso mobility shift zzso revealed zzso as the core sequence for zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The core sequence of the zzso sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of zzso zzso genes than in the corresponding regions of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in the regulation of gene expression under zzso zzso
