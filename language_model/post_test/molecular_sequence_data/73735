A cluster of zzso zzso genes has been cloned and zzso from a zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1904 zzso zzso DNA isolated as zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene order was zzso with zzso transcribed zzso from the zzso zzso Although other zzso bacteria show similar zzso zzso this arrangement for zzso is thus far zzso zzso from the zzso zzso two open reading frames zzso and zzso having unknown functions were zzso zzso analysis of the end of a zzso cloned DNA zzso showed that zzso was zzso zzso from the zzso gene coding for zzso zzso A tree representation of zzso acid sequence zzso relationships of 31 zzso zzso zzso from various organisms revealed two zzso groups: one with zzso of zzso zzso and one with zzso of zzso zzso which are zzso This divergence was not observed in zzso because an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring no zzso activity was zzso by the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso activity was zzso when zzso zzso was grown in the presence of zzso amounts of zzso or zzso zzso may repress the zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso by using 11 identified DNA motifs which resemble the zzso coli zzso box consensus and which are in most cases separated by multiples of 11 zzso corresponding to a DNA zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are zzso zzso Their putative promoters are 6 zzso apart and are partially overlapped by putative zzso boxes, suggesting concerted zzso zzso
