An alternatively spliced zzso of a zzso nuclear orphan zzso zzso was identified and designated as zzso As a result of retaining zzso 5 of this zzso zzso zzso zzso a truncated zzso with the complete zzso domain zzso zzso expression of both zzso was confirmed using a zzso expression zzso In the zzso the expression of the two zzso zzso was elevated in the zzso with distinct profiles beginning at zzso zzso expression increased at zzso day 18, peaked between day 20 and day 24 and remained at high levels throughout adulthood, whereas zzso expression was elevated zzso at zzso day zzso Among separated primary germ cells and established zzso cell lines, zzso was expressed highly in zzso and zzso germ cells and zzso in a zzso cell line and a germ cell line, but not expressed in a zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso was expressed at a much lower level in all the zzso cell types zzso In adult zzso blocked at germ cell development by vitamin A depletion or zzso zzso expression was dramatically reduced whereas zzso was highly zzso Based upon the zzso expression patterns of these zzso it was suggested that zzso was specific to zzso and zzso germ cells whereas zzso was enriched in early germ cell populations such as zzso zzso The biological activities of zzso and zzso on a direct repeat zzso zzso acid zzso response element zzso reporter gene was examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of this reporter whereas zzso enhanced zzso induction of the same reporter, and the opposite biological effects of these zzso were zzso zzso experiments provided evidence for a direct interaction of zzso but not zzso with DNA fragments containing this zzso zzso roles of zzso and zzso on zzso induction of promoters containing this particular zzso are zzso
