Current knowledge of parameters affecting zzso stability is very restricted in zzso Here we investigated factors which might contribute to the stability of a particular plant zzso zzso To this end, zzso and deletion zzso were made in two different zzso and an zzso of the transcribed region of a well zzso zzso gene zzso zzso genes were expressed under the control of a strong zzso specific promoter zzso and zzso in zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso Northern analysis revealed the importance of the zzso of the mature zzso zzso with respect to its zzso in transgenic zzso Enlargement of the 3' zzso region by several hundred zzso reduced the steady state zzso level zzso the introduction of a stop zzso leading to premature termination of translation of the zzso led to a dramatic decrease of the steady state zzso zzso
