The zzso of integral membrane proteins to specific zzso is necessary to maintain the functional integrity of zzso zzso Recent studies indicate zzso that retrieval and retention mechanisms, requiring specific primary sequence zzso are used to ensure that proteins reside in specific zzso of the zzso and zzso pathways and zzso that these zzso exist as components of two juxtaposed systems separated by the zzso of the zzso zzso
