The secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined by zzso qualitative inspection of the sequential zzso involving C alpha zzso C beta H and zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso exchange experiment were used to confirm the secondary structure assignment and to demonstrate the zzso and stability of the zzso After the secondary structure elements were established, the global fold of the protein and the zzso binding site have been determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso as primary source of zzso The secondary structure and the global fold of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appeared to be very similar, differences are observed zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a central parallel zzso including five strands surrounded on both sides by a pair of zzso
