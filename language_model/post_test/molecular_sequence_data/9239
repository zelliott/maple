zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that regulate a variety of biological zzso The latest version of the zzso database zzso zzso includes zzso mouse and zzso rat mature zzso Only one new rat mature zzso was added to the rat zzso database from version 16 to version 18 of zzso suggesting that many rat zzso remain to be zzso Given the importance of rat as a model zzso discovery of the completed set of rat zzso is necessary for understanding rat zzso zzso In this study, next generation sequencing zzso zzso analysis and zzso technologies were applied to discover novel zzso in rat zzso zzso was zzso to analyze the sequences of the small zzso generated from zzso analysis of rat kidney zzso Hundreds of novel zzso candidates were examined according to the zzso of their reads to the rat zzso presence of sequences that can form a zzso hairpin structure around the mapped locations, zzso zzso patterns, and the levels of their expression determined by both zzso and zzso zzso Nine novel rat hairpin precursor zzso zzso were discovered with high zzso Five of the novel zzso are also reported in other species while four of them are rat zzso In zzso 9 novel zzso zzso novel mature zzso were identified via combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
