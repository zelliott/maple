From zzso to humans, zzso and zzso small zzso particles play key roles in crucial zzso processing zzso Various such particles are required for zzso zzso steps and/or for chemical modification of zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso and perhaps even zzso Each zzso particle contains a small zzso possessing zzso C and D, as well as related zzso and zzso sequence zzso whereas each zzso particle contains a small zzso featuring zzso H and zzso sequence zzso Recently published studies highlight the importance of sequence and structural elements of these zzso in the zzso activity and assembly of the zzso zzso A novel sequence element, the zzso body box, found at the zzso of stem structures within a subset of zzso small zzso mediates the specific retention of particles containing these elements inside zzso zzso zzso Two highly zzso zzso the zzso and zzso boxes, have been identified in the 3' stem of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso sequence elements are necessary for early zzso zzso events and consequently for mature zzso zzso zzso Finally, convincing evidence has been provided that the zzso C and D sequence motifs of zzso small zzso fold into a zzso structure, called a zzso that provides a platform for assembly of zzso zzso zzso
