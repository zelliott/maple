The zzso family of zzso factors comprises many members which contribute to diverse cellular functions that vary depending upon the zzso and zzso zzso Recently, different groups have identified a novel member of the zzso family that is zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso this gene is designated currently as zzso In order to understand zzso regulatory mechanisms zzso by zzso we investigated its effect on the human zzso 4 gene promoter based upon the role of zzso 4 in early differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso suppressed zzso zzso 4 promoter activity in both zzso and cervical zzso cancer cell lines, a novel result, while simultaneously zzso the zzso linked zzso zzso Furthermore, serial deletion zzso of the zzso 4 promoter continued to be suppressed by zzso a phenomenon that was only partially rescued by zzso zzso domain zzso but completely zzso by deletion of the zzso pointed zzso These results suggest that zzso may have dual functions in the zzso regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso One of these functions may not be exclusively zzso through DNA binding in the context of zzso suppression of the zzso 4 zzso
