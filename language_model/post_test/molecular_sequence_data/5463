The zzso gene in zzso produces a zzso fusion protein in which zzso is fused in frame to a tail protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Barrio et zzso zzso The tail protein is incorporated into the zzso and zzso is thought to act as a zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso was cloned by Barrio et zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso followed by a large zzso and then the first coding zzso We report that the large zzso of zzso contains an open reading frame, which produces a zzso protein zzso that is zzso in zzso from zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso begins at the same start zzso However, alternate zzso of the primary transcript produces two structurally unrelated zzso This is the second reported instance of two structurally unrelated proteins being produced via alternate zzso suggesting that this form of zzso organization may be more common than previously zzso
