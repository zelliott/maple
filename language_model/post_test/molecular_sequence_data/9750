Basic zzso element binding zzso protein is a newly identified member of the zzso zinc finger family that also includes the zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso This family of proteins binds zzso motifs widely distributed in gene zzso resulting in distinct zzso or repression of zzso zzso Whereas zzso proteins are zzso zzso expression of zzso appears more limited and has not been documented in the female zzso tract of any zzso zzso This study was designed to identify and characterize the cellular distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso at known stages of zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso detected zzso zzso that zzso in size (5 zzso to that of the major zzso transcript in rat zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso were higher zzso zzso zzso in zzso than zzso at corresponding days of pregnancy, although for each zzso the levels did not change with pregnancy stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells isolated from pregnancy zzso expressed the zzso zzso but zzso abundance varied with cell type zzso GE zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using an zzso generated against the zzso region of a zzso zzso fusion protein produced in zzso coli revealed the presence of zzso protein only in zzso not in zzso zzso studies localized zzso predominantly to the zzso of zzso GE and zzso zzso zzso with the presence of functional zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso containing multiple zzso motifs was demonstrated in nuclear extracts prepared from zzso and from zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso cells by zzso mobility shift zzso These results demonstrate the preferential zzso zzso expression of zzso and suggest its regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
