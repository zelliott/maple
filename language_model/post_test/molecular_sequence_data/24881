zzso the zzso zzso of the intermediate compartment zzso into the array of zzso zzso is a crucial step in membrane zzso but it is poorly zzso To gain insight into this step, we investigated the dynamics by which zzso zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso associate with, and zzso incoming zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso cycle via zzso zzso between the zzso complex and a constellation of mobile structures that we call late zzso zzso These stations are intermediate between the zzso and the zzso in terms of zzso and they receive cargo from earlier zzso elements and deliver it to the zzso zzso Late zzso elements are transient in nature and sensitive to zzso they are seen in only a fraction of fixed cells, whereas they are always visible in living zzso Finally, late zzso stations undergo zzso fusion and establish zzso connections between themselves and the zzso Overall, these features indicate that late zzso stations mediate the transition between zzso elements and the zzso zzso
