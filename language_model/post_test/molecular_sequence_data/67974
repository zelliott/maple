zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso are the main component of the zzso zzso zzso which encloses a zzso zzso containing the viral zzso zzso In this study we characterize a panel of zzso zzso zzso against zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso are analyzed by zzso of intact zzso or of released zzso zzso and by Western zzso using a series of zzso truncated zzso zzso Nine of the zzso recognize zzso on the zzso surface, whereas five require zzso of zzso by disruption of the zzso Several of the zzso are capable of zzso the zzso this is most probably due to virus zzso by the zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso (the 6 Western zzso zzso were zzso zzso three major zzso regions of the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is included in the 66 zzso zzso zzso and is not accessible on the zzso surface, suggesting that the zzso is internally located in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognize zzso in the region of zzso acids zzso which is part of the first predicted zzso structure of zzso The third zzso region is in the second predicted zzso between zzso acids zzso where the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was found to be independent of the zzso assembly factor proteins zzso and zzso zzso studies of the truncated proteins reveal that molecules zzso of zzso or more zzso from the zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso
