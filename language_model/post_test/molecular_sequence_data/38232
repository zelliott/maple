zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity is regulated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the active zzso zzso and experimental data suggest that the zzso might stabilize zzso in an optimal zzso for zzso activity by bridging two zzso regions of the zzso The sequence requirements for this mechanism were examined both in zzso and ex zzso by means of zzso peptides and zzso zzso The results of in zzso experiments suggested that zzso is not an all or nothing zzso With the exception of the smallest zzso the zzso peptides bound to zzso activated it, and zzso with the zzso zzso but all of this occurred with reduced zzso When added to the medium of infected cells, most of the peptides inhibited infectious virus production to varying degrees in a zzso manner and in accordance with their in zzso activity on zzso We interpret this zzso to be due to unscheduled zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequences from 19 zzso zzso revealed a limited number of zzso sequence zzso These features were in agreement with the experimental zzso We conclude that binding and zzso of zzso by zzso may be zzso and this zzso may be an integral aspect of the in zzso regulation of zzso activity in the course of virus zzso The zzso zzso binding domain is therefore a potential target for the development of zzso zzso
