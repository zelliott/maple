The period gene is a key regulator of biological zzso in zzso zzso The central part of the gene encodes a zzso zzso repeat that has been implicated in the evolution of both zzso and zzso zzso We have previously observed that length variation in the repeat follows a zzso zzso in Europe and North Africa, so we have sought to extend this observation to the southern zzso We observe a parallel zzso in Australia for one of the two major length zzso and find higher levels of some zzso length zzso particularly at the tropical latitudes, that are extremely rare in zzso In addition we examined zzso zzso from sub-Saharan Africa and find a very different and far more variable profile of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso content of the repeat from all three zzso reveals a possible mechanism that may explain how the repeat initially arose in the ancestors of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Our results further reinforce the view that zzso selection may have contributed to shaping the zzso patterns of zzso zzso
