zzso zzso in the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso are associated with a novel syndrome characterized by partial zzso and severe insulin zzso Here we have further characterized the properties of natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated the efficacy of putative natural zzso and synthetic zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in rescuing zzso zzso zzso A range of natural zzso failed to activate the zzso zzso and their zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso were markedly zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso corrected defects in zzso binding and zzso recruitment by the zzso zzso restoring zzso function comparable with zzso zzso zzso zzso via recruitment of zzso contributes to zzso zzso of wild type by the zzso and zzso zzso and the introduction of an artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso their zzso zzso More complete zzso zzso release and reversal of zzso zzso was achieved with zzso than zzso zzso Modeling suggests a structural basis for these zzso both zzso destabilize zzso 12 to favor zzso zzso conversely, zzso makes more extensive contacts than zzso within the zzso pocket, to stabilize zzso 12, zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso was a more potent zzso of zzso target gene zzso expression in peripheral blood zzso cells with the zzso zzso Having shown that zzso is of variable and limited efficacy in these subjects, we suggest that zzso may represent a more rational therapeutic zzso
