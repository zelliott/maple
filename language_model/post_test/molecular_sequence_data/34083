zzso variation of zzso proteins allows pathogens to evade zzso zzso The variable protein commonly includes a zzso region zzso which represents a key target for zzso and is therefore predicted to be zzso To understand the zzso of zzso zzso we analyzed the clinically important zzso M proteins of the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso by M proteins were directed almost exclusively against the zzso part and not against the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for mice and humans with invasive zzso zzso Nevertheless, only zzso zzso protected efficiently against infection, as shown by passive zzso The zzso fused to an unrelated protein zzso no zzso zzso that it is inherently zzso zzso These data indicate that the M protein zzso zzso zzso attack not only through zzso variation but also by weak zzso a paradoxical observation that may apply to other zzso zzso
