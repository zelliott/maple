zzso analysis of mouse zzso has demonstrated the importance of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso for anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have also been identified in several human families with multiple zzso hormone zzso To identify additional zzso regulators of zzso development, we screened an adult zzso zzso zzso library for zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso gene expressing two alternatively spliced zzso products, which zzso proteins of zzso and 317 zzso zzso zzso The proteins have been named zzso and zzso since they are highly related to zzso zzso is expressed in both developing and adult zzso zzso eye and brain zzso suggesting an important role in development and maintenance of anterior zzso zzso was mapped close to zzso on mouse zzso 3, in a region having extensive zzso zzso with zzso zzso These data make the human zzso zzso a candidate gene for zzso syndrome, an zzso disorder with variable zzso zzso eye and zzso zzso
