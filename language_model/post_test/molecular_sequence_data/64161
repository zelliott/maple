zzso forms of the zzso zzso were expressed in human cells and used to compare their structural and functional properties with those described for other members of the zzso protein zzso zzso was found to occur in two charge zzso that differ in the extent of zzso of otherwise identical zzso complex type zzso zzso analysis with both circular zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso showed a lack of significant structural changes upon calcium addition or zzso This finding is in contrast to results obtained for several other zzso family members and indicates that the zzso zzso domain in zzso is zzso The lack of conservation of important functional features common to several other members of the zzso family indicates that zzso despite its sequence zzso to zzso has evolved clearly distinct zzso
