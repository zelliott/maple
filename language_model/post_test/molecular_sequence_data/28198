We have studied the expression of X alpha zzso a member of the zzso zzso family in zzso zzso Small amounts of X alpha zzso zzso are zzso in a range of cell types, but much higher levels are present in zzso and tissue culture zzso In zzso X alpha zzso transcripts accumulate during early zzso but their level declines in more advanced zzso Faithful and efficient initiation of zzso occurred on cloned X alpha zzso injected into zzso even at low template zzso We have examined the amount of transcript produced by various deletion zzso relative to a zzso control zzso The presence of zzso of DNA zzso and zzso of DNA 3' to the initiation site zzso for high levels of promoter activity, although maximum activity required zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The DNA between zzso and zzso was necessary for zzso in zzso and contains several sequence motifs implicated in zzso regulation including three zzso boxes and a sequence resembling a heat shock zzso An 8 zzso deletion that removed the latter element from zzso of zzso DNA reduced promoter activity by zzso
