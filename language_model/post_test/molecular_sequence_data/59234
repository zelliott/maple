zzso is a novel zzso inflammatory protein that possesses weak similarity to the zzso family members of zzso zzso and that is highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso Here we have used the zzso zzso to express zzso human zzso zzso in zzso coli as a fusion protein containing a zzso His tag and a factor zzso zzso site in the zzso The protein was zzso by affinity zzso on zzso acid zzso zzso with factor zzso further zzso by zzso zzso and characterized by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to bind zzso zzso and zzso was determined by dialysis zzso We found that zzso zzso may bind at least seven molecules of zzso in zzso and several molecules in zzso with an affinity for the first bound zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso may zzso bind several molecules of zzso when present in the zzso space, or zzso if localized in zzso compartments where the concentration of zzso is relatively zzso At least eight molecules of zzso were bound in zzso and four in zzso with an affinity just below 1 zzso zzso zzso for the first zzso Thus zzso does not bind significant amounts of zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso are bound zzso and binding of each of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso is accompanied by zzso changes that move zzso zzso to more zzso zzso
