zzso zzso infection is associated with a variety of diseases including gastric zzso zzso is an electron transfer protein containing a zzso zzso prosthetic group and zzso an zzso electron transfer protein under zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported but its zzso role is zzso The aim of this study is to understand a zzso role of zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso 

The zzso gene zzso was cloned from one of clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso and its transcript was zzso by primer extension, Northern zzso and real-time zzso chain reaction in different zzso of an iron zzso The zzso transcript was also zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking a zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso 

zzso sequence of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso open reading frame with a deduced zzso acid sequence having zzso identity to that from the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso The deduced promoter zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso was zzso upstream from the first zzso of zzso The zzso transcript zzso zzso was induced up to zzso in both zzso and zzso strains under zzso conditions, suggesting that the zzso induction is independent to the zzso zzso 

The zzso gene may play an important role in iron zzso zzso
