Three zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The three genes are located near 16 zzso on the zzso coli zzso A strain of zzso coli, zzso incapable of utilizing zzso was used to screen a zzso library of zzso coli for a zzso zzso zzso E1 zzso that allowed for growth on zzso zzso zzso was found to contain all three known zzso genes on a zzso zzso zzso of zzso The products of these zzso genes were identified by zzso of zzso coli strains with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso The gene products from the zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso and zzso of sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene products had the following relative masses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, another product of Mr zzso was zzso The genes have been zzso to reveal an additional open reading frame zzso a putative zzso zzso protein binding site that may control zzso and zzso putative zzso zzso sites for zzso and zzso and sequence zzso for zzso zzso binding sites preceding each of the open reading zzso except for zzso The calculated molecular weight zzso of the gene products derived from the sequence are as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No role is known for zzso although a number of regulatory roles appear to be zzso No obvious zzso termination site zzso to zzso was found and another open reading frame begins after zzso This zzso zzso was isolated separately from zzso and the sequence revealed a protein with a calculated zzso of zzso The zzso gene is followed by repetitive zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes appear to be organized in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
