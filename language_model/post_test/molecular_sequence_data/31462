A novel zzso strain, designed zzso was isolated from tropical forest soil in zzso zzso Province, zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of this strain clearly demonstrated that it belongs to the zzso zzso The strain formed zzso zzso on short zzso that emerged directly from zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso acid including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found as zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso no zzso was zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso acids were not zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences also indicated that the strain should be classified in the zzso zzso and showed that the closest relative was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso data revealed that strain zzso could be readily distinguished from its zzso closest zzso On the basis of these zzso and zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
