zzso isolated from the zzso region of zzso from zzso chick zzso used beta 1 zzso and required either zzso or zzso for attachment to plates coated with type I zzso type II zzso and zzso beta 1 zzso was concentrated in zzso plaques of the zzso zzso on type I zzso type II zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed at least 3 zzso including alpha 3, alpha 5, and putative alpha zzso alpha 5, but not alpha 3, had a higher molecular weight in zzso than in zzso zzso of alpha 3 and alpha 5 were about zzso of that in zzso When the zzso were cultured in the presence of zzso in suspension, the cells zzso into zzso This zzso was dependent on beta 1 zzso and type II zzso
