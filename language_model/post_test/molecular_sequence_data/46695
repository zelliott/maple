Group II zzso zzso reverse zzso that promote zzso zzso zzso zzso and then with the excised zzso form a DNA zzso that mediates zzso mobility by target zzso reverse zzso zzso Here, we show that the primary binding site for the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is within a region of zzso domain IV that includes the start zzso of the zzso zzso This binding is enhanced by other zzso particularly domain I and the zzso zzso and helps position zzso to initiate zzso synthesis in the 3' zzso as occurs during zzso Our results suggest how the zzso functions in zzso zzso and support the hypothesis that the reverse zzso coding region was derived from an independent genetic element that was inserted into a zzso group II zzso
