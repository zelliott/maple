zzso zzso of zzso zzso comprises a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to which addition of zzso to zzso of zzso in zzso b strains is controlled by the gene zzso In zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso however, a zzso is linked to zzso of zzso In order to test the hypothesis that the zzso locus is involved in the expression of zzso from zzso zzso was zzso in strains zzso and zzso and zzso zzso populations from the resulting zzso strains were zzso zzso structural analyses using zzso techniques and zzso mass zzso zzso on zzso zzso and core zzso material zzso as well as zzso on zzso zzso zzso indicated both zzso zzso strains to express only zzso extensions from zzso This provides strong evidence that zzso functions as a zzso adding a zzso to zzso of zzso in these zzso indicating that zzso zzso in the zzso sequence direct alternative functions of the gene zzso
