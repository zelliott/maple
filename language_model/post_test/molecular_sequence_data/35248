zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with a high preference for CDs over zzso In this study, we investigated the roles of zzso zzso in the specificity and zzso properties of zzso by using zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and zzso The three zzso were found to be similar to the zzso zzso regarding zzso zzso and pH zzso Nevertheless, the kinetic parameters for all the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were altered enormously as compared with those of the wild zzso Indeed, the zzso values of zzso for all zzso were strongly zzso Nevertheless, the affinity and zzso efficiency of zzso toward zzso were increased fivefold as compared with those of zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso forms a salt bridge with zzso zzso This bond would maintain the arrangement of side chains of zzso zzso and zzso in a particular orientation that promotes access to the zzso site and maintains the zzso zzso zzso any replacement with zzso zzso acids influenced the flexibility of the gate wall at the zzso binding zzso resulting in changes in zzso zzso
