The decision for a cell to zzso requires passage from zzso to S phase of the cell cycle and initiation of another round of DNA zzso This commitment is a critical one that is tightly regulated by many parallel zzso zzso these pathways zzso to result in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It is, therefore, important to understand all the mechanisms regulating zzso to determine the molecular basis of cell zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel cell cycle zzso designated zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso to the zzso cell cycle zzso zzso Similar to its zzso counterpart, human zzso is able to induce zzso zzso suggesting similar biological zzso zzso zzso is expressed in several human zzso and immortalized cell lines and is only expressed during the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso of zzso protein demonstrates that zzso is nuclear and results in enhanced cell zzso In addition, flow zzso profiles of these cells demonstrate a reduction in zzso zzso Changes in cell cycle regulation can be attributed to the ability of zzso to bind to and prematurely activate zzso independent of zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso cell proliferation is dependent on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso through the use of zzso demonstrates that zzso is an essential component of cell proliferation zzso zzso human zzso is a novel cell cycle protein capable of promoting cell proliferation through the premature zzso of zzso at the zzso phase zzso
