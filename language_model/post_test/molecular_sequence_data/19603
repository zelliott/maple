zzso is an zzso zzso zzso factor and acts high up in the regulatory hierarchy controlling eye and brain development in humans, mice, zzso and zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso is a zzso and its zzso by zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 2 greatly enhances its zzso zzso However, the protein zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso remain zzso Here, we present both in zzso and in zzso evidence to show that protein zzso zzso is a major zzso that directly zzso zzso First, zzso protein zzso directly zzso zzso in zzso Second, zzso Western zzso revealed that both protein zzso and protein zzso interact with zzso Third, zzso of protein zzso in human lens zzso cells leads to zzso of zzso Finally, zzso of protein zzso activity by zzso A or zzso of protein zzso and protein zzso by zzso interference leads to enhanced zzso of zzso Moreover, our results also demonstrate that zzso of zzso by protein zzso significantly zzso its function in regulating expression of both zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that protein zzso 1 acts as a major zzso to zzso zzso and zzso its zzso
