To identify zzso zzso responsible for retinal zzso in three zzso Pakistani zzso 

A thorough zzso examination including zzso examination and zzso was performed, and blood samples were collected from all participating zzso zzso DNA was zzso and zzso linkage and/or exclusion analyses were completed with zzso labeled short tandem repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso scores were zzso and coding zzso along with zzso boundaries of zzso gene were zzso zzso 

zzso examinations of the patients affected in all three families suggested retinal zzso with an early, most probably zzso zzso zzso linkage and/or exclusion analyses localized the critical zzso in all three families to zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso sequencing of zzso identified a zzso zzso site variation in zzso zzso zzso a single base substitution in zzso zzso zzso and a single base deletion in zzso 5: zzso in the three families, zzso All three variations zzso with the disease zzso in their respective families and were absent from ethnically matched control zzso 

These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso in zzso are responsible for retinal zzso in the affected individuals of these zzso Pakistani zzso
