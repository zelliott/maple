Here, we report the recovery of cell zzso from zzso years old mammoth zzso and the injection of those zzso into mouse zzso matured zzso by zzso cell nuclear transfer zzso From both skin and muscle zzso cell zzso structures were successfully zzso Those zzso were then injected into zzso zzso and more than half of the zzso were able to zzso zzso zzso were not taken apart and remained its nuclear zzso Those zzso did not show disappearance of nuclear membrane or premature zzso zzso zzso at 1 hour after injection and did not form zzso structures at 7 hours after zzso As half of the zzso injected with zzso derived from zzso mouse bone zzso cells were able to form zzso structures, it might be possible to promote the cell cycle of zzso from ancient animal zzso by suitable zzso in zzso This is the first report of zzso with zzso derived from mammoth zzso
