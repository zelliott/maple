The proteins zzso by the zzso zzso including zzso are essential for the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso into developing spores of the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso has been determined recently, and a structural zzso search revealed that zzso shares significant structural similarity but not sequence zzso to a group of zzso that bind to and/or act on small aromatic zzso We find that molecular zzso placed zzso exclusively in a highly zzso potential zzso pocket in zzso that is similar to that in the structurally zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso binds both zzso and zzso with a similar zzso while exhibiting markedly weaker binding to other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso in the putative zzso pocket in zzso essentially abolish its zzso zzso Moreover, replacement of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso with any of these zzso gene zzso effectively eliminated zzso zzso into developing spores in zzso although the zzso proteins were still located in the spore inner zzso Our results provide direct evidence that zzso zzso in particular zzso are directly involved in zzso movement into developing zzso zzso zzso
