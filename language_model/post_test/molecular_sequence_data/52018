We have developed a novel method for constructing zzso linking and boundary libraries using a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The restriction zzso could be used to purify the DNA fragments with a specific restriction zzso cutting zzso at their zzso The method uses a zzso and zzso reaction with zzso DNA ends of a zzso zzso which is connected zzso to the surface of the latex zzso zzso is based on the specificity of the restriction zzso for its recognition site, resulting in efficient zzso We applied this technique to the construction of high-quality zzso linking and zzso boundary libraries, which contain almost all the zzso sites of the zzso and, in addition, are free of zzso zzso zzso
