A novel zzso of zzso zzso strategy was developed to identify zzso acid sequence combinations necessary to restore the ability to bind zzso zzso to an inactive zzso zzso zzso in which 10 zzso acids of the third zzso loop of the delta zzso were replaced by the corresponding zzso acids from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso binds a zzso zzso zzso but is devoid of affinity for zzso zzso A library of zzso was generated in which some of the 10 zzso acids of the zzso sequence of zzso were randomly reverted to the corresponding delta zzso zzso Using a zzso binding zzso we screened this library to select zzso with high affinity for zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso revealed that a zzso at position zzso a zzso region zzso acids zzso and an zzso at position zzso of the human zzso zzso were present in all zzso Single and double point zzso were then introduced in zzso to evaluate the contribution of the zzso 300 and zzso zzso zzso for the binding of zzso zzso An increased affinity for zzso zzso was observed when the zzso 300 zzso zzso of zzso was reverted to a zzso zzso zzso Further zzso zzso experiments suggested that the presence of a zzso at position 300 may block the access of zzso zzso to their zzso zzso
