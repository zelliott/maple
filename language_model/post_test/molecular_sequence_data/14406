The biological functions of coiled coils generally depend on efficient folding and perfect pairing of their zzso Dynamic changes in the zzso registry that lead to staggered zzso have only been proposed for a few special systems and not found in generic coiled zzso Here, we report our observations of multiple staggered zzso structures of two zzso coiled zzso The partially folded structures are formed predominantly by coiled zzso zzso and occasionally by zzso zzso Using high-resolution optical zzso we characterized their energies and transition zzso at a zzso zzso The staggered states occur less than zzso of the time and about zzso of the time at zero zzso We conclude that dynamic changes in zzso registry may be a general property of coiled zzso Our findings should have broad and unique implications in functions and zzso of proteins containing coiled zzso
