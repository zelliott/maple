zzso is a tight junction zzso protein that zzso between the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso contains several protein binding sites that allow it to function as a scaffold that clusters zzso zzso and signaling zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso in zzso cells, zzso was silenced in zzso cells with small interference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the gate function of the zzso determined by an increase in zzso flow through the zzso route of mature zzso and achievement of lower zzso electrical resistance values upon zzso de zzso zzso zzso changes in the fence function of the zzso zzso by a zzso distribution of zzso on the plasma zzso zzso altered expression of zzso and zzso junction zzso determined by a decreased amount of zzso and zzso in mature zzso and a delayed arrival to the plasma membrane of zzso zzso and zzso during a calcium switch zzso and zzso an zzso zzso architecture characterized by the appearance of widened zzso spaces, zzso of regions in the culture and an altered pattern of zzso at the cellular zzso
