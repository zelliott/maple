A zzso was developed for zzso regions within the zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These zzso were used to zzso amplify partial zzso sequences from 15 zzso zzso zzso clone libraries were constructed from zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso cultivated under zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences derived from zzso some of which were not previously known to contain zzso genes were used for zzso zzso zzso trees constructed with partial zzso genes were zzso with those based on zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso sequences can be used to identify zzso expressing zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso formed two separate zzso Analysis of clone library data showed a zzso between the presence and the activity of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso gene can be used to characterize the diversity of natural populations of zzso zzso and to characterize gene expression patterns of individual species and zzso
