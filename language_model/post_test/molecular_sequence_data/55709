zzso of the zzso basic protein zzso gene is regulated in a zzso and zzso zzso manner during zzso formation in the zzso central nervous zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene contains several regulatory elements that zzso contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso in cells derived from the central nervous zzso The zzso element, termed zzso which is located between zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start site, has previously been shown to have characteristics of a zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used band shift and zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso proteins in mouse brain nuclear extract which interact with the zzso zzso zzso of these extracts has allowed the identification of a zzso to zzso nuclear zzso derived from mouse brain tissue at the peak of zzso which specifically binds the zzso DNA zzso zzso enriched in the zzso protein have been shown to stimulate zzso of the zzso promoter in extract derived from zzso zzso zzso binding protein activity is expressed in a zzso and development zzso pattern which zzso with the pattern of zzso transcription, suggesting that this protein may be a biologically relevant zzso factor for the zzso gene in zzso
