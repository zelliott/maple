zzso are infectious particles causing zzso zzso zzso zzso They zzso at least in part, of an zzso zzso of the ubiquitous cellular prion protein zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso are evident from increased zzso content and zzso resistance in zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso that can discriminate between the normal and zzso forms of zzso Such an zzso has been long sought as it should be invaluable for characterizing the infectious particle as well as for diagnosis of zzso such as bovine zzso zzso zzso or zzso disease zzso in zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso or human zzso but not zzso suggesting that it recognizes an zzso common to zzso from different zzso Using immobilized synthetic zzso we mapped three zzso segments in zzso as the zzso zzso In the zzso structure of zzso mouse zzso segments 2 and 3 of the zzso zzso are near zzso in space, and segment 1 is located in a different part of the zzso We discuss models for the zzso zzso that ensure close spatial proximity of all three zzso zzso either by zzso contacts in zzso forms of the prion protein or by zzso zzso
