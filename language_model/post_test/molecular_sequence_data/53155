Although zzso and zzso are not universally present in bacteria, they are present in various zzso species as determined by Southern zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and were shown to be zzso from two promoters zzso and zzso which were identified upstream of zzso by primer zzso zzso analysis of zzso and alignment with other zzso indicated that it contained the zzso motifs of ABC zzso while sequence alignment of zzso with other published zzso sequences predicted that they all contain four zzso segments and a zzso motif zzso zzso which may prove to be important for zzso zzso The viability of zzso and zzso zzso that were constructed by zzso zzso indicated that these genes are not zzso The role of zzso and zzso is zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso by transmission electron zzso showed that both exhibited zzso abnormalities indicative of defective division sites and in some cases zzso zzso of zzso
