zzso have been detected in humans and several animal species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, and probably zzso While investigating the possibility of zzso infecting additional animal host species, we detected zzso in three zzso samples from domestic Korean black zzso In a maximum zzso tree and a zzso tree, the zzso strain fell within the bovine zzso zzso but the zzso and zzso strains did not fall within any of the known animal zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the partial zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso strain also revealed high zzso acid sequence identity and a close genetic relationship with bovine zzso but the zzso acid sequences of the other two strains had low similarity to those of known zzso zzso from any animal zzso The similarity of the sequence of the zzso strains with the bovine zzso indicate that the infectious may have originated from zzso but the possible source for remaining strains could not be zzso
