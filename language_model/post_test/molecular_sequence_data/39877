The zzso family consists of a group of ubiquitous highly zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that bind zzso zzso zzso zzso and proteins with zzso zzso Some proteins with zzso motifs form complexes that have been implicated in the dynamics of the zzso zzso and processes such as zzso zzso A major unanswered question in the field is how zzso achieves the required specificity to bind such an array of zzso It is now becoming clear that zzso zzso are subject to differential regulation and that they may play distinct roles within the zzso zzso evidence suggests that these zzso have different functional roles in the sorting of diverse proteins with zzso zzso All zzso contain highly zzso aromatic zzso involved in zzso binding which are presumably implicated in the interaction with zzso motif zzso We have previously shown that zzso is zzso on zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso can bind directly to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso We demonstrate that a new region around zzso of zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso domain, recognizes and binds zzso and zzso In zzso binding zzso indicate that zzso type III forms a complex with zzso in a manner that depends on the zzso zzso status within the zzso domain in zzso zzso type III interaction suggests that zzso may be involved in membrane trafficking and in linking the zzso zzso with zzso reorganization zzso
