The ability of certain zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso to bind specifically both type I and type II zzso zzso is perhaps the best zzso but also the worst zzso example in the family of zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the structural variations in zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso together with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal the structural basis for types I and II binding specificity by zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso binding pocket can adopt two different zzso that, in turn, determine the type of zzso (I or zzso able to bind to the zzso The only exceptions are zzso with zzso at positions zzso and zzso that zzso from standard zzso zzso The motion of the zzso zzso depends on the presence of certain zzso located in a key position zzso for zzso near the binding zzso zzso zzso placing aromatic zzso in this key position are zzso By contrast, those presenting zzso or long zzso zzso block the zzso zzso in one of the two possible zzso preventing binding in a type I zzso This is zzso demonstrated by a single zzso in zzso zzso zzso that zzso type I zzso zzso while preserving binding to type II zzso Thus, simple zzso changes, governed by simple rules, can have profound effects on zzso zzso highlighting the importance of structural details to predict zzso zzso
