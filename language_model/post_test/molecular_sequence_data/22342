The zzso is an zzso zzso zzso complex required for the targeting and zzso of zzso zzso to the plasma zzso Through its interactions with a variety of zzso including small zzso the zzso is thought to integrate signals from the cell and signal that zzso arriving at the plasma membrane are ready for zzso Here we describe the three-dimensional crystal structure of one of the components of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso binds the small zzso zzso in a zzso manner with an equilibrium zzso constant of approximately 70 zzso zzso is an extended rod approximately 155 zzso in length composed principally of alpha zzso and is a novel zzso The structure provides a first view of the zzso protein family and provides a framework to study the molecular function of this zzso zzso
