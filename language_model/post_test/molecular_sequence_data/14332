zzso are infectious proteins zzso as zzso zzso zzso The zzso prion of zzso zzso is involved in a cell death process associated with zzso zzso The prion forming domain zzso of zzso adopts a zzso zzso structure characterized by the two fold repetition of an elementary triangular zzso zzso zzso cell death when interacting with zzso an zzso zzso of zzso When zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to the cell membrane and zzso zzso 

Here, comparing zzso zzso from different species, we devise a consensus for the zzso elementary triangular zzso We use this motif to screen zzso databases and find a match to the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso by the gene immediately adjacent to zzso zzso proteins are signal zzso zzso which undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts that the zzso zzso region adopts a zzso zzso We propose that upon zzso zzso these zzso extensions adopt the zzso fold and template zzso to adopt the zzso fold and trigger zzso We extend this model to a putative zzso the zzso infectious element in zzso zzso because the s locus controlling propagation of zzso also encodes a zzso protein and displays analogous zzso Comparative zzso analyses indicate evolutionary conservation of these zzso gene pairs, identify a number of novel prion candidates and zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso two zzso novel putative zzso zzso 

We suggest the existence, in the zzso kingdom, of a widespread and zzso zzso mode of signal zzso based on the transmission of an zzso from a zzso zzso zzso protein to an zzso zzso
