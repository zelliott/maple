The moss zzso zzso has two life cycles, zzso zzso and leafy zzso A modified from of suppression zzso zzso zzso mirror orientation selection zzso was applied to screen genes zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso Using reverse Northern zzso analysis, zzso expressed clones were zzso The identified genes were involved mainly in metal binding and zzso One of these genes was an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which was highly zzso in the zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed significant sequence zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence in the zzso DNA binding zzso Northern analysis under various stress conditions showed that zzso was induced by zzso cadmium, copper, zzso zzso and zzso In addition, it was highly expressed in zzso zzso We suggest that zzso is involved in responses to metals, and that suspension culture enhance the expression of genes responding to zzso
