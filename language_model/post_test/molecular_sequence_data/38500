zzso genes zzso a family of zzso factors, many of which play key roles in animal embryonic development but whose evolutionary relationships and ancestral functions are zzso To address these issues, we are characterizing the zzso gene complement of the coral zzso zzso an zzso zzso As the simplest animals at the tissue level of organization, zzso occupy a key position in animal evolution, and the zzso are the zzso class within this diverse zzso We have identified four zzso genes in zzso two zzso and zzso are zzso of genes identified in other zzso the others zzso and zzso are unique to zzso zzso may be zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearly belongs to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain binds specifically and zzso to zzso binding zzso The recently identified zzso gene zzso belongs to the zzso zzso Clearly, substantial diversification of the zzso family occurred before the zzso zzso zzso The fourth zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso to the ancestral zzso zzso gene and most closely resembles zzso The expression pattern of zzso in putative zzso is consistent with an ancestral role of the zzso family in neural differentiation and zzso We have determined the zzso structure of each zzso zzso gene and show that some zzso sites are shared both between the coral genes and between these and zzso genes in zzso zzso Together, these data support the zzso of the zzso family and indicate ancient origins of several zzso
