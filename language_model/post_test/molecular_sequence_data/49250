Human zzso are a family of zzso peptides that share a pattern of six zzso zzso zzso We describe the cloning and characterization of the zzso of five novel zzso genes zzso clustered on zzso zzso which were identified using a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the occurrence of the transcripts in only a few zzso with the highest abundance in the male zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in human zzso by real-time quantitative zzso revealed a distribution along the functionally different segments of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso for one of the zzso shows zzso restriction to the zzso cell layer of the zzso known to zzso factors responsible for zzso zzso We suggest that the novel peptides carry out zzso functions in the male zzso tract that may not be directly related to bacterial growth zzso in host zzso
