The functional features of a zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso were investigated by expressing at high level in zzso coli a soluble zzso form of zzso The zzso domain of the mature protein zzso zzso the first zzso zzso zzso was zzso from a large-scale zzso After cell zzso the protein was zzso found in the zzso zzso was zzso using zzso and allowed to zzso using two dialysis zzso The zzso protein was obtained in a homogeneous form after ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso The soluble zzso had the ability to form a complex with zzso human basic zzso zzso in solution, as demonstrated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso of a zzso complex was zzso by zzso zzso zzso binding experiments with the zzso immobilized on zzso zzso showed high binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited binding of zzso to its zzso receptors on baby zzso kidney zzso These data suggest that zzso of the zzso is not necessary for its zzso zzso The use of an zzso coli expression system resulted in the efficient production of a soluble zzso in a form suitable for zzso structural studies and screening of new potential zzso and zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso coli can be used for the production of complex molecules such as zzso zzso
