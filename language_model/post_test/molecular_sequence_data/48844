A zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the skin of the medical zzso zzso zzso obtained from a zzso farm located in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing analysis showed that the isolate was grouped in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities to all other species of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the type zzso was found to be the zzso respiratory zzso and the polar zzso profile consisted of the major compounds zzso zzso two unidentified zzso one unknown zzso and two unknown zzso The fatty acid profile was composed of zzso : 0, zzso : 0, summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : 0 zzso found in major amounts and several zzso fatty acids in smaller zzso among them zzso : 0 zzso and zzso : 0 zzso All these data support the allocation of the isolate in the zzso zzso zzso characterization and zzso zzso with the type strains of the most closely related species allowed a clear zzso and zzso differentiation of the zzso Based on these data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
