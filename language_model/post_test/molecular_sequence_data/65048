Type 1 zzso zzso and related zzso proteins had been described in a few zzso zzso zzso a single zzso some zzso and a green zzso In exhaustive database searches, we detected zzso sequences derived not only from additional zzso species but also from organisms belonging to three groups in which zzso had zzso not been zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso plant and human type 1 zzso sequences found in the databases are demonstrated to be zzso of zzso zzso However, a highly zzso sequence supposedly from the plant zzso zzso was found that is, together with the zzso zzso quite similar to zzso zzso These close relationships suggest that at least one horizontal gene transfer event involving zzso genes occurred between zzso and zzso Alternative hypotheses to explain the current zzso range of type 1 zzso are zzso The broader zzso range found is compatible with an ancient origin of type 1 zzso their zzso distribution being caused by losses in multiple zzso However, the possibility of ancient horizontal transfer events between distant relatives cannot be zzso
