zzso are thought to play a key role in regulating gene expression at the level of DNA zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso zzso requires competition of zzso factors with zzso for binding to regulatory regions and that there may be several mechanisms by which this is zzso We have characterized a human zzso assembly zzso zzso previously identified by zzso cloning at zzso a region implicated in several disease processes including zzso tumor zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso indicates that it encodes a protein with a potential nuclear zzso motif and two clusters of highly zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso coli demonstrates that this protein can interact with both core and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso can transfer zzso onto naked DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso demonstrates that both zzso and zzso zzso are required for zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso indicate that it can shuttle between the zzso and the nucleus, suggesting a role as a zzso zzso Given the potential role of the human zzso gene zzso symbol zzso in zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso structure of this gene and have analyzed the zzso status of zzso in sporadic zzso Our results, coupled with tumor suppression zzso in zzso zzso cells, do not support a role for zzso in the zzso of zzso A putative role for zzso in regulating cellular differentiation is zzso
