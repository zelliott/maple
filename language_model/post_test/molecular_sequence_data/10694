We have recently identified zzso as a new growth regulator and a member of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso has certain characteristics that are different from those of the classical members of the zzso family, zzso and transforming growth factor zzso including zzso responses on several normal cells and binding to zzso receptors on zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study we cloned and identified the expression of human zzso zzso The human zzso gene zzso a zzso putative zzso precursor containing an zzso domain in the internal segment, and the structural organization was similar to that of other members of the zzso family that bind to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the expression of human zzso to be mainly on peripheral blood zzso and the zzso in normal zzso and was highest on zzso zzso cell lines in various types of zzso cell zzso The expression profile was quite different from that of other members of the zzso family in normal and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells also showed that human zzso was zzso as a soluble form of zzso 5 zzso that is biologically active on the basis of the stimulation of DNA zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is involved in certain zzso processes such as maintenance or development of normal cell growth, and the progression of zzso
