zzso a stem cell marker, has been shown to be expressed on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses suggest the following differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, we examined zzso zzso gene expression on these zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction analysis zzso We were able to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma in all zzso zzso subsets, consistent with previous functional zzso We found zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso and zzso zzso zzso we investigated T cell zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our results show that a full-length zzso transcript and the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso were already expressed in the zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso transcripts were also detected in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of zzso beta gene zzso showed that zzso or zzso zzso of zzso cells are in a zzso beta zzso zzso although zzso beta zzso had already started in this zzso
