zzso injection of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso reliably promotes zzso zzso However, zzso to the zzso effects of zzso has been shown to occur during short term zzso zzso To determine whether humans would remain responsive to prolonged exposure to zzso and to study the mechanism of action of zzso we compared the effects of a zzso zzso infusion of either zzso or normal saline on parameters of zzso zzso concentration in nine healthy young zzso Each infusion was administered from zzso h on day 1 to zzso h on day zzso zzso was given as a 1 zzso loading zzso then at the rate of 1 zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso was given at zzso h on day 2, followed by zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso 1 zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso and then a zzso of zzso (1 zzso at 1600 zzso The integrated zzso concentration zzso and parameters of zzso zzso concentration were calculated for the period between zzso h on day 1 to zzso h on day 2, and zzso was calculated for 2 h after each zzso of zzso or zzso During zzso infusion, there was a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso 450 zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso maximum pulse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mean pulse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso growth zzso increased from 252 zzso 23 to 312 zzso 23 zzso There was no change in either zzso pulse frequency or zzso zzso zzso During zzso infusion, the zzso responses to the zzso zzso were zzso however, baseline zzso was lower, and the zzso and zzso responses to zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso We conclude that the zzso remains sensitive to zzso during a prolonged zzso zzso The mechanisms of the zzso effect on zzso zzso are uncertain, and the possibility that zzso acts as a functional zzso zzso is zzso The contrasting effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso could be due to differential effects of zzso on the zzso and zzso
