zzso zzso in the coat protein of zzso zzso severely restrict formation of infectious particles at restrictive zzso A set of 25 zzso zzso which had been localized to regions of the coat gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Parr, zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso define 17 sites of single zzso acid zzso by DNA zzso zzso assembled from the zzso proteins at zzso temperature were not zzso at restrictive temperature, nor defective in the infectious zzso At restrictive temperature, zzso zzso zzso chains were zzso at near zzso zzso These inactive chains were not zzso within the zzso The zzso chains failed to interact with scaffolding proteins to form the zzso precursor zzso and they did not zzso with each to form zzso zzso Rather, the zzso coat protein accumulated as zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of inclusion zzso The results indicate that the chains fail to reach the zzso needed for zzso or zzso zzso These zzso appear to be of the class of zzso folding zzso which destabilize an intermediate in the zzso folding zzso
