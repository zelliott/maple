Members of the zzso zzso protein associated with the nucleus mapped to the X zzso family of zzso zzso are promising targets for tumor zzso because they are normally expressed exclusively during zzso on the zzso side of the zzso barrier, an immune privileged zzso 

This study analyzed the human zzso zzso organization, as well as zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso and cancer zzso The zzso family consists of five zzso one of which is zzso all located in a gene cluster at zzso From the zzso the arrangement of the five zzso genes mapped on one zzso sequence is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated expression of zzso zzso in melanoma and zzso cell lines, and virtual Northern analysis established zzso gene expression in numerous cancer cell zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso confirmed the translation of zzso proteins in melanoma and zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso proteins migrated between zzso 15,000 and zzso 20,000 similar to those observed in zzso zzso labeling of melanoma cells and tissue sections demonstrated zzso protein zzso in the nucleus, zzso or zzso zzso in melanoma cells with nuclear zzso the protein was associated with the nuclear zzso a zzso similar to that observed in human zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was greatest in the more aggressive skin tumors, particularly in distant, zzso zzso zzso 

The data zzso suggest that the zzso protein may be a useful target in cancer zzso
