zzso is required for zzso fruit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prevents or delays zzso but it is not known how these genes are modulated during normal zzso zzso a previously zzso tomato zzso zzso was shown by gel zzso zzso to interact with the promoter of zzso an zzso zzso gene expressed during zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in tomato fruit, using zzso gene zzso greatly reduced zzso zzso levels, and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by viral delivery to developing flowers elsewhere on injected plants triggered altered floral organ zzso including production of multiple flowers within one zzso zzso fusion of zzso and zzso and conversion of zzso into zzso structures that grew into fruits and zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is not only involved in the control of zzso but also plays a critical role in floral zzso
