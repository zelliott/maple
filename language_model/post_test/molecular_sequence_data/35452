Light, the driving force of photosynthesis, can be harmful when present in zzso therefore, any light harvesting system requires zzso Members of the extended zzso complex zzso protein zzso are involved in light harvesting as well as in zzso and are found in the red and green plant zzso with a complex distribution pattern of zzso in the different zzso zzso 

Here, we demonstrate that the recently discovered zzso lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso family within this protein zzso The occurrence of zzso was found to be restricted to the red zzso zzso including red algae (with primary zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso (with secondary zzso of red zzso zzso zzso of a full-length zzso fusion construct in the zzso zzso zzso confirmed the predicted zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we observed that similarly to the zzso zzso zzso zzso antenna proteins also zzso transcripts in zzso were regulated in a zzso way at standard light conditions and strongly zzso at high light zzso 

The absence of zzso from the green lineage implies that zzso evolved in the red lineage after separation from the the green zzso During the evolution of secondary zzso zzso genes therefore must have been transferred from the nucleus of the zzso zzso to the nucleus of the host cell, a process that involved zzso with zzso allowing import of the gene product into the secondary zzso bound by four zzso Based on zzso zzso and on zzso data, we propose that zzso might participate in the light zzso and zzso structural or functional zzso of the zzso antennae of the zzso upon dark to light shifts as regularly experienced by zzso in zzso zzso in zzso of the red lineage as well as in green lineage zzso the zzso based zzso light harvesting system has been replaced by light harvesting systems that are based on members of the extended zzso protein zzso either for one of the zzso zzso I of red zzso or for both zzso In their proposed function, the zzso protein family may thus have played a role in the evolutionary structural zzso of zzso antennae in the red zzso
