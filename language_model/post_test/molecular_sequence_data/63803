The zzso gene family encodes critical regulators determining floral organ zzso zzso evolutionary patterns and processes of zzso genes is an important step toward unraveling the molecular basis of floral zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the evolution of zzso genes of the zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso lineage in the zzso zzso and is intriguing in evolving zzso zzso zzso in two major lineages within the zzso The gene zzso reconstructed using zzso DNA and zzso sequences suggests multiple zzso gene zzso events in zzso An ancient zzso event resulted in two ancient zzso zzso and zzso which have highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso further resulted in two zzso in one zzso of zzso the zzso group that does not produce modified zzso Most species analyzed were found to contain more than one copy of the zzso gene with most copies derived recently within zzso zzso and comparison of zzso ratios revealed relaxed selection in the zzso gene in zzso in comparison with the gene in the closely related zzso zzso and zzso and in other flowering zzso zzso also differed among major gene copies, zzso and zzso and among different zzso zzso of zzso Variation in selection pressures may indicate functional changes in zzso genes after gene zzso and among different zzso Strong positive selection at three zzso acid sites of zzso was also detected from a region critical for zzso zzso Total substitution rates of the zzso gene also differ among lineages of zzso showing a trend similar to that found in zzso zzso We also found that the zzso copy contains zzso zzso information when compared across species of zzso
