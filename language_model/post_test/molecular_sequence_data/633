In this study, we characterized the full-length zzso sequences of 13 distinct zzso C virus zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These were zzso using zzso from the zzso of patients now residing in Canada, 11 of which were African zzso The resulting zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso in length and each contains a single zzso of zzso zzso The sequences showed zzso similarities of zzso % in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso % in comparison with zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso reference zzso These similarities were often higher than those currently defined by zzso zzso criteria for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso division, zzso Further analyses of the complete and partial E1 and partial zzso sequences confirmed these 13 zzso assigned zzso
