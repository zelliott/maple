zzso zzso zzso are a major health concern in tropical and zzso zzso zzso infection is considered endemic to West Africa but has also been identified in Uganda, East Africa, among primates (including zzso However, the zzso and ecology of zzso in Uganda have not been zzso except for in chimpanzees zzso zzso which are infected by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We studied zzso in Uganda in a community of zzso primates that live in close proximity to zzso zzso estimates based on zzso were lower than those based on zzso chain reaction zzso indicating greater sensitivity of zzso zzso varied among host species, with humans and red zzso zzso zzso infected at lowest prevalence zzso and zzso by zzso respectively), and zzso olive zzso zzso zzso and zzso monkeys zzso zzso infected at highest prevalence zzso by zzso in all three zzso zzso zzso showed that primates travelling further and in smaller groups are at greatest risk of zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed three cryptic zzso of zzso that were not distinguishable based on zzso characteristics of their zzso Of these, the zzso with the greatest host range had not previously been described zzso This novel zzso zzso humans, as well as five other species of zzso 

Multiple cryptic forms of zzso circulate in the people and primates of western Uganda, and zzso zzso differ in host range and zzso transmission zzso Our results expand knowledge about human zzso infection beyond the West African countries of zzso and Ghana, where the zzso is a known public health zzso zzso infection in humans may be common throughout zzso Africa, and the transmission of this neglected zzso among zzso including zzso transmission, may vary among host communities depending on their location and zzso
