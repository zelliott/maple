In certain zzso a lost zzso including hand and foot, can be completely replaced through zzso zzso The zzso process involves cellular activities similar to those described for zzso Working on the assumption that the zzso pattern specific for a zzso or a zzso is controlled by different gene activities in the two zzso we employed a zzso differential display screen for the detection of candidate limb identity zzso Using this approach, we have isolated a zzso gene which in zzso and developing limbs reveals properties expected of a gene having a role in controlling limb zzso zzso it is exclusively expressed in the zzso but not zzso zzso during embryonic development its expression is zzso with zzso bud formation, zzso it has an elevated message level throughout the zzso limb bud and the zzso respectively, and zzso it is expressed only in zzso but not in zzso zzso This novel zzso gene shares a zzso zzso domain, the zzso with putative zzso factors including the zzso zzso gene zzso In a following zzso screen, we used the zzso zzso zzso motif and amplified a family of related genes in the zzso their different expression patterns in normal and zzso zzso zzso and tail suggest, in general, an important role of zzso proteins in zzso pattern zzso
