A zzso acid zzso and three other structurally related peptides were isolated from rabbit fetal and adult zzso These zzso zzso and zzso peptides inhibit zzso zzso rat adrenal cell zzso zzso The zzso was called zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and was shown to be zzso from its zzso acid zzso Its sequence was determined on a zzso zzso The structure of zzso is zzso zzso - zzso zzso was found to markedly inhibit zzso zzso production by rat adrenal cells in zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso did not affect the stimulation of zzso synthesis by zzso II in rat zzso zzso cells but it did suppress zzso zzso synthesis in whole adrenal cells, demonstrating that zzso is a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso The minimum effective concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was 5 zzso (20 zzso the zzso zzso effective zzso was 25 zzso and zzso was completely inhibited at zzso greater than 500 zzso (2 zzso
