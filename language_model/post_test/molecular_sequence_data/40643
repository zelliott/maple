The type III zzso system of the zzso zzso consists of 6 integral membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, in some other type III zzso systems, a zzso of zzso is apparently zzso suggesting it has a specialized zzso zzso the zzso gene from the zzso of a zzso strain of zzso resulted in a drastic decrease of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strain in zzso zzso gave rise to zzso containing zzso bypass zzso in zzso at positions zzso or zzso Using membrane zzso prediction programs, and alkaline zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso into the zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso is zzso with its zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso or zzso was able to rescue zzso of the zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso 91 in the zzso domain was identified to be important for zzso Based on secondary structure zzso the zzso domain, zzso should contain zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and studied using circular zzso zzso however, this domain was zzso and its structure was a mixture of zzso and random zzso zzso of full-length zzso with zzso increased expression levels of zzso but zzso with the zzso domain of zzso did not enhance zzso expression zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso further rescued zzso of strains deleted for the zzso gene expressing bypass zzso in zzso These results suggest zzso maintains zzso stability through zzso domain zzso The results also demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso has zzso and it presumably becomes structured while interacting with its binding zzso
