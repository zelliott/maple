The zzso gene was originally identified as a zzso zzso zzso isolated from nerve growth zzso zzso cells by differential display against zzso zzso It is transcribed solely in zzso of neuroendocrine cells in zzso and it is induced by zzso in target cells in zzso The zzso human zzso gene was isolated from a zzso zzso The gene spans approximately 6 zzso and contains two zzso The entire zzso protein is zzso by zzso 2, while zzso 1 contains only zzso zzso The structural organization of the human gene is similar to that described for the rat zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1991, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and both the translated and the untranslated regions show a high degree of sequence zzso to the rat zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a single transcript of approximately zzso zzso that was detected only in zzso preparations from zzso The gene was assigned to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
