zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are zzso zzso of zzso that contain three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain forms the zzso binding zzso The zzso domain forms the zzso zzso The zzso domain is involved in trafficking, zzso and zzso by zzso second zzso systems but its role in channel assembly and function is poorly understood and little is known about its zzso The zzso domain is formed by the large zzso zzso loop between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lack a large zzso zzso We replaced the complete zzso loop zzso zzso zzso in the zzso type 3A zzso zzso with a zzso from the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso and pharmacological characteristics of the zzso zzso receptors were comparable to zzso wild zzso The channels remained zzso but the zzso single channel zzso was zzso zzso as compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a protein that zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso currents with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso A similar deletion of the zzso loop in the zzso zzso zzso yielded functional, zzso zzso zzso These results imply that the zzso loop is not essential for zzso assembly and function and suggest that the zzso domain may fold as an independent module from the zzso and zzso zzso
