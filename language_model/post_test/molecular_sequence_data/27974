zzso in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso To characterize this effect in detail, a collection of zzso spontaneous zzso zzso arising in a strain having a disrupted zzso gene was analyzed by DNA zzso The resulting zzso spectrum was compared to that derived from an examination of 222 spontaneous zzso selected in a zzso zzso zzso zzso This comparison revealed that the zzso zzso was associated with an increase in the frequency of zzso zzso All possible types of substitution were detected but there was a reduction in the relative fraction of zzso transitions and an increase in the proportion of zzso zzso These changes were sufficient to cause a twofold greater preference for zzso at zzso sites in the zzso strain despite a decrease in the fraction of zzso zzso There were also considerable differences between the zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso changes occurred at fewer sites in the zzso strain but the zzso sites included several that were not detected in the zzso zzso Only two of the four sites that were zzso most frequently in the zzso strain were also prominent in the zzso strain and zzso zzso at almost all sites common to both strains were greater for the zzso zzso Although single zzso deletions occurred in the two strains with similar zzso several classes of zzso that were recovered in the zzso background including multiple zzso zzso insertions of the zzso zzso element zzso and more complex changes, were not detected in the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
