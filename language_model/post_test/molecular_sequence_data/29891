We have used genetic and zzso techniques to study zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a purple zzso zzso zzso All nine identified zzso genes are located within the zzso pair photosynthesis gene zzso and eight of the zzso genes form a zzso We have studied the zzso structure of the zzso gene cluster using zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sites in 10 zzso have been mapped to high resolution zzso base zzso by Southern zzso Two insertions each map within the coding regions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one zzso lies within the zzso zzso The zzso in zzso is not polar on the downstream zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may form two separate zzso Another zzso located in the zzso zzso region between the divergent zzso and zzso genes has no effect on zzso pigmentation and apparently lies between the promoters for these zzso A zzso zzso in the 3' region of zzso yields a zzso zzso while a zzso zzso affects only zzso zzso Regulatory signals for zzso of a downstream zzso required for zzso zzso may thus overlap the coding region of zzso We also present the first evidence for the functions of the zzso zzso and zzso gene products using a new in zzso zzso for the incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso precursors and zzso in zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso accumulate zzso zzso while those from zzso and zzso zzso accumulate zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso is the zzso zzso and that zzso and possibly zzso are components of the zzso zzso zzso
