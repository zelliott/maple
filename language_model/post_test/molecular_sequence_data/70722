The DNA repair zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso or duplex DNA, producing free zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of free zzso from zzso coli strain B zzso zzso its complex with zzso zzso zzso and a second zzso complex with zzso zzso zzso These represent the first high-resolution structures of a zzso zzso to be zzso The overall structure of the zzso coli zzso is more similar to the human zzso than the zzso virus zzso zzso differences between the bacterial and viral structures are seen in the zzso positions of the putative zzso zzso and base zzso similar to differences previously observed between the viral and human zzso In general, the zzso loop that contains zzso appears zzso in comparison with the viral and human zzso requiring smaller zzso zzso changes to bring zzso groups into zzso zzso These structural differences may be related to the large differences in the mechanism of zzso recognition used by the zzso coli and viral zzso The pH dependence of zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is consistent with zzso zzso by zzso but provides no evidence for a zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso is critically discussed with respect to these zzso
