zzso zzso is an abundant zzso zzso and a member of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the zzso domain of zzso as a zzso and a zzso As expected, zzso shares the zzso family zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso each use highly zzso zzso and numerous waters to form their respective zzso Further studies show that zzso and zzso each bind equal amounts of the four core zzso However, zzso prefers the zzso zzso while zzso probably prefers zzso zzso We also show that zzso and zzso will each bind zzso zzso when the preferred partner is zzso We suggest that these zzso must form zzso in order to bind zzso and differentiate between zzso zzso and zzso When taken together, these data imply that zzso may function as a zzso zzso in the zzso
