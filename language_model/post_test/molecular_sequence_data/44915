To determine the influence of some bacterial DNA repair pathways on the zzso and the lethal effects of zzso zzso zzso plasmids treated in zzso with 2 zzso zzso were zzso into zzso coli strains with different repair capacities zzso zzso and zzso Despite the differences in repair zzso no statistically significant difference in survival and zzso was observed among the tested zzso One hundred and zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso All zzso were characterized by single zzso zzso most of which (more than zzso were zzso transitions (the zzso G being almost exclusively preceded zzso by a zzso zzso distribution was not zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso zzso 123 zzso zzso zzso was a common zzso but significantly more zzso in zzso strains than in zzso zzso zzso position zzso zzso transcribed zzso zzso was significantly more zzso in zzso strains than in zzso zzso By applying a computer program for comparison of zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso spectrum was significantly different from those obtained in zzso zzso whereas in the zzso background, no difference was observed between zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is responsible for most zzso observed in all zzso The results also indicate that zzso repair zzso the distribution of zzso zzso The fact that zzso at G zzso on the T strand were significantly less frequent in zzso than in zzso strains suggests that zzso zzso zzso are susceptible to zzso repair in zzso zzso
