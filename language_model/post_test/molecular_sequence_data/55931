The zzso zzso protein zzso serves as core antenna to zzso II zzso zzso The predicted zzso of zzso exhibits six zzso regions and a large zzso loop zzso zzso which roughly includes 200 zzso zzso and is presumably exposed to the zzso side of the zzso zzso Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that loop E might be involved in binding or stabilizing functional zzso in the zzso site of water zzso or in interacting with the zzso zzso zzso protein (the zzso zzso zzso To scan loop E for functionally important zzso zzso zzso has been used to introduce deletions of zzso zzso in zzso and charged regions of loop zzso In addition, one zzso zzso of the only zzso present in loop E was created zzso zzso deleted in delta 1 zzso delta 2 zzso delta 4 zzso delta 5 zzso and delta 12 zzso are required for stable assembly of functional zzso II zzso zzso of zzso delta 3 zzso and delta 11 zzso significantly reduces the level of assembled zzso II and zzso zzso growth and oxygen zzso zzso of domain delta 8 zzso enhances the zzso to zzso In contrast, deletion of zzso delta 6 zzso delta 7 zzso delta 9 zzso and delta 10 zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso do not seem to zzso interrupt zzso II structure and function, although all zzso exhibit a slightly decreased stability of zzso II as compared to the wild zzso Thus, selected zzso of the large zzso loop of zzso are important for zzso II structure and zzso With respect to possible sites of interaction between loop E of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that none of the deletions in the region from zzso 330 to zzso zzso 6, delta 7, delta 8, delta 9, delta 10) completely interrupts a functional association of the zzso protein to zzso II, although the binding characteristics might be changed in some zzso
