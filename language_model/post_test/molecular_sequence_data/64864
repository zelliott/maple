zzso zzso zzso zzso provide a strategy to purify active, zzso proteins by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The high affinity interaction between these zzso and the zzso can be zzso in the presence of a zzso salt and a low molecular weight zzso compound zzso The zzso for zzso zzso is located near the zzso of the human zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso is an eight zzso acid zzso zzso that can be fused to a desired protein for use as a zzso zzso This zzso tag zzso zzso was fused to the zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso An additional zzso fusion protein zzso another version of zzso containing a point zzso at position zzso These fusion zzso expressed in zzso coli, allowed successful separation of the desired protein in a single zzso zzso This strategy extends zzso zzso zzso to numerous expressed zzso
