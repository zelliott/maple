zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso has been implicated in the development of zzso cell zzso zzso The zinc finger zzso factors zzso and zzso are considered zzso of the zzso signal in zzso cells, although their zzso nature and their relative contribution to zzso are only poorly zzso To shed light on the respective role of these zzso factors in zzso zzso we screened for genes zzso regulated either by zzso or zzso in human zzso zzso We show here that expression of the key zzso factor zzso is predominantly activated by zzso compared with zzso zzso promoter analysis and gel shift zzso identified three zzso binding sites in the human zzso zzso zzso We found that one of these binding sites is critical for zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter and that the selective induction of zzso expression depends on the zinc finger DNA binding domain of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the outer root sheath of hair zzso and zzso and in plasma cells that infiltrated zzso tumor zzso On the basis of the latter zzso we analyzed plasma zzso tumors and found strong expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells of zzso patients, implicating zzso signaling in the development of plasma zzso zzso The results reveal a central role for zzso in zzso the zzso factor zzso which may represent an important mechanism in the development or maintenance of zzso associated with inappropriate zzso zzso
