We have isolated and zzso zzso clones encompassing more than 5 zzso of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso transfer protein zzso This region contains multiple zzso repeats, a Mermaid zzso and an extensive zzso zzso which made sequencing zzso zzso To circumvent the problems that these repeats posed to traditional sequencing zzso we employed a novel zzso technique, which greatly simplified sequencing of regions that had been difficult to accomplish zzso We zzso the artificial zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing the zzso gene and unique primer sites at both ends of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso occurred efficiently and covered the entire region of zzso Analysis of the sequence indicates a number of potential regulatory factor binding sites upstream of the previously characterized minimal zzso The zzso regulatory region zzso significant zzso zzso in a zzso transformed mouse zzso line as compared to a minimal zzso promoter zzso In addition, a zzso repeat of variable length that may provide a useful genetic marker has been identified 2 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso
