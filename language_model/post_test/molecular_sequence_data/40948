As is the case with other zzso zzso compounds, zzso is produced by marine zzso and possesses various biological activities beside potent zzso To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism for high affinity between these zzso and their binding zzso which accounts for their powerful biological activities, we searched for its binding proteins from human blood cells by using the zzso of zzso zzso as a zzso By a protein pull-down protocol with use of zzso zzso a band of specifically binding proteins was detected in zzso zzso mass zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso one of Ras zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso Western zzso and surface zzso resonance experiments further confirmed that zzso specifically binds to zzso with the zzso value around 4 zzso
