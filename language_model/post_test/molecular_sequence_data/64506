The final steps in zzso synthesis by zzso bacteria can occur via zzso zzso and zzso or via zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to assess the presence of zzso zzso among 38 zzso zzso bacterial zzso from human feces that represent three different zzso clusters zzso zzso and zzso Only four strains were found to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso These were also the only strains to give zzso products zzso by zzso with zzso primer pairs designed within the zzso zzso gene or between the linked zzso zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso genes of one zzso zzso revealed similar organization to that described previously from different groups of zzso along with differences in zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in all 38 strains zzso suggesting that it, rather than zzso zzso provides the dominant route for zzso formation in the human zzso zzso that contains a constantly high concentration of zzso
