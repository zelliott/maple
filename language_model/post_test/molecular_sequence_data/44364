We have isolated the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso The gene contains an open reading frame consisting of zzso zzso corresponding to 338 zzso acid zzso The protein molecular weight was estimated to be zzso which is in good agreement with the zzso molecular weight of the zzso determined by zzso gel zzso The zzso was zzso in zzso zzso coli cells and zzso to zzso by one zzso column zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence showed no significant similarity to those of the currently known zzso zzso but displayed 40 and zzso identity with those of the hypothetical zzso protein of zzso zzso and the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might represent a new type of zzso zzso To determine the zzso site of the zzso all of the three zzso zzso zzso of zzso were replaced by zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed properties similar to those of the wild type, while the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with corresponding disappearance of the zzso maximum at zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso probably functions as an essential zzso zzso forming an internal Schiff base with zzso of the zzso to catalyze the zzso zzso zzso
