The sequencing and comparative zzso analysis of zzso zzso in zzso or other species, including human, would be very important in understanding evolutionary genetic changes underlying the evolution of limb zzso In this regard, comparative zzso zzso of the false killer whale zzso locus could shed new light on the evolution of limb zzso We zzso two false killer whale zzso zzso corresponding to 156 zzso and 144 zzso respectively, harboring the tightly linked zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso of the false killer whale zzso gene showed that it consists of 17 zzso zzso zzso in contrast to 18 zzso zzso zzso in human, and it displays zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso respectively, compared with the human zzso In particular, we discovered that zzso 10, deleted in the false killer whale zzso zzso is present only in zzso and this fact strongly implies that zzso 10 might be crucial in determining zzso limb zzso zzso and zzso sequences have been well zzso across 11 species, suggesting that these regions could be involved in an important function of limb development and limb zzso The neighboring gene zzso showed several zzso zzso such as zzso 2 through 9 zzso in zzso zzso zzso 3 through 9 zzso in zzso and zzso 5 through 9 zzso in zzso The other neighboring zzso zzso had undergone a substitution zzso at the start zzso giving rise to a 36 zzso shorter zzso sequence compared with the human zzso Our comparative analysis of the false killer whale zzso zzso locus provides important clues regarding the genetic regions that may play crucial roles in limb development and zzso
