The crystal structure of the complex of zzso bean inhibitor zzso active zzso with bovine zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso analysis at a resolution of zzso zzso zzso of the model of the complex zzso at a final R value of zzso From the resulting electron density map, about one-third of the zzso of the inhibitor were identified and two zzso at position zzso and zzso respectively, were found to be inconsistent with the sequence reported zzso The zzso chain of the inhibitor at the zzso active site turns back sharply at zzso and forms a zzso zzso loop, which interacts with zzso in a similar manner to the other families of zzso suggesting an important and common role of these regions in exhibiting zzso zzso
