zzso zzso is a prominent example of an zzso with roles as both a catalyst and a major structural component of the eye lens in birds and zzso In chicken it appears that gene zzso and separation of function may have occurred with one gene product acting primarily as a zzso and one primarily as an zzso However, two zzso genes are abundantly expressed in the lens of the embryonic duck zzso zzso which has extremely high zzso zzso Here the isolation and sequence analysis of full length zzso clones for both duck zzso are zzso The two zzso are highly similar zzso identical in predicted zzso zzso probably as a result of gene zzso However, the zzso for duck delta zzso contains an zzso zzso of two zzso probably the result of a recent zzso boundary zzso zzso belongs to a zzso of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso which possess some highly zzso blocks of zzso zzso There may be some clues to the zzso structures of these zzso motifs in otherwise unrelated proteins for which three-dimensional structures are zzso
