The complete zzso of zzso zzso X zzso which is thought to be a distinct species of zzso was zzso zzso sequences of zzso were compared with those of other members of the zzso zzso and zzso tree was zzso The range of identities of viral zzso open reading frame 1 zzso between zzso and other zzso were zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso zzso analysis was performed according to the zzso acid sequence of the zzso to determine the position of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was in the same group as zzso common mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso virus X zzso and zzso ring spot virus zzso In particular, coat protein zzso sequences among viruses from different zzso zzso were revealed to be less variable than those from different zzso of zzso virus X zzso a zzso type zzso In the present study, zzso was zzso by seeds of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was detected in the zzso but not in the seed coat or zzso of the zzso
