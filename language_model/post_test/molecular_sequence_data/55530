The zzso zzso protein is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To determine if this protein plays a role in the ability of zzso zzso zzso to use zzso as an iron source, an zzso zzso zzso was constructed and its zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit a zzso in its capacity to use zzso as an iron source or evidence of increased zzso toxicity in zzso this zzso produced increased levels of zzso in response to iron deprivation compared to zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (which cannot produce zzso resulted in a severe growth zzso in the zzso zzso double zzso zzso during zzso under zzso conditions, which could be rescued by the addition of zzso but not zzso to the growth zzso The zzso gene is zzso with the gene zzso the zzso regulator zzso and both of these genes are zzso by the other major zzso regulator in the zzso zzso The results of these studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso has at least one other zzso zzso that works in concert with zzso to allow this strain to efficiently use zzso as an iron zzso The genetic organization of the zzso zzso also provides the basis for the proposition that zzso may perform a previously zzso function by allowing the zzso regulator zzso to recognize zzso as an iron zzso
