In zzso zzso zzso serve not only as model systems for the construction of zzso but they can also be used directly as templates for the formation of zzso Biological zzso blocks can either be isolated as complete functional units from living cells or viruses zzso zzso zzso zzso or formed by zzso assembly from zzso or synthetic components zzso zzso zzso In both cases, rational design of zzso requires knowledge of the zzso of the biological structures, which frequently occur as zzso zzso the zzso complex is composed of multiple copies of one or more zzso In this paper, a method is described for the zzso zzso of molecules in zzso The method is based on using dilution factors and relative zzso rather than absolute zzso which are often difficult to zzso especially in short-lived assembly zzso The approach exploits the fact that the larger the zzso of the component is, the more dramatic is the influence of the dilution factor zzso in zzso on the zzso We established and used the method to determine the zzso of components of bacterial virus zzso The log of dilution factors was plotted against the log of reaction zzso The zzso Z was determined with the equation zzso zzso in zzso or 90 degree angle alpha in zzso degrees, zzso degrees zzso where T is the slope of the curve zzso of 90 degree angle zzso which is the angle between the zzso and the concentration dependent zzso Z can also be determined from a standard table given in this zzso With the zzso zzso in zzso assembly system, up to zzso infectious zzso per zzso can be assembled from 11 zzso zzso giving our method a sensitivity of nine orders of zzso We confirmed the zzso of zzso components that were determined previously with microscopic zzso The described method also responded to programmed zzso changes, which were generated by assembling the zzso DNA packaging motor from modified zzso zzso zzso molecules forming a zzso of zzso or a zzso of zzso instead of the zzso zzso
