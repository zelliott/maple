zzso can be driven by zzso resulting in zzso of zzso In the zzso zzso aggressive zzso zzso zzso identified sterile alpha motif domain 9 zzso as a substantially down regulated gene in zzso zzso was recently found to be zzso in zzso familial zzso zzso In this study, we studied the gene structure and function of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and examined these in a variety of zzso 

zzso is located on human zzso zzso with a zzso gene sterile alpha motif domain 9 like zzso in the zzso zzso Although both genes are present in a variety of species, the zzso for zzso is lost in the mouse lineage due to a unique zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in human zzso zzso is expressed at a lower level in a variety of zzso associated with zzso stabilization, such as aggressive zzso breast, and colon zzso zzso and zzso contain an zzso SAM domain, but the remainder of the predicted protein structure does not exhibit substantial zzso to other known protein zzso The putative protein product of zzso zzso to the zzso In zzso data shows that zzso zzso regulates cell zzso Over expression of zzso in the colon cancer cell line, zzso reduces the volume of tumors formed when transplanted into zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso are a novel family of zzso which play a role regulating cell proliferation and suppressing the zzso zzso This is the first report as far as we know about a human gene that exists in zzso but is lost in zzso due to a mouse specific zzso resulting in the loss of the zzso zzso
