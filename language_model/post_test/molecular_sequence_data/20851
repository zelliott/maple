zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso family first identified in the zzso As with the other 200-plus zzso zzso zzso serves a range of cellular functions including zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and is involved in processes such as cell cycle arrest, and zzso zzso proteins including zzso are expressed zzso in zzso zzso throughout the zzso and zzso nervous system and their expression has been used to selectively target specific cell types and isolate zzso zzso More recent experiments have revealed that zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of intrinsic zzso zzso and the induction of long-term zzso zzso Furthermore, selective knockout of zzso in mice produces disturbances of motor coordination and suggests a putative role for zzso in the maintenance of calcium dynamics underlying motor zzso
