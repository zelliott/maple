The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular diversity of zzso in the zzso zzso of patients with chronic zzso 

zzso plaque was collected from 41 patients with chronic zzso and 15 healthy zzso The prevalence of zzso in those plaque samples was tested by zzso chain reaction with two zzso zzso primer zzso zzso from eight zzso plaque samples were cloned and zzso for molecular diversity analysis using one of these two primer sets and a novel third primer zzso 

zzso were detected in the zzso plaque of patients with chronic zzso at a prevalence of zzso but were not detected in healthy zzso Using one primer set, all sequences of the zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso With another primer set, the zzso were also found to be identical to the zzso zzso zzso species except one zzso was found to belong to the class zzso 

zzso might be correlated with zzso zzso The diversity of zzso associated with zzso was zzso Almost all zzso zzso fell into the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso species was the zzso but zzso zzso in the zzso dental plaque of patients with zzso
