We have prepared zzso from brain tissue by stabilizing the cellular zzso in zzso M zzso zzso instead of the usual procedure which extracts the zzso protein and then zzso zzso in zzso at some later zzso There are substantial differences in the zzso associated proteins obtained by the two methods, and brain zzso is a major component of the stabilized zzso We have now modified the buffer used for the isolation of stabilized zzso to minimize their tendency to zzso When the stabilized zzso were further zzso by zzso density zzso zzso we were able to distinguish previously unidentified zzso at 49, 74 zzso and 100 zzso zzso These bands maintained zzso intensity in the same proportion to zzso as in the original zzso whereas background proteins were diminished in zzso zzso We now report the identification of the zzso zzso zzso as zzso by zzso zzso zzso is a protein known to bind to brain zzso and also to zzso and may thus serve as a zzso between these zzso zzso
