zzso zzso virus zzso are translated into zzso that are processed by viral zzso to yield functional intermediate and mature zzso zzso zzso carry genes that zzso an zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso responsible for 11 maturation zzso The zzso structure contains two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a unique domain zzso and forms functional zzso However, little is known of interactions or communication across the structure of the zzso during zzso zzso Using reverse genetic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso we identified a new zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and confirmed a zzso zzso in D3 zzso Both zzso and zzso were impaired for viral replication and zzso zzso processing at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at the zzso temperature resulted in emergence of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso Among the zzso zzso a zzso zzso change suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as the previously reported zzso Analysis of multiple zzso zzso structures, and alignment of zzso zzso primary zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso across zzso and are physically distant zzso zzso from each other, from zzso and zzso zzso and from the zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that long-distance communication pathways between multiple zzso and zzso of zzso play a significant role in zzso activity and viral zzso suggesting possible novel targets for zzso site zzso of zzso
