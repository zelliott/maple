We report the identification of a new zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a 55-year-old man with progressive zzso mild peripheral zzso and bilateral zzso tunnel zzso A diagnosis of zzso familial zzso zzso was considered after an zzso biopsy revealed zzso deposits in the heart of a patient who had no family history of zzso and no evidence of a plasma cell zzso zzso screening for a zzso zzso by zzso focusing zzso was positive and prompted further studies to identify the genetic zzso and to characterize the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of all four coding regions in the zzso gene demonstrated zzso in zzso zzso Near equal amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed at the second base position of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences found in zzso 61 zzso to zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acids which differ in mass by zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses of zzso zzso from serum showed the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso The observed mass results for the zzso and zzso proteins were consistent with the predicted values calculated from the genetic analysis zzso
