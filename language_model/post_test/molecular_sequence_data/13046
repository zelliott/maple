The zzso zzso from zzso coli repairs damage in the DNA by dual incision of the damaged strand on both sides of the zzso The incisions are in an ordered fashion, first on the zzso and next on the zzso of the damage, and they are the result of binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we show that at least the zzso 24 zzso acids of zzso are involved in interaction with zzso and that this binding is important for the zzso The zzso region of zzso which shows zzso with a domain of the zzso zzso is part of a region that is predicted to be able to form a zzso We therefore propose that zzso and zzso interact through the formation of such a zzso The zzso region of zzso only interacts with zzso when present in the zzso complex, indicating that the zzso change in zzso accompanying the formation of this complex exposes the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso region of zzso is not important for the zzso suggesting that for this incision a different interaction of zzso with the zzso complex is zzso zzso zzso zzso that lack up to 99 zzso acids from the C zzso still give rise to significant incision zzso indicating that this zzso region of zzso does not participate in the formation of the active site for zzso This region, however, contains the zzso zzso that was proposed to be involved in zzso since a zzso of the zzso zzso fails to promote zzso zzso zzso Phillips, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso with the same zzso zzso but this protein shows normal zzso binding and incision in zzso and also results in normal survival after zzso zzso in zzso As a consequence of these results, it is still an open question as to whether the zzso site for zzso is located in zzso in zzso or is formed by both zzso
