zzso are positively charged zzso peptides which zzso cell zzso and display zzso zzso They are usually thought to bind specifically to zzso zzso and binding studies have been performed almost exclusively with zzso charged zzso Here we demonstrate that binding of zzso to neutral zzso a reaction which is difficult to assess with zzso means, can be followed with high accuracy using zzso zzso zzso The binding mechanism can be described by a surface partition equilibrium after correcting for zzso zzso by means of the zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters are observed for the binding zzso zzso The three zzso zzso that were investigated bind to neutral zzso with large zzso reaction zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso (at 30 degrees zzso zzso The reaction zzso increase with increasing temperature, leading to a large positive heat capacity zzso of approximately 130 zzso zzso zzso (at 25 degrees zzso zzso The Gibbs free energies of binding zzso are between zzso and zzso zzso resulting in a large negative binding zzso zzso The binding of zzso to small zzso zzso is hence an zzso zzso The negative zzso and zzso and the large positive zzso contradict the conventional understanding of the zzso zzso CD experiments reveal that the zzso fraction of zzso is approximately zzso zzso at 8 degrees C, decreasing to approximately zzso at 45 degrees zzso Since the random zzso zzso zzso transition in zzso solution is known to be an zzso process, the same process occurring at the membrane surface is shown to account for up to zzso of the measured reaction zzso In addition to zzso zzso formation, the second main driving force for membrane binding is the zzso of the zzso zzso acid side chains into the zzso zzso It also contributes a negative zzso and follows the pattern for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of cholesterol drastically reduces the extent of zzso binding and reveals an zzso compensation zzso zzso zzso was measured with a dye zzso and correlated with the extent of zzso zzso The level of dye zzso is zzso related to the amount of zzso zzso and can be traced back to a membrane zzso zzso
