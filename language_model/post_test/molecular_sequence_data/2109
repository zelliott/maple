The zzso family of zzso zzso includes zzso zzso as well as the zzso regulatory protein zzso Recently, an additional zzso zzso has been found in zzso that recognizes the zzso sequence element common in zzso zzso This factor was designated zzso The structural gene for zzso has now been isolated and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence predicts a protein of 650 zzso considerably larger than zzso or zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene demonstrates this gene is not essential but is required for zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso blots of proteins from zzso cells suggest the presence of additional zzso proteins other than zzso and zzso Furthermore, expression of at least one of these related zzso proteins appears to be under control of zzso
