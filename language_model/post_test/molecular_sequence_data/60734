To investigate their hypothesis that zzso zzso is correlated with zzso zzso change, the authors classified tumors of the zzso of zzso zzso and according to zzso zzso as either zzso type zzso or zzso or zzso type zzso or zzso and analyzed the tumors for zzso zzso during zzso 

zzso tumors of the zzso of zzso (5 zzso 24 zzso with zzso zzso and 23 zzso obtained from surgical specimens were zzso The zzso zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso III zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso was detected by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso length zzso and enriched zzso zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso component and zzso tumor spreading in the zzso was significantly higher in zzso tumors zzso 27 of 30 tumors, and zzso 30 of 30 tumors, zzso than in zzso tumors zzso 2 of 22 tumors, and zzso 5 of 22 tumors, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was positive in zzso tumors but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso rates for incomplete zzso tumors zzso 7 of 9) and zzso zzso tumors zzso 7 of zzso which showed zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso were significantly higher than in complete zzso tumors zzso 6 of zzso and ordinary zzso tumors zzso 2 of zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso In zzso tumors, zzso zzso was more frequently recognized in tumors with zzso duct tumor extension zzso 3 of 4) than in those with zzso duct extension zzso 0 of 6) zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, sequences of zzso zzso 12 were common in 17 zzso with zzso component that were analyzed for both zzso and zzso 

zzso of the zzso of zzso can be classified zzso as either zzso type or zzso type, and they have different features according to tumor location, association with zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is supposed to be associated with tumors arising in the area from the zzso to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso occurring in both zzso and zzso zzso
