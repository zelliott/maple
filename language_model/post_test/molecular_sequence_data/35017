Land use management, one of the most important aspects of anthropogenic zzso to zzso zzso has exerted overriding impacts on soil zzso cycling and inhabitant zzso However, the knowledge concerning response of different zzso groups to long-term land use changes is still limited in zzso zzso Here we used quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso approaches to investigate the response of zzso communities to four different land use practices, zzso zzso pine forest, restoration land and degradation zzso zzso analyses showed that expression of the zzso zzso gene responds more sensitively to changes of land zzso In particular, we observed, occurring at significantly lower numbers of zzso zzso genes in degradation land samples, while the abundance of total zzso and Group zzso based on zzso zzso gene copy numbers remained constant among the different treatments zzso zzso nitrate content is significantly correlated with zzso zzso gene zzso but not their bacterial zzso The percentage of zzso among total zzso communities increases with increasing depth, but has no significant relationship with total zzso total nitrogen or zzso zzso pH was significantly correlated with total bacterial zzso Based on results from zzso three land use practices zzso zzso pine forest, restoration zzso showed distinct dominant bands, which were mostly affiliated with Group zzso zzso land, however, was dominated by sequences belonging to Group zzso zzso from this study suggest that community structure of zzso zzso zzso were significantly impacted by land use zzso
