During our researches on zzso and ecology of zzso zzso carried out in western zzso some specimens showing a zzso zzso were zzso they belonged to four zzso zzso decorum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2011, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso We hypothesized that such zzso could be due, as reported in literature, to characteristic zzso zzso of zzso inside the zzso of blue colored zzso zzso observations by transmission electron zzso on zzso of zzso decorum, showed the presence of zzso viral zzso with a diameter of nearly zzso zzso zzso performed on specimens of zzso decorum, evidenced an zzso structure of viral particles matching with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, on zzso portion of the major zzso protein zzso zzso allowed to place the virus into zzso group, already known for other zzso zzso The symptoms of infected individuals and the course of the disease were followed in laboratory, indicating similarities with other studies on zzso zzso Moreover, some notes on reproduction of infected zzso females are zzso Our data support unequivocal and direct zzso for the first case of zzso infection in zzso zzso reported in zzso
