Nuclear inhibitor of protein zzso zzso is one of two major regulatory zzso of protein zzso in zzso zzso We report here the cloning and structural characterization of the human zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso in human gene zzso zzso zzso zzso is a processed zzso and was localized by in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso is an authentic zzso gene and was localized to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of seven zzso and encodes four different zzso as determined from zzso library zzso reverse zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso sequence zzso database search zzso zzso zzso represents the major transcript in human zzso and various cell lines, and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso that only differs from the previously cloned calf zzso zzso by a single zzso The other zzso termed zzso gamma and zzso are generated by alternative zzso site zzso by zzso skipping and/or by alternative zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are expected to zzso fragments of zzso that differ from the latter by the absence of the first 142 and 224 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso which, unlike zzso displays in zzso and zzso activity and lacks an zzso consensus motif for interaction with protein zzso While the zzso were found to be present in various human zzso the zzso transcript could only be detected in human transformed zzso
