zzso DNA and zzso zzso containing zzso strongly activate cells of the immune zzso zzso zzso is a powerful zzso in vaccination protocols for zzso as well as for zzso zzso zzso A decisive propensity of zzso is its capacity to induce zzso T helper type 1 zzso immune zzso To exert its function zzso has to be taken up by responsive cells, zzso zzso cells zzso The rate of zzso is influenced by the zzso backbone modification and critically determines activity of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso backbone zzso are currently used for most in zzso and in zzso studies, since zzso modification protects zzso from the attack of zzso However, after administration of zzso zzso long-lasting effects including zzso as well as sustained local zzso zzso and zzso zzso production have been zzso To circumvent these restrictions we investigated the effects of DNA sequence as well as DNA backbone modification on cellular zzso and resulting zzso We show here that zzso of zzso zzso can be strongly enhanced by zzso zzso runs added at the 3' end of the zzso In addition these zzso showed an improved zzso activity in zzso and in zzso This included protection of mice against lethal zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso specific zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso neither induced zzso nor prolonged zzso production after local zzso Since these improved PO zzso are efficient in zzso and in zzso and lack long lasting zzso effects they could be used preferably as zzso in vaccination zzso
