We have analyzed the zzso zzso identified in a screen for zzso with decreased zzso transmission zzso and shown to zzso to the previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso increase in the rate of zzso III zzso per cell division, and near zzso rates of marker zzso on this zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of the segregation of a marker zzso indicated that sister zzso loss zzso zzso and sister zzso zzso zzso zzso contributed equally to zzso zzso A zzso clone of zzso was isolated and used to map its physical position on zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame with a 99 zzso predicted protein sequence that contained two zzso sequences and was zzso identical to the coding region of a zzso zzso repair zzso zzso zzso of zzso between these two predicted protein sequences included a zzso motif and an zzso binding site containing a zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso gene product are viable and display two striking, and perhaps zzso zzso extreme zzso instability and a delay in cell cycle progression in zzso This delay is independent of the cell cycle checkpoint that requires the function of the zzso zzso
