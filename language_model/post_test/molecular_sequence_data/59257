A zzso was isolated from zzso zzso coding for a 360 zzso acid long zzso with no significant similarity to any known zzso In zzso zzso showed that the corresponding transcript is expressed exclusively in zzso cells of the zzso hence its name zzso zzso zzso 1 therefore represents a highly specific marker for the head region of zzso In accordance with this, we found that zzso 1 expression was strong in zzso zzso a zzso zzso 1 zzso early during head zzso namely zzso h after initiation of zzso by zzso These findings imply that zzso 1 is an excellent marker for monitoring early events in zzso differentiation processes in zzso
