We used a molecular evolutionary approach to investigate the species adaptation of rabies virus in zzso A maximum likelihood analysis of selection pressures revealed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of natural viral zzso were highly zzso especially at zzso sites, in contrast to the higher rates of zzso evolution observed in viruses subject to laboratory zzso Positive selection was only found at a single zzso acid zzso 183 in the zzso of the G zzso The low rate of zzso evolution in natural zzso of rabies virus may be due to constraints imposed by the need to replicate in multiple cell types within the host, which in turn zzso zzso transmission, or because viral proteins are not subject to immune zzso Using known dates in the zzso history of European viral zzso we estimated that overall rates of zzso substitution in rabies virus were similar to those observed in other zzso zzso Assuming that the average rate of synonymous change does not vary among species, we estimated that the current genetic diversity in zzso zzso 1 may have arisen only during the last 500 zzso
