zzso is an zzso zzso protein that has recently been implicated as a zzso of systemic insulin sensitivity with liver and muscle as target zzso zzso is found as two forms in serum, as a lower molecular weight zzso and a high molecular weight zzso Little is know about the regulation and significance of these zzso complexes in serum and about the events that lead to the generation of the zzso zzso Here, we show that there is a profound sexual zzso of zzso levels and complex distribution in zzso Female mice display significantly higher levels of the high molecular weight complex in serum than zzso In both females and zzso levels of the high molecular weight complex are significantly reduced in response to a systemic increase of zzso The ratio of the two complexes is restored upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso formation of zzso critically depends on zzso bond formation zzso by zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso that are subject to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso or zzso zzso treated with zzso are significantly more zzso than the higher order zzso forms of the protein with respect to reduction of serum zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of primary zzso with zzso and higher order forms of zzso confirms that the increased zzso seen in zzso is reflected in an zzso potency to reduce zzso output in the presence of zzso zzso zzso these results shed new light on the regulation of this complex protein and suggest a new model for in zzso zzso of the zzso implicating a serum zzso zzso
