The protein products of the Tap zzso associated with zzso zzso 1 and 2 genes are presumed to deliver peptides across the zzso zzso zzso for assembly with major zzso complex zzso class I zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso has a premature stop in the Tap 2 gene and probably therefore fails to deliver peptides into the zzso which leads to a low level of cell surface zzso class I zzso zzso of a Tap 2 gene restores to zzso both zzso class I zzso expression and the ability to present influenza viral zzso We investigated the ability of zzso cells zzso with a Tap 2 gene to process and present zzso zzso and zzso viral zzso to zzso and zzso zzso T zzso We found that zzso peptides as well as zzso and zzso viral peptides can be processed and presented by zzso but at reduced zzso zzso of a Tap 2 gene of mouse zzso zzso or rat origin into zzso increased the presentation of zzso viral zzso and partially restored the presentation of zzso zzso The already low level of zzso viral peptides presented by zzso is not elevated by zzso of either Tap 2 gene into zzso This indicates a differential effect of zzso of a Tap 2 gene of rat or zzso mouse origin into zzso on viral zzso zzso
