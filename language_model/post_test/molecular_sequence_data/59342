We provide the first report, to our knowledge, of a zzso system for rescuing a zzso zzso zzso zzso virus entirely from cloned zzso zzso were constructed containing full-length zzso copies of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso segments flanked by zzso zzso promoter and zzso delta virus zzso zzso When cells expressing both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso with these zzso full-length zzso zzso were transcribed zzso and these in turn were zzso and packaged into infectious zzso zzso The resulting progeny virus contained specific genetic tags characteristic of the parental zzso zzso zzso viruses containing two zzso segments of zzso zzso and one segment of zzso zzso were also produced following zzso of appropriate zzso This accomplishment will allow the full application of zzso DNA technology to manipulate the zzso zzso
