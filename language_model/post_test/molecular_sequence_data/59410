Certain peptides with sequences related to part of the major zzso complex class I zzso enhance the action of zzso These peptides also zzso into zzso structures that seem to be related to their biological zzso In the current study, the zzso zzso with zzso acid sequence zzso is used as a representative example of these zzso zzso As seen by electron zzso the zzso associates into gently twisted zzso 50 A thick, in which the amount of twist decreases as the ribbons become zzso X-ray zzso analysis suggests that the peptides are arranged as in an zzso zzso extending essentially endlessly along the fiber zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso is such that one side of the zzso is predominantly polar while the opposite side is zzso This allows the zzso to form zzso with alternating zzso and zzso zzso The length of the extended zzso zzso 54 zzso determines the thickness of the ribbon and the tendency of individual zzso to twist accounts for the twisting of the zzso An alternative model is also discussed, again based on zzso zzso but with adjacent sheets zzso in a zzso fashion rather than forming stacked zzso zzso inactive peptides such as zzso zzso zzso acids zzso do not form ordered zzso zzso
