zzso which belongs to the basic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso factors, is one of the most essential proteins involved in zzso systems of zzso Clock genes have been cloned from several species, including zzso insects, birds, fish, and zzso In the present study, we successfully isolated a Clock zzso zzso zzso from the giant zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso open reading frame that zzso a putative zzso protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso exhibiting high identities with zzso zzso in other species zzso This is the first report of a zzso clock gene from zzso zzso possessed an exceptionally long zzso domain zzso zzso zzso in its zzso which usually ranges from 14 to 57 zzso acids in other known zzso and is supposed to function in zzso zzso Using zzso we observed that zzso was expressed in all tested zzso zzso zzso was performed to investigate the gene expression profile during the zzso zzso The results indicated that the expression of the zzso gene had no significant zzso in central nervous zzso zzso zzso and zzso or peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, gene expression tended to increase in the central nervous system zzso zzso and abdominal zzso of zzso or constant dark zzso prawns, and in the zzso zzso No expression change was found under constant light zzso or in heart and zzso
