Using a probe obtained by zzso amplification from mouse zzso DNA, a zzso clone was isolated covering the entire mouse zzso zzso The mouse gene has an zzso zzso very similar to that of the rat and human zzso The first zzso is zzso while zzso zzso carry the coding zzso zzso 6 also encodes the stop zzso and a zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of mouse zzso is zzso and zzso identical to the rat and human zzso zzso The zzso sequence of mouse zzso was confirmed by zzso amplification of mouse brain zzso The cloning of the mouse zzso gene should allow zzso of the regulatory characteristics of its promoter and facilitate transgenic approaches to the analysis of zzso gene function in this zzso
