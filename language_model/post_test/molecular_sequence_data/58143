zzso factors zzso in zzso arthritis zzso are zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso located in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso technology has overcome the difficulty of their zzso so that zzso zzso zzso can be examined for their individual binding zzso and zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cells zzso of a patient with zzso zzso bound specifically with rabbit zzso zzso and had no human zzso zzso zzso By direct binding zzso and zzso experiments, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this patient with zzso was zzso for zzso zzso was tested against zzso zzso and zzso fragments, and bound only to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso had high zzso for zzso in a capture zzso Total zzso was extracted and the variable region heavy zzso and light zzso chain zzso were amplified using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain genes indicated usage of the zzso zzso gene zzso gene zzso and a new V zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest preferential use of restricted zzso genes in the formation of zzso in human zzso zzso The pathological significance of zzso specific zzso is still zzso However, this finding suggests that all zzso zzso production may not necessarily be induced by zzso zzso
