The origin and evolutionary relationship of zzso zzso was investigated in zzso by zzso and characterizing two new zzso zzso and muscle zzso zzso The zzso organization and sequences of these genes were compared with those of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene encodes an adult zzso zzso Our analysis of these genes showed that zzso positions are zzso among the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso gene families evolved from a single zzso gene in the ancestral zzso zzso comparisons and molecular zzso analyses also suggested a close relationship between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was also found that there are two distinct lineages of muscle zzso zzso in zzso the zzso muscle and adult zzso zzso The four muscle zzso in zzso show a closer relationship to each other than to the zzso muscle zzso Similarly, the two zzso zzso in zzso show a closer relationship to each other than to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the two types of zzso muscle zzso diverge from each zzso The close relationship between the zzso zzso muscle zzso and the zzso muscle zzso was supported by both zzso and maximum zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso had at least two muscle zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso evolved after the separation of the zzso and zzso
