The zzso sequence of the zzso coli zzso gene and the primary structure of the zzso protein were zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein matched that predicted from the zzso sequence of the zzso pair coding zzso The zzso gene lacks characteristic promoter zzso neither the zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso was detected within 222 base pairs upstream from the zzso zzso zzso There is, however, a typical zzso sequence zzso base pairs before the zzso zzso An upstream open reading frame, separated by just 2 base pairs from the coding region of zzso encodes the zzso half of the zzso product zzso zzso zzso zzso Bond, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso The zzso protein contains 245 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso consistent with the observed value zzso Similar to zzso and zzso zzso uses several minor zzso the significance of these minor zzso to the low level expression of the protein product in zzso coli cells remains to be zzso The in zzso zzso zzso method was employed to determine the functional region involved in interaction with zzso zzso The first zzso zzso located in the zzso region of the zzso protein zzso was shown to be important for this zzso zzso sequence zzso between zzso protein and zzso P zzso functionally analogous to the zzso protein in the zzso zzso DNA zzso is not zzso There are, however, several short stretches of zzso regions including the zzso eight zzso acids and the zzso region of zzso zzso
