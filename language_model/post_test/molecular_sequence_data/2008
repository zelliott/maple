The gene for the zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso contains a 75 base pair zzso zzso zzso and lacks the zzso zzso sequence of the mature zzso There is a single copy of this gene in the zzso and it is zzso Northern zzso experiments indicate that the precursor is processed to produce mature zzso and a free zzso zzso A secondary structure of the transcript can be formed in which the zzso stem of the zzso is zzso Two zzso placed zzso zzso zzso separated by a 4 base pair stem are present in this zzso The zzso sites for the removal of the zzso are placed between the middle and 3' zzso of these zzso
