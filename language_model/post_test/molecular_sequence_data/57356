zzso killer strains of zzso zzso zzso a zzso toxin to which they are themselves zzso The alpha and beta components of toxin comprise zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The intervening zzso segment is called zzso A zzso signal zzso is removed on entry into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the toxin components from the zzso zzso zzso in a late zzso zzso zzso of a zzso copy of the zzso gene zzso the complete zzso killer zzso on sensitive zzso We now show that expression of immunity requires the alpha component and the zzso 31 zzso of zzso An additional zzso extension, either eight zzso of gamma or three of four unrelated zzso is also zzso zzso of zzso terminating at the alpha zzso or lacking the gamma zzso half of gamma causes profound but zzso growth zzso zzso is suppressed in zzso by the same 31 zzso of gamma required for immunity to zzso toxin in zzso but not by the presence of zzso Both immunity and growth zzso are alleviated by insertions in alpha that zzso zzso zzso is not suppressed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso by growth at higher pH or temperature, or by normal zzso zzso zzso therefore, probably does not involve processing of the alpha toxin component at its zzso or release from the cell and binding to zzso zzso Some zzso and substitution zzso in gamma severely reduce toxin zzso without affecting zzso They are presumed to affect zzso folding in the zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso
