zzso properties of zzso may mediate zzso inflammatory events in zzso colitis zzso and Crohn's disease zzso In the present study, profiles of zzso produced by activated zzso were studied in zzso tissue from 43 patients with and without inflammatory zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extracted from zzso biopsy specimens was studied using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso A greater percentage of active UC samples had zzso levels of zzso for zzso zzso 1, 6, and 8 and zzso than samples in inactive UC and zzso zzso These zzso were comparable in active UC and inflammatory zzso zzso of zzso zzso in active UC tissue was significantly higher than in active zzso zzso necrosis factor was detected in only 7 of 43 samples with no difference between zzso Active and inactive CD did not differ in percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in more inflammatory controls than in CD and was expressed in fewer zzso patients than zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso inactive CD and possible defective production of zzso may explain disease zzso and zzso
