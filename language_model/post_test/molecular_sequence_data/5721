The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prominent member of the zzso family, the members of which contain zzso zzso called zzso To gain insight into the complex zzso and the zzso relationship of zzso the final intermediate in the zzso of zzso A was studied by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso In zzso solution the leader zzso part of this precursor adopts predominantly a random zzso structure, as does the synthetic leader zzso zzso The spatial structure of the fully modified zzso part of the precursor is similar to that of zzso in zzso The leader zzso part does not interact with the zzso part of the precursor zzso Thus, these two parts of the precursor do not influence each other's zzso zzso The zzso of the precursor was also studied while zzso to zzso of zzso mimicking the primary target of the zzso activity of zzso zzso the zzso zzso The location of the zzso relative to the zzso was investigated by using zzso zzso zzso zzso It was observed that the zzso half of the zzso part of the precursor interacts in a different way with zzso than does the corresponding part of mature zzso whereas no significant differences were found for the zzso half of the zzso zzso In this model system the leader zzso is in contact with the zzso It is concluded that the strongly reduced in zzso activity of the precursor zzso relative to that of zzso is not caused by a difference in the spatial structure of zzso and of the corresponding part of precursor zzso in water or by a shielding of the membrane interaction surface of the zzso part of the precursor by the leader zzso Probably a different interaction of the zzso part of the zzso region with zzso contributes to the low activity by preventing productive zzso The zzso of the leader zzso part just next to the zzso part are likely to contribute most to the low activity of the zzso
