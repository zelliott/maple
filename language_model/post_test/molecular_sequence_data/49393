The specificity of perch zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied using the protein dot zzso technique, followed by detection with zzso zzso zzso bearing human milk zzso The strongest binding was noted with the H type 1 zzso zzso zzso I, zzso alpha 1-2 Gal beta 1-3 zzso beta 1-3 Gal beta zzso the interaction with the H type 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 1-2 Gal beta zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the perch zzso to the Lewis zzso zzso with tumors and embryonic zzso was also zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso I, zzso alpha 1-2 Gal beta zzso alpha zzso beta 1-3 Gal beta zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso Lex zzso Thus, perch zzso zzso exhibited pronounced differences in zzso specificity from other zzso feature that may be used in structural studies and isolation of zzso zzso
