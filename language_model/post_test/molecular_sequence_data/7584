The large zzso B virus zzso surface protein zzso forms two zzso which display their zzso zzso domain at the internal and external side of the viral zzso zzso The external zzso domain has been implicated in binding to a virus zzso To investigate functions of the internal zzso domain, a zzso signal sequence was fused to the N zzso of L zzso causing exclusive expression of external zzso zzso A fusion construct with a zzso signal zzso which zzso in its primary sequence to zzso zzso by signal zzso was used as a zzso zzso was N zzso in zzso zzso cells at both potential sites in zzso in contrast to zzso or zzso zzso confirming the expected zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso characterization revealed the following zzso zzso zzso lost the zzso effect of L or zzso on zzso of zzso zzso B surface zzso zzso suggesting that the retention signal mapped to the N zzso of L is recognized in the zzso and not in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the culture medium even in the absence of the major zzso surface protein zzso while release of an L zzso lacking the retention signal was still dependent on S zzso zzso zzso but not zzso could complement an zzso zzso zzso defective for zzso zzso in zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso domain, like a zzso zzso is involved in the interaction of the viral envelope with zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso
