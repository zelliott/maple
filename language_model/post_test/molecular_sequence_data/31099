zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to nerve growth factor differentiate as sympathetic zzso and extend zzso on zzso and to a much lesser extent on zzso Analysis of zzso fragments indicated that zzso outgrowth occurs mainly on zzso zzso corresponding to the center of the zzso and only poorly on zzso zzso a long arm structure that is active with other zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso and zzso zzso of these cells on zzso zzso zzso and zzso By affinity zzso we isolated an zzso zzso for zzso consisting of two zzso with molecular zzso of 180 and 135 zzso The latter is recognized by an zzso to zzso beta 1 zzso The bound zzso zzso could be displaced by zzso but not by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso fragments showed that the zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso The expression of the zzso alpha zzso of the zzso zzso at the cell surface was increased zzso after zzso zzso The effect of zzso is specific since the amount of a zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso remained zzso Moreover, the increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso at the cell surface corresponded to a selective increase in cell zzso to zzso and to zzso zzso The zzso complex is thus an zzso zzso for zzso whose expression and binding specificity zzso with the capacity of zzso zzso cells to extend zzso on zzso
