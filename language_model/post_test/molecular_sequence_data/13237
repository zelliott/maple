A previously zzso zzso protein zzso that does not contain zzso but, zzso binds specifically to the isolated zzso zzso 2 zzso domain of zzso has been zzso The additional presence of the unique zzso region of zzso prevents zzso binding to the zzso zzso However, zzso at zzso (or zzso its zzso to zzso reverses the zzso and allows interaction of the zzso zzso domain with zzso Moreover, zzso is associated with a zzso zzso activity and also binds to zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of the zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso domain appears to provide an alternative zzso for zzso signaling that is regulated by zzso zzso
