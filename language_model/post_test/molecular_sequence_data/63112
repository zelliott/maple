The zebra zzso zzso zzso has a large Z zzso and highly condensed W zzso We used the random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technique to isolate zzso sequences zzso and zzso Southern zzso zzso to male and female zebra zzso zzso DNA suggested that these sequences were located on the W zzso although zzso sequences appeared to be zzso or zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso using bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones corresponding to zzso sequences showed zzso to the whole W zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso sequences that are repeated across the entire W zzso Based on the sequencing of a zzso repetitive sequence and Z zzso derived zzso zzso we demonstrate a random distribution of repeat sequences that are specific to the W zzso or zzso by both Z and zzso The positions of zzso repeat sequences mapped to a zzso region of a Z zzso zzso clone containing the zzso zzso The apparent zzso of W zzso repeat sequences in zzso and zzso birds suggest that the W zzso had not differentiated well from the Z at the time of divergence of these zzso
