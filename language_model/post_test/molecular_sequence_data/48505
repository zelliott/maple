A novel metal zzso zzso B zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso zzso from the culture zzso with zzso recovery zzso zzso zzso The zzso functions as a zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso activity was found at pH zzso and 50 zzso The zzso specificity was in the order: zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso did not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was primarily produced during the early stages of zzso zzso The apparent zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of zzso zzso acid were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso specificity of zzso zzso was investigated using zzso In the reaction zzso the zzso ratio of released fatty acids zzso zzso was 45 : zzso The zzso of the gene is zzso zzso in length and codes for a zzso acid signal zzso and a zzso acid mature zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows zzso identity to a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso production of zzso was achieved using a zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is essential for the zzso function of zzso and that the active site may include zzso zzso and zzso
