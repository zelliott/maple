We studied two zzso strains from clinical zzso These strains had type IV and zzso acids in their cell walls and also had zzso zzso such as zzso activity and zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso which did not permit assignment to any previously recognized zzso According to zzso zzso data, these two strains are members of the same species zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis based on comparisons of almost complete zzso zzso DNA sequences revealed that these strains are closely related to zzso zzso but DNA zzso experiments clearly showed that they constitute a distinct new species with a level of DNA zzso to the zzso zzso type strain of less than zzso This new species can be differentiated from zzso zzso strains by its zzso activities and carbon source zzso and the name zzso zzso is proposed for zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was isolated from a zzso zzso
