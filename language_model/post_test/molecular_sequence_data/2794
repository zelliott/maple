A zzso clone representing the gene for the zzso zzso the zzso of bovine coronavirus was isolated from a zzso zzso library of the viral zzso and zzso The gene is located immediately zzso of the zzso zzso gene on the viral zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene predicts a zzso of zzso zzso acids with an Mr of zzso In zzso translation of zzso transcribed from the cloned zzso gene yielded a zzso of Mr zzso similar to that predicted from the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso the in zzso product was zzso processed to a zzso zzso which zzso on zzso gels with the zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso confirming the identity of the gene as that zzso the zzso zzso Finally, only zzso zzso to the zzso protein inhibited zzso by the virus thus confirming its identity as the zzso of bovine zzso
