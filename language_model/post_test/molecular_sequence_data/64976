We used molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate the association properties of zzso sterile zzso zzso domain of human zzso To test the zzso propensity of this structure we carried out four zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso modeled zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso modeled zzso with an zzso zzso zzso The results show a direct interaction between zzso 5 and zzso 3 since a zzso collapse of zzso 3 is observed when zzso contact and/or an zzso of zzso 5 is introduced by modeling in zzso SAM zzso On the basis of these results we suggest that the recognition properties of the SAM zzso may be modulated by the zzso state of zzso zzso
