zzso regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso in combination with associated sequences zzso constitute the zzso immune system, which zzso DNA from invasive genetic elements as novel zzso that provide a genetic record of zzso zzso We investigated the potential of zzso zzso of zzso zzso a species relevant for commercial zzso zzso and vegetable zzso Upon investigating the occurrence and diversity of zzso systems in zzso zzso zzso we observed a ubiquitous occurrence of zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso type zzso zzso locus adjacent to four zzso zzso including the universal zzso and zzso genes and the type II signature gene zzso Comparative analysis of zzso zzso content in 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso revealed 10 unique locus zzso that contained between 9 and 29 variable zzso We observed a set of zzso zzso at the ancestral end, reflecting a common origin, as well as zzso zzso reflecting recent zzso Some of these zzso showed perfect identity with zzso zzso and many zzso showed zzso to zzso zzso zzso Following a comparative analysis of sequences immediately zzso zzso that matched zzso zzso we identified a novel putative zzso motif zzso zzso Overall, these findings suggest that type zzso zzso systems are valuable for zzso of zzso zzso
