An artificially designed fusion zzso which was designed to have strong cell adhesive activity and an active functional unit that enhances zzso differentiation of mouse zzso zzso cells, was zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso which stimulates zzso outgrowth in conditions of serum zzso was engineered and incorporated into an zzso structural zzso The designed fusion protein also had a zzso zzso sequence derived from zzso The zzso fusion protein could zzso efficiently onto zzso culture surfaces and showed cell zzso activity similar to zzso zzso cells grown on the fusion protein exhibited more cells with zzso than cells grown on zzso These results indicated that the constructed protein could retain properties of incorporated functional peptides and could provide effective signal zzso The strategy of designing zzso fusion proteins has the possibility for supporting current tissue engineering zzso
