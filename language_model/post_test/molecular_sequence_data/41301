Rice zzso are vital for supporting high-yield zzso which are controlled by various factors such as cell division, cell zzso and cell wall zzso zzso formation and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are important for determining the shape of zzso To understand the regulation of zzso development, we zzso a rice dwarf zzso dwarf 50 zzso Previously, we reported that zzso cells in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso deposit cell wall zzso In this study, we revealed that zzso encodes putative zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso required for many essential cellular functions, such as zzso organization, zzso and zzso trafficking in zzso Analysis of the rice zzso revealed 20 putative zzso including zzso The zzso zzso induced zzso oriented cell division, irregular deposition of cell wall zzso and thick zzso zzso in the zzso cells of the zzso resulting in zzso organized cell files of the zzso zzso and dwarf zzso Our results suggest that the putative zzso zzso by zzso is essential for IM formation, including the direction of cell division, deposition of cell wall zzso and control of zzso zzso
