The zzso axis of zzso zzso is thought to be specified by a zzso of bone zzso protein zzso activity, which, in part, arises through the interaction of zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and short zzso zzso produce zzso zzso including expanded zzso expression zzso We find that the three zzso are zzso and that the locus they zzso renamed zzso zzso maps to linkage group zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are deficiencies and thus represent zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso retains partial zzso Aspects of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are fully suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso a zzso zzso in zzso is zzso to zzso zzso providing further evidence that zzso normally functions in a zzso zzso zzso patterning is highly sensitive to maternal and zzso zzso gene zzso especially when the level of zzso zzso activity is also zzso However, elimination of the zzso activity of both genes does not result in a completely zzso zzso Thus, while zzso and zzso are required to limit activity of zzso additional mechanisms must exist to block these zzso zzso We have ruled out zzso zzso zzso as candidates for the zzso zzso including a newly identified zzso zzso which is specifically expressed in the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso encodes an as yet unidentified zzso factor that mediates zzso patterning by directly or indirectly zzso zzso zzso
