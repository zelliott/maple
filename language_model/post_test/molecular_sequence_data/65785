zzso and zzso compose a family of DNA zzso that is distinct from that of the other two DNA zzso zzso and zzso all of which are involved in repair of oxidized bases in zzso zzso That the NEIL zzso unlike zzso and zzso are able to zzso base zzso from zzso DNA regions suggests their preferential involvement in repair during replication and/or zzso Previous studies showing S zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso suggested zzso involvement in the repair of replicating zzso Here, we show that human zzso zzso interacts both in zzso and in zzso with zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso the sliding clamp for DNA zzso zzso stimulates zzso activity in zzso the oxidized base zzso from zzso DNA sequences including fork zzso zzso enhances zzso loading on the zzso In contrast, although present in the zzso zzso zzso does not stimulate zzso zzso interacts with zzso via a domain that is located in a region near the C zzso zzso for base zzso zzso The interacting sequence in zzso which lacks the zzso zzso zzso includes a sequence zzso in DNA zzso delta and implicated in its zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed zzso interaction with zzso The zzso zzso in zzso reduces its zzso activity, suggesting that the zzso zzso loop, a common binding interface of zzso is involved in zzso zzso These results strongly support in zzso function of zzso in preferential repair of oxidized bases in DNA prior to zzso
