How sorting receptors recognize zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso and respond to pH changes for zzso binding or release is zzso The plant zzso sorting zzso zzso binds zzso zzso with a central zzso zzso zzso zzso a soluble form of the zzso lacking zzso and zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso as a zzso with a specificity indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso contains an zzso region zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a unique central region, and three zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso By zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and from zzso binding studies with a zzso protein lacking the zzso repeats, we defined three zzso structural zzso an zzso zzso domain connected to a central domain, which together determine the zzso zzso binding site, and a zzso zzso repeat domain that alters the zzso of the other two zzso to enhance zzso zzso A zzso representing the central domain plus the zzso domain could bind zzso but was not specific for zzso These results indicate that two zzso binding sites recognize two separate zzso zzso a zzso site defined by the central zzso repeat domain structure and an zzso site contributed by the interaction of the zzso zzso domain and the central zzso
