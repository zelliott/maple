Previous work has shown zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso coronary smooth muscle cells zzso of zzso zzso However, the molecular identity and functional role of this putative zzso remained zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso for this zzso that encodes an open reading frame for a protein of zzso zzso acids with the highest zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of this zzso in zzso cells revealed a novel pharmacology in that zzso and zzso were full zzso and zzso was more potent and zzso than zzso for increasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso induced a zzso increase in cellular DNA content, protein zzso cell number, and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso indicating a zzso role for zzso zzso This was supported by the finding that the treatment of zzso with zzso zzso to the cloned zzso sequence significantly inhibited zzso and zzso DNA and protein zzso In addition, reverse zzso chain reaction analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso was dramatically increased in cells of zzso arteries compared with freshly harvested zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso level was zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in cells of coronary arteries zzso in zzso In conclusion, we have cloned the zzso zzso zzso with novel pharmacology and demonstrated that this zzso is zzso in zzso of in zzso organ cultures or in zzso zzso coronary arteries to mediate the zzso effects of zzso
