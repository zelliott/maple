An arrayed library of human zzso nuclear complementary zzso DNA was constructed from a zzso cell hybrid zzso containing an zzso marker as the sole human zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso of zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso with a primer zzso containing a random zzso at its 3' zzso zzso amplification of human sequences from this zzso was performed using zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso The products were zzso cloned and an arrayed library was zzso zzso indicated that all clones were derived from transcribed zzso A number of randomly isolated clones were evaluated by Southern and Northern experiments, sequence analysis, and zzso At least zzso of these clones were of human zzso zzso The number of independent clones in the library was estimated to be approximately zzso Using 60 zzso clones as zzso 6 showed positive signals on Northern zzso For 3 of these, the corresponding zzso were isolated: clone zzso codes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso is a human zzso of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belongs to the family of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso Southern experiments showed the 3 zzso to map to human zzso zzso as zzso Taken together these results show that the generation of a zzso library is a useful tool for the isolation of unknown genes located on a human zzso zzso present in a zzso cell zzso
