To observe the zzso and resistance profiles of the zzso zzso causing zzso zzso in Taiwan, 12 zzso zzso zzso were zzso collected from patients with zzso zzso in a hospital during zzso zzso data were zzso and zzso were identified by zzso methods and zzso zzso zzso zzso to 14 zzso compounds were zzso zzso were further zzso by sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso associated with zzso spreading was the most common skin presentations caused by zzso zzso All of the zzso were susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and resistant to zzso zzso and zzso while zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso varied among the 12 zzso zzso zzso delineated the 12 zzso into 2 major groups, which was zzso with different single zzso zzso at position 160 zzso versus zzso of zzso zzso different levels of zzso minimum zzso concentration zzso versus zzso zzso and prevalence of zzso zzso versus zzso We have noted that tiny zzso zzso can be the first sign of zzso zzso which we believe has not been previously zzso No resistance to zzso and zzso was zzso therefore, zzso drugs remain effective for treatment of zzso zzso in zzso
