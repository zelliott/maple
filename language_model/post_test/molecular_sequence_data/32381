zzso has been implicated in maintenance of a normal cellular zzso ratio and the zzso of zzso damaged zzso In order to obtain more information about these important regulatory proteins in zzso we have previously cloned and expressed the first zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso In this work, the second zzso gene zzso was zzso About zzso of zzso coded by zzso was produced in a soluble form while zzso of zzso coded by zzso was found in inclusion zzso To improve the production of soluble zzso we constructed two zzso zzso with zzso in zzso site zzso by zzso and zzso with zzso zzso region zzso Only the latter zzso was successfully expressed in soluble form with increased zzso activity and showed less sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the structure of zzso with less zzso nature could give more opportunity for protein zzso and could improve the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso determines the zzso of zzso and may provide another strategy for increasing expression level of soluble zzso proteins in zzso zzso
