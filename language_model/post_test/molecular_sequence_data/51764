zzso peptides with zzso acid sequences corresponding to predicted zzso segments of zzso toxin were used as zzso to identify a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso II, with sequence zzso forms zzso channels when zzso in zzso zzso zzso The single channel zzso in zzso M zzso or zzso is 28 zzso 3 and 24 zzso 2 zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso with sequence zzso zzso as zzso I, or a zzso with the same zzso acid composition as zzso II but with a zzso zzso do not form zzso zzso energy calculations show that a bundle of four zzso zzso is a plausible structural motif underlying zzso pore zzso The identified functional module may account for the zzso activity of both zzso toxin and the zzso zzso toxin zzso
