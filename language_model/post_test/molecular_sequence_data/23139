zzso virus zzso zzso 78 protein is known to inhibit the promoter site of several zzso and viral zzso including the human zzso zzso type 16 E6 transforming zzso The zzso studies of zzso 78 have been reported, but the effects of zzso 78 zzso zzso of zzso 16 E6 promoter activity on the various human cervical zzso cells have not been zzso zzso zzso cloned by zzso zzso 78, is zzso into cervical zzso zzso zzso efficiency of zzso 78 was approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso 78 gene was significantly higher on day 1 of the zzso of zzso 78 DNA in zzso cells, and DNA level of zzso 16 E6 was decreased on day 1 of the zzso The growth of zzso cervical cancer cells was only zzso inhibited by zzso 78, and the other cervical cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unaffected by zzso 78 zzso In spite of the high efficiency of zzso 78 gene transformation and expression rate, we could not show the significant growth zzso in various cervical cancer cell zzso Taken together, long-term expression of zzso 78 strategy might be needed for cervical zzso gene therapy using zzso zzso
