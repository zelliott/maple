The third component of complement zzso exists in two main zzso forms, zzso and zzso which can be distinguished at the molecular level using a variation of the zzso chain zzso An increased frequency of the zzso zzso has been noted in a number of zzso and inflammatory conditions affecting the zzso including systemic zzso zzso zzso and type II zzso zzso Recently, in an unrelated study, we found (with small zzso an increased zzso of graft loss associated with the presence of the zzso zzso To further assess this, we analyzed the zzso zzso in 183 zzso pairs of patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso of 183 zzso were lost, but graft loss was not associated with the zzso zzso over zzso zzso However, the presence of the zzso zzso predicted an increased risk of graft dysfunction zzso as serum zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso versus zzso with a relative risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso predisposed toward graft dysfunction when present in either donor or zzso The presence of two zzso zzso gave a relative risk for graft dysfunction of zzso suggesting a zzso effect, although numbers were zzso The presence of the zzso zzso was not significantly correlated with the number of rejection episodes, serum zzso or duration of primary zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso mechanisms for this association are zzso
