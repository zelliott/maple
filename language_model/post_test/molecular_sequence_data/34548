The development of insulin zzso over the last two decades have aimed at zzso the zzso profile of zzso injected insulin for therapeutic use in diabetes zzso Rapid acting zzso were successfully engineered and marketed in the late zzso In engineering zzso zzso it has been a particular challenge to obtain action profiles that would be predictable from day to day in the same zzso The most recent approach has been to zzso the insulin zzso with a fatty acid which provides the insulin zzso with a specific affinity for zzso The first clinically available agent of this type is insulin zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso zzso binding will zzso zzso following subcutaneous injection but still allow the insulin zzso to be zzso by the insulin zzso following zzso from the carrier zzso Moreover, the molecular features of insulin zzso are attractive in that the zzso can be formulated as a neutral zzso solution and does not zzso after zzso Together with an important zzso mechanism zzso by plasma zzso zzso this explains a highly significant reduction of zzso zzso of zzso response observed in repeat zzso clamp studies where insulin zzso was compared to other zzso insulin zzso No safety considerations have been identified in using zzso as an insulin carrier to zzso and buffer insulin zzso In assessing the clinical attractiveness of insulin zzso it is zzso critically important to consider how the molecular modifications impact efficacy and zzso A number of pharmacological studies have shown that insulin zzso overall retains the molecular pharmacological properties of native human insulin, including a zzso balance between zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, insulin zzso provides an attractive novel approach for zzso zzso insulin delivery to people with zzso
