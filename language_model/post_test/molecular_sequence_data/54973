zzso zzso of a human zzso virus zzso isolated from clinical specimens depends on molecular identification of the unique and exclusive zzso base sequence in the zzso region of a highly zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso Among other options, a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technology using two consecutive zzso zzso of the target DNA in tandem with three consensus general zzso may be used to detect a minute quantity of zzso DNA in crude zzso K zzso of zzso cells, and to prepare the template for zzso by automated direct DNA zzso A short target sequence of zzso bases excised from the computer-generated zzso is sufficient for zzso determination of all clinically relevant zzso zzso based on the database stored in the zzso This chapter discusses the principle and the essential technical elements in performing zzso zzso DNA amplification for the detection of zzso from clinical specimens and short target sequence zzso for zzso using standard molecular biology laboratory equipment and commercially available zzso
