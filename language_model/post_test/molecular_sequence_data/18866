The zzso tumor 1 gene zzso can either repress or induce the expression of zzso zzso with its tumor zzso role, elevated zzso levels have been observed in leukemia and solid zzso zzso has also been suggested to act as an zzso by inducing the expression of zzso and zzso However, these are only the zzso studies, and no functional study has been performed to zzso zzso with its tumor zzso role, zzso binds to zzso zzso II as part of a zzso zzso regulatory complex and causes zzso repression of zzso zzso and zzso It also zzso zzso zzso Based on the reduced level of zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso samples in the absence of zzso promoter zzso and zzso we speculated that an zzso zzso factor is regulating its zzso The zzso analysis predicted zzso as an zzso zzso factor to regulate the zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso decreased zzso levels and promoted proliferation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso results demonstrated binding of zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso treatment of zzso cells led to an zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso further suggesting regulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso activity of zzso by zzso zzso An inverse correlation between expression levels of zzso and zzso was observed in zzso zzso These observations indicated that zzso functions as an zzso by zzso the expression of zzso in zzso We suggest that targeting zzso could be a therapeutic strategy for cancer, including zzso
