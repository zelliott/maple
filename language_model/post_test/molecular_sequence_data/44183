A specific zzso zzso zzso was produced to rapidly purify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso acid sequence zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso zzso specifically and sensitively with both zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso was rapidly zzso to a specific activity of zzso zzso with a yield of zzso by a three-step zzso including zzso zzso zzso The specific activity of zzso was increased about zzso from the cell zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso was estimated to be about 50 zzso by zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso exhibited no significant similarity to other zzso except for a zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso These results suggest that there might be some molecular types of zzso
