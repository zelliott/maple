The zzso and fatty zzso proteins zzso are two recently identified protein families that both function by binding small zzso zzso We have sought to clarify relationships within and between these two groups through an analysis of both structure and zzso Within a similar overall folding pattern, we find large parts of the zzso and zzso structures to be zzso zzso The three largest structurally zzso regions within the zzso common core zzso to characteristic sequence motifs that we have used to determine the constitution of this family using an zzso sequence analysis zzso This afforded a new interpretation of the family, which highlighted the difficulties of determining a comprehensive and coherent zzso of the zzso The first of the three zzso sequence motifs is also common to the zzso and zzso to a zzso structural element characteristic of both zzso zzso of structure and sequence within the two families suggests that they form part of a larger zzso zzso we have christened this overall group the zzso to reflect the zzso structure of its zzso
