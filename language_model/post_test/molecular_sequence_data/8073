zzso is required for transport zzso budding from the zzso in zzso zzso and encodes a large zzso protein found on the zzso membrane and as part of the coat of transport zzso In a screen to find functionally related zzso we isolated zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an integral zzso membrane protein whose zzso domain binds to the zzso domain of zzso as shown by zzso zzso and zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso probably occurs before budding is complete, because zzso is not found in zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreases the rate of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso defective in zzso formation, but not those that affect later steps in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is important, but not necessary, for zzso formation at the zzso zzso a close zzso of zzso also acts early in the assembly of transport zzso However, zzso performs a different function than zzso since zzso does not bind zzso and genetic tests show that zzso and zzso are not functionally zzso The importance of zzso for zzso formation is zzso by the isolation of a zzso silent zzso zzso that produces a strong zzso to zzso transport zzso when combined with zzso zzso zzso genetic interactions between zzso zzso and zzso show close functional links between these proteins and imply that they might function together as a zzso complex on the zzso zzso
