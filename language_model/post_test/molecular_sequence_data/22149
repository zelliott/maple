zzso a novel class of insect active zzso produced by zzso zzso are used for insect control in a number of commercial zzso Recently, a new class of zzso was discovered from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso also called zzso are very similar to zzso differing in the length of the side chain at zzso and in the variety of novel minor zzso The zzso zzso genes zzso were cloned on four zzso covering a zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso Their function in zzso zzso was confirmed by a zzso zzso and subsequent zzso by cloned zzso The coding sequences of the zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso were highly zzso In particular, the zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso zzso acid identity, with one notable zzso The zzso gene sequence codes for one additional zzso zzso which is responsible for the additional two zzso in the zzso zzso The DNA sequence of zzso genes in this region suggested that the zzso zzso zzso gene could have been the result of an zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes represent the putative parental gene structure that was naturally engineered by deletion to create the zzso zzso
