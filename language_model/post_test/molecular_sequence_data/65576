The potent zzso zzso and zzso properties of protein zzso 4 zzso from the rat seminal zzso zzso zzso have previously been found to be modulated by a zzso zzso zzso More structural details that integrate experimental data into a zzso framework have recently been zzso Unfortunately, zzso zzso and zzso strategies were not successful in creating a theoretical model of the structural organization of zzso It was zzso that the global structure of zzso is not similar to that of any protein of known three-dimensional zzso zzso the classical approach to the zzso zzso in this paper we report novel information obtained by comparing the zzso parameters of zzso with two zzso composed of zzso unfolded and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we zzso the zzso sequence by several publicly available zzso zzso Overall, disorder predictions and a zzso of existing experimental data strongly suggest that zzso needs large plasticity to efficiently interact with the different targets that characterize its multifaceted biological function, and should therefore be better classified as an zzso zzso zzso
