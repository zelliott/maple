zzso zzso zzso zzso roots through the activity of three essential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso gene acts as an accessory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to the highly zzso zzso gene family with remotely related representatives in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain zzso zzso zzso with active zzso zzso Here, we report on the properties of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso A4 induce comparable, strong growth effects affecting all parts of the zzso Several have not been described earlier and were found to be very similar to the effects of the zzso related zzso gene zzso They include leaf zzso and starch zzso zzso increase of zzso leaf disk expansion, growth of isolated roots on zzso media, and stimulation of zzso zzso by small root zzso zzso our findings indicate that enhancement of zzso zzso plays an important role in generating the complex zzso and zzso zzso and might be an ancestral property of the zzso zzso
