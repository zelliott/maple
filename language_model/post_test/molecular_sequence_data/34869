Several groups of zzso zzso as represented by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were once widely considered to be the most primitive extant zzso zzso The main evidence for this is their zzso zzso and possessing some other primitive features between zzso and zzso and being zzso to all zzso with zzso in zzso zzso from many zzso Some authors even proposed that these organisms zzso before the zzso origin of zzso within zzso This view was once considered to be very significant to the study of origin and evolution of zzso cells zzso However, in recent years this has been challenged by accumulating evidence from new zzso Here the sequences of DNA zzso II in G zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified first by zzso and sequencing, then combining with the sequence data of the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso groups of different evolutionary positions from zzso zzso trees were constructed by various methods to investigate the evolutionary positions of these zzso zzso Our results showed that since the characteristics of DNA zzso II make it avoid the zzso of zzso zzso appearing in the previous zzso zzso our trees can not only reflect effectively the relationship of different major zzso groups, which is widely accepted, but also reveal zzso positions for these zzso zzso which is different from the previous zzso zzso They are not the zzso zzso but zzso after some zzso organisms such as zzso and zzso they are not a united group but occupy different zzso zzso Combining with the recent zzso findings of zzso zzso in them, we think that though some of them zzso zzso as represented by zzso may occupy a very low evolutionary position, generally these organisms are not as extremely primitive as was thought before; they should be zzso groups zzso after the zzso origin of zzso to adapt themselves to zzso zzso zzso
