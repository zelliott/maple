Both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are type I zzso expressed on the cell surface from where the zzso active zzso are released to circulation by a regulated zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso activity is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso and not by sequences at or around the zzso zzso In the current study we have identified that the zzso zzso encompassing zzso to 655 of the zzso form are needed for its zzso To narrow down this region further, we have examined the zzso of zzso zzso proteins in zzso cells and zzso zzso These experiments identified five zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso proteins that were essential for their zzso When the corresponding zzso were zzso by zzso in native zzso and zzso zzso the zzso proteins were not zzso although they were displayed on the cell surface and zzso zzso These results demonstrated that a small region in the zzso of zzso is required for its zzso at the zzso zzso This conclusion was further supported by our observation that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso although the zzso form did not contain the zzso zzso
