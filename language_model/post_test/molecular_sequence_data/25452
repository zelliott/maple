The main intrinsic membrane protein of the lens fiber cell, zzso has been previously shown to be zzso in preparations of lens zzso zzso occurred on zzso zzso near the zzso zzso of the zzso Since zzso is thought to function as a channel protein in lens plasma zzso possibly as a zzso channel zzso zzso could regulate the assembly or gating of these zzso We sought to identify the specific zzso which are zzso in order to help identify the zzso involved in regulating zzso zzso To this end we zzso a zzso zzso from native zzso that had not been subjected to any zzso zzso or zzso zzso Any zzso detected in these fragments must be due to cellular zzso and thus is termed in zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso with zzso protein zzso to determine the mobility of zzso and zzso zzso peptides on different zzso columns and to determine possible zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Lens zzso which contain zzso of the protein as zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso were released from the zzso region of zzso and a major product of zzso zzso remained zzso zzso of the zzso peptides on zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that one of these fragments, corresponding to zzso zzso in zzso was partially zzso The zzso and zzso forms of this zzso were separated on zzso zzso In zzso zzso sites were found at zzso 243 and 245 through zzso modification via zzso and sequence zzso zzso was never detected on zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso 243 could be increased by incubation of zzso with zzso protein zzso under standard zzso zzso Other zzso that zzso zzso found near zzso zzso acids must be responsible for the in zzso zzso demonstrated at zzso zzso
