The zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein zzso with strong zzso to zzso zzso was cloned from nine zzso zzso zzso The zzso water zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressing the gene cloned from the zzso strain zzso was zzso times higher than the zzso of zzso expressing the gene cloned from other strains zzso zzso initially cloned without its zzso zzso zzso an approximately 3 times higher water zzso than the full-length zzso This zzso to a zzso higher protein density in the zzso plasma zzso as shown by zzso electron zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso confirmed the presence of functional water channels in zzso and a pharmacological study indicated that this strain contains at least a second functional zzso
