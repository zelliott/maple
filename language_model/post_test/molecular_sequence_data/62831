An internal zzso entry segment zzso has been identified in the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso of two members of the zzso family of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso can involve the alternative mechanism of internal zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso another zzso family member, also contains an zzso Previous studies have shown that the translation of zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso can involve both zzso initiation and internal zzso In contrast, the data presented here suggest that internal initiation can account for all of the translation initiation that occurs on an zzso with the zzso zzso in its zzso zzso Like many other cellular zzso the zzso zzso appears to be modular in nature and the entire zzso zzso is required for maximum zzso zzso The zzso entry window within the zzso zzso is located some distance upstream of the initiation zzso and thus, this zzso uses a zzso and zzso mechanism to initiate zzso Finally, we have derived a secondary structural model for the zzso The model confirms that the zzso zzso is highly structured and predicts that a zzso may form near the zzso end of the zzso
