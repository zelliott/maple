A zzso presumably involved in zzso was identified and characterized by using zzso zzso zzso intensity was zzso fold higher in adult zzso than that in fetal zzso The full length of this gene was zzso zzso and it zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso structure and zzso acid sequence analysis revealed that the protein contained 1 zzso 2 zzso and a functional active site zzso lay upstream of zzso domain, all of them also existed in zzso zzso E1 and E1 like zzso So we named this gene as a novel zzso zzso E1 like gene zzso zzso profile showed that zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso of the expression of zzso in different zzso stages of zzso indicated that it was highly expressed in adult zzso In conclusion, zzso is a novel human E1 like gene highly expressed in adult zzso which plays key role in zzso system, and accordingly influences zzso and male zzso
