The zzso type zzso c zzso consisting of the core zzso I and II only was isolated from the soil zzso zzso zzso and zzso as complex with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be grown in the presence of a number of different zzso zzso However, only zzso and zzso yielded zzso zzso suitable for high resolution zzso zzso zzso The zzso belong to space group zzso and zzso zzso to at least zzso A (1 A zzso zzso zzso resolution using zzso zzso The structure was determined to a resolution of zzso A using molecular replacement and refined to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The refined model includes zzso I and II and the 2 chains of the zzso fragment, 2 zzso A zzso 3 copper zzso and 1 zzso zzso a new metal zzso binding site, 52 tentatively identified water zzso and 9 zzso zzso Only four of the water molecules are located in the zzso half of zzso c zzso Most of them are near the interface of zzso I and zzso Several waters form a zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and the zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso binds to the zzso polar domain of zzso II and is critically involved in the formation of the crystal zzso The zzso procedure is well zzso and will allow for the analysis of the structures of mechanistically interesting zzso zzso c zzso
