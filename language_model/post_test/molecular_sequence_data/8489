Cell type in the zzso zzso zzso is determined by information present at the zzso zzso zzso can switch mating types when zzso information located at a silent zzso zzso or zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are kept silent through the action of a number of zzso one of which is the zzso zzso zzso We have identified a binding site for zzso within the Ya region of zzso and zzso In order to examine the function of this zzso site, we have constructed strains that lack the site in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso with the idea that zzso plays a redundant role in zzso it was found that a triple deletion of the zzso sites at zzso Ya and I did not permit the expression of zzso We have also shown that zzso deletion of the binding site at zzso had no effect on the level of cutting by the HO zzso nor on the amount of zzso switching zzso Similarly, zzso deletion of all three zzso sites at zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso
