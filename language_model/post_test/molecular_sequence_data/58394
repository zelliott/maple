zzso human von zzso Factor zzso a zzso zzso essential to zzso has been developed as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of von zzso disease zzso Permanent zzso zzso zzso cell clones zzso zzso zzso zzso were established in order to ensure complete zzso zzso removal zzso zzso zzso Reiter, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Large quantities of material are required for in zzso tests and clinical zzso This demand is commonly met by achieving high-yield expression of the desired protein via zzso zzso of zzso necessary to completely process increasing amounts of zzso zzso could not be accomplished, presumably due to lethal effects of zzso zzso for the host cells zzso zzso zzso zzso University of zzso Recent reports have zzso that zzso can only mediate zzso processing zzso zzso and Kaufman (1992) Blood 79, zzso zzso zzso and Kaufman (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso We report here that zzso processing, however, occurs predominantly zzso upon zzso zzso zzso experiments employing zzso as well as zzso zzso media demonstrate that zzso precursors are accessible and zzso by zzso in zzso Exposure to zzso in zzso converts the zzso zzso pattern typical of incompletely processed zzso zzso into highly homogeneous and structurally intact zzso superior to the ones exhibited by zzso zzso These findings thus demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale production of a completely zzso intact and homogeneous zzso preparation, based on individual zzso high-yield expression and subsequent zzso removal by zzso in zzso
