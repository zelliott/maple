zzso deposition of zzso zzso zzso or A4 protein zzso zzso is associated with Alzheimer's disease and with zzso syndrome zzso for zzso zzso The large zzso precursor protein zzso of zzso is normally zzso within the zzso region by a putative zzso zzso zzso to release its zzso zzso zzso is produced by an alternative zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso contains a zzso inhibitor domain for the zzso zzso zzso A, which is located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso forms of zzso In addition, we show that the zzso has an zzso zzso activity, which zzso the zzso bond in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso inhibitor domain of zzso and zzso A may be involved in the formation of zzso
