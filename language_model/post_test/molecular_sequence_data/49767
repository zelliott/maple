A novel member of the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso is identified here as a core component of the zzso zzso is zzso localized to the daughter zzso throughout the cell zzso The zzso domain (54 zzso zzso of zzso is responsible for its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an apparent mass of 67 zzso zzso zzso zzso during its zzso zzso of zzso or its zzso domain does not influence zzso zzso or amplification but interferes with the zzso cell cycle zzso zzso also resides for part of the cell cycle in the zzso and interacts with zzso The presence of both zzso and zzso at the zzso may link the DNA damage surveillance network to the zzso zzso zzso
