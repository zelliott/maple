The zzso membrane protein zzso family is essential to zzso protein zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a role in protein transport to the plasma zzso In this study, we describe a new rat zzso zzso produced by alternative zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso dominates in each zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence for the newly discovered zzso zzso reveals that its expression is determined by whether an zzso is retained or zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences for the zzso zzso differ at the zzso end of the zzso A similar process has been described for zzso in zzso zzso and suggests a zzso function for the zzso domain that can be zzso
