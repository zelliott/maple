The isolation and the characterization of two tobacco zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso the major zzso protein from zzso zzso are zzso Their predicted zzso acid sequences zzso to proteins of zzso 21 zzso in which the characteristic regions common to zzso zzso are zzso Southern analysis indicates that the genes corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso derive respectively from zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso distribution in tobacco plants indicates that these two genes are zzso expressed in flowers and growing zzso Whatever the tissue tested, zzso zzso is more abundant than zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reveals zzso and zzso expression of these two genes in flower parts of tobacco zzso In particular, regulation of zzso zzso zzso appears to be correlated with zzso growth of each floral zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli, is recognized by zzso raised against zzso
