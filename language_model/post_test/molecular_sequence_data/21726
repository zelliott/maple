zzso zzso was used to investigate the role of a zzso zzso zzso ) in protein formation, by mutating zzso at both sides, we mapped its contribution to overall stability and its role in folding zzso We found that both of the above zzso are also part of a dense interaction network composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso the fold stabilizing effects, we compared and contrasted electronic circular zzso and zzso data of zzso equipped with a zzso with those of the zzso deleted zzso Data were acquired both in neutral and in zzso zzso solutions to decipher the pH dependency of both fully and partially charged zzso Our results indicate that the folding of zzso zzso is more complex than a simple two-state process as we detected an intermediate state that differs significantly from the native zzso The intermediate formation is related to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso equipped with zzso the population of the intermediate state at zzso pH is significantly higher than it is for the zzso deleted zzso In this molecular framework zzso zzso more than zzso does, because of its higher degree of zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not an isolated entity of this zzso rather it is an integrated part of a complex interaction zzso
