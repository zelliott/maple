zzso is a functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which is activated by zzso and is thereby zzso into the zzso of anterior tip cells of the zzso region of the zzso By using in zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso zzso which contains the zzso gene that encodes a putative zzso zzso protein and is expressed in the anterior tip cells, was greatly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso however, resulted in almost no zzso zzso The absence of any obvious zzso zzso in the zzso zzso could be due to a zzso of similar zzso In fact, a search of the zzso whole zzso database demonstrates the existence of an additional 16 zzso all of which contain a zzso zzso Among these zzso four genes show zzso zzso while the others are zzso We discuss the potential role of zzso in zzso via its effect on the interaction between cellulose and these zzso zzso family zzso
