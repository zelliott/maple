zzso and zzso zzso formation is considered to be mainly responsible for early implant failure caused by zzso of zzso zzso Nevertheless, little is known about the complex microbial diversity and zzso similarities around dental zzso An zzso assessment was made of the diversity of microbial communities around titanium implants by single strand zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene zzso as well as subsequent sequence zzso zzso of adherent zzso and zzso zzso zzso were collected from ten zzso Additionally, samples of zzso were taken at titanium implant zzso and remaining zzso The bacteria in the samples were characterized by zzso and sequence zzso A high diversity of bacteria varying between patients and within one patient at different locations was zzso zzso characteristic for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso communities were zzso zzso of the zzso showed higher abundance of zzso species than from residual zzso zzso and zzso species frequently reported from the oral cavity were not detected at the zzso suggesting a role as late zzso Different niches in the human mouth are characterized by specific groups of zzso zzso zzso are a very valuable approach to study dental zzso development in zzso
