We have cloned a gene for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which is zzso in lower plants by the zzso zzso in higher plants by the nuclear zzso demonstrating genetic information transfer from the zzso zzso to the nucleus during flowering plant zzso The sequence zzso encodes an zzso extension as well as an zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso region has high zzso acid sequence similarity with the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso from plant zzso suggesting a common lineage of the zzso The deduced zzso region of zzso a second zzso zzso of zzso shows high sequence similarity with the putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The sharing of the zzso region together with its zzso zzso untranslated zzso sequence in different proteins strongly suggests an involvement of zzso for targeting signal acquisition after gene zzso A remnant of ancestral zzso zzso transcribed and subjected to zzso editing, is found in the zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso zzso gene expression was initiated at the zzso level prior to termination of zzso
