During gene zzso the effect of binding of zzso factors to zzso DNA sequences is transmitted to zzso zzso by means of zzso Although zzso contribute to the efficiency of transcription, their zzso roles are poorly zzso We used zzso to conduct molecular and genetic dissection of an zzso zzso but unique zzso zzso zzso Factor 1 zzso in a zzso zzso Through zzso zzso was found to form a zzso complex including zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso that lacks the zzso gene in which no stable association between zzso and zzso is zzso and zzso of a zzso reporter gene is reduced by zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso are viable, zzso becomes zzso in zzso background, causing severe zzso in zzso and the central nervous system, similar to those resulting from a complete loss of zzso zzso These data demonstrate a crucial role of zzso in the development of zzso and central nervous zzso
