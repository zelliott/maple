The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso ( zzso in complex with zzso zzso has been characterized by X-ray zzso and in solution by zzso zzso The structure of the complex revealed that zzso harbors a zzso zzso zzso binding pocket where the zzso binds with minimal structural zzso of the zzso These findings were zzso by obtaining sequential backbone resonance assignments of this zzso zzso zzso which enabled the study of the zzso complex by monitoring chemical shift zzso induced by addition of zzso zzso or the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The results are consistent with a zzso zzso zzso binding site and also demonstrate that the zzso complex is largely stabilized by interactions between the protein and the zzso zzso portion of the zzso Analysis of the crystal structure also shows a vast network of interactions between the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the characteristic zzso zzso zzso extension that is typical of bacterial zzso but is absent in their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso place their respective zzso and zzso rings 15 A apart and separated by zzso in the zzso zzso The network of interactions among zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso extension indicate that the gross zzso zzso that would be necessary to place the zzso and zzso rings parallel and adjacent to one another for direct hydride transfer between zzso and zzso in zzso is highly zzso This conclusion is supported by observations made in the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso complex, which strongly suggest that zzso in the zzso sequence do not undergo zzso exchange in the presence or absence of zzso zzso These findings are discussed in the context of a possible zzso zzso transfer of hydride in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso
