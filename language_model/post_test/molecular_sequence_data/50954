We report a unique application of the Random zzso zzso DNA zzso technique for genetic linkage mapping of a single spruce tree using zzso DNA from zzso tissue of individual zzso zzso segregating zzso were zzso for zzso inheritance and zzso zzso of the 61 markers were distributed into 12 linkage groups and covered zzso zzso The 14 markers not associated with any linkage group should be assigned to linkage groups as more markers are added to the zzso This new approach quickly provides molecular genetic markers that are simple to evaluate for constructing genetic linkage maps and for other related genetic studies in forest tree zzso
