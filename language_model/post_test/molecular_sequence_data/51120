The structural organization of an expressed bovine gene zzso that encodes an zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The gene extends over 10 zzso and is divided into 12 zzso The first zzso encodes the zzso untranslated region and approximately one-half of the zzso that targets this protein to the zzso The remainder of the zzso together with three zzso acids of the mature zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso protection analyses revealed multiple sites of zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the zzso gene can drive the zzso of a reporter gene in an zzso zzso This promoter region contains several sequence elements which might play an important role in regulating the expression of this zzso including possible zzso and zzso boxes, putative zzso sites, and sequences resembling zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene also contains sequences zzso to several motifs that are shared among some nuclear genes zzso zzso zzso These include zzso zzso zzso a respiratory zzso and zzso zzso zzso differences in the zzso zzso levels were observed with high levels found in skeletal muscle and heart, and lower levels in other zzso
