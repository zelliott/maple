While it is accepted that protein flexibility plays a role in protein zzso zzso and molecular recognition, few techniques are capable of the rigorous measurement of protein motions required to zzso zzso zzso zzso echo shift zzso can be used to measure the time scale of protein motions, and we have used this technique, along with zzso zzso and binding and structural data, to examine the zzso evolution of protein flexibility in an zzso zzso Two light chain zzso zzso increase affinity for zzso by zzso but also significantly affect zzso Specifically, a zzso of the protein is seen in each of three zzso zzso two slower motions undergo decreased zzso of zzso by 3- and zzso respectively, in response to an applied force, and the distribution associated with the zzso of a faster motion is narrowed upon zzso zzso The zzso zzso appear to zzso the zzso complex by more strongly zzso zzso to the protein and by more tightly packing the zzso The data demonstrate that in addition to zzso zzso dynamics are systematically manipulated during affinity zzso and they imply that the evolution of protein flexibility may be a central component of the immune zzso The results also reflect the type of protein zzso that may be important for other biological zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso
