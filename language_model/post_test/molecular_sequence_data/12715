A zzso clone containing the zzso zzso gene zzso was selected from a zzso library of zzso zzso fragments by colony zzso using the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso thus cloned was partially zzso and the sequence was compared first with the sequence of the zzso and then with the reported rat zzso zzso The sequence zzso and zzso structure indicated that the zzso zzso contained at least part of zzso The fragment, together with zzso DNA, was then labeled by zzso and used as a probe for in zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso system together with the zzso pattern of zzso The zzso signals revealed that zzso is localized on zzso zzso zzso
