zzso coli possesses multiple routes for iron zzso Here we present zzso zzso a novel iron acquisition system of zzso coli strain zzso zzso Laboratory strains of zzso coli such as zzso lack a functional zzso zzso gene caused by a zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso iron zzso zzso is a zzso of the iron zzso zzso from zzso The zzso gene is part of the zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in response to iron deprivation in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in improved growth of an zzso coli zzso lacking all known zzso systems and zzso increased iron zzso into zzso Furthermore, the presence of other zzso metal zzso did not impair growth of strains expressing zzso The zzso protein functioned as zzso iron zzso in zzso in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is an integral zzso membrane protein exhibiting seven zzso zzso Two zzso motifs within zzso zzso of zzso family members are implicated in iron zzso zzso zzso of each zzso motif of zzso diminished iron zzso in zzso and growth zzso In zzso the zzso zzso protein with an altered first zzso motif was impaired in iron zzso whereas activity of the zzso zzso with a zzso in the second motif was similar to the zzso zzso
