The zzso gene of zzso zzso plays a central role in controlling zzso zzso its product is required to promote the activity of at least six distinct transport systems for zzso nutrients under conditions of nitrogen zzso zzso We report here the zzso sequence of the cloned zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence indicates that zzso encodes a protein of 86 zzso which appears to be organized into two distinct structural zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso 1 to zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and several regions strongly enriched for zzso zzso suggesting a short zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso contains consensus sequences characteristic of the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso positive control of nitrogen transport systems most likely involves protein zzso Northern analysis indicates that the absence of general zzso acid zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso is not due to reduction in zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein probably acts at the zzso zzso zzso that may serve as zzso for zzso are zzso
