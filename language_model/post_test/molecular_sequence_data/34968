zzso zzso zzso a class of zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of aromatic zzso compounds through a strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso is essential for zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso dramatically zzso zzso zzso However, a putative zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently identified in zzso zzso zzso but has not yet been zzso We report here the crystal structure and functional characterization of this zzso zzso The overall fold of zzso and the geometry of its zzso zzso zzso are similar to those present in functional zzso zzso the zzso was found to be active and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the presence of a zzso or zzso in the zzso of zzso did not significantly affect zzso structure or zzso zzso analysis identified differences in zzso packing and zzso constraints in the active site of zzso that allow it to accommodate a zzso zzso These findings overturn the conventional view, demonstrating that the zzso zzso of this family of zzso is zzso Moreover, they highlight the need for further study of the evolutionary history of zzso and the functional significance of the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso
