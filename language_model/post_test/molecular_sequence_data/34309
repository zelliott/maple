More than 1860 zzso have been found within the human zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene zzso These zzso can be classified according to their degree of severity in zzso zzso Although the most common zzso are well zzso few data are available for rare zzso Thus, genetic counseling is particularly difficult when fetuses or patients with zzso present these orphan zzso We describe a three-step in zzso zzso that can evaluate rare zzso zzso zzso consequences to establish a correlation between zzso and zzso By using a green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso we expressed zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso trafficking was zzso by zzso zzso and the cellular zzso of zzso was determined using zzso zzso We studied the zzso maturation process using Western zzso analysis and evaluated zzso channel activity by automated zzso zzso zzso Of six rare zzso that we zzso five have been isolated in our zzso The cellular and functional impact that we observed in each case was compared with the clinical data concerning the patients in whom we encountered these zzso In conclusion, we propose that performing this type of analysis for orphan zzso zzso zzso can improve zzso genetic zzso
