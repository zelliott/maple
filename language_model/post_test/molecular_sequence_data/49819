zzso modeling of Ebola viral zzso predicts the formation of zzso zzso structures at the 3' and zzso zzso and zzso structures between the zzso of the zzso (or zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a high degree of identity among Ebola zzso zzso Reston, and zzso zzso zzso viruses in their 3' and zzso zzso (18 zzso in zzso and within a second region zzso by approximately 20 zzso While base pairing of the two zzso regions could lead to the formation of the base of the putative zzso or zzso structures, the intervening sequence variation altered the predictions for the rest of the zzso Using an in zzso zzso replication system, we engineered zzso designed to disrupt potential base pairing in the viral zzso zzso Analysis of these zzso by screening for enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter expression and by zzso of zzso zzso levels demonstrated that the upper portions of the putative zzso and 3' zzso structures can be zzso without affecting virus zzso
