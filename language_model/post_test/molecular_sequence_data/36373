zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha secondary shifts, defined as the difference between the observed value and the random zzso value, have been calculated for zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso of the secondary chemical shifts with those of adjacent zzso was used to smooth out local effects and to obtain a correlation dependent on secondary zzso zzso and similarities in the placement of secondary structure elements in the primary sequences of these structurally zzso proteins are zzso in the smoothed secondary chemical shifts of all three types of zzso The close correlation observed between the secondary chemical shifts and the previously defined locations of secondary structure, as defined by traditional methods, exemplifies the advantage of chemical shifts to delineate regions of secondary zzso
