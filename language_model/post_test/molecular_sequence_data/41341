The zzso repeat zzso domain is an zzso binding domain allowing members of the zzso zzso to participate in zzso processing of zzso zzso Loss of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was isolated in an active zzso zzso population and zzso analysis revealed that it was tightly linked to a zzso zzso in the first zzso of zzso Independent evidence that disruption of zzso caused the zzso zzso was provided by fine mapping to a region of zzso containing no other gene than zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequence of 832 zzso acids contains 10 zzso repeats and a zzso target zzso the function of which was zzso demonstrated by transient expression in zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso is apparently normal, zzso zzso zzso from normal development as early as 3 days after zzso are reduced in size, exhibit more or less severe zzso aberrations depending on the genetic background, and generally do not zzso The zzso zzso is the first to associate the loss of a zzso gene with an zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso generated by zzso experiments indicate that zzso also affects zzso plant growth and zzso zzso The loss of zzso zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso is the likely cause for the lack of an organized zzso network and an zzso zzso zzso
