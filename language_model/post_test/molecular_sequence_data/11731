Earlier we have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to fold back forming zzso zzso triplex with identical strands oriented parallel to each other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Letters 339, zzso zzso zzso In this study the zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso into the parallel triplex and increase its stability significantly zzso increased from zzso up to zzso degrees C in zzso M Na zzso zzso pH 7, zzso M zzso when three zzso molecules per triplex were zzso Fluorescence zzso and zzso zzso the quantum yield of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso lifetime of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 3 degrees zzso for the parallel triplex studied were shown to be similar to those for zzso zzso binding plots indicated an zzso mode of zzso binding to the parallel zzso The association constant is close to that of zzso binding to zzso The zzso experiments revealed the maximum number of binding sites to be five zzso molecules per one triplex zzso zzso mechanics calculation of possible structures for the parallel zzso complex were zzso
