The zzso zzso is activated in response to various cellular stresses to protect cells from zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso heavy chain zzso which is a zzso protein regulating zzso is present in zzso and binds to zzso to promote zzso zzso However, details of the binding interface between zzso and zzso remain zzso Here, we report on the binding mode between zzso and zzso using zzso analyses and a structural model of the interaction generated by molecular zzso zzso modeling analyses predict that an zzso zzso in zzso is crucial for binding to zzso In fact, substitution of this zzso to Ala of zzso diminished its ability to interact with zzso leading to reduced activity to zzso zzso Surprisingly, this zzso had little effect on zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso will clarify zzso roles of zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso
