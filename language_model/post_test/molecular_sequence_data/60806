zzso zzso zzso has been used to study the binding of 20 different peptides to the zzso binding protein zzso and the crystal structures of the zzso complexes have been zzso This zzso binding zzso part of the zzso zzso system of Gram negative bacteria, has evolved to bind and zzso small peptides of widely varying zzso The peptides used in this study have the sequence zzso where X is any of the 20 commonly occurring zzso zzso The various zzso found at position 2 on the zzso fit into a hydrated zzso The majority of zzso are restrained to particular zzso within the zzso Water molecules act as flexible zzso matching the zzso requirements of the protein and zzso and shielding charges on the buried zzso This use of water by zzso to broaden the repertoire of its binding site is not unique, but contrasts sharply with other proteins which use water to help bind zzso highly zzso zzso the thermodynamics of binding from the structure of the complexes is highly complicated by the influence of water on the zzso
