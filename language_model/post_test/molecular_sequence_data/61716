To investigate sequence diversity of zzso beak and feather disease virus, samples collected from 31 zzso species with or without clinical signs were tested for the presence of the viral zzso A real-time zzso chain reaction was developed amplifying a 202 base pair zzso of the region zzso the zzso protein C1 and detecting 100 to 1000 zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso chain reaction products showed zzso to zzso identity with no consistent pattern with regard to the infected bird zzso zzso acid exchanges were concentrated mainly in five of the 42 deduced zzso zzso obtained from an outbreak of acute beak and feather disease in zzso clustered in a separate branch of a zzso zzso zzso in samples from African zzso parrots with feather disorders grouped together, whereas those from the same species with zzso clustered in other zzso These results indicate the possible existence of beak and feather disease virus zzso
