The first step in zzso zzso zzso synthesis is the zzso linkage of UMP to the terminal protein zzso This reaction can be studied in zzso with two different zzso The simpler zzso is based on a zzso template and requires synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The other zzso uses specific viral sequences zzso as a template for zzso zzso and requires the addition of zzso zzso Using one or both of these zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso and metal requirements of the zzso zzso We determined the effects of single and double zzso acid zzso in zzso on the abilities of the peptides to serve as zzso for zzso zzso in zzso which zzso with zzso in zzso were found to abolish viral zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso of human zzso 14 zzso was viable, but zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso were zzso Of the three zzso zzso tested, only the zzso zzso was found to function as a zzso for zzso zzso in zzso We also examined the metal specificity of the zzso zzso reaction on a zzso zzso Our results show a strong preference of the zzso zzso for zzso as a zzso compared to zzso or other zzso zzso
