zzso in the cardiac zzso binding zzso gene zzso are among the most prevalent causes of inherited zzso zzso Although most zzso zzso cause reading zzso that are predicted to zzso truncated zzso it is not known if or how expression of these peptides causes zzso One possibility is that because the zzso contains a unique binding site for the zzso zzso of myosin, shortened zzso peptides could directly affect zzso contraction by binding to zzso To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of a zzso protein containing the zzso zzso binding site on zzso properties in zzso zzso from zzso and zzso knockout zzso In zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso increased zzso zzso sensitivity of tension, but had no effect on resting zzso zzso results were observed in zzso knockout zzso where zzso increased zzso sensitivity of tension with the zzso response zzso at approximately 5 zzso zzso zzso force was not affected by zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso protein zzso reduced its ability to increase zzso zzso These results demonstrate that binding of the zzso zzso to zzso alone is sufficient to affect zzso zzso function and suggest that regulated binding of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso directly influences zzso zzso zzso
