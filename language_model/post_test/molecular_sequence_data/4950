We previously identified zzso as a novel zzso expressed gene in the developing mouse zzso The human zzso gene was recently assigned to zzso and shown to be imprinted and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could participate in the zzso of zzso and zzso growth zzso associated with maternal zzso zzso 7 in zzso We have now initiated the characterization of the zzso locus in order to identify and dissect zzso elements implicated in its imprinted zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso as well as the DNA sequence of the zzso of the zzso including zzso zzso of promoter sequences and covering the first 2 zzso have been zzso Important sequence zzso such as a zzso island spanning zzso 1 and direct repeats, are identified and zzso To address the role of zzso modifications in the zzso of zzso a zzso analysis of the zzso gene is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso Using zzso carrying a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso we show that this partial promoter zzso pattern reflects a strict zzso differential zzso the expressed paternal zzso is zzso whereas the silenced maternal zzso is fully zzso at the zzso sites zzso That the zzso carry the zzso information necessary to lay down this zzso zzso pattern is suggested by analysis of DNA isolated from zzso and zzso zzso
