The DNA binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were zzso The affinity zzso equilibrium zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso major late promoter consensus zzso element is 2 zzso zzso M, a value similar to the affinity of zzso regulatory proteins for their binding zzso zzso binding is highly specific and recognizes zzso sites with approximately zzso lower zzso Despite this zzso zzso also binds with high affinity to several zzso elements that do not match the consensus zzso sequences zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso virus 40 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all bound zzso Furthermore, zzso was active in promoting zzso in zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Thus, contrary to previous suggestions, the existence of zzso zzso elements does not itself indicate the existence of multiple zzso zzso
