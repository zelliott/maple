DNA damage causes zzso instability and cell death, but many of the cellular responses to DNA damage still remain zzso We here report a human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso domain and novel zzso zzso zzso motifs that are involved in responses to DNA zzso We found that the zzso motif is widely distributed among DNA repair proteins of higher zzso and that zzso as well as a zzso protein with tandem zzso zzso has zzso and zzso activities against zzso site and other types of base zzso zzso accumulates rapidly at zzso breaks in a zzso zzso 1 zzso manner in human zzso Indeed, zzso interacts directly with zzso and is required for its zzso and for cellular resistance to zzso zzso zzso also interacts directly with zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins and possesses zzso activity at protruding DNA zzso Various treatments that produce zzso breaks induce formation of zzso zzso which fully coincide with zzso zzso Thus, zzso and the zzso motif may play important roles in DNA repair of higher zzso
