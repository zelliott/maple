A novel zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a sand sample collected in the desert in the west of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso irregular zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was related closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was only zzso showing that strain zzso represented a zzso species distinct from zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso AB zzso zzso
