zzso is a zzso zzso In this study we characterize the ability of zzso expressed zzso to bind and assemble zzso zzso We find that both of two zzso expressed alternatively spliced zzso of zzso can bind and assemble zzso as efficiently as preparations of zzso from bovine zzso This establishes that the zzso assembly activity found in zzso preparations from brain extracts is indeed zzso by the cloned gene for zzso It also demonstrates that zzso modification is not required for zzso of the zzso binding or assembly function of zzso zzso analyses of the zzso cages assembled by zzso expressed zzso reveals a zzso narrow size zzso This may be important for the regulation of zzso size during zzso We also express the 33 zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli, and measure its ability to bind to zzso zzso to bind to zzso zzso and to assemble zzso zzso into zzso zzso It has been suggested that the 33 zzso zzso of zzso constitutes a zzso binding zzso We find that the zzso expressed 33 zzso zzso of zzso binds to zzso zzso fails to bind to zzso zzso zzso and is not sufficient for zzso zzso The finding that the 33 zzso zzso of zzso binds to zzso zzso but fails to assemble zzso zzso into zzso cages is consistent with the published zzso zzso The finding that the 33 zzso zzso of zzso fails to bind to zzso cages is novel and potentially zzso It is clear from these experiments that the 33 zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to carry out some aspects of zzso zzso however it appears that defining the regions of the protein involved in zzso binding and assembly may be more complex than originally zzso
