zzso cells contain a large number of small zzso zzso zzso species, the vast majority of which bind zzso Most of the zzso zzso can form zzso to zzso duplexes with zzso and are thought to guide zzso of selected zzso in zzso These include zzso zzso zzso host zzso zzso zzso We have characterized two novel human zzso species, zzso and zzso which similarly exhibit zzso (with one zzso and zzso zzso and are therefore predicted to direct zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso To establish the function of zzso zzso in zzso we exploited the zzso zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso zzso genes indicated that they are zzso within multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso abolished zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso could be restored by injecting either the zzso or human zzso transcript into zzso zzso zzso of zzso and human zzso sequences revealed that only boxes C, D, and zzso as well as the zzso zzso complement, were zzso suggesting that they may be the only elements required for zzso zzso stability and zzso
