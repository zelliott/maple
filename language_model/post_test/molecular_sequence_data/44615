The zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of the rat zzso zzso was selected as a model of zzso zzso zzso segment for systematic study of synthesis and zzso zzso Application of conventional zzso chemistry resulted in very low yield of the synthesis zzso zzso when zzso was used as the zzso for zzso zzso As shorter zzso fragments of zzso showed improved swelling in zzso zzso the synthesis was repeated in this mixed zzso and the yield increased to zzso A comparative synthesis using zzso zzso chemistry and zzso derivatives of Ala and zzso to prevent zzso did not provide any zzso zzso Taken together, these results illustrate the synthetic problems associated with zzso zzso almost regardless of the chemistry zzso As expected, the zzso of zzso and of most of its minor fragments made them scarcely soluble in common zzso zzso could be achieved by loading the crude materials dissolved in zzso zzso onto a C4 zzso column and zzso with a zzso linear zzso CD studies of the zzso and of the shorter zzso with the zzso sequence zzso showed a higher percentage of zzso structure for the zzso This suggests that the shorter sequence may better represent the correct zzso region of the second zzso of the rat zzso zzso
