zzso zzso zzso are scavenging zzso that zzso cellular zzso and toxins by catalyzing the zzso of these zzso with a zzso zzso zzso are classified depending on gene organization and sequence zzso The sequence analysis of zzso DNA for zzso class zzso zzso locus in rice indicated that two zzso zzso genes lay in a tandem orientation with a short zzso zzso zzso zzso The upstream zzso and downstream zzso spanned zzso and zzso zzso with nine coding zzso zzso The transcript of zzso had a long 3' untranslated region zzso zzso that was mostly zzso by a 10th zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso contained a long zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso messages were strongly expressed in leaf zzso while transcripts from roots were low zzso Because zzso messages in leaf zzso were strongly induced only by water treatment, it was difficult to zzso for the induction of zzso transcripts by various stress zzso Thus, using rice culture cells, we analyzed the respective responses of zzso and zzso genes against various treatments by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The results showed that zzso was expressed at a level zzso zzso higher than zzso in suspension cells without stress zzso zzso was expressed zzso under various stress zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso gene was strongly enhanced to zzso by treatment with zzso zzso These observations suggested that the expression of zzso and zzso genes are zzso regulated in the culture cell of zzso
