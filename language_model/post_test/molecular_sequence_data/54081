There is currently a shortage of efficient promoters for zzso gene zzso especially in zzso zzso Here, we report analysis of the rice zzso promoter, a member of the group 3 Lea family, in transgenic rice zzso The abundance of zzso zzso increased in leaf zzso within 2 h of exposure to zzso or zzso acid zzso and within 6 h of exposure to drought, but there was no transcript increase in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the roots similarly to in the leaves, but at a faster zzso The promoter was linked to the zzso reporter zzso transformed into rice, and its activity was analyzed in transgenic plants at all stages of plant growth from zzso zzso zzso flowers, and to dry seeds, both before and after stress zzso The activity of the promoter was significantly increased in the whole plant body, including flowers, on exposure of plants to stress conditions, with very low levels of zzso activity in all zzso Moreover, the promoter was found to be predominantly active in the whole zzso including zzso zzso and zzso layer during seed zzso Together, we have identified and analyzed the zzso promoter and found a previously zzso zzso zzso property in the whole plant body with activity in the whole grain during seed zzso
