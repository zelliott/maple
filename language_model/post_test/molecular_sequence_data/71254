Two regulatory genes zzso and zzso were identified from a zzso zzso copper resistance zzso and characterized by zzso fusion to the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso and zzso are organized within an zzso controlling the zzso of cat in a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from zzso and zzso show zzso to the response and sensor proteins of known zzso regulatory zzso zzso within either zzso or both genes zzso the zzso activity, suggesting the presence of no zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso host zzso The zzso start site involved in copper induction was mapped by primer zzso
