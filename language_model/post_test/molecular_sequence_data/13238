zzso and zzso elements of the immediate zzso zzso region of the gene coding for human factor zzso were identified and zzso The major zzso start site, designated as zzso was determined by zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso analysis of human liver zzso and was found to be located 50 zzso upstream from the translation start zzso Two minor zzso start sites were found at zzso zzso zzso and zzso Progressive deletions of the zzso zzso region were fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene and transient expression in zzso and zzso cells was zzso Two promoter elements that were essential for zzso zzso were zzso The first site, zzso located at zzso zzso to zzso functioned independently of orientation or position and contributed about one-third of the promoter activity of the factor zzso zzso zzso zzso competition, and zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that this site contained an zzso binding element zzso to the promoters in the genes coding for factor IX and factor zzso The second site, zzso located at zzso zzso to zzso also functioned independent of orientation or position and contributed about two thirds of the promoter activity in the gene for factor zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequences demonstrated that a zzso G + zzso core sequence which shares zzso sequence identity with the zzso gene zzso was essential for the function of the second zzso zzso and competition zzso suggested that this site also binds zzso factors as well as the zzso factor zzso Two zzso elements located upstream of the promoter region spanning zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso were also identified by reporter gene zzso
