zzso zzso zzso were zzso from synaptic plasma zzso or synaptic zzso zzso recycling zzso from both bovine and rat brains and from a zzso cell line, zzso Several zzso could be identified in zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso activity involved protein extraction with detergents, zzso zzso zzso under stringent conditions and native zzso zzso activity could be attributed to a very tight complex of several proteins that could not be separated except by zzso zzso resolved the zzso complex into at least five zzso which could be zzso and identified zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso tightly associated with the zzso proteins zzso C and zzso zzso activity could be zzso from both synaptic plasma zzso and recycling zzso yields being much greater from the latter zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso from a zzso cell line zzso by zzso of intact cells and affinity zzso with zzso and zzso zzso under very stringent zzso also displayed zzso activity tightly associated with zzso The association of zzso in a tight complex was confirmed by its zzso from cellular and membrane extracts of zzso using zzso directed against any component protein of the complex followed by zzso with zzso directed against the other zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso activity zzso In addition, induction of the different components of the complex during zzso stress was demonstrated by the zzso zzso zzso in synchronized zzso zzso The role of the complex in membrane fusion and cellular response to zzso zzso stress during growth and development is zzso
