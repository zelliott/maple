zzso zzso type 10 zzso is an zzso dominant disorder characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso is caused by an expansion of an zzso zzso repeat in zzso 9 of the zzso 10 zzso gene zzso an approximately zzso protein of unknown zzso However, how this zzso leads to zzso is zzso 

In an effort to understand the zzso mechanism of zzso the authors conducted a series of experiments to address the effect of repeat expansion on the zzso and zzso processing of the zzso zzso In addition, we generated zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso mice and addressed the role of zzso gene dosage on the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is transcribed at the normal level, and the zzso containing an expanded repeat is processed normally in zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited embryonic zzso zzso zzso were overtly normal and did not develop zzso zzso 

A simple gain of function or loss of function of zzso is unlikely to be the major zzso mechanism contributing to the zzso zzso type 10 zzso
