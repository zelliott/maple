Two novel marine, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from coastal seawater in Tokyo zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the two zzso are members of the zzso zzso sharing highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso values between zzso zzso zzso zzso and these zzso were only zzso zzso in contrast to the high DNA zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso At least 1 % zzso zzso was required for zzso Cellular fatty acid profiles revealed zzso : zzso as the major component and zzso : zzso zzso as the major zzso fatty zzso zzso was detected as the major respiratory zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of both strains was 69 zzso On the basis of zzso zzso data and zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that these strains should be placed in a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a reference zzso
