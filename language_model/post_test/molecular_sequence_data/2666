The solution structure of zzso zzso zzso and of the putative active site zzso zzso has been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso at 600 zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso are assigned in a sequential manner with a combination of two-dimensional zzso zzso Some assignments made in our previous paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, zzso were found to be incorrect and are now zzso Analysis of the zzso data indicates that zzso consists of an zzso compact domain zzso zzso held together by three zzso linkages and a zzso zzso tail zzso zzso which does not fold back on the rest of the zzso This last observation zzso conclusions drawn by us previously on zzso extracted from its natural source, the zzso zzso zzso The improved sensitivity of the zzso zzso relative to that of our old zzso zzso the availability of two zzso with slightly different chemical shifts, and the additional information arising from zzso assignments of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have permitted the determination of the solution structure of zzso with much greater precision than zzso zzso calculations on the zzso domain using the hybrid distance zzso simulated zzso method were based on 685 and zzso approximate zzso distance restraints derived from nuclear zzso enhancement zzso data for the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, together with 16 distance restraints for 8 backbone hydrogen bonds identified on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso exchange data and 26 zzso backbone and 18 zzso 1 zzso zzso angle restraints derived from zzso and zzso zzso constant zzso A total of 32 structures were zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso and zzso which form the core of the zzso domain is well determined in both cases with an average atomic zzso difference between the individual structures and the respective mean structures of approximately zzso A for the backbone atoms and approximately 1 A for all zzso As found zzso the orientation of the exposed finger of zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to the core could not be determined on the basis of the present data due to the absence of any long-range zzso between the exposed finger and the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
