The zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso are named zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso which regulates a variety of cellular functions that are mainly controlled by zzso zzso A previously described zzso zzso nuclear zzso sequence zzso lies in the zzso DNA binding domain of zzso between zzso acids zzso however, this targeting sequence has not been zzso examined or zzso 

Using a zzso zzso approach, we found that zzso 19 and 20, located within a previously described zzso zzso are not required for nuclear zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso 36, which is located within a predicted classical zzso zzso was required for zzso nuclear zzso While wild type zzso zzso with zzso zzso and to a very weak extent with zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not interact with zzso zzso providing a molecular explanation why zzso zzso is not targeted to the zzso 

Our results provide strong evidence that zzso 36 of zzso is a critical zzso for proper nuclear targeting of zzso and consequently for the execution of its biological zzso
