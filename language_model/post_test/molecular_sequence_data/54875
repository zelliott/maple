The extent to which zzso influences the location of protein fragmentation sites that allow retention of function is not zzso To evaluate this, we used a novel zzso approach to create libraries of zzso that express zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with identical modifications at their zzso and we selected for zzso in each library that complement the growth of zzso coli with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso created using the zzso zzso were found to support growth with a higher frequency zzso than those generated from the zzso zzso zzso and selected zzso zzso zzso zzso coli growth more strongly than zzso zzso zzso zzso of functional clones from each library also identified a greater zzso of fragmentation sites within zzso zzso zzso sites were observed within the zzso binding and core zzso of both AK zzso However, only zzso contained sites within the lid domain, which zzso dynamic fluctuations that are critical for zzso These findings zzso the flexible lid domain as having an increased sensitivity to zzso events at zzso zzso In addition, they provide evidence that comparisons of zzso zzso sites in zzso proteins could be useful for finding dynamic regions whose zzso fluctuations are important for function, and they show that the discovery of protein fragments that zzso function in zzso can be aided by the use of zzso zzso as starting points for protein zzso
