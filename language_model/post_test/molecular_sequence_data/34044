zzso bottlenecks may reduce genetic variation and potentially increase the risk of zzso Here, we present the first study to use historic samples to zzso loss of variation at the major zzso complex zzso which plays a central role in zzso disease zzso Balancing selection acts on the zzso and could moderate the loss of variation expected from zzso however, in a Wisconsin population of greater zzso zzso zzso the number of zzso class II B zzso per individual declined by zzso following a population zzso compared to a loss of only zzso at zzso zzso indicate that drift likely reduced zzso variation at the population level, as well as within individuals by reducing the number of gene copies per individual or by fixing the same zzso across multiple zzso These multiple effects of genetic drift on zzso variation could have important implications for immunity and zzso
