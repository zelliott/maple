Current models of zzso evolution suggest changes in gene regulation zzso the evolution of zzso Despite the fact that protein complexes regulate gene zzso the evolution of regulatory protein complexes is rarely zzso Here, we investigate the evolution of a zzso interaction zzso between zzso A11 zzso and zzso box zzso zzso Using extant and zzso ancestral zzso we show that the physical interaction between zzso and zzso originated in the zzso stem zzso zzso divergence tests and zzso with zzso protein pairs indicate that the evolution of interaction was attributable to changes in zzso and deletion studies demonstrate that the interaction interface is located in the zzso region of zzso However, there are no changes in zzso acid sequence in the zzso region during this time period, indicating that the origin of the derived zzso was attributable to changes outside the binding zzso We zzso that the zzso acid zzso in zzso altered zzso access to the zzso binding interface at the zzso zzso We also found an expansion in the number of paired zzso binding sites in the zzso of zzso lineage species suggesting the complex has a biological zzso Our data indicate that the physical interaction between zzso and zzso evolved through zzso changes that facilitate the zzso which prevents inappropriate zzso rather than through the evolution of a novel binding zzso We speculate that evolutionary changes of zzso regulation have limited zzso effects compared with changes to interaction zzso zzso
