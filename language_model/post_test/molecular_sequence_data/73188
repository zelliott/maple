zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are major zzso components of the central and peripheral nervous system zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the final step of zzso zzso In this report we describe isolation of the complete copy of human zzso zzso Total zzso from zzso zzso cells, a human fetal zzso cell line, was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on rat zzso zzso sequence were used in zzso and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends reaction zzso The obtained sequence was used to zzso the zzso for the complete coding region to be amplified and cloned into a zzso zzso expression zzso Following zzso of the zzso cells with the resulting zzso the cell zzso was zzso for the zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso was used to determine the length of zzso zzso and Southern zzso zzso was used to determine the number of zzso zzso Our results indicate that human zzso retains all conservative features of rat and mouse zzso It is a single copy gene with zzso transcript of about 4 zzso
