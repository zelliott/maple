The zzso family of proteins mediates zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso that maintains zzso stability by protecting against DNA double strand zzso zzso proteins are thought to facilitate DNA strand exchange reactions as zzso or as right-handed zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a left-handed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each zzso in this left-handed filament is linked to its zzso via interactions of a zzso zzso motif with the zzso zzso zzso Immediately following the zzso zzso we identified an zzso zzso hinge region (a zzso rotation zzso in which a 360 degrees zzso zzso rotation accompanies zzso structural transitions from a closed ring to the zzso right-handed filament, then to an zzso right-handed filament and finally to the left-handed zzso Additional structural and functional analyses of zzso and zzso proteins confirmed that the zzso rotation motif is crucial for zzso functions of zzso family zzso These observations support the hypothesis that zzso family protein filaments may function as rotary zzso
