The zzso and zzso activities of zzso ultraviolet light zzso at four zzso zzso zzso 300 and 320 zzso were determined using a rat zzso cell line zzso zzso infected with a zzso zzso carrying the zzso and zzso zzso In this system, zzso can be positively detected as zzso zzso Although the action zzso for these activities closely fit some of the previously reported zzso for zzso DNA zzso zzso cell killing and mouse skin zzso they diverge at 320 zzso from the zzso spectrum for DNA and the action spectrum for bacterial zzso and zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso detected after zzso with 300 and 320 zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso and C zzso as zzso targets at both zzso zzso increased zzso of relatively large deletions at 300 zzso and zzso greatly increased frequency of tandem double zzso at both zzso and of clustered multiple zzso at 320 zzso These results suggest the involvement of distinct mechanisms specifically zzso or becoming zzso in zzso zzso at these different zzso in zzso zzso
