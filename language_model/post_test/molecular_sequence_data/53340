zzso acid zzso is a neurotransmitter that also occurs in a few zzso cell types, where it may serve as a zzso zzso zzso is zzso from zzso by zzso zzso zzso and from zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in several zzso cell types but is zzso in the zzso zzso cells and zzso cells of the zzso zzso of the zzso Using two zzso raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to two different regions of rat zzso we now demonstrate strong zzso for zzso in zzso cells of the rat zzso zzso whereas zzso cells as well as other structures of the zzso are zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso and colon demonstrate that both zzso react with a single band of 85 zzso consistent with the predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso is demonstrated by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Our results strongly indicate that zzso cells produce zzso via zzso zzso of zzso and experimental data zzso suggest that the zzso of zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso release of zzso these results point to a new mechanism of zzso interaction between zzso cells and zzso zzso
