zzso protein synthesis initiation factor zzso 4 zzso also known as zzso is a component of the protein complex zzso which is involved in the recognition of the zzso cap, zzso unwinding of zzso secondary structure and recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso sequence data from rabbit zzso zzso gamma was used to zzso zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso These were used to screen zzso libraries from rabbit and human brain, yielding a partial rabbit and a complete human zzso sequence of zzso zzso Northern zzso and primer extension analysis indicated that the zzso sequence was zzso To confirm that the zzso represented that of zzso zzso three peptides were zzso based on zzso sequences and used to produce zzso zzso The zzso specifically recognized intact zzso gamma and its zzso products following zzso zzso The zzso gamma zzso contains zzso zzso at zzso 6, 67, 90, zzso and zzso but only the last is followed by a long open reading zzso The zzso gamma zzso is 154 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and contains sequence motifs of potential zzso a sequence zzso that is similar to the zzso recognition sequence of zzso 2A from zzso zzso 14, five zzso regions with scores greater than 10, which are characteristic of rapidly zzso zzso stretches of zzso acid, and numerous potential zzso zzso
