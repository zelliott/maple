zzso is structurally and functionally zzso to a family of zzso zinc finger zzso factors required for late gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these proteins in zzso has been hampered by their relative zzso and tendency to zzso We report here the successful zzso of zzso active, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso binding to a zzso DNA sequence that is located upstream of zzso zzso zzso promoters and the late promoters of zzso zzso This sequence is sufficient for binding of zzso in zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso and to the sequence upstream of the zzso late promoter zzso is accompanied by DNA zzso zzso protects about 25 zzso of the zzso upstream region from zzso I zzso and zzso zzso protects the promoter region only in the presence of zzso zzso DNA, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the only zzso components required for zzso from zzso in zzso
