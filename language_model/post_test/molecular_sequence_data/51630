The formation of B zzso restricted zzso was followed during chicken embryonic development by monitoring the appearance of the various zzso gene zzso zzso zzso V zzso J zzso as a sensitivity that allows the detection of a single rearranged zzso By zzso the zzso committed zzso zzso we describe their evolution in different compartments at different zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the first site where zzso cells are observed (at days 5-6 of zzso via the general zzso they then seed the various zzso while undergoing zzso and V zzso J zzso zzso which occur simultaneously but lag behind zzso by one to several zzso These zzso populations decline with time in most zzso sites and only expand in the zzso zzso expression is observed in the zzso in the absence of ongoing zzso activity and thus appears to be an improper marker of zzso in the zzso zzso to the B cell lineage seems to result from an intrinsic cell program, but the survival and expansion of the committed B zzso require the specific zzso of the zzso
