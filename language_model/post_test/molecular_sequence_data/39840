zzso zzso zzso binds iron in each of two zzso and delivers it to cells by a zzso zzso zzso The binding and release of iron result in a large zzso change in which two zzso in each lobe close or open with a rigid twisting motion around a zzso We report the structure of human serum zzso zzso lacking iron zzso which was independently determined by two zzso 1) the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso was solved at zzso resolution using a multiple wavelength anomalous zzso phasing strategy, by substituting the nine zzso in zzso with zzso and 2) the structure of zzso zzso zzso from zzso was determined to a resolution of zzso by molecular replacement using the human zzso and the rabbit zzso as search zzso These two crystal structures are essentially zzso They represent the first published model for full-length human zzso and reveal that, in contrast to family members zzso zzso and zzso zzso both zzso are almost equally zzso zzso degrees and zzso degrees zzso are required to open the zzso and zzso respectively zzso with closed pig zzso zzso of this structure is critical to a complete understanding of the metal binding properties of each lobe of zzso the zzso structure suggests that differences in the hinge regions of the zzso and zzso may influence the rates of iron binding and zzso In addition, we evaluate potential interactions between zzso and the human zzso zzso
