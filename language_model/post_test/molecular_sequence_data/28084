zzso protein zzso is the most abundant zzso protein in zzso of the central nervous zzso zzso models of zzso zzso have been generated by computer predictions based on its primary sequence and experiments with zzso zzso We have examined the initial events in zzso zzso including the zzso and orientation of zzso in the plasma zzso in rat zzso which express zzso and the other zzso proteins when cultured without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hudson, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso These cells, identified by the presence of surface zzso the major zzso zzso were stained with six zzso zzso directed against zzso or short zzso sequences of zzso Five of these zzso zzso specifically stained living zzso zzso was only seen approximately 10 d after zzso was first detected in the zzso of fixed and zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is slowly transported from the zzso to the cell zzso The presence of zzso zzso on the zzso surface was also confirmed by zzso of such zzso with zzso and by zzso zzso zzso of living zzso Our results indicate that zzso has only two zzso zzso and that the great majority of the zzso including its zzso and zzso zzso is located on the zzso face of the zzso plasma zzso This disposition of the zzso zzso suggests that zzso interactions between zzso molecules of zzso zzso faces may mediate zzso of adjacent zzso in the zzso zzso
