A new species of purple zzso bacteria isolated from an Antarctic microbial mat is zzso The zzso designated strain zzso was mildly zzso growing zzso at 15-18 degrees C with a growth temperature range of zzso degrees zzso zzso of strain zzso were highly zzso curved rods and zzso contained zzso zzso and showed a zzso in zzso zzso zzso A specific zzso relationship was observed between strain zzso and the purple zzso zzso zzso zzso and the two organisms shared several zzso and other zzso properties, with the notable exception of growth temperature zzso Tests of zzso DNA zzso however, showed zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso to be genetically distinct zzso Because of its unique set of properties, especially its requirement for low growth temperatures, we propose to recognize strain zzso as a new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso named for its known habitat, the zzso
