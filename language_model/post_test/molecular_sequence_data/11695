In the present study, the requirements and characteristics for the production of zzso by human T cells, T cell clones and B cells were determined and compared with those of zzso zzso was produced by human zzso and zzso T zzso zzso isolated from peripheral blood zzso cells and by zzso and zzso T cell zzso zzso T cell clones belonging to zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced zzso following zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso B cell lines expressed zzso zzso and produced small amounts of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and production of zzso protein by peripheral blood T cells and T cell clones was induced rapidly and was relatively long zzso whereas zzso production by these cells was zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was induced by modes of zzso that failed to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso shares many biological activities with zzso which is compatible with the notion that the zzso and zzso receptors share a common component required for signal zzso However, zzso lacks the T zzso properties of zzso Here we have shown that this is related to the fact that T cells fail to bind zzso zzso and do not express the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the differences in expression and biological activities of zzso and zzso on T cells may have consequences for the relative roles of these zzso in the immune zzso
