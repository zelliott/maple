To further investigate the ways in which proteins respond to changes in the length of the zzso chain, a series of 32 insertions and five deletions were made within nine different zzso of T4 zzso In most cases, the inserted zzso acid was a single zzso although in some instances up to four zzso not necessarily zzso were zzso Different insertions zzso the protein by different zzso ranging from approximately 1 to 6 zzso In one case, no protein could be zzso An zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso of the zzso was extended by four zzso increased stability by zzso zzso For the zzso the loss in stability ranged from approximately 3 to 5 zzso The structures of six zzso zzso as well as one deletion zzso and the extension zzso were determined, three in crystal forms zzso with wild zzso In all cases, including previously described zzso zzso within a single zzso there appears to be a strong tendency to preserve the zzso by zzso zzso so that the effects of the zzso are zzso into a bend or loop at one end or the other of the zzso In three zzso even the zzso core was disrupted so as to permit the preservation of the zzso containing the zzso zzso (or zzso zzso was also observed for the deletion zzso in this case a loop at the end of the zzso being zzso In general, when zzso occurs, the reduction in stability is only moderate, averaging zzso zzso Only in the most extreme cases does zzso or zzso occur within the body of an zzso in which case the zzso is substantial, averaging zzso zzso zzso can occur for insertions close to the end of a zzso in which case the zzso is less zzso averaging zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso include shifts in the backbone of 3-6 A, extending over 20 zzso or zzso As a result, zzso zzso which form a zzso on the zzso domain, undergo substantial reorganizations such that the interface between this zzso and the rest of the protein is altered zzso In the case of zzso zzso two nearby zzso which form a bend of approximately 105 degrees in the zzso structure, reorganize in the zzso structure to form a single, essentially straight zzso These structural responses to zzso demonstrate the plasticity of protein structures and illustrate ways in which their three-dimensional structures might changes during zzso
