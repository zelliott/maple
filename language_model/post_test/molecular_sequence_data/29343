The classical zzso mouse zzso zzso cell zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso zzso bulb zzso zzso and selected zzso zzso and has defective zzso Here we identify zzso as the gene zzso in the original zzso and two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a putative nuclear protein containing a zinc zzso domain initially identified by its induction in spinal motor zzso during zzso zzso The present study suggests an unexpected molecular link between zzso zzso and zzso and its results have potential implications for neurodegenerative diseases and male zzso
