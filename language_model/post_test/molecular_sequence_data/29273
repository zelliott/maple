Human zzso zzso with zzso produce large quantities of zzso but little of this zzso product is released zzso as the mature biologically active zzso To demonstrate efficient zzso zzso and export, zzso cells require a secondary zzso zzso In an attempt to identify agents that may serve as initiators of zzso zzso processing in zzso zzso human zzso were treated with several individual zzso zzso Two peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoted rapid and efficient release of mature zzso The zzso response engaged a mechanism similar to that initiated by zzso zzso acting via the zzso zzso Thus, both processes were disrupted by a zzso zzso both were sensitive to zzso acid and zzso two pharmacological agents that suppress zzso processing, and both were negated by zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso like zzso promoted a dramatic change in zzso zzso and a loss of membrane zzso The zzso response was concentration dependent and was influenced profoundly by components within the culture zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso did not initiate zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso export of zzso zzso but these agents were less efficient than zzso As a result of this ability to promote release of potent zzso zzso such as zzso select zzso peptides may possess important zzso functions that extend beyond innate zzso
