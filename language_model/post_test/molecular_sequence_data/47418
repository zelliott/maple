As a first step towards understanding the zzso of zzso that accumulate in specialized zzso zzso of cotton at the molecular level, two full-length genes zzso and zzso were characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the formation of a key zzso zzso Cotton zzso genes exhibited features typical of other plant zzso however, zzso encodes the largest of all plant zzso zzso described to zzso zzso contains several novel features that may represent functional specialization of this particular zzso zzso Such features include a unique 42 zzso acid sequence located in the region separating the zzso domain and zzso zzso domain, as well as an zzso zzso domain that is not found in zzso or other zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso belong to small zzso that probably include zzso zzso in zzso cotton zzso zzso zzso zzso protection zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in a zzso and zzso manner during zzso of specialized zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression of zzso coincided with a possible commitment to zzso zzso in developing zzso although other zzso processes also requiring zzso cannot be zzso
