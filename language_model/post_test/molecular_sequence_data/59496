zzso DNA zzso a zzso zzso zzso which has zzso activity, was cloned from zzso zzso zzso We zzso a zzso cloned DNA zzso that contained a single open reading frame zzso 460 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso A putative zzso binding site was found 5 zzso upstream of the initiation zzso The zzso acid sequence of this zzso from zzso zzso zzso had zzso identity with that of zzso from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso A zzso extract prepared from the zzso strain showed 80 to zzso more zzso activity than that from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso extracts of the zzso strain using 4 column zzso The recovery of zzso from the zzso strain was about zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties were similar to those of zzso zzso zzso For application of this zzso zzso we attempted to zzso a zzso that seemed to be specifically assimilated by zzso using the zzso activity of the zzso
