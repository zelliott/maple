An zzso slow zzso zzso was detected with a zzso frequency of about zzso in Sweden and was also found in a family of Scottish descent from zzso New Zealand, and in five families in zzso zzso zzso study established that the major zzso component was zzso in which zzso at the zzso position of the zzso is still attached to the processed zzso A minor component with the zzso sequence of zzso was also present as zzso of the total zzso After amplification of the gene segment zzso the zzso sequence of zzso specific zzso of DNA to an zzso probe zzso zzso at position zzso indicated the zzso of zzso at the zzso position to zzso zzso zzso This produced the zzso sequence zzso This was confirmed by sequence analysis after zzso of the zzso This zzso produces an alternate signal zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso precursor of zzso giving rise to two possible products, zzso and the zzso zzso Another plasma from zzso had an zzso with a previously described substitution (1 zzso which also affects zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso in the zzso for the zzso sequence may account for the frequency of zzso in the zzso zzso at these two sites results in a series of zzso zzso zzso that have arisen independently in diverse zzso
