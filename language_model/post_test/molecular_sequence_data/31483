A novel zzso was isolated from a freshwater hot spring, the Hale House Spring, located at Hot Springs National Park, Hot Springs, zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso stained zzso were zzso zzso strictly zzso and zzso and did not form zzso Growth occurred at zzso zzso with an optimum at 60 zzso at pH zzso with an optimum at pH zzso and at zzso zzso up to zzso zzso with optimum growth in the absence of zzso zzso zzso was capable of zzso growth on zzso or zzso zzso as well as reducing zzso and zzso Major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso and zzso and the major zzso zzso was zzso In the zzso pattern, zzso was the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of the isolate indicated that strain zzso represents the first reported cultivated member of subdivision 23 of the zzso It is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
