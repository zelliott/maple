zzso zzso and zzso of zzso fatty acids are markedly impaired in the aging rat zzso While these zzso would be expected to adversely affect overall zzso zzso zzso levels do not change significantly with zzso This conundrum suggests that specific zzso mechanisms occur in the aging zzso The comparison of cardiac zzso zzso complex zzso zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso zzso rats revealed a zzso significant increase in zzso with no change in zzso zzso and a zzso decrease in the zzso constant zzso in old compared to young zzso The observed kinetic adjustments were selective to zzso as neither the zzso nor zzso of zzso zzso changed with zzso zzso zzso zzso levels decreased by 57% in old vs young rat hearts and correlated with a zzso decrease in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso from old rat hearts zzso zzso more efficiently due to an zzso change in zzso
