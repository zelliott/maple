The growth and differentiation of neural precursor cells in the central nervous system zzso are regulated by their response to zzso growth factors which interact with specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that rat zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, precursors of the zzso cells in the zzso express the zzso zzso zzso the gene product of the zzso dominant white spotting zzso locus and zzso for stem cell zzso zzso of zzso transcripts and zzso protein is lost when zzso zzso differentiate into zzso zzso Analysis of developing rat brain revealed an increase in the expression of zzso transcripts between zzso days 10 and 12, a window of time preceding the emergence of zzso and the onset of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso suggests a role for this zzso and its zzso during zzso zzso
