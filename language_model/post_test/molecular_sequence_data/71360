The DNA mismatch repair zzso is a specialized system, highly zzso throughout evolution, involved in the maintenance of zzso zzso To identify novel human genes that may function in zzso we employed the zzso interaction zzso Using the zzso protein zzso as zzso we cloned zzso The zzso protein forms a complex with zzso binds to zzso DNA, has zzso to bacterial DNA repair zzso and displays zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso is associated with zzso instability zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a novel human DNA repair protein that may be involved in zzso and, as such, may be a candidate zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso In addition, these results suggest that zzso zzso may play a role in human DNA zzso
