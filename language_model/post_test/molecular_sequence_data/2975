zzso is a major zzso in zzso egg white which causes a serious zzso food zzso zzso This study determined eight zzso zzso 5-11 zzso acids in zzso and nine zzso zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso within the primary sequence in zzso using zzso of overlapping peptides zzso on cellulose zzso zzso zzso from eight zzso patients were used to probe the zzso We also analyzed the zzso acids that are critical for zzso binding by substituting a single zzso acid within each zzso zzso analysis of the zzso indicated that charged zzso acids zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso and some zzso zzso zzso and zzso and polar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids were important for zzso zzso These results provide useful information for the molecular design necessary to reduce the zzso of zzso and a better understanding of zzso relationships of allergic zzso in food zzso
