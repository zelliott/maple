The analysis of large zzso by mass zzso is a particular challenge, in many cases, because of the small proportion of zzso in the presence of a large number of zzso zzso In addition, zzso are generally available in dilute zzso Thus, methods to specifically identify zzso at low zzso are zzso In this work, zzso zzso immobilized zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed and applied to zzso analysis of zzso zzso bind zzso with high zzso The zzso zzso is packed directly at the head of the zzso zzso After the zzso are bonded to the zzso and washed, they are zzso at high pH and separated by zzso This method has several zzso zzso selective retention and zzso of zzso on an zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the sample to remove zzso and buffers that are not suited for zzso separation or zzso zzso zzso facile fabrication with common tools and chemicals (less than 10 zzso zzso adaptation to commercial zzso instruments without any zzso The applications of zzso are demonstrated by the analysis of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso
