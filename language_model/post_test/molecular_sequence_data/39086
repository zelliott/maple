This study was performed to generate and evaluate zzso zzso for use in a zzso zzso zzso zzso In a molecular genetic approach, fragments of the zzso zzso major zzso protein zzso were produced as fusion proteins to create three different zzso encompassing the variable zzso I, II and IV of selected zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso and used in an zzso zzso zzso zzso detection was evaluated with 103 patient zzso and the results were compared with zzso obtained in the zzso zzso The results showed that the generated zzso zzso detected the presence of zzso zzso human zzso with little zzso to zzso zzso zzso When compared to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso detected the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso
