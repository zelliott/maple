zzso of cell lineage in acute zzso is essential for diagnosis and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso establishes zzso lineage of zzso blasts that may be too primitive to be identified as zzso based on zzso zzso or zzso A highly specific and sensitive new procedure for zzso zzso detection has been developed using zzso zzso It involves a zzso for total cellular zzso zzso reverse transcription, and specific amplification of target sequences in the resulting zzso zzso by the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso are designed to amplify an zzso pair zzso sequence from the signal zzso 179 and zzso sequences from the start and end, respectively, of the zzso zzso and a zzso sequence overlapping the zzso and light zzso The zzso amplification products, detected zzso demonstrate zzso zzso expression in the zzso cells zzso The sensitivity of this new procedure was evaluated on serial zzso of zzso cells and was found to be zzso cells depending on the zzso zzso amplified zzso No amplification products were obtained using peripheral blood zzso as a negative cellular zzso The specificity of the procedure is demonstrated by Southern zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso specific for each of the amplified zzso An additional advantage of this procedure is availability of results in zzso zzso compared with 1-2 weeks for conventional zzso zzso
