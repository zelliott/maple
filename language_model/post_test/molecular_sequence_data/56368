zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of two distinct zzso alpha and zzso of which the former directly binds to DNA and the latter acts auxiliary to enhance the DNA zzso Recent cloning studies has revealed that the alpha zzso is zzso to the products of the zzso zzso gene zzso and the human zzso zzso and that it functions as a major regulator for the T zzso gene zzso We have currently cloned zzso for the beta zzso The isolated zzso contain three zzso that are presumed to arise from alternative zzso zzso and zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and 155 zzso zzso zzso These zzso neither show any significant zzso with known other proteins including the alpha zzso nor have any known zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso as the complex of these zzso is thought to constitute an entirely novel category of zzso zzso regulator together with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins produced in an in zzso translation system or in zzso coli demonstrated that the larger two beta zzso but not the smallest one, can zzso with the alpha zzso Furthermore, this zzso was shown to cause a marked increase in the intrinsic DNA binding affinity of the alpha zzso
