The induction of zzso by zzso an zzso zzso in the zzso fungus zzso zzso is zzso We previously proposed a mechanism that is based on the presence of low levels of zzso in the zzso zzso this zzso zzso activity would digest zzso zzso that could enter the cell and trigger expression of zzso We now present experiments that lend further support to this zzso We show here that transcripts of two members of the zzso system, zzso and zzso are present in zzso zzso zzso zzso These transcripts are induced at least zzso in the presence of zzso We also show that a construct containing the zzso B zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter zzso zzso B resistance to zzso zzso cells grown in the absence of zzso Moreover, zzso production of the zzso transcript was suppressed when zzso zzso against three members of the zzso system was expressed in zzso zzso are presented indicating that zzso zzso activity is the zzso event in induction of synthesis of the zzso transcripts by zzso The results reveal a critical requirement for zzso expression of the zzso system for induction of synthesis of its own transcripts by zzso
