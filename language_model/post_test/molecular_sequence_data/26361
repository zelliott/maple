Twenty-six overlapping zzso spanning the entire zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso known as zzso surface zzso 2 were screened for their ability to induce the proliferation of peripheral blood zzso zzso obtained from 12 donors living in zzso Solomon Islands where zzso zzso is zzso A zzso zzso form of zzso known as zzso zzso was also screened in these zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was included as a zzso The location of the predicted T cell zzso within zzso was examined using the algorithm, zzso and by scanning zzso for zzso acid sequences showing the zzso zzso There were 13 predicted zzso zzso sites and five examples of zzso sequences in the zzso The location of these with regard to the peptides tested is zzso Nine of the 12 individuals responded to zzso with high stimulation zzso zzso than 4) being obtained in the majority of zzso Only three individuals responded to zzso with the stimulation zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso from both the constant and variable regions of zzso were recognized in the zzso zzso However, the majority of the positive zzso responses were to peptides which spanned the central variable region which included the two copies of the zzso repeat occurring in the zzso High zzso comparable to those obtained to zzso were seen in some individuals with some zzso There was considerable variation between donors in number and nature of the peptides zzso and two donors did not respond to any of the zzso zzso The significance of these findings to vaccine development is zzso
