Changes in the zzso chemical shift of backbone zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been used to map the zzso zzso zzso binding site on the zzso domain of the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso chemical shift changes were measured on formation of a stable complex with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso with significantly shifted zzso signals mapped specifically to a broad site covering one face of the zzso This site (the zzso binding zzso consists primarily of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The site zzso with the zzso binding site seen in other proteins that share the same zzso zzso zzso zzso conservation data and recent zzso zzso studies are discussed in relation to the zzso binding site identified in this zzso
