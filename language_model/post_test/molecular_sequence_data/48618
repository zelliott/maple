zzso attachment to von zzso factor zzso requires the interaction between the zzso zzso and exposed zzso zzso zzso insights into the mechanism of the zzso interaction have been limited to an zzso truncated A1 domain that lacks zzso zzso zzso that make up the zzso between the D3 and A1 zzso of zzso We have demonstrated that removal of these zzso zzso zzso interactions in the zzso zzso and contributes to zzso zzso under high zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that removal of these zzso from the single A1 domain enhances zzso pause times on immobilized A1 under zzso zzso A rigorous comparison between the truncated zzso and full length zzso zzso demonstrates a kinetic stabilization of the A1 domain induced by these zzso zzso as evident in the zzso of the unfolding zzso This stabilization occurs through site and zzso binding of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso of free zzso zzso to zzso has an affinity zzso and this binding although free to zzso is sufficient to suppress the zzso pause times to levels comparable to zzso under zzso zzso Our results support a zzso role for this zzso region involving a zzso zzso that maintains zzso A domain associations in the inactive state of zzso at low zzso and an zzso zzso that regulates the strength of zzso zzso A1 domain associations in the active state of zzso at high zzso
