We cloned a full-length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso protein zzso 412 zzso similar to zzso carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are similar to zzso zzso and identical to the precursor of zzso carrier protein 2 zzso also termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso sequence identity to the zzso domain of zzso but lacks the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed only a single zzso species of zzso zzso which agrees well with the length of the zzso zzso zzso making it improbable that alternative zzso produces an zzso fusion zzso The sequence similarities of zzso to conventional zzso are lesser than that to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner by the zzso zzso reaction zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was competitive with zzso and zzso with zzso This pattern of zzso is shared with zzso but not with conventional zzso zzso which is inhibited zzso with respect to zzso From these results, we concluded that zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute a second zzso of zzso which we propose to term zzso zzso zzso
