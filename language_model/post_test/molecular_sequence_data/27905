zzso from peripheral and central nervous tissue as well as from established cell lines respond to low zzso of zzso with rapid extension of zzso zzso Two sites on zzso have been identified which stimulate zzso zzso the major site residing at the end of the long arm of zzso Recently zzso has been cloned and zzso allowing for synthetic peptides to be prepared and tested for biological zzso We report here that zzso against synthetic peptides corresponding to A and to B1 chain sequences at the end of the long arm can partially inhibit zzso zzso zzso Further, we show that a 19 zzso acid synthetic zzso zzso from the long arm of the zzso A chain is capable of stimulating zzso process formation to almost the same extent as zzso and competes with zzso for stimulation of zzso zzso
