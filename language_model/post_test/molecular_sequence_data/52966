A zzso zzso domain contained within the viral zzso protein is a key player in the zzso processing of the zzso C virus zzso and a prime target for the development of zzso zzso In the present work, we describe a zzso zzso inhibitor of this zzso Active site occupancy by this compound could be monitored following zzso resonance energy transfer between the zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso and could be used to 1) zzso assess active site binding of zzso zzso zzso 2) directly determine equilibrium and zzso parameters of zzso complex formation, and 3) zzso using zzso zzso the contribution of single zzso of zzso to inhibitor binding in direct binding zzso The zzso was also used to characterize the zzso of the zzso zzso by its zzso zzso We show that zzso inhibitor complex formation depends on the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data support an ordered mechanism of zzso zzso complex formation, requiring zzso zzso prior to inhibitor zzso
