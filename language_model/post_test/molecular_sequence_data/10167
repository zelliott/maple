To identify a zzso cell cycle marker detected by a zzso zzso against zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso Chang, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso gene zzso was isolated by reverse zzso from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso Butcher zzso The gene zzso was zzso zzso in length and contained an open reading frame of 205 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed 80 and zzso similarity to human and rice zzso zzso Southern zzso indicated that the isolated gene zzso was part of the zzso zzso zzso with up to three copies in each zzso zzso Northern zzso was used to detect a zzso zzso with a size of zzso zzso from an zzso growing zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso has been cloned into an expression zzso and a fusion protein was subsequently zzso zzso zzso simultaneously recognized the zzso fusion protein and a single zzso band in zzso total protein zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso is highly similar to its zzso counterpart and that zzso zzso is a good tool for detecting zzso zzso in zzso
