zzso and zzso fragments of rye zzso DNA zzso zzso gene were cloned and a zzso zzso region was zzso Cloning of zzso zzso into zzso zzso led to a single zzso deletion in the coding region of zzso zzso A scheme of full-length zzso gene cloning is proposed, allowing one to escape the damage effect of the zzso gene expression product on the host zzso The differences between zzso and zzso in zzso sequences of DNA downstream of zzso genes are zzso Gene zzso is located 131 zzso downstream from zzso gene on the complementary zzso The zzso acid sequences of D1 and zzso proteins of different species are zzso
