We introduce a method for zzso small flexible zzso of the size of zzso and zzso and test it against zzso zzso We then show how the method can be used as the basis for a strategy for solving the much more difficult problem of zzso fully flexible peptides in the zzso size zzso After developing the method we apply it to zzso class I systems and find that the predictions are in zzso with biological and zzso zzso
