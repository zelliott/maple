In zzso zzso inject saliva into plant zzso gaining access to zzso sap and zzso (and sometimes zzso plant zzso We are examining the involvement, in this zzso interaction, of individual zzso proteins and zzso as identified in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we focus on a zzso protein we have arbitrarily designated zzso zzso We have zzso by using zzso transcript zzso that this protein is important in the survival of the pea zzso zzso zzso on fava zzso a host zzso Here, we further characterize the zzso its transcript, and its zzso and we study the feeding process of zzso zzso The zzso protein fails to match any protein outside of the family zzso By using in zzso zzso and zzso the transcript and the protein were localized to a subset of zzso cells in principal zzso zzso zzso zzso whose sequence contains an zzso zzso zzso is injected into the host plant during zzso zzso By using the electrical penetration graph method on zzso zzso we find that the zzso affects several aspects of zzso and zzso with the result that the zzso zzso spend very little time in contact with zzso sap in sieve zzso Thus, we zzso that zzso zzso is crucial in the feeding of the pea zzso on fava zzso
