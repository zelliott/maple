zzso is a zzso zzso protein of the cortical zzso of zzso zzso zzso are also abundant in brain and several other zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhances the binding of zzso to zzso Previous studies have established that the beta zzso of zzso binds zzso zzso in a zzso fashion with intermediate affinity zzso 200 zzso and that this activity is destroyed by zzso We have confirmed the zzso sensitivity of zzso binding by zzso and the existence of a zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso generates a larger core zzso zzso zzso that is also devoid of zzso zzso Use of zzso zzso peptides generated from partial zzso clones identified strong zzso activity within the zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso This region of the zzso is highly zzso between zzso zzso and human and shares structural features with zzso sequences in other zzso Multiple zzso zzso sequences zzso rich in zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso that enhance zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso sensitivity of this zzso Consensus sequences for zzso by zzso zzso and by protein zzso C (or zzso zzso are also found within or near this zzso zzso zzso these data suggest a structural basis for the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso binding and possibly by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso
