The common fragile site at zzso band zzso zzso is the most sensitive single site in the human zzso to induced zzso zzso This fragile site may zzso zzso zzso to breakage that is commonly observed in zzso zzso and many other zzso We previously used zzso induction of zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid to generate a series of hybrids with zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso were localized to two distinct zzso separated by 200 zzso that lie on either side of a region of frequent breakage within zzso as observed by FISH zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso were localized at or near the end of a THE zzso The zzso element is flanked by LINE and zzso repetitive zzso The eight zzso zzso zzso clustered in a region capable of forming multiple zzso zzso Thus repetitive elements and zzso structures may be responsible for zzso fragility in this zzso
