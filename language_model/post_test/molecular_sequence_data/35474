zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are insect zzso of economically important veterinary diseases such as African horse sickness virus and zzso zzso However, the identification of zzso based on zzso features is zzso The sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso referred to as DNA zzso has been proposed as a tool for rapid identification to zzso zzso a study was undertaken to establish DNA zzso for all zzso determined zzso species in Swedish zzso In total, 237 specimens of zzso representing 37 zzso distinct species were zzso The zzso generated 37 supported zzso 31 of which were in agreement with the zzso zzso However, two pairs of closely related species could not be separated using the DNA zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Austen showed relatively deep zzso divergence (more than 10 times the average), which led to the creation of two cryptic species within each of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso as a tool for the species identification of biting zzso can differentiate zzso of species zzso Identification of some closely related species should employ a less zzso region, such as a zzso internal transcribed zzso
