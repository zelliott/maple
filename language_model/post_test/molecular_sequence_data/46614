A synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso segment zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been studied by two zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso mixture containing zzso M zzso Reconstruction of the spatial structure of zzso from the zzso data resulted in an zzso formed by zzso zzso Distribution of the molecular zzso potential on the zzso surface is very similar to that in zzso zzso of proteins with a known three zzso zzso two zzso bands located on the opposite zzso sides separated by strong zzso zzso
