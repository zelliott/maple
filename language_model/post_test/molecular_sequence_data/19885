The zzso type zzso zzso channels play an essential role in zzso zzso muscle contraction, and zzso The zzso sensor domain zzso is the key element of zzso zzso channels for sensing zzso potential, and has been studied at the levels of both zzso and protein zzso Two recently identified proteins containing zzso without a pore domain showed unexpected biological roles: regulation of zzso activity and zzso zzso These proteins not only provide novel platforms to understand mechanisms of zzso sensing and zzso zzso but also highlight previously unappreciated roles of membrane potential in zzso zzso
