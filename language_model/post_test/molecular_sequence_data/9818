The zzso modification of core zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso We recently reported the occurrence of a novel zzso zzso involving a zzso zzso between a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso In order to determine the complete structure of the modified zzso zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso was zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso I or zzso zzso zzso zzso to give zzso fragments that were separated by zzso zzso acid analysis, sequencing, and mass zzso analysis of the fragments showed that the zzso acid sequences of these fragments are identical to those of both zzso zzso and zzso except for two zzso peptides obtained by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso was identical to that reported zzso and the other was a zzso unidentified zzso which was designated zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso analyses of zzso showed that it to be a fragment, derived from zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The yields of zzso and zzso were calculated to be 47 and zzso respectively, expressed as the percent of the total amount of zzso used in the zzso Based on these data, the structure of zzso was determined to be a zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso formed through a zzso zzso transfer reaction between zzso of zzso zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso zzso
