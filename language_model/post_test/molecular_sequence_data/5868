The zzso zzso zzso zzso the last step in the zzso of the plant hormone zzso is zzso by a small zzso family in tomato, zzso three members, zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the major gene expressed during zzso leaf zzso and wounding zzso et zzso zzso To investigate the zzso regulation of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso between the zzso reporter gene and 97 zzso of zzso zzso plus zzso zzso and 1825 zzso respectively, of zzso zzso zzso sequence were constructed and introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of transgenic tomatoes indicated that the region containing zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso gene is sufficient to zzso a marked increase in zzso activity during fruit zzso albeit at very low zzso Fusion of zzso and 1825 zzso of zzso upstream sequence resulted in strong and specific induction of zzso expression in situations known to be accompanied by enhanced zzso zzso zzso gene expression was similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso with major increases especially during fruit zzso zzso and zzso of leaves and, to a lesser extent, of zzso Analysis of transgenic zzso zzso plants confirmed the pattern of zzso promoter activity detected in tomato leaves and zzso zzso gene expression was also induced following zzso treatment with zzso and pathogen zzso zzso analysis illustrated localized zzso activity in the zzso of zzso fruit, zzso zones of zzso zzso and zzso flowers, and at wound zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso is regulated at the zzso level in a wide range of cell types at different zzso stages and in response to several external zzso
