The full length spike zzso gene of zzso respiratory coronavirus zzso was inserted into the zzso of human zzso type 5 downstream of the early zzso region 3 zzso The zzso virus zzso in cultures of the zzso zzso ST cell line and directed the synthesis of S zzso to an amount of approximately 33 zzso per zzso cells, as determined by zzso The zzso was zzso except in the late phase of the infection, when a low amount (4 zzso per zzso zzso was released in the culture zzso The zzso zzso consisted of 2 zzso of 160 K and 175 K, zzso The 160 K zzso zzso with the authentic zzso precursor from zzso zzso The 175 K zzso had the same mobility as the authentic mature S protein from zzso cells and from zzso released in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso corresponded with the 175 K mature zzso zzso zzso gave evidence that some zzso S protein was exposed on the cell surface; it also showed that the protein was recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso developed zzso serum zzso and were partially protected against zzso
