We have cloned two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso from Atlantic zzso zzso comparison with zzso zzso revealed that the zzso domain was highly similar while zzso regions were less zzso The zzso region contained three insertions relative to zzso zzso one of these corresponded to the zzso found in the alternatively spliced zzso zzso While two different salmon zzso transcripts were zzso alternative zzso in the zzso did not appear to contribute to further transcript zzso Both salmon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that specifically bind a consensus zzso recognition sequence in zzso The salmon zzso proteins also recognized the classical zzso zzso however, a point zzso in the zzso zzso abolished this zzso
