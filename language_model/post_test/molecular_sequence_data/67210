The zzso system, in which a monolithic zzso zzso column is directly connected to an zzso mass zzso showed superior performance at high mobile phase linear zzso A two-dimensional zzso zzso system was established, using an zzso zzso zzso column at the first dimension and a monolithic zzso zzso column at the second zzso In an analysis of zzso fragments from bovine serum zzso an zzso sequence coverage, obtained by the zzso system, increased by zzso as compared to a zzso zzso This zzso system using a monolithic zzso zzso column should be useful for enhancing sequence coverage of zzso fragments in zzso
