It has been reported that zzso zzso may have zzso targeting for the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In a previous study, we reported 11 zzso zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso and seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of which only the zzso zzso zzso has been reported to influence the binding of zzso Using zzso zzso we identified putative zzso sites considering the zzso encompassing these eight zzso sites, and we ranked the lowest free energies that could potentially lead to an zzso degradation or zzso zzso When a specific zzso or a particular zzso was associated with a zzso site, we defined a free energy difference of 4 zzso between zzso to zzso them energetically zzso The best results were obtained for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all influencing one or more of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeted the zzso zzso region, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also influenced the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that these zzso might play a relevant role on the zzso expression zzso
