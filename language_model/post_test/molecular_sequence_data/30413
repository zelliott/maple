Previous studies have shown that reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso is a zzso and inhibitor zzso approximately zzso zzso of insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Lane, zzso Lane & zzso zzso In this study we have prepared a family of defined modified derivatives of zzso and used them to probe the nature of the zzso and zzso sites of zzso All zzso derivatives of zzso in which either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso side chains were modified served as zzso and were potent zzso of zzso zzso This was true whether the zzso were either zzso or zzso although the zzso derivatives had a higher zzso zzso zzso peptides derived from zzso however, were inactive as zzso and a mixture of the three zzso zzso fragments zzso 12, 24, and 93 zzso zzso zzso was found to be less potent in zzso the zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso side chains produced derivatives that were neither zzso nor capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso with modified zzso groups were zzso for zzso but were not able to inhibit zzso zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso zzso has a large zzso zzso binding domain and is effectively inhibited by zzso zzso but not by short zzso zzso some of the zzso zzso and zzso side chains are essential to the zzso nature of these zzso and zzso derivatives that fail to inhibit zzso can still be recognized and zzso by active zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
