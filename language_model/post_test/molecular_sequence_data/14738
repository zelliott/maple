UK zzso diagnostic service sequence analysis of genes generally examines and reports on variations within a designated region zzso and 3' of each zzso typically 30 zzso up and zzso However, because of the zzso nature of the zzso sites, zzso zzso outside the AG and zzso zzso of the zzso and donor zzso sites zzso and zzso are most often classified as being of unknown clinical significance, unless there is some functional evidence of their zzso It is now becoming clear that zzso deep within zzso can also interfere with normal processing of zzso and result in zzso effects on the mature zzso In diagnostic laboratories, these deep zzso zzso most often fall outside of the regions zzso and so are rarely zzso With the likelihood that next generation sequencing will identify more of these zzso zzso it will become important to perform additional studies to determine the zzso of such sequence zzso Here, we zzso zzso detected in either zzso or zzso in patients with zzso zzso These have been zzso both in zzso and functionally using either zzso isolated from the patient's cells or, more commonly, zzso as zzso zzso We show that deep zzso zzso are not a rare zzso including one zzso that results in multiple zzso where both de zzso donor and zzso are created by the zzso Another zzso produces transcripts that result in either zzso or a dominant negative effect, potentially zzso the disease zzso
