zzso zzso is a zzso protein expressed mainly on cells of the zzso zzso It associates with zzso on the cell surface to form the zzso zzso complex, which binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a crucial signal for the appropriate development of zzso zzso and zzso patches, and in the formation of B and T cell compartments in the zzso In this study we report the characterization of mechanisms governing both zzso as well as zzso and zzso regulation of the human zzso zzso Using a zzso T cell line, induction with either zzso or zzso resulted in an increase in zzso levels compared with zzso zzso This induction corresponded to an increase in zzso activity of the human zzso zzso zzso and deletion analysis demonstrated the importance of zzso and zzso motifs in the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, the ability of zzso to induce activity was lost in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the same zzso had little effect on the ability of zzso to induce zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso site positioned at zzso of the promoter zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso site, although playing a major role in zzso zzso did not mediate zzso zzso zzso our study suggests that alternative signaling pathways may be present to induce the expression of zzso in response to different zzso or inflammatory zzso
