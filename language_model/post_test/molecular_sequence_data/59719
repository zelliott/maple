The zzso zzso the major zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso In common with other highly expressed zzso zzso the zzso end of this zzso contains a zzso structure, while zzso termination at the zzso zzso T zzso zzso generates a stable zzso zzso zzso We assessed the influence of these structures on the expression level of zzso and on the functional stability of the zzso Each one of the zzso or zzso structures was sufficient to increase the functional stability of the zzso zzso more than zzso A zzso of the 3' T zzso slightly increased the zzso stability zzso Also, differences in the observed functional zzso could be correlated with the expression level of the zzso derivatives when these were partially zzso Our data suggest that zzso stabilization by a zzso zzso structure can occur even in the absence of a zzso structure that protects zzso against 3' zzso
