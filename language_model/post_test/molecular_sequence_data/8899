The zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso is a key regulator of gene expression during adaptation to zzso zzso inflamed tissue often displays regions of prominent zzso Recent studies have shown zzso zzso is intricately linked to that of the zzso zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B zzso during hypoxic zzso We describe the relative zzso contributions of each to zzso inflammatory gene expression and investigate the level of zzso between the two pathways using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Under the control of an active promoter, zzso is expressed and zzso into the cell culture media, where it can be sampled and measured over zzso Thus, zzso zzso under the control of either zzso or zzso were used to resolve their zzso zzso dynamics in response to zzso and to zzso zzso zzso We also investigated the interactions between zzso and zzso activities using a construct containing the sequence from the promoter of the inflammatory gene zzso 2 zzso which includes functionally active binding sites for both zzso and zzso Finally, based on our experimental data, we constructed a mathematical model of the binding affinities of zzso and zzso to their respective response elements to zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data reveal distinct zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in response to hypoxic zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate synergistic activity between these two zzso factors on the regulation of the zzso promoter, implicating a zzso role for both zzso and zzso in the expression of zzso in hypoxic zzso
