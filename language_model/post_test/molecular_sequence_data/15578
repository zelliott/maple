zzso gene is widely expressed in various fish, suggesting that this zzso zzso is a very important component in the innate immune zzso Large yellow zzso zzso zzso is one of the important economic species of zzso fish but knowledge of its innate immune mechanism is zzso In this study, we characterize a zzso zzso zzso gene named as zzso It consists of an open reading frame of 258 bases zzso 85 zzso acids and has a zzso sequence in common with other known zzso The zzso DNA of zzso contains three zzso and two zzso the same organization as other reported zzso indicating that zzso is one member of the zzso family in zzso The zzso expression of zzso gene in normal fish and the expression pattern in zzso fish at the time course of stimulation were zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly increased in the zzso heart and stomach but not significantly induced in the liver after zzso zzso An interesting finding is the demonstration of high amounts of zzso transcripts in the kidney in normal fish and their maintenance through zzso exposure to zzso zzso The synthetic zzso demonstrated a rather wide spectrum of zzso activity in zzso against bacteria and zzso tested, and particularly showed strong activity against the principal fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study indicates that zzso may play a role with a zzso mode in the innate immunity of zzso zzso
