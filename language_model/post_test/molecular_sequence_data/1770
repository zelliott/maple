Previously, the zzso protein zzso from zzso has been demonstrated to interact with the ABC zzso zzso and its closest zzso zzso zzso and zzso investigation of zzso and of zzso plants suggested a regulatory role of zzso on zzso transport zzso To further understand the dramatic zzso zzso that is caused by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we were interested in other zzso interacting zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso ABC zzso has been isolated in a zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate molecular interaction between zzso and ABC zzso zzso and its closest zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso repeat domain of zzso which is well known to mediate zzso zzso zzso mapping proved that zzso binds to a motif of zzso that resembles zzso zzso and zzso binding to the zzso of zzso was zzso By membrane zzso and zzso we localized zzso to the central zzso membrane and the zzso complex was verified in zzso by zzso We were able to demonstrate that zzso binds to isolated zzso and has a significant impact on the zzso of zzso and zzso well-known zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
