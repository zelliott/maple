A Spanish family with a zzso zzso of factor H was identified in previous zzso The zzso was zzso as low amounts of a zzso zzso with partial identity to factor H were detected in her zzso The aim of this study was to obtain further zzso of her zzso employing her zzso zzso After zzso of zzso from her zzso virus zzso zzso and from zzso cells, and zzso synthesis we succeeded in amplifying zzso which codes for factor H zzso zzso from both cell lines, using specific zzso The amplified fragments were indistinguishable from the one which was amplified from the control cloned zzso zzso The failure to amplify the 3' end of the patient's factor H zzso suggests that the zzso is zzso which is consistent with the characteristics of the zzso zzso Thus, factor H zzso was zzso in zzso cells and the patient's zzso zzso We suggest that zzso B zzso can be used for the study of a range of inherited complement zzso
