zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of producing four major toxins that are responsible for disease symptoms and zzso in a variety of animals, humans, and zzso The zzso is the third leading cause of human zzso bacterial disease, and zzso zzso is the zzso zzso agent of zzso zzso among zzso which in the acute form can cause increased mortality among broiler zzso Countries that have complied with the ban on zzso growth promoters zzso in feeds have had increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso To address this issue, new zzso agents, putative zzso from the zzso of zzso are zzso Two putative zzso zzso genes zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso coli , and the zzso proteins were zzso to near zzso Gene and protein sequencing revealed that the predicted and chemically determined zzso acid sequences of the two zzso proteins were zzso to zzso zzso The proteins were identical in the zzso putative zzso binding domain, but only zzso identical to each other in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were capable of zzso both parental zzso host strains of zzso zzso as well as other strains of the zzso in spot and zzso reduction zzso The observed reduction in zzso was correlated with up to a 3 log zzso reduction in viable zzso zzso on zzso infusion zzso zzso However, other member species of the zzso were resistant to the zzso activity by both zzso
