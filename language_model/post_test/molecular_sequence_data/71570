zzso trees constructed using human zzso sequences contain a large number of zzso These are due either to repeated zzso or to zzso between zzso zzso We show that a tree constructed using synonymous variation in the protein coding sequences of 29 largely complete human zzso molecules contains 22 zzso at 32 zzso zzso zzso This level of zzso is very unlikely if inheritance is zzso even if we take into account base composition zzso There must either be zzso sites or zzso between zzso We present evidence which suggests that zzso sites do not exist in our zzso It therefore seems likely that zzso has occurred between zzso lineages in zzso
