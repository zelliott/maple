Human zzso type 1 zzso causes zzso zzso On the basis of previously mapped zzso and sequence zzso of zzso to other zzso we designed zzso zzso and employed the zzso chain reaction to recover zzso zzso from zzso zzso Seven spliced zzso species were zzso including three not previously zzso and the coding zzso of each were zzso The most abundant viral zzso encodes an zzso zzso One new species is predicted to zzso the full-length zzso zzso and another can, zzso zzso the zzso or zzso zzso three products that regulate zzso zzso and DNA zzso One zzso species originating from a novel zzso promoter in the upstream regulatory region has the potential to zzso the minor zzso protein zzso A newly recognized zzso open reading frame zzso is contained in all zzso that are zzso at the zzso zzso site and also in a putative zzso zzso Three distinct species, two of which are derived from the upstream regulatory region promoter, have the potential to zzso the zzso zzso the third species also contains the entire coding region of the zzso protein zzso to the zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and the potentially zzso zzso zzso are derived from a promoter located in the zzso zzso We uncovered no evidence of alternatively spliced zzso that could account for the zzso abundant zzso proteins in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso modification is mainly responsible for the observed protein zzso
