zzso zzso zzso is an enigmatic zzso subterranean water family of marine origin zzso One of the species in the zzso zzso zzso is endemic to the zzso islands of zzso and zzso zzso zzso It has been suggested that the origin and distribution of zzso crustaceans could be explained by one of two alternative zzso zzso active colonization of inland freshwater aquifers by a marine zzso followed by an zzso zzso or zzso passive colonization by zzso of ancestral marine populations in coastal aquifers during marine zzso A comparison of zzso zzso patterns and age zzso of zzso should discriminate in zzso of one of these two zzso 

zzso relationships within zzso zzso based on three zzso DNA zzso and one nuclear marker revealed five genetically divergent and geographically structured zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso data showed the occurrence of a high geographic population subdivision in both islands, with current gene flow occurring exclusively between sites located in close zzso zzso zzso dated the origin of zzso zzso previous to about 6 zzso whereas major zzso events within the species took place between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso displayed a surprisingly old and highly fragmented population structure, with major episodes of zzso within the species roughly zzso with some of the major marine zzso episodes that affected the region during the last 6 zzso zzso changes zzso zzso zzso active range expansion of marine zzso ancestors colonizing zzso zzso the zzso pattern observed in zzso zzso
