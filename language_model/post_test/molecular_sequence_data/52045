The zzso zzso protein of malaria zzso is a major surface protein of the zzso zzso In the process of investigating the zzso of this protein in the zzso zzso complex, we found that a zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso protein of zzso of zzso zzso recognizes New World monkey zzso and human zzso cells zzso in Western zzso and by zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds to the zzso acid sequence zzso which is also shared with the alpha 3 domain of the human and zzso major zzso complex class zzso In addition, in zzso experiments suggest that the binding of the zzso zzso to zzso from zzso monkey enhances the invasion or development of malaria zzso These results form the basis for investigating the relationships between zzso surface proteins and zzso zzso
