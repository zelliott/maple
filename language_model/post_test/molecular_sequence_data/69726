Several zzso clones zzso receptors for zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso factor, have been isolated in the past 3 zzso The primary structure of these receptors revealed that they are members of the zzso of G zzso receptors containing seven zzso zzso In this study the zzso chain reaction was carried out to isolate novel zzso clones zzso human receptors of zzso related zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso library using zzso zzso zzso devised from zzso sequences among the zzso zzso the human receptors for zzso zzso and zzso Four novel zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso for zzso and zzso receptors were zzso All zzso zzso by the cloned zzso share common features with the G zzso zzso zzso such as seven putative zzso zzso zzso and, except for zzso zzso zzso sites near the zzso The zzso acid sequence identities among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are in the range of zzso higher than those of other members of the G zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the number of zzso acids between the fifth and sixth zzso zzso which varies within this zzso is the same in these zzso Thus, three of the newly identified proteins probably belong to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from the other clones with respect to the zzso acid zzso suggesting that this may be the zzso for a different type of zzso Furthermore, it was confirmed that zzso is a functional zzso for zzso one of the zzso zzso as revealed by the measurement of decrease of zzso zzso as well as calcium influx using stable zzso
