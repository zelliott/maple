zzso zzso strain zzso can degrade zzso and some of its zzso derivatives via a zzso zzso zzso The zzso route involves zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and a subsequent zzso zzso All 15 structural genes involved are clustered in an zzso that is regulated by a zzso transcribed zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso zzso is unusual since reactions of this type are usually accomplished by single component zzso We have isolated and zzso a number of marine bacterial zzso capable of degrading zzso and a range of other aromatic compounds as sole carbon and energy zzso Southern zzso and zzso zzso were used to compare the zzso pathways of these strains and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to known zzso genes zzso by zzso zzso All the strains tested that zzso zzso via a zzso zzso were found to have DNA highly zzso to each of the components of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, DNA of the same strains also strongly zzso to zzso specific for zzso zzso genes and the specific regulator of its zzso zzso These results demonstrate conservation of structural and regulatory genes involved in aromatic zzso within strains isolated from diverse geographical locations zzso Norway and zzso and a range of zzso that include activated zzso sea water and zzso zzso
