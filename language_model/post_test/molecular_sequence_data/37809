We determined the zzso zzso b gene sequences zzso zzso of one subspecies of the European red deer zzso zzso in zzso three subspecies of the zzso zzso zzso in Asia and North America), and six subspecies of the zzso deer zzso zzso in zzso Our zzso analysis revealed the zzso of the European red zzso that of the zzso and that of the zzso zzso The zzso however, was shown to be more closely related to the zzso deer than to the European red zzso This is in conflict with traditional zzso results, which suggest a close sister group relationship between the zzso and the European red zzso The divergence time between the European red deer and the zzso plus the zzso deer was estimated to be approximately zzso zzso and that between the zzso and the zzso deer was estimated to be zzso zzso The zzso deer was subdivided into two subspecies groups, and the zzso was also found to consist of an Asian group and a North American zzso
