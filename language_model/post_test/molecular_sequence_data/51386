The relation between the match of experimental and simulated zzso zzso with the accuracy of structure determination of zzso has been zzso A hypothetical experimental spectrum of the zzso zzso from its known X-ray zzso structure zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been generated with simplifying assumptions of single correlation time, leakage rate zzso and this spectrum has been simulated imposing various constraints in a manner as one would do in a real zzso The hypothetical spectrum represents the case of an infinitely good experimental spectrum and therefore the study of quality of fit against quality of structure represents the limiting case of real zzso It has been shown that even with a limited number of zzso it is possible to approach the correct structure of the zzso by demanding a highly accurate fit between experimental and simulated zzso zzso zzso geometry calculations have been used to probe the extent of structural zzso in the zzso intensity matching zzso
