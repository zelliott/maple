The zzso motif in the sequence of zzso A4 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zinc zzso contains a zzso acid that is zzso in several zinc zzso To study its role for the two zzso activities, zzso in mouse zzso A4 zzso was replaced by a zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed four or five times in zzso coli, and the resulting proteins were zzso to apparent zzso With respect to their zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited specific activities of zzso zzso 160 and 90 zzso 30 zzso of zzso per zzso of protein per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 or zzso respectively, corresponding to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, when the zzso proteins were zzso for zzso activity toward zzso they were found to be virtually inactive (less than or equal to zzso of zzso zzso To serve as a positive control, we also replaced zzso with an zzso zzso which resulted in a protein zzso zzso with zzso properties almost indistinguishable from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso was also carried out with human zzso zzso and the zzso human zzso displayed specific activities similar to the corresponding mouse zzso zzso analyses of the zzso mouse and human proteins confirmed that the zzso did not significantly influence their zinc zzso In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate a direct zzso role for zzso in the zzso reaction of zzso zzso where it presumably acts as a base to zzso water, whereas its function, if any, is apparently not essential in the zzso zzso zzso
