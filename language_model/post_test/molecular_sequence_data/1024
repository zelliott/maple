A zzso zzso zzso zzso designed from zzso substitution of a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited strong zzso activity zzso 2 to approximately 4 zzso against three zzso and three zzso comparable to that of zzso but had no zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated bacterial selectivity of zzso is closely related to the selective interaction with zzso charged zzso on the surface of bacterial zzso These results suggested that the central zzso in zzso plays an important role in its bacterial cell zzso In conclusion, zzso with zzso selectivity may serve as an attractive candidate for the development of zzso zzso
