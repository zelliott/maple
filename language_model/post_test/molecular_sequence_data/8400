zzso at the zzso locus are the most common class of zzso in humans, with deletion of all four adult zzso genes resulting in the zzso lethal condition zzso zzso zzso zzso Using gene targeting in mice, we have deleted a 16 zzso region encompassing both adult zzso zzso Animals zzso for this deletion become zzso and die late in gestation mimicking humans with zzso zzso Introduction of a human zzso zzso rescued these animals from zzso death thus demonstrating the utility of this zzso model in the development of cellular and gene based approaches for treating this human genetic zzso
