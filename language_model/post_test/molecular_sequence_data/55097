zzso zinc finger proteins comprise a large protein zzso zzso evidence suggests that members of this family are zzso proteins with regulatory functions in zzso zzso Compared with those in animals, functions of zzso zinc finger proteins involved in plant growth and development are poorly zzso 

Here, we performed a zzso survey of zzso zinc finger genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso by describing the gene structure, zzso relationships and zzso location of each family zzso zzso sequences and expression profiles of putative zzso members were also zzso A total of 68 zzso genes zzso were identified in zzso and divided into seven groups by zzso zzso These 68 genes were found to be zzso distributed on 10 zzso with 15 zzso zzso events, suggesting that zzso zzso played a major role in expansion of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios suggested that the duplicated genes of the zzso family mainly experienced zzso selection with limited functional divergence after zzso zzso Twelve zzso zzso genes grouped with other known zzso genes from zzso were found to contain putative zzso zzso in their promoter zzso Seven of these genes chosen for further quantitative real-time zzso analysis showed differential expression patterns among five representative zzso zzso and over time in response to zzso acid and drought zzso 

The results presented in this study provide basic information on zzso zzso proteins and form the foundation for future functional studies of these zzso especially for those members of which may play important roles in response to zzso zzso
