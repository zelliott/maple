zzso of the human gene A4 is enriched in the zzso zzso and is zzso activated on differentiation of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A4 zzso contains an open reading frame that predicts a zzso of 17 zzso To determine the function of the A4 zzso we characterized its zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of deduced A4 zzso acid sequence revealed four putative zzso zzso The zzso nature of A4 was confirmed by its being zzso with organic zzso zzso studies of cells expressing A4 localized it to the zzso zzso Moreover, A4 zzso in zzso as determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of A4 suggest that it belongs to a family of integral membrane proteins called zzso some of which zzso to form zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing A4 showed the appearance of a zzso zzso Thus our studies indicate that A4 is a zzso zzso protein localized to the zzso zzso and that, similar to other zzso A4 zzso and exhibits characteristics of an zzso zzso
