In order to study the regulation of the synthesis of zzso zzso in response to changes in environmental parameters zzso and nitrogen zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This gene consists of zzso zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso highly zzso to that from zzso zzso zzso but more distant from those identified from other zzso The relative abundance of the two zzso transcripts zzso and zzso zzso is equivalent in cells grown under either red or green light, but the zzso species zzso in zzso cells and the zzso species in zzso zzso The very high identity zzso observed between the zzso long zzso sequence upstream from the zzso and zzso zzso genes suggests the existence of similar regulatory signals for the control of zzso expression in both zzso
