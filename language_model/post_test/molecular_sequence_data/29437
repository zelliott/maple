A zzso from zzso zzso resembling zzso zzso zzso an zzso with putative roles in zzso zzso in animals and zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a zzso composed of zzso zzso Like zzso from other sources, zzso had zzso activity toward zzso and zzso activity toward zzso zzso Unlike other zzso the zzso from zzso actively zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by heavy metals and zzso zzso agents, but was insensitive to zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso was a zzso zzso Although zzso transcripts were determined in plants and cultures of zzso the respective zzso could not be detected in zzso after the zzso activities present were resolved using zzso zzso Instead, zzso contained several zzso active toward zzso zzso which were all sensitive to zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso
