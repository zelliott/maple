zzso is an zzso protein found in the zzso component of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso differentiate into swimming zzso zzso is found associated with the zzso body complex at the base of the zzso In order to determine the factors responsible for targeting zzso to a specific zzso region, zzso coding for both zzso were isolated and zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso representing the 46 zzso and 51 zzso zzso respectively, were investigated in zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 263 zzso acids with a predicted size of zzso zzso that zzso with the 51 zzso zzso of zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted size of zzso zzso that zzso with the 46 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identical to zzso except for the addition of an zzso acid between positions 94 and 95 of the zzso sequence and the absence of 45 zzso acids beginning at position zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences were not closely related to any previously zzso However, the sequences did have zzso identity to a group of zzso zzso binding zzso but lacked the zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso Both zzso contained two zzso and three zzso repeats found in other zzso proteins and in some zzso binding zzso Using zzso zzso blots of zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso of 44 zzso and 74 zzso The 44 zzso component was identified as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso bound specifically to the zzso of fixed zzso cells, cells which lack a zzso related zzso When the zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso each zzso was independently targeted to the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso represents a unique zzso protein that can form specific complexes with zzso and other zzso zzso We suggest that the association of zzso with the zzso of zzso bodies may reflect its role in connecting the zzso with the zzso activity for the zzso zzso This would provide a mechanism for zzso segregation during the closed zzso of zzso zzso
