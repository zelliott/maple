The novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso products of zzso zzso The zzso compounds inhibited zzso binding to ETA receptors zzso for zzso on zzso zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso receptors zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso was not inhibited by either of these compounds even at 100 zzso The zzso analogue zzso induced extremely potent zzso of zzso binding to ETA receptors zzso of zzso zzso but it barely inhibited zzso binding to zzso receptors zzso of 18 zzso and binding of various other peptides to their zzso zzso shifted the zzso curve for zzso toward the right in zzso isolated coronary zzso indicative of competitive antagonism for the ETA zzso However, there was a small amount of zzso zzso that paralleled the incomplete zzso of zzso binding in the membrane of the vascular smooth muscle zzso These data suggest that the artery contracts via both ETA and zzso receptors and that zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso revealed large tissue and species differences in the distribution of ETA zzso Thus, the potent ETA zzso zzso should be useful in clarifying the zzso roles of ETA zzso
