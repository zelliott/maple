Despite the enormous ecological and economic importance of coral zzso the zzso organisms in their establishment, the zzso zzso increasingly face a range of anthropogenic challenges including ocean zzso and seawater temperature zzso To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying coral biology, here we zzso the approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso using next-generation sequencing zzso This zzso contains approximately zzso gene zzso zzso zzso indicate that the coral and the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 500 million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which modern zzso are represented in the fossil record zzso million years zzso Despite the long evolutionary history of the zzso no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of genes from zzso to zzso However, unlike several other zzso zzso seems to lack an zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso dependency of this coral on its zzso for this zzso zzso zzso inhabit environments where they are frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and analysis of the zzso zzso data indicates that the coral host can independently carry out de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso which are potent zzso zzso In addition, the coral innate immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea zzso indicating that some of these genes may have roles in zzso or zzso A number of genes with putative roles in zzso were identified, and several of these are restricted to zzso The coral zzso provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of zzso and responses to environmental zzso
