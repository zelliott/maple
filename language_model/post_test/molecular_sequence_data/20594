zzso sequences sharing zzso identity were zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso efficiently repaired zzso plasmids containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso From zzso zzso active zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each resulting from double zzso were zzso and their apparent kinetic parameters were determined using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso At zzso zzso the apparent kinetic parameters of the zzso were not distinguishable from each other or from those obtained for the zzso zzso used as zzso On the other hand, the pH tolerance of the zzso was visibly extended towards alkaline pH zzso Compared to the parental zzso a zzso increase in apparent zzso was observed for zzso at pH zzso This factor is one of the highest ever observed for zzso in a single zzso zzso
