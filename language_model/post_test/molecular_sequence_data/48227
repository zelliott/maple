The zzso of an zzso zzso current zzso in identified cultured motor zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso was found to be strongly modulated by zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coding for zzso channels, exhibited similar zzso by zzso over a range of zzso from 0 to 100 zzso zzso channels also showed a decreased rate of zzso and an increased rate of recovery from zzso at high zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso can be ascribed to an unusual combination of a weak zzso zzso zzso mechanism and a strong, fast, zzso zzso zzso zzso between the two forms of zzso is responsible for the zzso dependence of cumulative zzso zzso of zzso was determined primarily by a strong zzso and zzso mechanism similar to fruit fly Shaker zzso zzso using fast zzso of zzso patches with zzso channels were used to establish that the effects of zzso on the peak current zzso and zzso were due to processes occurring at either different sites located at the external channel mouth with different retention times for zzso zzso or at the same zzso where retention time is determined by zzso zzso of the channel zzso The possible zzso implications of zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso currents is zzso
