In zzso cultured zzso callus was employed as a model to investigate zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso Thirty-one zzso including 16 novel species were identified from a large number of small zzso which were cloned from both differentiated and zzso rice zzso zzso Four target genes of the zzso were further zzso A set of the zzso including zzso and zzso exhibited intriguing expression patterns during the transition from zzso to differentiated zzso By exploiting the correlations between the differential expression patterns of these zzso and their targets, the regulatory roles of the zzso on zzso maintenance and zzso were zzso
