We have identified an zzso zzso B zzso in a patient with an zzso form of zzso zzso zzso In the family the eye disease is zzso by late age of onset and zzso dominant zzso In addition to zzso the zzso has low total cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso disease zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso directly against zzso B and zzso of zzso zzso gel separated zzso a normal zzso zzso and a truncated zzso B species with an estimated size of zzso zzso was identified in the zzso and his zzso zzso The location of the zzso in the zzso B gene was identified using chemical zzso of mismatch and this was confirmed by direct sequencing of an amplified zzso of DNA spanning the estimated site of the zzso The zzso is a zzso transition at zzso zzso which changes the zzso zzso zzso to a STOP zzso resulting in the premature termination of zzso zzso The truncated zzso B protein is zzso zzso acids long with a predicted size of zzso zzso Using zzso specific zzso and zzso melting techniques, the zzso his sister and two other relatives out of a total of 20 family members, screened for the presence of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso for the zzso The segregation of the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in the family using the 3' variable number of tandem repeats of the zzso B zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
