We present a novel zzso zzso that was discovered in a 32-year-old zzso man admitted to the hospital after a car zzso He presented with a low zzso zzso zzso zzso and a prolonged zzso zzso time, 58 zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso revealed a zzso zzso with an apparently higher molecular zzso zzso focusing zzso demonstrated an zzso shift in the zzso pattern of the chains and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in the average mass of the unresolved zzso and normal gamma zzso DNA sequence analysis showed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso 309 of the gamma chain zzso This zzso zzso substitution was consistent with the charge change shown by zzso as well as the mass change identified by zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso occurred with a longer lag time, lower rate of lateral zzso and similar final zzso compared to normal and that factor zzso zzso was zzso The zzso results suggest that zzso zzso is necessary for proper alignment of zzso zzso specifically in zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso and zzso structures support the conclusion that the lack of a side chain at this position helps facilitate the close contact between abutting zzso zzso of condensing zzso zzso during zzso
