Here we present a procedure for zzso membrane proteins which employs molecular dynamics simulations incorporating target restraints derived from zzso structures alongside distance restraints derived from zzso zzso The application of the zzso procedure to the closed zzso of the pore domain of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso This domain is formed by a parallel bundle of five zzso zzso Each zzso zzso is zzso due to cumulative zzso of backbone zzso zzso zzso The central region of zzso may adopt a more distorted zzso This would enable a ring of zzso zzso zzso (one from each zzso zzso to pack together, zzso the central pore and thus preventing zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations on isolated zzso that zzso formation is not an inherent property of zzso
