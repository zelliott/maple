LIGHT zzso zzso zzso that competes with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso D for zzso entry zzso on T zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso which plays important roles in inflammatory and immune zzso In the present study, the zzso of guinea pig zzso zzso LIGHT zzso as zzso and its zzso zzso virus entry zzso zzso as zzso were amplified from zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso cover 726 and zzso zzso zzso predicted proteins with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso structure, zzso zzso and characterization of both genes were also zzso We also generated a zzso model to verify interaction between the two zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso analysis revealed that both LIGHT and zzso are zzso expressed in guinea pig various zzso A fusion protein zzso zzso zzso zzso (the soluble mature part of zzso was efficiently expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso using metal zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso can bind its receptors on T zzso The zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in the immune system, and our results might provide a platform for further research into the effects of LIGHT and zzso
