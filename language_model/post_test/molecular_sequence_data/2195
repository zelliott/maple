A putative second zzso channel expressed in rat brain is identified by cloning and characterization of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso isolated from rat brain libraries, zzso a zzso protein that is zzso identical with a previously described rat brain zzso channel and zzso identical with a zzso zzso zzso This new zzso channel is called zzso to distinguish it from the previously described zzso channel zzso The zzso zzso unlike the zzso zzso channel gene complex, appears to produce a single, large zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis of rat zzso DNA indicates that the zzso and zzso transcripts are the products of independent zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso transcripts in rat brain by in zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso gene is zzso expressed by central nervous system zzso Identification of this putative second zzso zzso channel zzso indicates the existence of a zzso channel gene family, confirming zzso data on the diversity of zzso channels expressed in rat zzso
