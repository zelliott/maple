A quantitative real-time zzso zzso was developed to measure the zzso load of human zzso virus type I zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso The zzso copy number was referred to the actual amount of cellular DNA by means of the zzso of the zzso zzso Ten copies of zzso DNA could be detected with zzso sensitivity, and the zzso had a wide range of at least 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated using independent zzso of zzso from an zzso patient zzso of variation, 24 and zzso zzso The performance of this zzso zzso zzso coupled with its high zzso thus allows reliable routine follow-up of zzso zzso load in infected zzso zzso results using clinical samples indicate a higher zzso load in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso carriers, and also suggest the usefulness of this quantitative measurement to assess the zzso link between zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso
