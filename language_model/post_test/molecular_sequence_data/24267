It has been reported that the zzso syndrome is caused by zzso in zzso zzso zzso gene that affects zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso To identify the zzso binding zzso within human zzso zzso zzso at zzso or zzso position were constructed by cassette zzso More than zzso of the initial activities were remained at the concentration of zzso up to 300 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso regardless of their size, zzso and zzso of the side zzso whereas the wild type zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were completely inhibited by 30 zzso zzso The binding of zzso to the wild type zzso or the zzso zzso was further examined by zzso labeling with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso occurred apparent zzso values near 20 zzso for the wild type zzso or the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso was significantly decreased in the presence of 300 zzso zzso Unlike the wild type zzso or the zzso zzso zzso less than zzso of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was not affected by the presence of 300 zzso zzso The results with cassette zzso and zzso labeling demonstrate selectivity of the zzso for the zzso binding site and suggest that zzso but not zzso is required for efficient binding of zzso to zzso Interestingly, studies of the zzso zzso showed that both the wild type zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso at zzso between 10 and 100 zzso whereas less than zzso of the initial activities of the zzso zzso zzso were diminished by zzso These results indicate that zzso but not zzso may be also responsible for the zzso zzso therefore, zzso bound to the zzso zzso
