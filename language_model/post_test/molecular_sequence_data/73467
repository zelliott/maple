zzso an zzso zzso zzso is attached to the outer face of the zzso membrane and is a component of the protein import zzso zzso interacts with both the zzso and zzso zzso It is the only known zzso membrane protein that binds the zzso zzso and might thus mediate the membrane zzso event of zzso protein zzso These results suggest that the two import pathways overlap and, zzso that zzso represents the point of zzso zzso also interacts with two other zzso zzso including zzso another binding protein for the zzso zzso The data presented here are consistent with the idea of a common zzso machinery for both zzso protein import pathways in the zzso zzso
