We report here structural differences between zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso associated with Alzheimer's disease as determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso Specifically, we have identified regions of the zzso zzso containing backbone zzso hydrogen atoms that are protected from zzso or exposed when this zzso is incorporated into zzso or zzso zzso formed in zzso saline without stirring at 37 degrees zzso Study of zzso was facilitated by use of the zzso agent zzso zzso Our data clearly show that both the zzso segment zzso and the zzso segment zzso are highly exposed to zzso in both zzso and zzso In contrast, the internal zzso zzso is highly protected from exchange in zzso but much less so in zzso The data suggest that the zzso elements zzso the zzso zzso are already present in zzso but that they are expanded into some adjacent zzso upon the formation of mature zzso The zzso approximately ten zzso appear to be zzso in both zzso and zzso The zzso segment of zzso is more ordered in zzso than in zzso suggesting that, if zzso are a zzso precursor of zzso the transition from zzso to zzso involves substantial ordering of this region of the zzso zzso
