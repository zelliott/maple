Several distinctive features of zzso zzso have been identified by a detailed analysis of the available heavy and light chain zzso They include unique zzso gene segments that are not normally expressed in zzso to external zzso zzso zzso which may serve to change the zzso specificity as well as to increase zzso a less stringent choice of light zzso and a unique basic zzso in the heavy chain zzso It is proposed that in the majority of cases, the regulatory mechanism of zzso in the healthy animal operates via zzso gene expression to prevent the synthesis of potentially high affinity zzso zzso
