zzso control of the timing of zzso zzso of dormant zzso stored in zzso is required for normal progression of zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso is specifically involved in the zzso control of zzso B1 zzso during zzso zzso zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso It was reported that another zzso zzso zzso exists in zzso zzso and that this protein regulates the translation of zzso zzso together with zzso in zzso protein zzso In this study, we characterized zzso and zzso zzso by using newly produced zzso that discriminate between zzso zzso and zzso are bound to several key proteins involved in zzso control of dormant zzso including zzso and zzso in immature zzso However, zzso and zzso themselves have no physical zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso accelerated zzso zzso zzso B1 translation, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso from zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso B1 zzso a target of zzso whereas zzso zzso occurred at timing earlier than that for zzso zzso but not all, of zzso B1 zzso release the zzso zzso during zzso zzso whereas zzso remains associated with the zzso On the basis of these findings, we discuss the functions of zzso and zzso in zzso control of zzso during zzso zzso
