Various reports have described that zzso acid zzso can alter zzso zzso zzso and target gene zzso of zzso By using the method of zzso and zzso the present work predicts that critical zzso acids for converting these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found to exist within regions predicted as zzso The ratios of zzso and zzso positions of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, are varied by changes of the protein structures, probably around turn zzso zzso zzso of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor and alpha zzso and target gene specificity of zzso zzso are converted by changing turn zzso zzso of zzso probabilities can be predicted around the zzso acid zzso positions of an zzso zzso protein of a nylon degradation zzso These findings will have relevance to work on protein engineering and zzso zzso
