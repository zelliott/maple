zzso may be linked to zzso diabetes zzso zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso infection at onset of adult zzso was investigated by detection of specific zzso sequences in peripheral blood using a reverse zzso and a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso whole blood samples taken from 12 newly diagnosed zzso patients with zzso or zzso were zzso The comparison groups were 12 adult patients suffering from zzso zzso in the course of zzso 12 adult patients with zzso zzso and 15 healthy adults without any presumed zzso infection or zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in five of 12 zzso newly diagnosed zzso patients and in one of 12 zzso patients in the course of zzso By contrast, none of the 12 zzso patients and none of the 15 healthy adults had zzso sequences in whole zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso products from the six positive patients showed a significant zzso with zzso B3 or B4 zzso and some common patterns were observed among the zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso B virus zzso sequences can be detected in peripheral blood from patients at the onset or in the course of zzso and provides evidence for a role for zzso in adult type I zzso
