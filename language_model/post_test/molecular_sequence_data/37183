By different approaches, we characterized the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso The sequence of zzso segment A revealed the presence of two open reading frames zzso a large zzso with a zzso zzso sequence and a zzso small zzso located within the zzso half of the large ORF, but in a different reading zzso The large zzso was found to zzso a zzso zzso processed by the viral zzso zzso to generate zzso (the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The two zzso sites at the zzso and zzso junctions were identified by zzso zzso We showed that the processing of zzso generated zzso and several small peptides zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso 461 to zzso zzso to zzso and 475 to zzso Two of these peptides zzso zzso to 460 and 475 to zzso were positively identified in the viral particles with 10 additional peptides derived from further processing of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso multiple zzso downward zzso Ala zzso with the notable exception of the zzso zzso Replacement of the members of the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed their zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso segment B sequence revealed a single large zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso should be considered a new aquatic zzso species, slightly more related to zzso than to zzso
