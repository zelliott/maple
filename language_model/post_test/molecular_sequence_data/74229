zzso play a major role in the defensive strategies of plants against zzso zzso In the current study, the gene for a zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso an important zzso zzso The corresponding complementary zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso in zzso zzso 449 zzso acid zzso The zzso expression of zzso in response to the treatments of cell walls of six pathogens and confrontation against two zzso zzso was measured in zzso zzso using real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso The expression of zzso can be highly induced by exposure to the cell walls of plant pathogens and living zzso suggesting a role in plant disease zzso The zzso gene was inserted into the zzso zzso and transferred into the cells of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The optimal reaction conditions for zzso zzso activity were: 45 degrees C, pH of zzso and 5 zzso zzso of zzso The maximum zzso activity was zzso U zzso following exposure to the cell wall zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso can efficiently degrade cell walls of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating that it may be involved in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso
