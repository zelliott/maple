Seven peptides corresponding to the zzso acid sequence of toxin 2 from the scorpion zzso zzso were chemically zzso zzso and zzso in mice for their putative zzso properties against scorpion zzso All the peptides were zzso and some produced zzso zzso as verified by injecting the zzso with toxin into zzso zzso However, direct challenge of zzso mice (with the longest synthetic peptides of 27 and 57 zzso acid zzso revealed an unexpected zzso zzso the animals did not resist injection of one zzso of zzso toxin 2 zzso zzso but zzso of mice with native toxin protected zzso of the zzso These findings suggest that vaccine preparations with synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso acid sequence of certain toxins should be analyzed zzso
