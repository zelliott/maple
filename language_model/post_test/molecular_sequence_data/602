A class of hairpin zzso linked by zzso acid, resulting in a zzso zzso at the turn unit, showed improved binding affinities relative to their zzso zzso for particular zzso We incorporated zzso in zzso zzso and determined whether there are any sequence preferences under the turn unit by quantitative zzso zzso Although there was an energetic penalty for zzso and zzso base pairs, we found little preference for zzso over zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso Their binding affinities and zzso in the context of zzso zzso demonstrated overall diminished affinity and no additional specificity at the turn zzso We anticipate that this study will be a baseline for further investigation of the turn zzso as a recognition element for the DNA minor zzso
