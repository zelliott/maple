The zzso in rice field soil are crucial in regulating the zzso of zzso zzso substantially reduces methane zzso from rice zzso However, it is poorly understood how drainage affects microbial methane zzso zzso we analyzed the dynamics of methane zzso rates, composition zzso terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso and abundance zzso quantitative zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes zzso a zzso of particulate methane zzso and their transcripts over the season and in response to alternate zzso cycles in planted zzso field zzso In zzso methane zzso accounted for less than zzso of total methane production but was enhanced by intermittent zzso The zzso zzso resulted in distinct effects on the zzso communities in different soil compartments zzso soil, zzso soil, surface zzso The zzso communities of the different soil compartments also showed distinct seasonal zzso In bulk soil, potential zzso activity and zzso of zzso were relatively low but were significantly zzso by zzso In contrast, however, in the zzso and surface soils, potential zzso activity and zzso zzso were relatively high but decreased after drainage events and resumed after zzso While type II zzso dominated the communities in the bulk soil and zzso soil compartments (and to a lesser extent also in the surface zzso it was the zzso of type I zzso that was mainly transcribed under flooded zzso zzso affected the composition of the zzso community only minimally but strongly affected metabolically active zzso Our study revealed dramatic dynamics in the zzso zzso and activity of the various type I and type II zzso on both a seasonal and a spatial scale and showed strong effects of zzso zzso cycles, which enhanced the zzso of methane flux into the zzso
