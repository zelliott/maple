Some zzso zzso zzso show higher affinity for zzso zzso than for zzso without zzso These zzso possess a secondary binding zzso zzso to the possibility of additional zzso zzso zzso adopt different zzso depending on whether they contain zzso or zzso To study these zzso differences, complexes of zzso and zzso zzso with Lens zzso zzso have been zzso Starting points were X-ray structures of lentil zzso and complexes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso molecular modeling package with the zzso force field was zzso Two different models were built, displaying in both a network of hydrogen bonds between the zzso and the binding zzso Furthermore, to compare the free and bound zzso zzso analysis in the free state has been zzso A complete analysis of all possible zzso fragments has been performed using the zzso force zzso A zzso analysis employing the same force field was carried out to study the complete zzso zzso zzso found by zzso were clustered in zzso families and analyzed in terms of flexibility and zzso zzso All values of zzso zzso angles are in the range as calculated by zzso for the zzso
