zzso receptors are linked to zzso zzso and signaling molecules via the zzso protein zzso We report a novel family of zzso density zzso zzso termed Shank, that binds via its zzso domain to the C zzso of zzso protein zzso A zzso complex of zzso assembles in zzso cells and can be zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso that lacks the zzso C zzso In addition to its zzso domain, zzso contains a zzso region that binds to zzso and a SAM domain that mediates zzso zzso may function as a scaffold protein in the zzso potentially zzso zzso zzso complexes and zzso them to regulators of the zzso zzso
