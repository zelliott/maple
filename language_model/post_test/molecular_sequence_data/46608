We have isolated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso from cell zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by affinity zzso with zzso Based on the internal zzso acid sequence information, zzso zzso were zzso and used to amplify the gene zzso this protein zzso zzso of the zzso sequence and characterization of the zzso protein revealed that zzso is composed of 224 zzso acid zzso zzso weight of zzso and exists in a zzso zzso zzso analyses for the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that they interact with each other with an equilibrium zzso constant, zzso of zzso zzso A gel mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso inhibited the interaction between zzso and a zzso zzso may be one of the zzso factors which zzso regulate zzso
