Some organic zzso are extremely toxic to living organisms by virtue of their ability to partition into and disrupt the normal functioning of biological zzso In recent years, several bacteria have been discovered that are more tolerant to these toxic zzso than most zzso Using enrichment procedures, we have isolated new organic zzso bacteria from both zzso and pristine soil zzso These organisms were characterized by several different experimental procedures including description of their cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso organic zzso tolerance range, and survival after zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso bacteria can be isolated from the environment that are as tolerant to toxic organic zzso if not more so, than the most organic zzso zzso zzso
