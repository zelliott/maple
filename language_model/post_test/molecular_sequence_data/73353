zzso coli zzso zzso is one of seven zzso in the zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso The binding of zzso a zzso and zzso an zzso to the zzso zzso zzso has been analyzed using zzso exchange and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding reduces the extent of zzso exchange, as does the subsequent binding of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso complex coupled with liquid zzso zzso has allowed the identification of four peptides whose zzso exchange slows considerably upon the binding of the zzso or zzso Two of these peptides represent regions known or thought to bind zzso and zzso Two additional peptides are located at the zzso hinge region and are proposed to be zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but are zzso in the zzso zzso active zzso formed after zzso and zzso binding and domain zzso These studies provide a clear example of a zzso essential domain movement in this zzso
