A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso and/or zzso were mainly replaced by zzso and/or N zzso zzso were zzso and examined for their zzso binding properties and in zzso zzso by guinea pig zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a dramatic decrease in the zzso potency when compared to the parent zzso and was found to have a potent delta zzso zzso activity against various delta zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso potency of 2 against zzso as zzso was zzso weaker than that against zzso or zzso Among the zzso in which zzso was replaced by an N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved as a mixed zzso zzso zzso while its zzso zzso in which the N zzso is zzso zzso or (R or zzso zzso zzso were very potent delta zzso zzso zzso 2, 4, zzso and zzso were highly stable against rat brain and rat plasma zzso and thus may represent a starting point for the development of novel zzso compounds useful as zzso for studies of zzso zzso
