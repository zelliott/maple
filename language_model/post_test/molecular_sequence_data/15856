Some 12 new zzso and zzso fragments were zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and characterized by their sizes zzso zzso to greater than 300 zzso zzso patterns on zzso partial zzso acid zzso content of specific zzso and their binding to zzso or zzso structures in zzso zzso This permitted the various fragments to be ordered along the zzso structure of zzso and to compare them with previously described zzso fragments arising by zzso zzso Two zzso fragments zzso zzso 50 zzso and 90 zzso remain associated with a large zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the complex and could be zzso with 2 M zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso zzso fragments devoid of binding activity included the zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso corresponding to the zzso domain and several larger fragments extending more to the zzso of zzso An zzso zzso zzso of about 50 zzso was also zzso Together the data show a lack of zzso binding to the zzso zzso and rod of zzso and provide indirect evidence that this activity is located within or close to its zzso zzso zzso zzso structures of zzso were obtained as two large fragments zzso than 300 zzso zzso and zzso They zzso to the short arm structure of zzso with one zzso or two zzso arms decreased in size to the inner zzso zzso Shortening in zzso is mainly due to the B1 chain segment including the central zzso domain which was identified as a new zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso was comparable to that of zzso while much lower activity was found for other zzso zzso A zzso lower binding potential was also observed for the zzso complex whose structure can now be defined in more precise molecular zzso
