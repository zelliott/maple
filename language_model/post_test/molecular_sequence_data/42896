zzso arthritis is an zzso disease involving stimulation of T cells and the production of zzso In this disease zzso to collagen type II are believed to play a major role in inflammatory events ultimately resulting in joint zzso However, collagen type zzso cartilage has been discussed as one of the primary zzso (as evidenced by animal zzso despite not being zzso Evidence is presented here for the involvement of zzso the zzso zzso of the first component of complement, in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains an zzso exhibiting an identical sequence to part of an arthritis modulating zzso from collagen type zzso Furthermore, zzso of a synthetic zzso representing the zzso on the zzso zzso has been shown to delay the onset and reduce the severity of zzso arthritis in a zzso mouse zzso Since the complement system, in particular zzso (as part of the first component of the classical zzso plays a major role in the inflammatory process, we propose that the zzso zzso zzso altered during the inflammatory process, may result in the generation of zzso which also recognize collagen type II, and may thus be considered as a link between the early inflammatory process in the joint and the only later occurring cartilage zzso
