Members of the zzso family of type I zzso proteins are highly abundant in transport zzso and are thought to be involved in selective protein transport between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso proteins have been grouped into four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and appear to assemble into zzso complexes that contain only one representative from each zzso Here we zzso dissected the zzso family in a single cell type, namely in the intermediate zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of these cells for production of their major cargo protein zzso zzso can be zzso manipulated via the process of background adaptation zzso zzso with highly active cells in black toads and virtually inactive cells in white zzso zzso zzso library screening revealed the identity of six zzso proteins expressed in the zzso zzso cells, namely one member of the zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso two of the zzso zzso zzso and two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed in the zzso cells, pointing to zzso specific zzso zzso Of the six zzso zzso zzso the expression of four zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso to zzso induced in active versus inactive zzso whereas that of the other two members zzso and zzso had not or only slightly zzso The four proteins were induced only in the intermediate zzso cells and not in the anterior zzso cells, and displayed similar overall tissue zzso that differed from those of zzso zzso and zzso Together, our results reveal that zzso expression can be zzso specific and selectively zzso and suggest that in zzso zzso cells an zzso zzso complex is involved in zzso transport through the early stages of the zzso zzso
