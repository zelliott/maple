The complement component zzso plays important roles in inflammatory responses and zzso zzso In zzso fish, although zzso has been identified at the DNA or the protein level in trout, carp and zzso zzso only partial zzso sequences are zzso The present study was designed to obtain the complete primary structure of zzso from the common carp ( zzso zzso and to examine its possible structural zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification from carp zzso zzso resulted in isolation of six distinct zzso zzso zzso which were grouped into two divergent types zzso I and type zzso Using two sequences representative of the two types as zzso two distinct full-length zzso clones zzso and zzso were isolated, in addition to a truncated zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso share zzso identity and predict a typical zzso structure of the mature protein that lacks the zzso bond, as in zzso from other zzso Southern zzso of zzso DNA suggested the presence of multiple genes zzso zzso I and a single gene zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, carp zzso I contains novel zzso like zzso that have a zzso instead of the zzso zzso at the zzso site for the zzso zzso both in the complete and truncated zzso Northern zzso analysis suggested that zzso I and zzso II are mainly expressed in zzso and the expression levels are significantly increased by stimulating carp with zzso or zzso zzso functional divergence among the zzso zzso in carp is zzso
