zzso zzso has emerged as a major drug-resistant pathogen in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be essential for survival of the zzso however the zzso of zzso zzso has not been extensively zzso In this study, we report a detailed characterization of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso and further zzso zzso The expression of zzso was analyzed by Western zzso Growth and zzso formation were analyzed zzso 

zzso was cloned from zzso zzso and expressed as a 55 zzso zzso whereas the molecular weight of the native protein is approximately 600 zzso zzso showed zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso activity was observed at pH zzso and zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso and enhanced by zzso metal zzso specifically zzso zzso is zzso by laboratory as well as clinical zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first detailed characterization of zzso from zzso zzso and suggests its importance in survival and zzso
