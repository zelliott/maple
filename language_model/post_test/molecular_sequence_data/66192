In zzso cells, four zzso zzso zzso - zzso are localized to zzso zzso zzso and zzso are predominantly localized to sorting and recycling zzso zzso to the zzso network, and zzso to the zzso zzso The unique zzso of zzso may contribute to establishing zzso pH values and zzso zzso in zzso zzso underlying the regulation and targeting of zzso zzso are largely zzso We identified an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso for activated C zzso 1), a zzso scaffold zzso by zzso zzso screening using the zzso C zzso as zzso The zzso C zzso is exposed to the zzso zzso that the interaction is zzso zzso The binding region was further delineated to the central region of the zzso C zzso zzso also bound zzso and zzso but not zzso in zzso zzso association between zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso pH of the recycling zzso was elevated in zzso zzso cells, accompanied by a decrease in the amount of zzso on the cell surface, although the total level of zzso was not significantly zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a role in regulating the distribution of zzso between zzso and the plasma membrane and contributes to maintaining zzso pH of the zzso recycling zzso
