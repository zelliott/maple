A structural model is constructed for the integral membrane zzso sensory zzso I zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The model is built on the template of the zzso zzso zzso The modeling procedure includes sequence zzso a side chain zzso search and simulated zzso by restricted molecular zzso The structure is in general agreement with previous results from zzso experiments, zzso substitution and room and zzso temperature zzso In particular, a zzso near the zzso ring of the zzso zzso is found to be critical in maintaining the proper zzso zzso of the zzso a layer of zzso lying on the zzso side of the zzso pocket is found to zzso the restraints around the zzso region of the zzso affecting the zzso around its 13 zzso 14 bond that are important to the zzso zzso The restraints in these regions are more stringent in zzso than in zzso The tightened restraints are chiefly due to van der zzso zzso where the attractive and repulsive components play zzso zzso zzso zzso account for a majority of the restrictive zzso It is hypothesized that the enhanced barriers due to these restrictions regulate the progress of zzso zzso so that it can couple with the zzso reaction chain in the zzso A possibility is also suggested that zzso changes of the protein provide the signal recognized by the zzso
