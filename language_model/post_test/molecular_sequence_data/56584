zzso chain reaction zzso was used to identify zzso zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso deduced from the highly zzso zzso acid sequences in the zzso domain of known zzso were used for zzso Among 16 clones zzso 13 were identical to known zzso whereas the other three clones were disclosed to zzso novel zzso The expression pattern of one of the three newly identified zzso designated as zzso was further zzso In zzso zzso the zzso message was predominantly expressed in brain, zzso and zzso and was zzso expressed in heart and zzso In human zzso cell lines, the zzso message was zzso expressed in a zzso zzso cell line, zzso and two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso that are dependent on zzso zzso factor or zzso and erythropoietin, zzso The transcript was approximately 8 zzso long and the message level in zzso cells was slightly increased at 24 hours and then slowly declined when treated with zzso zzso for zzso zzso while the message level was rapidly decreased when treated with zzso zzso for zzso zzso These results show that several zzso including three novel ones are expressed in a human zzso cell line and that the particular zzso zzso might be involved in the differentiation process in zzso zzso
