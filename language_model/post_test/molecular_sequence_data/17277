A number of zzso zzso were recovered from coastal sediments in zzso zzso United zzso with standard isolation zzso Most of them were zzso assigned to the zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of their zzso zzso and there appeared to be no difference whether the isolation media contained distilled water or zzso A group of 20 zzso zzso was selected to undergo further zzso zzso zzso Three approaches were used to analyze the diversity of these zzso zzso zzso sequencing, fluorescent amplified zzso length zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence analysis confirmed that all of these zzso should be classified to the zzso zzso and they were analyzed with a group of other zzso zzso zzso sequences available from the zzso Database zzso The relationships of the 20 zzso were observed after zzso zzso and almost identical clusters were obtained with these three zzso This has obvious implications for zzso screening for novel zzso because zzso zzso which is a rapid and reliable zzso zzso method, can be applied as a very useful zzso tool to indicate which environmental zzso have been cultured zzso
