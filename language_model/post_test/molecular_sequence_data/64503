zzso to 2, 5, and zzso of the zzso transformation efficiency were found when zzso zzso carrying zzso insertions in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were used to transform zzso zzso The structures of the zzso integrated into the host zzso by these zzso were analyzed by Southern and sequence zzso The zzso of zzso obtained with the zzso zzso had zzso zzso whereas those obtained with the zzso zzso had truncated right zzso From this analysis, it was concluded that the zzso proteins zzso and zzso are required for full-length zzso integration and that these proteins play a role in protecting the right and left zzso borders, zzso zzso and truncated zzso structures were detected in the majority of the zzso obtained with the zzso zzso indicating that zzso plays a role in correct zzso processing and is required for zzso zzso zzso
