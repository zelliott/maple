zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso elements of the zzso zzso zzso members of which were identified in plants, zzso and zzso The autonomous zzso and zzso zzso zzso elements are mobilized by the single zzso protein zzso by zzso To date zzso zzso were shown to be functional in approximately 20 plant species and have become the most widely used zzso elements for gene tagging and functional zzso approaches in zzso In this chapter we review the biology, regulation, and zzso mechanism of zzso elements in zzso and zzso zzso We discuss the parameters that are known to influence the functionality and zzso efficiency of zzso zzso and need to be considered when designing zzso zzso expression zzso and Ds elements for application in zzso plant zzso
