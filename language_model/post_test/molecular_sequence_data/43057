In our effort to zzso organize and assemble data from zzso zzso libraries, we assign DNA restriction sites collectively to the spots on two-dimensional zzso gel zzso In order to test the efficiency and reliability of such an approach, we have modeled the restriction analysis of zzso libraries with a panel of restriction zzso The work has two zzso In the first, we have chosen 255 proteins from the zzso data base and determined whether or not their coding sequences contain restriction sites for the zzso of our zzso In order to apply a sufficient zzso power we decided to use a relatively large number of zzso zzso with low and high cutting zzso In total, 13 restriction zzso were zzso which could distinguish zzso or zzso different restriction site zzso We have compiled a table in which the absence or presence of restriction sites yields a pattern of zzso and zzso Such a restriction pattern can be read as a zzso zzso The zzso numbers with zzso 13 digits would uniquely assign each of the 255 proteins if the zzso sequences would be truly at zzso As the restriction sites are not randomly distributed, the zzso does not yield a unique zzso The choice of sequences was not random zzso In fact, there are some human zzso sequences which possess the same cut number (the decimal equivalent of the zzso number representing the restriction zzso In spite of this zzso 141 coding sequences could uniquely be distinguished by the above zzso In the second part of the project we have used the above mentioned coding sequences to prepare two-dimensional maps zzso of charge vs zzso of the same kind as one zzso from experimental zzso gels and submitted such a map together with 13 maps of restriction zzso treated populations to a computer image zzso zzso one would expect results zzso zzso zzso to those obtained in the first part of the zzso In the modeled system we were confronted with zzso maps which closely resembled the experimental situation zzso some spots were close together and zzso and instances of incorrect spot detection yielding zzso cut zzso From 255 proteins we were able to assign unequivocally 161 zzso To implement the model in an actual experiment we will perform the zzso with the restriction zzso in zzso and only spots assigned the same cut number upon the two independent treatments will be considered as carrying a valid restriction zzso
