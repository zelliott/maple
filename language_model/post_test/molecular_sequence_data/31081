zzso is a nuclear factor that specifically binds to an zzso element in the zzso zzso In this study the gene zzso zzso has been cloned by direct screening of a zzso zzso library using zzso binding sequence as a zzso The full-length zzso zzso a 345 zzso acid protein with a potential zzso zzso structure and revealed a high degree of zzso to a zzso zzso factor, zzso at the zzso zzso The bacterial fusion protein bound to the zzso zzso as well as the viral zzso core sequences as in the case of zzso zzso zzso activated the human zzso promoter in a zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated the zzso conservation of the zzso gene through evolution and the existence of several other related genes sharing the zzso zzso zzso zzso was normally not zzso but induced by the stimulation with either zzso zzso or zzso Interestingly, zzso was shown to bind to the regulatory regions for various zzso protein genes and several other zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso has a role in regulation not only for the zzso gene but also for several other genes involved in zzso reaction, inflammation and zzso
