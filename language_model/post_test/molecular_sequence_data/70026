zzso zzso grows on methanol as carbon and energy source following spontaneous zzso to a zzso zzso after incubation in media containing zzso Acquisition of ability to grow on methanol zzso with the appearance of a zzso zzso molecular mass 26 zzso which is suggested to substitute for the product of the zzso zzso which is the electron zzso from methanol in related bacteria, but which is absent from zzso zzso zzso leading to growth on zzso as carbon and energy source was not observed despite the presence of in zzso zzso zzso activity in cells grown on zzso Lack of growth on zzso may correlate with the absence of zzso which is the obligatory electron zzso from zzso zzso in other zzso
