The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso gene and the nuclear zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The zzso sequence represents the first example of a zzso zzso gene from this zzso This gene contains seven zzso zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso suggesting the use of the universal genetic zzso This differs from the situation in the zzso of the related zzso zzso in which zzso codes for zzso In addition, a complete absence of zzso triplets may imply the lack of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso possess short zzso and 3' untranslated transcribed sequences and lack a 3' zzso zzso The zzso gene does not require zzso zzso deletion zzso editing, as occurs in zzso zzso to be functional, and no short guide zzso molecules could be zzso by labeling total zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In spite of the differences in zzso usage and the 3' end structures of zzso zzso analysis using the zzso and zzso protein sequences suggests a zzso relationship between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of the zzso which is consistent with the zzso relationship of these groups previously obtained using nuclear zzso zzso zzso
