Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to regulate development of zzso zzso including bone, cartilage, and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso has been studied during development of the zzso zzso but the role of zzso in this context and in the regulation of zzso genes is zzso We used targeted differential display to isolate zzso genes of the zzso family that are expressed at defined stages of zzso zzso These studies were carried out with fetal rat zzso cells that produce zzso tissue in zzso We observed a zzso zzso zzso and cloned the corresponding zzso which represents the rat zzso of zzso Northern zzso analysis and competitive zzso demonstrated that zzso and the zzso zzso genes exhibit similar zzso expression during the zzso period of zzso zzso This expression pattern differs from that of zzso which is found predominantly in zzso zzso Several approaches were pursued to determine functional consequences of zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells decreased zzso promoter activity in transient zzso and conditional expression of zzso in stable cell lines reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso gene zzso zzso promoter deletion analysis and binding of the in zzso translation product of zzso demonstrated that zzso activity was targeted to a single zzso site, located in zzso I zzso to zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso gene zzso However, the zzso of increased zzso expression with progression of zzso differentiation suggests an important role in promoting expression of the mature bone cell zzso
