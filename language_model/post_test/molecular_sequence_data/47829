The zzso protein from influenza A virus is a zzso zzso membrane protein that functions as a zzso zzso To determine the features required for the assembly of this protein into its native zzso state, the protein was prepared by total synthesis using native chemical zzso of unprotected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of synthetic zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso indicated that approximately 40 zzso were in an zzso secondary zzso The zzso of the full-length protein was compared to that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that both the zzso and the full-length protein in zzso zzso existed in a zzso zzso zzso of the association zzso for the two sequences showed the free energy of zzso of the full-length protein was more favorable by approximately 7 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was used as a further probe of the structure of the full-length zzso A zzso segment zzso to the zzso region was found to be highly resistant to zzso by zzso and zzso This region, which we have modeled as an extension of the TM zzso may help to stabilize the zzso zzso
