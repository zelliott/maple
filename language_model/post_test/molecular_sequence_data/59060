The molecular mechanism by which bacterial zzso genes mediate recognition by resistant host plants has been enigmatic for more than a zzso In this paper we provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is recognized inside the plant zzso zzso expression of zzso in pepper leaves, using zzso zzso for gene delivery, results in hypersensitive cell death, specifically on plants carrying the resistance gene zzso In addition, for its zzso recognition, zzso requires nuclear zzso signals that are present in the zzso region of the zzso We propose that zzso is zzso into plant cells via the zzso zzso type III zzso system and that nuclear factors are involved in zzso zzso
