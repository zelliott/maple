zzso is a zzso that specifically removes a zzso zzso zzso from its zzso zzso levels of zzso expression are detected in zzso and in cell lines of zzso zzso zzso are important in host defense against bacterial and viral zzso The zzso zzso of the bacterial cell wall can mimic bacteria and activate zzso to provoke inflammatory zzso Here, we report that zzso strongly activates zzso expression in zzso which is paralleled by changes in zzso protein zzso Two zzso regulatory factor zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter are responsible for the induction of zzso expression by zzso as well as for zzso zzso promoter zzso We have identified two members of the zzso family zzso and zzso that specifically bind to these zzso zzso plays a primary role in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene and zzso zzso a zzso zzso activity to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso treatment increases the amount of zzso in zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso suggests that zzso zzso is a dynamic process and that a critical balance of zzso should be maintained during innate immune zzso
