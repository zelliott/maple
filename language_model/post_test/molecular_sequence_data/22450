zzso zzso zzso is a condition characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported in patients with inflammatory zzso The goal of this study was to investigate whether genetic zzso zzso patients to the development of acquired zzso We report a patient who developed zzso following a zzso zzso zzso He later had an zzso root aneurysm that required surgical zzso zzso evaluation showed inflammation followed by destruction of elastic fibers in both the skin and the zzso zzso analysis showed that the patient was zzso for an inherited zzso zzso zzso zzso and compound zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso indicated abnormal zzso processing of zzso zzso in patient zzso The zzso zzso zzso on the other hand led to increased interaction of zzso and TE and increased deposition of zzso zzso partially rescuing the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso results in elastic fibers susceptible to inflammatory zzso These results suggest that the zzso of acquired zzso involves an underlying genetic zzso and highlight the importance of molecular genetic analysis in patients with idiopathic zzso tissue zzso
