Previous studies have shown that bovine zzso zzso besides zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso which are structurally and functionally very similar to zzso The primary structure of zzso I and II indicates that they are not zzso products of zzso in agreement with independent findings on two zzso genes reported to be present in the bovine zzso which zzso zzso and zzso I and II, zzso A careful zzso on the occurrence of these zzso in various bovine zzso is presented in this paper, based on their isolation with standard zzso techniques and on functional and structural zzso All data indicate that the same zzso found in zzso are also present, besides zzso in zzso such as zzso liver and zzso zzso where they were never found zzso zzso and inhibitor II always zzso
