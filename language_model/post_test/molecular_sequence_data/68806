To determine whether any of the type II collagen zzso are associated with zzso zzso or zzso of the finger zzso in the genetically isolated Finnish zzso 

Two patient zzso with evidence for only primary zzso and a cohort of healthy control subjects were selected from the Helsinki University Central Hospital and the zzso Foundation Hospital in zzso Forty one patients with primary zzso zzso 49 patients with zzso of the finger zzso and 48 control subjects were zzso Two markers of the type II collagen zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were zzso from each zzso 

Four different zzso of the zzso marker were observed and the relative risks associated with the different zzso zzso varied between zzso and zzso among the patients with zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso among the patients with zzso of the finger zzso The zzso zzso detected two different zzso and the associated relative risks were zzso and zzso for the patients with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for the patients with zzso of the finger zzso 

A major zzso zzso of the type II collagen gene as the zzso factor for zzso could be excluded in this zzso A spectrum of zzso associated with different zzso of this gene could not be zzso zzso Further, these two forms of cartilage disease can be caused by gene defects with reduced zzso and the effect of such an zzso is easily masked under the high frequency of normal zzso
