zzso virus 40 zzso DNA was rescued after the fusion of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso monkey cells and zzso and zzso zzso clones were zzso A zzso mouse DNA zzso fused with the rescued zzso DNA, and derived from mouse DNA zzso the single insert of zzso DNA in zzso cells, was zzso zzso of the intact rescued mouse zzso or two zzso fragments of it, into zzso zzso zzso DNA suppressed replication of the zzso in zzso monkey cells, although the plasmids expressed zzso T zzso zzso cells were transformed with zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA with or without fragments of the mouse DNA in zzso Although all of the rat cell lines expressed approximately equal amounts of T zzso and zzso zzso carrying zzso DNA linked to either of the same two replication zzso fragments produced significantly less free zzso DNA after fusion with zzso cells than those transformed by zzso DNA without a cellular insert or with a cellular insert lacking zzso zzso The results suggest that two independent segments of cellular DNA act in zzso to suppress zzso replication in zzso either as a zzso or integrated in zzso zzso
