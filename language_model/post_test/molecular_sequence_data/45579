zzso zzso is a major blood group system in man, which is clinically significant in zzso zzso zzso zzso are carried by an zzso of two major zzso specific zzso the zzso zzso and zzso proteins and the zzso zzso that shared a common predicted structure with 12 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins have been identified zzso and zzso notably in diverse zzso specialized in zzso production and zzso such as zzso liver and zzso zzso studies and experimental evidence have shown that these proteins belong to the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso but another view suggests that zzso proteins might function as CO2 gas zzso Until recently no information on the structure of these proteins were zzso However, in the last two years, new insight has been gained into the structural features of zzso proteins (through the determination of the crystal structures of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso Here, models of the zzso and zzso architecture of human zzso proteins are proposed, based on a refined alignment with and crystal structure of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso This alignment was performed considering zzso structural features, which were revealed through zzso zzso zzso and led to propose alternative predictions for the less zzso regions, particularly in the zzso zzso The zzso models, on which an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso was tentatively zzso were further assessed through the consideration of zzso and zzso data, as well as of zzso and zzso zzso These models highlighted some zzso specific features that have not yet been zzso Among these, are the prediction of some critical zzso which may play a role in the channel function, but also in the stability of the zzso structure and zzso zzso These results provide a basis to further understand the zzso relationships of zzso zzso and the zzso occurring in zzso zzso
