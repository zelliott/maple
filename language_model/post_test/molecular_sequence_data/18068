The zzso zzso zzso zzso are a structurally diverse group of zzso believed to be important in the zzso defense of plants against potential zzso The gene for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 425 has been cloned and zzso The major zzso start is 11 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso and 28 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso The gene contains two zzso and encodes a basic zzso of zzso zzso acids with a 23 zzso acid zzso signal zzso followed by a 43 zzso acid, zzso domain, which is linked by a hinge region to the main structure of the zzso This gene appears to be expressed because the zzso are identical to the coding sequence of a zzso which was zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid sequences from different plants indicates there are at least three classes of these zzso class I, basic zzso with an zzso zzso domain and a highly zzso main zzso class II, zzso similar to the main structure of class I zzso but lacking the zzso zzso and, class III, zzso with zzso sequences different from those of the class I and II zzso The sequences zzso the zzso domain in class I zzso are flanked by zzso zzso imperfect direct repeats suggesting that these zzso arose from a common ancestral gene and were introduced into genes for class I zzso by zzso zzso
