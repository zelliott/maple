zzso virus zzso 5 zzso requires zzso acid on host cells to bind and zzso Other zzso including Aleutian mink disease zzso zzso canine zzso zzso minute virus of mice, and bovine zzso also bind zzso zzso zzso structural zzso may explain this functional zzso The zzso acids required for zzso zzso acid binding map to a site at the zzso twofold axes of the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso does not bind zzso acid, but rather binds zzso zzso zzso at its zzso axes of zzso To explore the zzso relationships among zzso with respect to cell zzso attachment, we determined the structure of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and image reconstruction at a resolution of 16 zzso Surface features common to some zzso namely depressions zzso the fivefold axes and zzso at or surrounding the zzso zzso are preserved in the zzso zzso However, even though there were some similarities, a comparison of the zzso structure with those of zzso and zzso failed to reveal a feature which could account for the zzso acid binding zzso common to all three zzso In contrast, the overall surface zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso A zzso model generated for zzso based on the crystal structure of zzso and constrained by the zzso zzso envelope revealed differences only in surface loop zzso Surprisingly, the surface zzso of zzso and zzso are remarkably similar to that of zzso despite only exhibiting approximately zzso identity in zzso acid zzso Thus, zzso surface features are shared among zzso and may not be unique to their replication zzso zzso whether they require a helper or are zzso Furthermore, specific surface features alone do not explain the zzso in zzso requirements for host cell zzso interactions among zzso
