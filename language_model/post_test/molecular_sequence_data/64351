zzso of protein interaction zzso is required for cellular signaling zzso Here, we show that the zzso protein interaction domain from the cell polarity protein zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to a zzso domain adjacent to the zzso domain, increasing the affinity of the zzso zzso for its zzso zzso by approximately zzso zzso zzso regulation is required for function as zzso disruption of zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso in polarized zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that the free zzso domain has several zzso from the zzso zzso zzso that account for its low zzso zzso zzso results from a zzso zzso transition in the zzso module that causes the zzso to assume a zzso zzso zzso zzso The coupled zzso and zzso architecture of zzso reveals how simple binding zzso can be combined to yield complex zzso
