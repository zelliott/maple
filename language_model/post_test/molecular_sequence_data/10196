zzso induced zzso provides a good model for chronic zzso pulmonary inflammation and zzso In the present study, a specific single zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso and a zzso of zzso was zzso and characterized from the zzso zzso fluid of zzso zzso The same protein was also isolated from both the extract and zzso medium of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso this protein was termed an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso factor zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso by a combination of gel zzso zzso Q zzso exchange, and zzso high performance liquid zzso This zzso displayed a potent zzso zzso activity in zzso The sequence of the first 15 zzso zzso acids was determined and was found to have high sequence zzso with members of the zzso zzso protein family, which includes human cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein from activated mouse zzso
