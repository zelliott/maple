zzso and zzso modification often induce zzso changes and allow the protein to specifically interact with other zzso zzso of zzso and zzso modification at the same zzso site may result in the protein undergoing functional zzso We describe that at zzso zzso zzso of human zzso alternative zzso and zzso modification zzso Yang zzso can be predicted by the zzso zzso We propose here that alternative zzso and zzso modification at zzso in the zzso region, zzso and zzso in the zzso region of two zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso are involved in the differential binding behavior of zzso to the zzso DNA zzso This implies that zzso or zzso modification of the same zzso acid may result in a different binding capacity of the modified zzso In the zzso domain, zzso zzso and zzso are additional zzso Yang sites that could be involved in the zzso of zzso binding zzso
