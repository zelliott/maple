We isolated two zzso clones zzso human proteins which interact with DNA zzso zzso a human zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso by zzso zzso One of these zzso named zzso was a novel protein zzso to the nuclear zzso signal zzso zzso zzso and the other was the known protein zzso which is also a zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso in human cell zzso was zzso with zzso expressed zzso and zzso fused with zzso with zzso zzso zzso confirming the interaction between these proteins and DNA zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso T zzso similar to zzso and zzso In addition, interaction of the putative zzso in DNA zzso zzso with zzso and zzso but not with zzso was confirmed by the zzso zzso
