An zzso zzso was isolated from American lobster gastric zzso The zzso zzso D runs as a single band on zzso displaying zzso activity on a zzso at pH zzso with an zzso point of zzso zzso of the protein in zzso depended on the conditions of the gel zzso zzso treatment by itself was not able to fully unfold the zzso Thus, in zzso the protein appeared to be zzso A few minute of boiling the sample in the presence of zzso was necessary to fully zzso the protein that then run in the gel as a single band of zzso zzso The protein sequence of lobster zzso zzso as deduced from its zzso zzso lacks a zzso zzso and zzso which are characteristic of some of its structural zzso A comparison of zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso showed that most zzso D zzso involved in food zzso lack the zzso loop, whereas all zzso zzso zzso including the American lobster zzso zzso zzso contain the zzso zzso We propose that the absence or presence of this loop may be characteristic of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
