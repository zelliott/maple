Many advanced snakes use zzso teeth associated with a zzso zzso introduce zzso into prey or zzso Various zzso and zzso groups are zzso according to whether their zzso are positioned anterior (for example zzso and zzso or zzso (for example grass zzso in the upper zzso A fundamental controversy in snake evolution is whether or not front and rear zzso share the same evolutionary and zzso zzso zzso this controversy could identify a major evolutionary transition underlying the massive radiation of advanced zzso and the associated zzso zzso Here we examine this issue by visualizing the zzso zzso in the upper jaw of 96 snake zzso covering eight zzso We use the sonic zzso gene as a marker, and zzso reconstruct the development in 41 of the zzso We show that front zzso develop from the zzso end of the upper zzso and are zzso similar in zzso to rear zzso This is consistent with their being zzso In zzso zzso the anterior part of the upper jaw lacks sonic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso from its zzso zzso origin to its adult front zzso with an ancestral zzso position of the front zzso In zzso zzso the zzso develop from an independent zzso dental zzso and retain their zzso zzso In light of our findings, we put forward a new model for the evolution of snake zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso became zzso zzso from the remaining zzso which allowed the zzso teeth to evolve independently and in close association with the zzso zzso becoming highly modified in different zzso This zzso event could have facilitated the massive radiation of advanced snakes in the zzso era, resulting in the spectacular diversity of snakes seen zzso
