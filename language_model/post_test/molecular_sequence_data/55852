In this study, we investigated whether complex zzso influence cell zzso by modulating the activity of zzso zzso Our experimental model was represented by zzso cells, a line of zzso zzso derived from the minimal zzso Morris zzso zzso of the zzso which zzso to zzso coated with fetal calf serum zzso by an zzso zzso being zzso the specific serum protein which sustained cell zzso We found that zzso zzso obtained by zzso complex zzso zzso was accompanied by a reduction of cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso appeared to mediate the effect of zzso depletion on cell zzso In fact, sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was ten times higher in zzso cells compared to control zzso Moreover, growth of zzso zzso cells in media supplemented with complex zzso restored the cell sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor to the same level as that found in control zzso Furthermore, zzso depletion of zzso cells decreased the affinity of zzso receptors for zzso without zzso their number, affinity of zzso receptors was zzso in zzso cells by supplementing their growth media with complex zzso In conclusion, these results support the participation of zzso to cell zzso as zzso of zzso zzso
