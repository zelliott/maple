To assess the potential for development of new classes of pharmacological drugs in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular zzso 

zzso of pharmacological blood pressure zzso Since the discovery of the zzso system by zzso almost 100 years ago, a large number of zzso peptides have been zzso By interaction with such peptides of zzso zzso or zzso origin, blood pressure may be zzso zzso OF THE zzso zzso The success of the zzso converting zzso zzso zzso in hypertension and zzso heart failure is generally attributed to reduced generation of zzso zzso The recent development of specific and highly potent zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso have provided a new opportunity to inhibit the zzso system, and this is currently being explored in zzso zzso In addition, blockade of the first and zzso reaction of the zzso system, zzso of zzso activity, is also a target for the development of zzso zzso However, this development is hampered at present by a zzso increase in active zzso that clinically zzso the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IN zzso zzso zzso zzso The availability of circulating or tissue zzso may be increased by zzso its zzso clearance by zzso inhibitor zzso These agents induce a reduction in blood pressure and zzso effects in animal models, and may become a new class of drugs for the clinical management of patients with hypertension and zzso heart zzso OTHER zzso zzso zzso IN THE zzso OF zzso There are several potential pharmacological targets that may lead to the development of novel zzso agents in the zzso These include the interaction or blockade of zzso zzso zzso of development include zzso zzso zzso antagonists, which block the zzso zzso effect of zzso Y, or zzso antagonists, which block zzso zzso actions at the zzso A zzso zzso The cardiovascular actions of the functional zzso Y inhibitor zzso zzso zzso provide a potential new mechanism for reducing blood pressure in zzso In addition, the recent discovery of small molecular agents with high potency and specificity for the zzso A zzso zzso may also be of value in specific vascular disease zzso 

Future development is likely to provide us with novel drugs based on interactions with zzso peptides that may improve the management of specific cardiovascular disease zzso
