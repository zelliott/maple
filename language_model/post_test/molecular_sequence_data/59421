The zzso part of the zzso protein encompassing two zinc fingers was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with the zzso binding protein zzso of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso binds to the promoter of the zzso gene zzso zzso A of zzso zzso zzso I zzso experiments showed that zzso bound to three sites with high affinity and to one site with low affinity within the first zzso region upstream of the zzso initiation zzso All of the sites contained sequences related to the zzso consensus binding site zzso and are suggested to participate in repression of the zzso gene in response to zzso
