We have recently undertaken a systematic structural analysis of fully protected zzso containing at the zzso and zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso spaced by an zzso zzso zzso The interest for this class of peptides derives from the observation that, on zzso zzso the zzso and zzso sequences have a markedly different retention zzso The zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show different overall zzso attributed to a different three-dimensional structure that also depends on the zzso zzso zzso following preliminary studies in solution, we report here the detailed zzso analysis of the zzso zzso in order to understand the structural features governing the overall zzso of linear fully protected zzso
