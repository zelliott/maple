zzso zzso cells are important in normal zzso and support growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso We have previously described the zzso adherence of a human zzso cell line zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso We have extended these observations to a human zzso cell line zzso and characterized the zzso adherence of zzso and zzso cell lines to human zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso cells were in very close zzso to the zzso but no specific zzso junctions were zzso Under the conditions zzso these zzso express zzso zzso collagen types I and IV, zzso zzso and zzso but no factor zzso zzso In addition, the zzso had receptors for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells do not adhere to zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso by the zzso zzso zzso collagen types I, III, or IV, or zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso do not inhibit attachment of either zzso or zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not inhibit adherence of zzso and zzso cells to zzso In contrast, the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused significant zzso zzso zzso zzso of the adherence of both zzso and zzso cells to normal human zzso zzso These data zzso zzso that zzso to which zzso cells adhere are specialized zzso zzso zzso that the membrane interactions between zzso and zzso cells and zzso involve close zzso of cell zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso that the zzso adherence between zzso and zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso does not involve the zzso recognition sequence of the zzso family, the B2 zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso proteins zzso and zzso that zzso may at least be partially responsible for zzso adherence between human zzso and zzso and zzso zzso
