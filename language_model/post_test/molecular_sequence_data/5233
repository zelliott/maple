Whether zzso communication results when group A zzso interact with their target cells is zzso Here, we report that upon contact with cultured human zzso cells, both whole zzso and zzso zzso surface zzso zzso activate zzso cell protein zzso zzso as well as protein zzso C, thus regulating the zzso of cellular zzso zzso a major surface protein of group A zzso has both zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities that may relate to early stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induce a similar protein zzso pattern with the de zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein found in the zzso fraction of the zzso zzso However, this zzso required the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis identified the zzso protein as nuclear core zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso reacted with the zzso protein by Western zzso suggesting that the binding of zzso to these zzso cells elicits a novel signaling zzso that ultimately leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso plays a key role in this zzso Treatment of zzso cells with protein zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso invasion of zzso zzso zzso these data indicated that zzso zzso plays a critical role in bacterial entry into the host zzso To identify the membrane zzso that elicits these signaling events, we found that zzso bound specifically to zzso and zzso membrane proteins in a direct zzso zzso These findings clearly suggest that zzso plays an important role in cellular communication between zzso and zzso cells that may be important in host cell gene transcription, and hence in the zzso of zzso zzso
