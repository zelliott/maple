zzso zzso coli strain zzso carries multiple zzso for zzso zzso The regulatory protein zzso of P zzso has previously been implicated in potential zzso zzso The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to zzso the translated sequences share zzso zzso In this study we investigated the role of zzso and zzso in regulation of the zzso zzso By using gel mobility shift zzso we showed that zzso binds to sequences in both the zzso and zzso zzso in a somewhat different manner than zzso The results of both in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso tests indicated that zzso could function in an zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso and zzso can form zzso and that these complexes can repress expression of the zzso zzso The effect of zzso on expression of type 1 zzso was also zzso Taken together, the results that we present expand our knowledge about a regulatory network for different zzso gene systems in zzso zzso coli and suggest a hierarchy for expression of the zzso zzso
