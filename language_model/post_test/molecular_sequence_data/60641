We have altered the N zzso of zzso f by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso We have replaced the zzso zzso zzso located immediately downstream of the processing site zzso by a zzso zzso is the N zzso of the mature protein and serves as the sixth zzso zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso zzso accumulated different forms of zzso f and assembled them into the zzso zzso zzso The strain was able to grow zzso Our results therefore contradict a previous report zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that a zzso considered to be identical to the zzso described here, prevented zzso zzso zzso A comparative functional characterization of zzso with zzso a zzso processing zzso in which we had replaced the processing site by a zzso sequence zzso revealed that both zzso accumulate high spin zzso zzso with an unusual orientation of the zzso and low spin zzso f with an zzso peak at zzso zzso Both zzso have significantly lower zzso zzso than wild type zzso zzso We attribute the high spin form to zzso zzso f and the low spin form to zzso forms of zzso f that were zzso at a position different from the regular zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso displayed a small population of functional zzso zzso presumably zzso at zzso with characteristics close to those of wild type zzso zzso The latter form would account for zzso zzso turnover and zzso electron transfer that sustain zzso growth of zzso
