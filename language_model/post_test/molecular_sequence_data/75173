The zzso 4 region of the zzso coli zzso contains genes zzso and zzso that zzso proteins involved in zzso A zzso We have determined the sequence of zzso base pairs of DNA upstream of the zzso zzso This zzso of DNA contains the complete coding sequence for the zzso zzso gene product and an upstream open reading frame capable of zzso a zzso protein zzso In addition there appears to be an additional open reading frame zzso immediately upstream of zzso The initiation zzso for zzso is a zzso zzso and the start zzso for zzso is apparently a zzso zzso The start and stop zzso overlap between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso This overlap is suggestive of zzso zzso and argues that the genes are zzso zzso et zzso zzso Crowell, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1987) and zzso and McHenry zzso zzso and zzso McHenry, zzso zzso zzso 1987) have demonstrated that there are three similarly overlapping coding regions downstream of zzso including zzso suggesting the existence of a complex zzso of at least seven zzso zzso zzso
