The zzso of zzso zzso isolated from zzso cell walls, in zzso solution was investigated by small angle zzso scattering zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso coupled with zzso delivery zzso techniques in comparison with zzso It was shown that both zzso exhibit a rigid zzso zzso in zzso solution by zzso zzso The mass per unit length zzso and radius zzso of rod cross section of zzso were measured to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso while those of zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso scattering technique, the average zzso number of zzso is 9, while that of zzso is around zzso From the comparison of the zzso and R of the respective rod cross sections as well as their zzso number data, it is concluded that zzso is composed of triple zzso which tend to zzso as triplets in solution, whereas zzso is composed of a single triple zzso The zzso number distribution of zzso was found to range from 1 to about 25 determined by zzso From the observation of a zzso ring type of peak in the zzso scattering cross section of zzso by zzso the existence of a small amount of ordered clusters of zzso can be zzso The zzso zzso of these ordered zzso clusters is consistent with the radius of the individual zzso rods forming a zzso zzso These results indicate that higher zzso forms of zzso containing up to 8 triple zzso behave as ordered zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso zzso formed by rigid rods stacking together side by zzso We propose a molecular structural model for zzso zzso
