zzso protein zzso type 4 zzso belongs to a family of zzso acid and zzso protein zzso In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of the human zzso zzso The gene spans about 10 zzso and includes one untranslated and eight translated zzso The zzso zzso region of the gene is rich in G and C zzso and lacks zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region reveals potential binding sites for zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso Two zzso initiation sites were mapped by zzso protection analysis, one to 54 and the other to 84 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso cell hybrid panel maps zzso to zzso 16, and comparison of the zzso gene structure with that of zzso and zzso suggests that zzso is more closely related to zzso than zzso
