zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are three proteins involved in the synthesis and zzso of zzso The expression patterns of these three genes were examined in zzso zzso by whole mount in zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso first appeared in the zzso zzso layer zzso at the zzso stage and was progressively up regulated during zzso As development zzso zzso was expressed in the mature zzso during the zzso stage and in the liver at 48 zzso zzso showed a similar expression pattern to that of zzso during zzso It was first detected in the center of the zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso At the bud stage, its expression shifted to the zzso zzso was also zzso expressed in the mature zzso from 16 zzso to 24 zzso and became strongly expressed in the liver and in zzso cells of the gut at 48 zzso zzso was initially zzso expressed from the zzso to the early zzso zzso it was then strongly expressed in all the zzso till 30 zzso and in the gut of 48 zzso zzso However, zzso transcripts also appeared in the central nervous system during the zzso stage, but not in the zzso the zzso or the zzso Our data reveal for the first time distinct and unique patterns of expression of the zzso metabolism genes zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
