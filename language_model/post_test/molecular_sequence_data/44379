zzso carrier protein zzso in a number of zzso pathways in zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The first four pathways require the zzso prosthetic group, zzso to assemble an zzso chain or to transfer an zzso group from the zzso linkage to a specific zzso By contrast, the zzso prosthetic group is not required for zzso zzso zzso and the function of zzso carrier protein in this zzso scheme is currently zzso We have combined zzso and molecular biological approaches to investigate zzso of zzso carrier protein that are important for zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of the first 6 zzso acids from zzso carrier protein or chemical synthesis of a partial zzso encompassing zzso 26 to 50 resulted in losses of secondary and zzso structure and zzso loss of activity in the membrane zzso reaction of zzso zzso zzso These zzso fragments, however, inhibited the action of intact zzso carrier protein in the zzso zzso This suggests a role for the loop regions of the zzso coli zzso carrier protein and the need for at least two regions of the protein for participation in the zzso zzso We have zzso zzso carrier protein from eight species of zzso (including representatives from all four zzso and characterized the proteins as active or zzso in the membrane zzso zzso The complete or partial zzso acid sequences of these zzso carrier proteins were zzso The results of zzso zzso to change zzso acids zzso in active, and altered in zzso zzso carrier proteins suggest the importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The first 3 of these zzso define a face of zzso carrier protein that includes the beginning of the loop region, zzso 16 to zzso Additionally, screening for membrane zzso activity in zzso from bacterial species that had zzso carrier proteins that were active with zzso coli zzso revealed the presence of zzso activity only in the species most closely related to zzso zzso Thus, it seems likely that only bacteria from the zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso by the mechanism found in zzso zzso
