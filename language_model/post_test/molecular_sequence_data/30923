zzso mapping of the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso B zzso gene zzso by Northern zzso zzso zzso and primer extension analyses indicated that two overlapping transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso originated from the same strand and were transcribed from left to right between coordinates zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was located approximately 30 bases downstream from a probable zzso zzso The coding region of the zzso gene zzso was reconstructed from two zzso using zzso zzso and inserted into zzso virus by zzso zzso zzso infected with the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso in the zzso and on the cell surface by zzso using an zzso zzso horse serum and zzso zzso zzso On Western zzso bands of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were identified in zzso zzso cells, by both zzso zzso zzso and the zzso horse zzso These were similar in Mr to bands identified by these zzso in zzso zzso Mice vaccinated with the zzso virus produced zzso which recognized proteins of the same Mr as zzso zzso on Western zzso but did not have in zzso zzso zzso
