zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein has been zzso We have also identified and cloned zzso that encodes a novel zzso of zzso zzso carrying a zzso highly basic zzso The point of zzso zzso to a junction between two zzso in the human zzso zzso The human zzso flanked by these zzso does not zzso a zzso corresponding zzso which is unique to the zzso The overall sequence identity between zzso and human zzso is zzso and zzso zzso contains sequence motifs previously described in the sequence of human zzso Through expression in zzso cells, we show that zzso zzso and zzso are active zzso both capable of zzso zzso growth factor binding protein zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is dramatically enhanced by the addition of zzso whereas zzso of zzso is slightly inhibited by zzso as previously established with human zzso Surprisingly, however, quantitative analyses demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso very slowly compared to zzso even though its ability to cleave zzso is unaffected by the presence of the zzso By zzso analysis, we find that both zzso are expressed in several zzso The level of zzso in the zzso zzso does not exceed the levels of other zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso pregnancy serum is not zzso This is in striking contrast to the increase seen in human pregnancy serum, and the expression of zzso in the human zzso which exceeds other zzso at least zzso Interestingly, the position of the insert of zzso within the zzso domain, lies in close proximity to the zzso zzso which in human zzso forms a zzso bond with the zzso of zzso major basic protein zzso zzso functions as a zzso inhibitor in the zzso complex, but whether any zzso parallel on regulation of zzso activity can be drawn between the insert of zzso and the linkage to zzso is not zzso zzso these data support the development of the mouse as a model zzso for the study of zzso which must take into account the differences between the mouse and the zzso
