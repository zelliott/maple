zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in tight junction zzso formation in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso B, and zzso are expressed in rat zzso but only rat zzso is present in polarized zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells to determine the role of zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso short hairpin zzso resulted in approximately 50% zzso of zzso and substantial loss of zzso zzso as measured by the absence of zzso zzso formed by adjacent cells and sealed by zzso zzso When zzso zzso human zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells, zzso polarity was zzso In contrast, expression of zzso that either lacked its zzso motif zzso or zzso a point zzso zzso did not complement, indicating that multiple sites within zzso zzso tail are required for the development of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in normal zzso cells unexpectedly blocked zzso maturation to the zzso zzso as did expression of three zzso zzso with single point zzso in putative zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was without effect, and the zzso zzso only partially blocked zzso Our results show that zzso is essential for the development of polarity in cultured zzso cells via its possible zzso and recruitment of relevant zzso proteins and that zzso polarity is achieved within a narrow range of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso domain in zzso cells are linked, unlike simple zzso
