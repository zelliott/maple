In order to define the zzso binding site and the zzso relationship of tumor necrosis factor zzso single zzso acid zzso were made by zzso zzso at selected zzso of human tumor necrosis factor, using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were compared to the wild type zzso in zzso using crude bacterial zzso for protein yield, zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso activity, and in zzso zzso zzso All zzso which did not form zzso zzso also showed little zzso activity or zzso binding zzso activity, indicating that zzso formation is obligatory for zzso zzso Most zzso of internal zzso yielded no zzso zzso while most zzso of surface zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso at surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded zzso zzso with good activities, except zzso zzso which may cause zzso changes in the zzso zzso This suggested that these zzso are near the zzso binding zzso zzso at other strictly zzso internal zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso form zzso zzso with little zzso These zzso may indirectly affect the zzso binding site by forming zzso with zzso zzso zzso of surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affect zzso binding and zzso activity but not zzso formation, suggesting that these zzso are involved directly in zzso zzso The fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located on the opposite sides of a zzso are clustered at the zzso grooves of zzso zzso supports the current notion that zzso zzso binding sites are zzso and are located at the three zzso zzso However, our finding that zzso which is outside the groove, can also be involved directly in zzso binding suggested that the zzso binding sites of zzso may not be confined to the zzso zzso but extended to include additional surface zzso
