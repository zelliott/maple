We have cloned and zzso the gene for the 180 zzso zzso of the a zzso from zzso zzso The protein shows high similarity to the 180 zzso zzso from other zzso Comparative expression analysis for the transcript, protein and zzso activity suggests that control occurs mainly at the level of zzso In zzso analyses of the zzso suggest that high levels of the transcript are zzso in the zzso and deposited zzso in the zzso zzso of the 180 zzso zzso in whole zzso shows that its location is mainly zzso however, zzso of the protein can be seen to occur during zzso zzso of the cell zzso
