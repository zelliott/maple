zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso which are present in all zzso of life, catalyze the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso formed during DNA replication and zzso How zzso have evolved to zzso cleave zzso structures is of great interest especially in light of studies wherein mice carrying a zzso deficient zzso were predisposed to zzso zzso studies of zzso from zzso to human have shown that, although they share similar zzso the zzso of higher organisms contain a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso When presented with zzso zzso having a zzso zzso and zzso zzso display enhanced reaction rates and zzso site zzso To investigate the role of this interaction, a kinetic study of human zzso zzso employing well defined DNA zzso was zzso The presence of a zzso on zzso reduced zzso and increased zzso and single turnover rates of zzso zzso at near zzso salt zzso zzso and zzso reactions were also zzso by the presence of a zzso and the absence of a zzso from a zzso zzso was more zzso to zzso activity than removal of the zzso or introduction of a hairpin into the zzso zzso zzso reactions were predominantly zzso by product release regardless of the presence or absence of a zzso Furthermore, the identity of the stable zzso product species was deduced from zzso studies to be the zzso zzso Together the results indicate that the presence of a zzso is the critical feature for efficient zzso zzso recognition and zzso
