The ability to predict properties such as zzso binding and zzso into zzso is an important and zzso asset in the design of new zzso peptides zzso zzso to predict those properties are described here, which make use of calculations performed with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso effects can be estimated in a way that provides zzso close approximations in many zzso Finally, an estimate of the probability of zzso is also zzso These procedures are illustrated by comparing the calculations with experiments on a few zzso
