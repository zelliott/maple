To better define zzso interactions at a zzso origin, the domain of zzso virus 40 zzso large T zzso that specifically interacts with the zzso origin has been zzso and its binding to DNA has been zzso Evidence is presented that the affinity of the zzso T zzso zzso domain for the zzso origin is comparable to that of the full-length T zzso Furthermore, stable binding of the T zzso zzso domain to the zzso origin requires pairs of zzso recognition sites separated by approximately one turn of a DNA double zzso and positioned in a head-to-head zzso Although two pairs of zzso are present in the zzso origin, zzso and band shift experiments indicate that binding is limited to zzso formation on a single pair of zzso Finally, it is demonstrated that the T zzso zzso domain interacts poorly with zzso zzso
