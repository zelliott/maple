zzso G zzso was zzso from the cultured zzso of zzso zzso zzso and was found to consist of two distinct zzso with apparent molecular weights of 24,000 zzso and 60,000 zzso The partial zzso zzso acid sequences of the alpha and beta zzso were determined with a protein gas phase zzso and a zzso zzso corresponding to the partial zzso acid sequence of the alpha zzso was zzso An zzso coli zzso having the zzso G zzso gene was isolated from an zzso zzso gene library by zzso with the zzso zzso The resulting positive clone was further screened by the zzso zzso overlay zzso zzso coli carrying a zzso designated zzso was found to produce zzso G zzso in the zzso This zzso had an zzso pair DNA zzso inserted in the zzso site of zzso
