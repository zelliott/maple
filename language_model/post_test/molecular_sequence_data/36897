The gene zzso chick zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso has been isolated, characterized and expressed in zzso zzso The structural gene spans zzso zzso and contains 11 zzso and 10 zzso Several of the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso including each of the predicted zzso zzso zzso boundaries zzso the second, putative zzso zzso domain are zzso between zzso and other zzso zzso zzso The putative promoter region zzso to the first zzso displays high zzso content and zzso zzso and zzso consensus zzso zzso of the zzso gene is evident prior to full zzso cortical zzso zzso are abundant in cells consistent with zzso zzso as revealed by in zzso zzso zzso of zzso kidney cell cultures with zzso zzso or zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso binding with the pharmacological specificity displayed by both zzso and zzso zzso However, expression of the same zzso in zzso zzso fails to yield zzso zzso zzso
