The zzso factor zzso an orphan member of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso is highly expressed during T cell zzso zzso suggesting a possible role for zzso in negative zzso We examined this by generating two sets of transgenic zzso In one set of mice, a zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and the other in which zzso zzso protein is zzso expressed in developing zzso We report that zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso T cell development and inhibited zzso negative selection in zzso cell zzso transgenic zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso protein induced zzso in developing zzso resulting in a decreased number of zzso and mature T zzso Together, these data support a role for zzso in the downstream signaling events in zzso negative zzso
