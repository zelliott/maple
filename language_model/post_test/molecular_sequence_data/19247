zzso zzso is essential in plant zzso biology and is often associated with zzso zzso sets of floral traits, such as color, zzso shape, or zzso zzso zzso by zzso is often considered a key factor in floral evolution and plant zzso Our aim is the identification and characterization of the genetic changes that caused the evolution of divergent zzso syndromes in closely related plant zzso We focus on zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor that is a major zzso of flower color variation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of sequence variation in zzso in wild zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso arose at least five times zzso DNA sequence analysis was zzso by functional zzso for zzso preference using genetic zzso and zzso These results show that zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes in a single gene cause a major shift in zzso biology and support the notion that the adaptation of a flowering plant to a new zzso type may involve a limited number of genes of large zzso Gene identification and analysis of molecular evolution in combination with behavioral and ecological studies can ultimately unravel the evolutionary zzso of zzso zzso
