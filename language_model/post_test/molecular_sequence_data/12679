A zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso This zzso was zzso and found to contain an open reading frame of zzso zzso giving a predicted protein zzso M, of zzso The sequence shows a high degree of identity with other zzso zzso zzso with zzso implicated in the binding of zzso and metal zzso zzso zzso However, there are significant differences in the putative zzso interface and zzso binding regions which may account for the unusual zzso structure and regulatory properties of the zzso zzso zzso
