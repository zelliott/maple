The crystal structures of zzso and zzso were determined to resolutions of zzso and zzso by zzso anomalous zzso and zzso anomalous zzso respectively, using the zzso zzso pipeline of the Joint Center for zzso zzso zzso as part of the zzso zzso zzso Initiative zzso These proteins are the first structural representatives of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both structures adopt a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fold zzso The biological unit of both proteins is a zzso and analysis of zzso indicates that the zzso interface zzso are highly zzso The zzso of the critical regions for zzso appears to be dependent on pH or salt zzso suggesting that this protein might be subject to environmental zzso zzso similarities to zzso and zzso analysis suggest a function in zzso zzso
