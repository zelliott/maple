The newly discovered zzso of human zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso preparation originally designed to be specific for zzso zzso As this zzso is currently the only suitable probe for zzso we sought to characterize the binding of the two zzso We determined that the gamma zzso does not recognize the native form of zzso However, with zzso zzso of zzso we found that 1) the zzso zzso zzso differs somewhat from that of classic rat brain zzso but probably only to the degree of the zzso zzso species difference; 2) the previously reported zzso bands of zzso represent a single protein with zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso present in the zzso pool bind to two separate sites within the zzso zzso 4) access to one binding site is zzso zzso even after protein zzso 5) zzso modification of zzso does not significantly affect the total amount of gamma zzso that it can zzso but 6) does significantly affect the rate of zzso binding to one zzso This investigation defines the appropriate experimental use of our zzso and the significance of these findings for the future study and cloning of zzso is zzso
