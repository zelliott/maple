We have identified a new member of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is highly related to bone zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso encodes a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of approximately zzso The zzso zzso contains a potential signal sequence for zzso a putative zzso zzso processing site, and a zzso domain with considerable zzso to other known members of the zzso zzso In the mature zzso domain zzso is more zzso to zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso than to any other previously identified zzso family zzso zzso also shows significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso in the zzso region of the zzso Based on these sequence zzso zzso and zzso define a new zzso within the larger zzso zzso By Northern analysis, zzso zzso was detected primarily in zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain and to a lesser extent in liver and zzso In addition, zzso zzso was present in both zzso and adult bone samples, with higher levels being detected in zzso than in long zzso These results suggest that zzso may play multiple roles in regulating cell differentiation events, including those involved in skeletal zzso zzso was mapped to the zzso region of mouse zzso 14 close to a region known to contain a spontaneous zzso zzso that is associated with a zzso zzso
