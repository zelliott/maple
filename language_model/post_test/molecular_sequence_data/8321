zzso the nitrogen regulatory protein of zzso zzso contains a single zzso zzso motif followed immediately by a highly basic zzso The zzso domain was expressed to zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso In order to test the putative zzso ability of zzso the zzso promoter region of the nitrate zzso zzso gene cluster zzso of zzso was zzso Our results show that zzso is a zzso protein and binds to the zzso promoter regions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso the first two zzso in zzso zzso Three of the four zzso zzso sites contained two zzso core zzso In one of the recognition sites for zzso one zzso motif was replaced by zzso The two zzso elements showed all possible zzso zzso zzso and zzso and were separated by between 4 and 27 zzso zzso analysis showed that all three zzso in both of the zzso core sequences and the single zzso zzso in each of the complementary zzso sequences were involved in the binding of zzso Moreover, loss of zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso elements also affect binding of zzso as their loss causes reduced zzso
