zzso peptides produced by predatory species of zzso marine zzso are potent zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso channels involved in synaptic zzso We determined the zzso solution structure of the smallest known zzso zzso a 12 zzso acid zzso that binds specifically to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the structure was based on a total of 80 upper distance constraints and 31 zzso angle constraints resulting in 20 representative zzso with an average zzso zzso of zzso A from the mean structure for the backbone atoms zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The structure of zzso is characterized by two compact zzso defined by two zzso bridges, which form distinct zzso separated by a deep zzso Two short zzso regions in the first loop are followed by a zzso zzso in the zzso The two zzso bridges and Ala 9 form a rigid zzso core, zzso the other zzso acid side chains toward the zzso zzso of the three-dimensional structure of zzso to those of the larger, 16 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific for zzso zzso remarkable similarity in local backbone zzso and relative zzso surface zzso The core scaffold is zzso in all five zzso whereas the zzso in zzso positions are highly zzso The second zzso region, and the specific zzso acids that the zzso exposes to zzso may be particularly important for binding and zzso This comparative analysis provides a three-dimensional structural basis for interpretation of zzso data and zzso relationships for zzso as well other zzso zzso
