zzso coli zzso processing, and zzso of human zzso beta zzso zzso fused to the signal zzso of zzso coli zzso or zzso protein were zzso With fusion to either signal zzso high-level expression was observed and the products accumulated to about zzso of total cell zzso In the fusion to zzso leader zzso more than 50% of the product has the zzso signal zzso removed zzso The majority of the processed material is not released by zzso zzso On the other hand, very little of the material from the fusion to zzso has the zzso signal zzso zzso Use of the host with a zzso in zzso or zzso variation of temperature for cell growth, and zzso of the zzso acid zzso around the zzso site do not facilitate processing of the zzso signal zzso These results suggest that some component in the zzso signal zzso interacting with the zzso beta zzso is interfering with the processing of the signal zzso
