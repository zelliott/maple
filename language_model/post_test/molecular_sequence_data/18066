A zzso gene zzso promoter containing zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start site has been shown previously to be active specifically in the zzso of transgenic tobacco zzso To investigate the region required for this zzso activity, deletions of the zzso promoter were constructed and placed upstream of the zzso zzso reporter zzso When these deletions were tested in transgenic tobacco plants, zzso zzso activity, which reached a peak between 15 and 19 zzso was observed for promoters extending from zzso to zzso Interestingly, the 174 zzso promoter lacked the complete 15 zzso consensus sequence found in the same position in all zzso genes so far zzso With the next shorter promoter in the deletion series (79 zzso which just included the zzso and zzso zzso negligible zzso activity was observed in zzso The results demonstrated that 174 zzso upstream of the zzso start site are sufficient for zzso and temporally regulated activity of the zzso promoter in zzso At most, zzso enhanced activity was observed with additional zzso sequences up to zzso
