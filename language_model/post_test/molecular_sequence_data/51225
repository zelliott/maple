A zzso zzso barley zzso protein that is a major zzso in zzso asthma disease, as previously shown by both in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso tests, has been identified as a zzso zzso member of the zzso family of zzso of zzso from zzso A zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The deduced sequence for the mature zzso which is 132 zzso long, is identical in its zzso end to the 20 zzso acid partial sequence previously determined from the zzso zzso and fully confirms that it is a member of the zzso family of cereal zzso zzso analysis of zzso addition lines using the insert in the zzso zzso clone as a probe, has led to the location of the zzso gene zzso in barley zzso 2, while another related member of this protein family, the barley zzso zzso inhibitor zzso gene zzso has been located in zzso zzso zzso is the first member of this inhibitor family in zzso to be assigned to zzso group 2, thus extending the zzso of genes in the family to five out of the seven zzso groups of zzso in wheat and barley zzso 2, 3, 4, 6 and zzso
