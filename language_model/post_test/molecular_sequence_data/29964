The zzso coli zzso gene encodes both the zzso and gamma zzso of DNA zzso III zzso in one reading zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the shorter gamma share zzso zzso zzso of a potential zzso zzso signal located at zzso zzso without changing the zzso acid sequence of the zzso product, eliminated zzso synthesis of the gamma zzso suggesting that the reading frame is shifted at that sequence and gamma is terminated by a nonsense zzso located in the zzso frame 3 zzso downstream of the zzso This seems to be the first known case of a zzso which is used, along with the termination zzso in the zzso frame, to terminate a zzso within a reading zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso the site at which a zzso fusion protein was zzso in zzso zzso had no effect on gamma formation in zzso suggesting that zzso observed in zzso is not the mechanism of gamma formation in zzso
