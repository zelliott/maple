Animals and plants carry recognition systems to sense bacterial zzso zzso perception in zzso involves zzso a zzso zzso zzso We surveyed the early zzso response of zzso cell cultures and zzso within 60 zzso of treatment with zzso a zzso corresponding to the most zzso domain of zzso Using zzso zzso approximately zzso of zzso genes displayed transcript level changes in zzso zzso suspension cultures and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes mostly zzso signaling zzso such as zzso factors, protein zzso and proteins that regulate protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes were also zzso in zzso zzso treated with zzso This suggests that many zzso genes are zzso regulated by rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso tobacco zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso full-length sequences were used to search for their zzso zzso zzso We identified either single or multiple putative zzso for 17 zzso zzso For 13 of these zzso zzso at least one zzso zzso was induced in zzso zzso suspension cells and zzso This result revealed a substantial overlap between the zzso zzso response and the tobacco zzso zzso defense zzso We also compared zzso gene sets and genes induced in zzso or zzso interactions upon different zzso zzso treatments, and zzso that zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso the zzso defense zzso
