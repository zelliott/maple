zzso of the zzso water channel zzso zzso assemble into square zzso and mediate zzso water transport across the zzso zzso The zzso gene expresses two zzso zzso Only the shorter zzso zzso assembles into square zzso while the longer zzso zzso interferes with array formation, presumably due to the additional 22 zzso zzso To understand why the zzso of zzso interferes with array formation, we constructed a series of zzso deletion zzso and examined their ability to form square zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells using zzso freeze fracture replica zzso zzso with deletions of less than zzso zzso zzso did not form square zzso and showed dispersed zzso labels against zzso zzso whereas more deletions led to the formation of square zzso labeled with zzso Furthermore, zzso substitution of the two zzso zzso at the position 13 and 17 in the zzso of zzso also resulted in the square array zzso zzso analysis and zzso labeling of zzso zzso cells revealed that the two zzso zzso of zzso are zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso is the reason for the inability of zzso to form square zzso
