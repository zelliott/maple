Changes in the expression and zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso receptors may be critical in determining the zzso action of zzso in pig zzso zzso In this study, a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and cloned from pig zzso zzso This isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso bases coding for a protein of 362 zzso acids with seven potential zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of this isolate was zzso identical to the zzso zzso acid sequence of other species including zzso cattle and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the presence of an zzso message of about 5 zzso in zzso from pig zzso zzso Relatively weak zzso zzso expression was detected on day 4 and day 7 of the zzso zzso The expression was greater zzso zzso zzso on days 10, 13 and 15 than on days 4 and zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso for zzso was expressed predominantly in the zzso large zzso zzso of cell, although there was some expression in small zzso cells, with zzso appearance of zzso small zzso zzso of zzso signals of zzso was observed in zzso tissue at all stages zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is expressed in pig zzso zzso throughout the zzso cycle and that zzso of the zzso zzso occurs when the zzso zzso becomes sensitive to zzso zzso zzso targets of zzso appear to be primarily large zzso cells in this zzso
