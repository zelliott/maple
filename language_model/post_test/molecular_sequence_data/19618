A real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was developed for detecting and zzso zzso coli in water samples from agricultural zzso The zzso included zzso of DNA extraction and zzso from water samples, and zzso amplification conditions using newly designed zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso the internal transcribed zzso region zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso using a pure culture of zzso coli with known quantities spiked into zzso agricultural water zzso The zzso zzso was capable of a minimum zzso limit of 10 zzso of zzso coli in the spiked agricultural water zzso A total of 121 surface water samples from three agricultural zzso across Canada were zzso and results were compared with conventional zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed significantly higher numbers of zzso coli in water samples than the zzso zzso in each agricultural zzso The new zzso zzso can facilitate the zzso of zzso coli in a single water sample in zzso 3 zzso including melt curve analysis, across a range of agricultural water quality zzso
