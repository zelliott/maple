To determine if occupancy of zzso pockets in zzso proteins by volatile zzso molecules can zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso of a zzso bundle zzso able to form higher zzso were studied with zzso zzso hydrogen exchange and zzso zzso shifted the zzso zzso towards the zzso only in a zzso predicted to create sufficient volume in the zzso zzso Other zzso at this zzso predicted to create a too small or too polar pocket, were unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso interactions is a novel and potentially zzso zzso basis for some zzso zzso
