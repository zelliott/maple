The zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso fatty acids for a variety of cellular processes including zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso The molecular mechanisms that govern the zzso of these compounds in zzso zzso have not been zzso We report the characterization of zzso a gene that encodes a putative zzso zzso fatty acid transport protein zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso that are zzso identical and zzso with similar chemical properties as compared with the fatty acid transport protein zzso described in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell 79, zzso suggesting a similar zzso zzso of zzso results in 1) an impaired growth in zzso medium containing 25 zzso zzso and 500 zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 2) a marked decrease in the zzso of the fluorescent zzso fatty acid analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 3) a reduced rate of zzso zzso incorporation into zzso and 4) a zzso decrease in the rates of zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso is involved in zzso fatty acid zzso and may represent a zzso fatty acid transport zzso
