zzso A13 zzso is believed to be the original founder gene of the zzso zzso zzso A family, and it has acquired an zzso expression associated with a highly differentiated zzso transport zzso zzso characterization of this zzso in a range of zzso species was undertaken to assess coding region zzso gene organization, zzso linkage, and zzso relationships relevant to its zzso role in the zzso evolution of the zzso gene zzso zzso diagnostic features peculiar to this zzso include an alternate zzso containing a zzso zzso an elevated basic zzso acid content with zzso expansion in the zzso region, and the conservation of zzso core zzso zzso specific to zzso A13 zzso The 12 coding zzso zzso the zzso human zzso gene were deduced from zzso clone sequencing, whereas internal repetitive elements and neighboring genes in zzso zzso were identified by zzso analysis of the draft sequence from the human zzso zzso A unique zzso zzso pattern in the zzso A13 gene was zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA and determined to be the most distinct of all zzso zzso The putative promoter region was identified by zzso zzso of potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso A13 zzso was used to map the gene to an zzso linkage group in mouse zzso 15 (between zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso permitted its zzso to linkage group zzso Comparative analysis of zzso A13 from nine species traced this zzso zzso history and assessed coding region variation, whereas zzso analysis showed it to be the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis estimated the gene age and divergence zzso The unique, zzso aspects of zzso A13 primary structure, gene organization, and genetic maps identify it as the probable common zzso of all zzso zzso beginning with the sequential zzso to zzso A7 and A11 approximately 700 zzso before the emergence of zzso
