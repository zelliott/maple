The rapid growth of different kinds of biological information allows a good opportunity to analyze the zzso characteristics in zzso regulatory zzso Data ranging from kinds of zzso zzso gene zzso protein structure, and expression profile of different organisms can reveal the inner zzso relationship of zzso zzso and other related zzso In return, these zzso characteristics can help us determine zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene functions, highlight zzso acid zzso with zzso significance, and identify regulated genes in the zzso zzso zzso examples in this field, although at their starting stage, have zzso Here we focus on recent progress in zzso zzso research from a zzso zzso
