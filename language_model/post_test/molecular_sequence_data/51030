The zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of a number of human tumors, including childhood zzso and adult small cell lung zzso We have isolated and characterized complementary DNA clones derived from a zzso unit, zzso located on the opposite DNA strand to zzso with extensive overlap existing between the zzso ends of the two zzso zzso The zzso zzso which can zzso a zzso acid zzso is expressed during fetal development, as well as in tumor cell lines containing amplified zzso zzso where it is expressed at very high zzso Although other examples of zzso zzso zzso genes exist, zzso and zzso are unique in that they appear to be zzso in tumor cell lines under zzso growth conditions and in response to the zzso agent zzso zzso This zzso suggests that their protein products may be functionally interrelated during normal development and zzso
