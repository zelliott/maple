In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso production, catalyzing the zzso of zzso to zzso We report here the zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and the cloning and expression of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso library of zzso zzso DNA was screened by plaque zzso using zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso acid sequence obtained from the zzso zzso zzso DNA from positive plaques was analyzed by Southern zzso zzso mapping and subsequent zzso of DNA fragments zzso to the zzso localized the gene within an approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso with a molecular weight of approximately 28,000 corresponding to that of the zzso zzso zzso was observed in both Western blots zzso and zzso analysis of zzso extracts of zzso coli harboring the zzso zzso Although the expression of the gene is tightly regulated in zzso zzso it was well expressed in zzso coli, although from a promoter sequence of zzso zzso
