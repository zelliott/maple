We isolated a new mouse gene that is highly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso This zzso zzso showed a significant sequence zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso zzso encodes 1,100 zzso acids and has zzso identity with zzso protein over three zzso The zzso protein contains an zzso zzso zzso a zzso DNA binding domain, a zzso zzso and a zzso and zzso region at its zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso of the zzso recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 zzso The serum also detected a zzso protein that seems to be a mouse zzso of human zzso zzso of cell extract with the zzso against the mouse zzso also brought down a zzso protein that could be recognized by an zzso raised against human zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso protein associates with a mouse zzso The zzso protein is expressed about three times higher in zzso than in peripheral zzso The expression of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in a zzso cell line, zzso reduced the expression level of the zzso zzso and decreased the zzso cell death induced by zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is involved in the zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso This implicates that the zzso may play an important regulatory role during T cell development in zzso
