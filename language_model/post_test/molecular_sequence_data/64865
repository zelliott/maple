The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso contain 350 zzso acids that are highly zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso within the zzso domain zzso zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso has been readily zzso and characterized as a zzso protein in zzso in intact cells, and in zzso This report describes for the first time the zzso zzso and characterization of zzso The expression of active zzso was zzso from zzso and insect cells, but not zzso Active zzso zzso was zzso expressed and zzso to zzso from zzso cells with a zzso increase in specific activity and a zzso recovery after sequential zzso and zzso zzso zzso The specific activity of pure zzso was zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso as zzso zzso Physical characterization showed zzso had a lower apparent molecular weight and zzso zzso than zzso suggesting differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso requiring basic zzso acids at zzso and zzso However, zzso generally exhibited a lower zzso and zzso than zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited a distinct zzso specificity showing zzso by homogeneous preparations of zzso and zzso but not by pure zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso and zzso exhibit differences in structure and function in zzso supporting the hypothesis that functionally different zzso zzso could diversify and/or fine-tune zzso signal zzso downstream of zzso zzso
