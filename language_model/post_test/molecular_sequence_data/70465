In zzso zzso cell development depends on the gene zzso cells missing zzso zzso activates the expression of other zzso factors such as pointed and zzso which control subsequent zzso zzso In order to better understand zzso cell zzso we have screened for genes whose expression in zzso cells depends on the activity of zzso Using an zzso trap approach, we have identified zzso as such a zzso zzso is expressed in most lateral zzso zzso cells throughout zzso zzso lacking zzso function have an normal overall zzso but fail to zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a severe zzso cell differentiation zzso zzso zzso cells fail to properly zzso zzso zzso tracts and do not form the normal zzso cell zzso resulting in a disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated following an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which show impaired locomotor zzso zzso encodes the first two known zzso members of the family of Regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso known to interact with the alpha zzso of zzso zzso specifically interacts with the zzso zzso zzso the interaction is not confined to the zzso zzso This interaction and the zzso of zzso and zzso suggests a function of zzso zzso for zzso cell zzso
