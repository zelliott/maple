There are no simple, direct methods to reliably distinguish zzso zzso 1 zzso disease viruses zzso from their attenuated zzso The present study was an attempt to apply zzso chain reaction zzso to develop a rapid and sensitive zzso for the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were chosen to flank the zzso tandem direct repeats in the zzso 1 zzso zzso The zzso reaction was specific for zzso 1 zzso amplifying fragments corresponding to one to three copies of the tandem repeats present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso was observed when the DNA from an attenuated zzso was zzso Use of the zzso technique allowed the detection of two copies of the zzso repeat in the DNA extracted from zzso zzso removed from two zzso No DNA was amplified from the DNA extracted from zzso induced by either an avian zzso virus zzso or zzso virus zzso zzso zzso
