zzso and zzso 2, closely related members of the zzso gene family degrade many zzso components of the zzso zzso and may play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso Because we use zzso cultures of rabbit and human zzso as model systems to study these zzso we compared their expression in zzso from both zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso culture medium often appears as a protein zzso while human zzso is a single protein zzso zzso selection with a zzso clone for rabbit zzso and in zzso translation of zzso from rabbit zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals two translation products, zzso and zzso as measured by zzso zzso gel zzso In zzso zzso and translation of a zzso zzso zzso for rabbit zzso gives a single protein product, zzso MR zzso We do not yet know whether the rabbit zzso represents two distinct gene products or whether it results from zzso processing of a single transcript or zzso To study human zzso we cloned a zzso from a zzso zzso cell zzso library and we used it to isolate genes for zzso and a related zzso zzso Both genes are contained on approximately 14 zzso pairs of zzso With an zzso containing zzso of the human zzso zzso clone as a specific probe in Northern zzso analysis, we demonstrate the differential expression of zzso and zzso 2 in zzso zzso cells, human zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter DNA linked to the bacterial gene zzso zzso zzso zzso can be induced by zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso Since the genes for zzso and zzso 2 are so zzso and since mechanisms regulating their expression appear to be distinctive, identification of these mechanisms in both rabbits and humans will increase our understanding of the relative role of these zzso in normal and disease zzso
