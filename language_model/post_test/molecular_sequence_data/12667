The products of the zzso genes in zzso are zzso factors that are necessary to impose regional identity along the zzso axis of the developing zzso However, the target genes under zzso regulation that control this zzso process are largely zzso We have zzso an zzso method to clone target genes of the zzso protein zzso We present here the characterization of zzso zzso one of the target genes isolated using this zzso The spatial and zzso expression of the zzso gene in the developing visceral zzso zzso of the zzso and the central nervous system zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is consistent with the idea that zzso is a zzso zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso while zzso zzso shows positive zzso In the zzso zzso is regulated positively by zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso CNN predicts a novel structural protein with three zzso zzso motifs and several zzso zzso exhibiting limited zzso to the rod portion of zzso zzso results demonstrate that the zzso zzso protein is localized to the zzso and the zzso pattern is coupled to the nuclear and zzso zzso cycles of zzso In addition, evidence suggests that the expression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso with the zzso function of zzso in that zzso zzso the formation of the second zzso zzso The zzso zzso of CNN and the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso suggest that this protein may participate in zzso zzso assembly and the mechanics of zzso through an interaction with zzso either directly or zzso
