zzso senile plaques are a zzso hallmark in the brain of Alzheimer's disease zzso Such plaques consist of, among many other constituents, zzso beta A4 zzso zzso This zzso is derived from an zzso precursor protein zzso by irregular zzso processing and is considered to be involved in the development of Alzheimer's zzso To study possible interactions of brain proteins with beta A4 zzso or other fragments of zzso beta A4 zzso and beta A4 zzso extended to the zzso of zzso were zzso produced as fusion proteins termed zzso and zzso zzso Using Amy and zzso affinity zzso a zzso protein from rat brain was isolated that bound tightly to zzso but not to Amy, thus indicating an interaction of the protein with the zzso of zzso This zzso protein was identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso but not to Amy was confirmed by gel zzso Although zzso slightly reduced the zzso of zzso the same reduction was observed in the presence of zzso These findings suggest that the interaction of the zzso domain of zzso with zzso is unlikely to influence directly the rate of zzso but may serve another zzso
