zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso sharing structural and functional similarities with zzso zzso and other zzso zzso that zzso the common zzso chain zzso While zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after the initial interaction with the specific, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso Through zzso experiments with zzso soluble zzso zzso we recently demonstrated that zzso drives the formation of a zzso zzso complex with a defined zzso and composed of two zzso two zzso alpha and two zzso zzso Here, we apply the same strategy to study the assembly in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We present evidence that both the zzso and the specific binding chain undergo zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, although zzso and zzso are able to bind independently to the zzso zzso they never form zzso but only zzso We propose that zzso assembles a zzso zzso complex composed of two zzso two zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso and present a model of the zzso interaction of these molecules based on similarities with the zzso zzso zzso
