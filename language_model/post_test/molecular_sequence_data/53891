As a part of our studies to zzso the zzso significance of free zzso in zzso or growing plant cells, we first demonstrate that two kinds of free zzso already occur at an early stage of seed zzso In this report, we used the developing zzso zzso seeds as a model plant, since we have already revealed a functional feature of the zzso zzso and structural features of zzso linked to storage zzso in the developing seeds zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 62, zzso Kimura, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 64, zzso The structures of free zzso which were determined by a combination of zzso sequential zzso zzso partial zzso and two zzso sugar chain map, fell into two zzso One dominant species is a zzso type structure having one zzso zzso at the reducing end zzso The concentration of this type of free zzso (as the zzso zzso is about zzso zzso in 1 g fresh zzso The detailed structural analysis revealed that the zzso type structures have a common core unit; zzso zzso The other minor species of free zzso is the plant complex type structure having an zzso unit at the reducing end zzso The concentration of this type of free zzso (as the zzso zzso was about 75 zzso in 1 g fresh zzso
