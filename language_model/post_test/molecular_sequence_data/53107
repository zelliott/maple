A zzso zzso gene coding for a putative zzso zzso binding protein was cloned and its full-length sequence zzso Database searches revealed zzso identity with zzso zzso a putative sugar zzso protein from zzso tuberculosis strain zzso The deduced protein product showed high sequence similarity to zzso proteins from a variety of bacterial species, including zzso zzso Analysis of zzso database sequences from zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences with other zzso zzso has allowed us to deduce a unique zzso arrangement of the genes involved in the zzso of zzso in members of the zzso tuberculosis complex and zzso zzso
