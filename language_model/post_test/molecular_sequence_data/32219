zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed the existence of a large number of putative zzso genes compared with the numbers in other zzso However, the zzso roles of zzso zzso zzso are still zzso In this study, we zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in which an zzso zzso was coupled to a zzso with a consensus sequence of a putative zzso zzso group characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso in human zzso cells was much weaker zzso zzso zzso than that of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso required zzso zzso zzso to activate zzso gene zzso in zzso cells, although a zzso amount of zzso was needed to exert activity similar to that of zzso in the zzso zzso recognition of zzso was zzso zzso by zzso but not by zzso or zzso although the activity was still zzso In addition, zzso did not antagonize zzso recognition in human zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Thus, these results suggest that there is preferential selective recognition of zzso zzso due to the magnitude of an affinity with zzso and zzso and the roles of increased zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso in evasion of zzso zzso
