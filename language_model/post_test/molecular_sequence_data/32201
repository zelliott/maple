To determine whether specific zzso of zzso are transcribed in patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso who have risk zzso in the zzso zzso donor zzso site at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blood zzso cells were obtained from zzso patients and healthy controls from Argentina, Spain, and Germany and from trio families from Spain and zzso A reporter zzso was used to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in relation to the zzso of functional zzso was analyzed using quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene was zzso 

zzso of complementary DNA from individuals with different zzso showed 4 basic zzso transcribed from all zzso regions zzso suggesting no preferential zzso zzso based on zzso zzso Analysis of translation efficiency showed that zzso zzso was the most efficient in initiating protein zzso We identified a novel zzso zzso that defines the pattern of expression of zzso of zzso The zzso consists of 4 repeats in zzso 6 affecting the protein interaction zzso The zzso zzso in the risk zzso with the high expression zzso of a zzso site zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso donor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated with levels of zzso in cells zzso with zzso The zzso most strongly associated with zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a proxy of the risk zzso but does not appear to be zzso 

None of the functional zzso investigated in this study is strongly associated with zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso donor zzso site, and its functional importance appears to be zzso Our results suggest that there may be other functional zzso yet to be identified, in zzso We did not observe evidence of zzso interaction between the functional zzso
