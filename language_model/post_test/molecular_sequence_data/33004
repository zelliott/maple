The tomato zzso of zzso zzso produces zzso zzso toxin and causes zzso stem zzso on zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso toxin zzso resides on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found only in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso and another zzso zzso both of which reside on the zzso in the tomato zzso zzso were compared to those of tomato zzso strains collected zzso This revealed that the sequences of both zzso genes were identical among five zzso zzso tomato zzso strains having different geographical zzso On the other hand, the sequences of other genes located on zzso other than the zzso are not identical in each strain, indicating that the origin of the zzso might be different from that of other zzso in the tomato zzso zzso zzso and restriction zzso length zzso analyses of the zzso zzso strains also indicated that the zzso in the tomato zzso strains were zzso although the genetic backgrounds of the strains zzso A hybrid strain between two different zzso was shown to harbor the zzso derived from both parental strains with an expanded range of zzso indicating that zzso can be transmitted from one strain to another and zzso maintained in the new zzso We propose a hypothesis zzso the ability to produce zzso toxin and to zzso a plant could potentially be distributed among zzso zzso strains by horizontal transfer of an entire zzso zzso This could provide a possible mechanism by which new pathogens arise in zzso
