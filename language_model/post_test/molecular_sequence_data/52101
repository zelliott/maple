The zzso zzso sites of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso precursor zzso and the fusion protein of respiratory zzso virus zzso show a sequence zzso To study this zzso two synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Human serum samples from zzso or zzso collections recognized the appropriate zzso in zzso or zzso zzso No zzso towards the zzso zzso could be monitored in both serum zzso In contrast, zzso zzso raised against both peptides demonstrate a high degree of zzso These data indicate that the high specificity of the zzso zzso may be a result of strong zzso restrictions at the zzso zzso site of both zzso Moreover, these observations are important for diagnostic zzso zzso peptides are a valuable tool for zzso zzso zzso Our data provide information concerning the specificity of zzso interaction on a highly zzso zzso zzso
