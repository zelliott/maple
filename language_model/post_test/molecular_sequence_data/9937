To identify a zzso complex zzso bound by zzso syndrome zzso zzso 

zzso from a patient with secondary SS and zzso zzso was used as a probe to isolate a complementary DNA zzso insert from a zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein was zzso by the human zzso serum and immune rabbit zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the immune rabbit zzso recognized a protein of 97 zzso zzso suggesting that the isolated clone contained a partial zzso The zzso upstream sequence was obtained by rapid amplification of the zzso zzso The complete zzso contained zzso zzso zzso a protein with a calculated Mr of 88 zzso zzso to zzso were found in 12 zzso of 60 zzso known to have zzso zzso and the majority of these zzso (8 of 12, or zzso were from patients who had secondary zzso 

zzso is a unique zzso complex zzso that appears to be a target of SS zzso
