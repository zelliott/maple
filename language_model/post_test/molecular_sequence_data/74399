zzso electron zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso water channels can assemble in cell plasma zzso in zzso zzso of particles zzso We investigated the zzso and dynamics of zzso assembly in zzso by tracking single zzso molecules labeled with quantum dots at an engineered external zzso In several zzso cell types, including primary zzso cultures, the long zzso zzso form of zzso diffused zzso with diffusion zzso approximately 5 zzso zzso zzso covering approximately 5 zzso in 5 zzso The short zzso zzso form of zzso which by zzso was found to form zzso was relatively zzso moving only approximately zzso zzso in 5 zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso did not affect zzso zzso but deletion of its zzso zzso density zzso zzso zzso binding domain increased its range by approximately twofold over zzso zzso analysis of short-range zzso diffusion within zzso indicated a zzso potential, with a restoring force of approximately zzso zzso These and additional experiments indicated that 1) zzso and zzso zzso do not zzso in zzso 2) zzso can be zzso directly by total internal reflection zzso zzso and 3) zzso are relatively zzso zzso zzso that do not require zzso or zzso interactions for zzso Our zzso are the first to zzso zzso in live zzso
