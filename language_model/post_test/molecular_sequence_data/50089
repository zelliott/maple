zzso in the zzso gene result in both zzso and Becker muscular zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is complicated by the large size of the zzso which consists of 79 zzso and 8 promoters spread over zzso million base pairs of zzso zzso zzso of one or more zzso account for zzso of cases of zzso and zzso and a multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso the most widely available method of zzso zzso approximately zzso of zzso zzso of point zzso and small zzso zzso has remained zzso We report the development of a method that allows direct sequence analysis of the zzso gene in a zzso accurate, and economical zzso This same method, termed zzso zzso condition zzso zzso sequencing, is zzso to other genes and should allow the development of widely available zzso for any number of large, zzso zzso
