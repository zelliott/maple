A series of synthetic peptides derived from proteins zzso by open reading frames 2 and 3 zzso and zzso of the zzso E virus was used in an zzso zzso to determine the zzso of zzso in these zzso Five peptides spanning almost the entire zzso protein sequence and 12 peptides from the zzso protein were zzso zzso samples collected from outbreaks in three different regions of the world zzso Kenya, and zzso were analyzed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the peptides was accomplished with the use of serum samples obtained from Middle zzso Four of 5 peptides from the zzso protein and 4 of 12 peptides from the zzso protein specifically reacted with zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso representing zzso zzso were used for the analysis of serum samples from outbreaks in Kenya and zzso The data indicate that these synthetic peptides may be used to develop a diagnostic test to detect zzso to the zzso E zzso
