zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso with zzso replaced by zzso and zzso respectively, have been produced by zzso DNA zzso A synthetic gene for zzso was fused to the coding sequence for the signal zzso of the outer membrane protein A zzso of zzso coli in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was used to transform zzso zzso Upon induction of gene zzso zzso and the zzso was expressed and zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso was carried out by zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso acid analysis and Western zzso analysis further confirmed the identities of the zzso zzso activities for zzso and zzso proteins were measured in both zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso The zzso zzso has specific activities identical with that of zzso zzso from mouse zzso zzso while both zzso have reduced specific activities in both zzso The data demonstrate the importance of the highly zzso zzso zzso in zzso for full biological zzso
