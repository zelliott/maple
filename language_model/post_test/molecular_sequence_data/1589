zzso zzso were injected with a zzso zzso suspension and zzso randomly selected zzso fragments generated by suppression zzso zzso zzso were zzso A total of 71 zzso clones corresponding to 25 genes were found to have enhanced zzso of which eight are found for the first time in zzso The most abundant gene in the zzso library was zzso zzso zzso clearly indicating this zzso inhibitor in the zzso A number of genes zzso signaling zzso such as zzso nuclear protein zzso growth factor zzso bound protein zzso zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso binding protein and zzso zzso bound protein were found for the first time in the shrimp, and they may be involved in the regulation of the host defense against the injected zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as genes associated with zzso zzso which may be necessary for zzso and zzso were also expressed at a higher level after the zzso These results may facilitate the understanding of shrimp immune zzso
