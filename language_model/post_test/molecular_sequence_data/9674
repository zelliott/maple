zzso islands are zzso clusters of zzso acquired zzso genes that are often found at zzso zzso The zzso zzso locus of zzso coli has served as the site of integration of two distinct zzso islands which are responsible for converting benign strains into zzso and zzso Because zzso genes are targeted to the zzso locus of zzso we investigated the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso for the presence of zzso acquired zzso At this site, we identified a 17 zzso DNA segment that is both unique to zzso and necessary for zzso This segment harbors a zzso zzso that is required for zzso survival and growth in low zzso zzso The zzso locus is regulated by the zzso zzso system, a major regulator of zzso functions present in both zzso and zzso bacterial zzso zzso our experiments indicate that the ability to replicate in low zzso environments is necessary for zzso zzso and suggest that a similar mechanism is responsible for the dissemination and acquisition of zzso islands in enteric zzso
