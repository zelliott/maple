Evolution of the domain zzso the zzso variable region of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso envelope zzso gene was analyzed in relation to route of virus challenge, virus load, and zzso zzso zzso zzso during primary infection of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso In this model system animals are initially infected with multiple viruses as evidenced by the presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso that could be resolved by using a zzso tracking zzso zzso Overlapping zzso of the multiple zzso were established in each zzso There was no selection for the establishment of specific zzso in comparing zzso and zzso zzso at week 2 zzso suggesting that no zzso selection occurred at the zzso zzso There was an initial period of significant stability of the zzso zzso zzso challenged zzso displayed subsequent zzso diversification significantly earlier than zzso challenged zzso and well past the initial resolution of zzso The time when zzso zzso reached a threshold zzso of 100 was significantly correlated with the timing of zzso diversification, even though zzso to the zzso protein could be detected much zzso The time when zzso reached a zzso of 400 was significantly correlated with virus load late in zzso These results show that the route of infection affects the timing of zzso diversification and that this diversification is correlated with the maturation of a specific zzso zzso However, prior zzso capable of zzso an zzso zzso zzso response did not accelerate zzso zzso This result suggests that diversification of the zzso zzso zzso region is the result of a zzso zzso zzso
