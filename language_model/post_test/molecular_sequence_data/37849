In liver and zzso the terminal step in zzso is zzso by zzso To examine the effect of the zzso signal zzso zzso on zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion genes were zzso zzso into either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of an expression zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso markedly zzso zzso fusion gene zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso promoter revealed that multiple regions are required for this zzso response in both the zzso and zzso cell zzso A sequence in the zzso promoter that resembles a zzso response element is required for the full zzso response in both zzso and zzso zzso However, in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, a zzso nuclear zzso zzso binding site was critical for the full induction of zzso expression by zzso zzso this zzso motif to that for the zzso zzso factor zzso reduces the zzso response in zzso cells to the same degree as deleting the zzso zzso However, zzso of this zzso construct with zzso proteins zzso the zzso binding domain zzso to the coding sequence for zzso zzso zzso or zzso completely restored the zzso zzso Thus, we zzso that, in zzso cells, zzso is acting as an accessory factor to enhance zzso signaling through the zzso response element by altering zzso promoter zzso or accessibility rather than specifically affecting some component of the zzso signal zzso zzso
