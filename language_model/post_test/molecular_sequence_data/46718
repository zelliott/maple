We report the isolation, zzso and pattern of gene expression of members of the zzso zzso class 1 zzso gene family from zzso zzso analysis and mapping of the rice zzso revealed that all of the rice zzso genes that we have isolated have one or two direct zzso in zzso Of the zzso genes that we tested, all exhibited expression in a restricted region of the zzso that defines the position at which the shoot zzso zzso zzso would eventually zzso prior to visible organ zzso Several distinct spatial and zzso expression patterns were observed for the different genes in this zzso After shoot formation, the expression patterns of these zzso genes were variable in the region of the zzso These results suggest that the rice zzso class 1 zzso genes function zzso to establish the SAM before shoot formation and that after shoot formation, their functions zzso
