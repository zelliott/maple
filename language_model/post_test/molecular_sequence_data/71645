zzso expression of the zzso gene is tightly regulated during zzso We have isolated and zzso the zzso regulatory region of human zzso zzso extension and zzso protection mapping revealed that zzso is initiated from a single start site downstream of a zzso motif in human brain and peripheral zzso zzso dissection of the zzso zzso region, which had been fused to a zzso reporter gene and zzso expressed in zzso zzso and zzso cells, indicated that the upstream region of zzso contains multiple positive and negative zzso regulatory zzso While the zzso promoter is likely to be driven by two zzso boxes located at zzso positions zzso and zzso a cluster of regulatory elements acting as a strong zzso was detected between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of human and zzso sequences revealed more than zzso identity in this zzso A zzso zzso repeat sequence and a zzso substitution are located 337 zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site, zzso zzso systematic screening for length variations in 225 unrelated individuals of a Caucasian population showed a zzso distribution of multiple zzso containing between 13 and 30 repeat zzso Although the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso lower zzso efficiency on the zzso promoter, a regulatory impact of the zzso on zzso expression related to brain plasticity and function remains to be zzso
