The maturation of zzso is a zzso process in which the activities of at least seven proteins are zzso The last step consists of the zzso zzso of the precursor of the large zzso after the zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso acid sequence requirements for the zzso zzso involved in the zzso processing of zzso the large zzso of the zzso 3 from zzso coli, were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso site showed that zzso still occurred when chemically similar zzso acids were zzso zzso was zzso however, in a zzso in which the zzso at the zzso side was replaced by a zzso zzso zzso of the precursor from the zzso end rendered zzso amenable to maturation even when two-thirds of the extension were removed but abolished zzso upon further deletion of a cluster of six basic zzso zzso A construct in which the zzso extension from the large zzso of the zzso 2 was fused to the mature part of the large zzso of zzso 3 was neither processed by zzso nor by zzso the zzso specific for the large zzso of zzso zzso The maturation zzso therefore, exhibits a relaxed sequence constraint in recognition of its zzso site and does not require the entire zzso zzso The results point to an interaction of the zzso with some domain of the large zzso rendering a zzso amenable to recognition by the zzso
