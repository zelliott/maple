The recently identified gene zzso encodes two diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the large zzso zzso family and is an zzso product of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso expressed zzso product of developing zzso zzso and zzso zzso Little is known about the expression of zzso gene products in other zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing the zzso cell zzso zzso expression was therefore initially assessed by zzso and zzso As a complementary approach, we developed a zzso mouse model, zzso in which mice express a fusion protein containing the first 69 zzso of zzso followed by enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso as a marker of zzso zzso zzso from both approaches are consistent, with preferential zzso expression in zzso major and minor zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Evidence also indicates that individual zzso cells of minor zzso and zzso zzso produce another zzso zzso in addition to zzso We further find tissue expression of full-length zzso zzso which zzso for zzso and are restricted to zzso zzso and all zzso zzso
