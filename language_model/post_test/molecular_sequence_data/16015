The zzso of some human breast zzso is well zzso However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the growth stimulation of these zzso by zzso are still poorly zzso With the hope of zzso these mechanisms, we have recently cloned and studied the zzso relationship of the human zzso and zzso zzso and also undertaken a study aimed at characterizing genes whose expression is controlled by zzso in zzso breast zzso We review here our findings concerning one of these genes and its expression products, the zzso zzso We discuss also whether a systematic determination of zzso gene expression in breast cancer zzso could be useful to establish a new zzso zzso of these zzso which may be useful to improve the diagnosis of zzso zzso
