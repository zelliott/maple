An overview of efforts to induce zzso zzso in order to develop an effective vaccine against AIDS is zzso The principal zzso zzso zzso on the zzso envelope is zzso zzso zzso and the induction of zzso zzso by synthetic peptides representing zzso are zzso The use of a cocktail of different peptides representing the zzso sequences of the majority of zzso zzso as well as the construction of hybrid zzso containing zzso of several viral zzso could overcome the problems related to zzso zzso A different approach based on the possibility of inducing a type of zzso immunity is also zzso a cellular clone zzso obtained in our laboratory from zzso cells infected with zzso of cultured zzso from an zzso patient, does not release viral particles despite the presence of a full-length zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells are fully resistant against zzso with any zzso or zzso zzso We are now attempting to reproduce the zzso viral interference by transferring the zzso zzso of the clone into zzso cells in order to render these cells resistant to zzso zzso
