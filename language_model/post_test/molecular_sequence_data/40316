zzso relationships among zzso have received little attention but are likely to be important zzso of the zzso structure, and dynamics of microbial zzso Many species of the zzso zzso are predators of other zzso but their zzso range is poorly zzso To better understand the predatory capabilities of zzso in nature, we analyzed the zzso performance of numerous zzso zzso across 12 diverse species of zzso All zzso zzso could zzso most potential prey species to effectively fuel colony expansion, although one species hindered zzso swarming relative to a control treatment with no growth zzso zzso strains varied significantly in their relative performance across prey types, but most variation in predatory performance was determined by prey type, with zzso prey species supporting more zzso growth than zzso zzso There was evidence for specialized zzso performance in some zzso zzso Such specialization may reduce resource competition among zzso strains in natural zzso The broad prey range of the zzso zzso coupled with its ubiquity in the soil suggests that zzso are likely to have very important ecological and evolutionary effects on many species of soil zzso
