zzso of zzso by sequencing has been a challenge because of a zzso deletion in zzso 2 in half of the zzso Furthermore, 19 of the 28 zzso cannot be identified on basis of zzso 2 alone, but need additional zzso zzso With the sequencing strategy presented here the complete zzso zzso are zzso zzso enabling identification of all zzso zzso by zzso typing zzso zzso zzso were amplified and zzso zzso the combined sequences were used for automated zzso zzso The method was validated by typing 21 individuals with all possible different zzso group zzso In addition 26 quality control samples were correctly typed by this zzso To determine the zzso zzso 155 unrelated Dutch Caucasian individuals were zzso zzso In total 15 known and two new zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were the most frequent zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso method presented here is an improvement compared to already existing protocols in that the complete zzso sequence is obtained for all coding zzso using identical zzso chain reaction zzso Furthermore, all zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso assignment and reducing the number of amplification zzso
