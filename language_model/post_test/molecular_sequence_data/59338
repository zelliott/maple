Type 1 von zzso disease zzso characterized by reduced levels of plasma von zzso factor zzso is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in zzso zzso of zzso is incomplete, and expression of the bleeding zzso is highly zzso In addition, plasma zzso levels vary widely among normal zzso To identify genes that influence zzso level, we analyzed a genetic cross between zzso and zzso two strains of mice that exhibit a zzso difference in plasma zzso zzso DNA samples from zzso progeny demonstrating either extremely high or extremely low plasma zzso levels were pooled and zzso for 41 markers spanning the zzso zzso A novel locus accounting for zzso of the total zzso in zzso level was mapped to zzso mouse zzso 11, which is distinct from the zzso zzso locus on zzso zzso We designated this locus zzso for zzso of zzso Additional zzso of as many as zzso zzso established a high resolution genetic map with gene order zzso zzso The zzso candidate zzso between zzso and zzso is approximately zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that a single dominant gene accounts for the low zzso zzso of zzso mice in crosses with several other zzso The pattern of inheritance suggests a zzso zzso in a unique component of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the human zzso for zzso may have relevance for a subset of type 1 zzso cases and may define an important genetic factor zzso zzso and expression of zzso at the zzso zzso
