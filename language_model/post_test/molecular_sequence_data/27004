A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample from a zzso field in zzso Province, South Korea, and was characterized zzso by using a zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso zzso belongs to the family zzso and is related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso supporting the affiliation of strain zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso values between strain zzso zzso and its closest zzso zzso were below zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests allowed zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso zzso from recognized species of the zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
