By defining the functional zzso in a zzso zzso syndrome zzso we show that the third zzso domain zzso of the muscle zzso zzso zzso the speed and efficiency of gating of its zzso The clinical zzso of this zzso results from the zzso zzso in zzso of the alpha zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso their zzso and causes zzso brief zzso single-channel zzso zzso analysis of engineered alpha zzso receptors demonstrated a zzso effect on channel zzso with zzso slow opening and rapid closing zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso contributions of alpha zzso to channel zzso Thus, we demonstrate a functional role for the zzso domain as a key component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
