We investigated the use of zzso zzso designed to zzso zzso within nuclear DNA to amplify potentially variable regions such as zzso or zzso zzso from a wide range of zzso We then explored various approaches to zzso zzso variation in these zzso zzso zzso designed to amplify regions within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes gave clean zzso in diverse zzso zzso and in birds, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso products generally, but not always, confirmed that the correct locus had been zzso Several primer sets produced smaller size fragments consistent with preferential amplification of zzso zzso this was confirmed by sequencing seal and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with randomly selected zzso recognizing zzso detected variation in some cases but not in zzso In zzso combinations with either low zzso seal zzso zzso or high zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity it was more efficient to sequence a small number of zzso related individuals zzso one per geographic zzso and from these data to identify zzso or potentially zzso restriction zzso for zzso zzso We conclude that for studies of zzso variation, the optimal approach is to use a battery of zzso for initial zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso select those that give clean zzso and sequence one sample from each population to zzso confirm gene identity, zzso estimate the amount of variation and, zzso search for diagnostic restriction zzso This will allow determination of the most efficient approach for a large-scale zzso
