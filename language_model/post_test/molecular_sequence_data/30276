zzso is an abundant DNA binding protein in the zzso zzso zzso The protein binds to specific sequences in both zzso elements and the upstream regions of a large number of genes and is likely to play an important role in zzso cell zzso To get insight into the relative strength of the various zzso binding sites within the zzso zzso we have determined zzso rates for several zzso complexes and found them to vary over a zzso zzso Strong binding sites for zzso are present in the upstream zzso sequences of the gene zzso the 40 zzso zzso II of the zzso c zzso the gene zzso zzso protein zzso and in the zzso of the zzso zzso The binding site in the zzso region is of intermediate zzso All strong binding sites conform to the sequence zzso zzso zzso interference experiments and studies with zzso binding sites indicate that critical bases for zzso recognition are within the two elements of the consensus DNA recognition zzso zzso with the DNA binding zzso of zzso and zzso can also be detected in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting evolutionary conservation of at least the respective zzso zzso in both zzso
