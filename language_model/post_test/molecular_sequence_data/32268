Human prostate and colon zzso zzso also known as zzso is an zzso prostate tissue and prostate cancer cells specifically expressed novel zzso The increased expression of zzso gene appears to promote prostate cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To clone and investigate the expression and regulation elements of zzso gene may provide insight into the function of zzso and develop a new promoter that targets therapeutic genes to the zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso The goal of the present study is cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso that contain various fragments of the zzso zzso region were zzso into human prostate cancer cells for promoter zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis identified the zzso zzso promoter region was required for the zzso zzso promoter zzso two zzso suppression and a positive regulatory region were zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso of the zzso gene retained the characteristic of prostate zzso expression and exhibited higher zzso activity than zzso zzso promoter in the medium supplemented with zzso zzso An zzso response element zzso was located in between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region relative to the translation initiation zzso Thus, our studies not only provide molecular basis of zzso zzso regulation, but also define a new regulatory sequence that may be used to restrict expression of therapeutic genes to prostate cancer in the prostate cancer gene zzso
