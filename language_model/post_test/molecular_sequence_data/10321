A novel zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso was isolated by differential display zzso and zzso zzso coded for a putative zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, including the zzso and reconstruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso are widely distributed in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurred from the zzso stage and its level increased during zzso maintained throughout zzso maturation to zzso stage and then decreased in post zzso zzso In zzso stage, zzso zzso was distributed zzso and in adult, occurred predominantly in zzso and zzso We assume that zzso zzso may have its function in zzso and in early phase of zzso whose function may be related to transport mechanism of small molecular weight substances like metal zzso from zzso to the function of its zzso in other zzso
