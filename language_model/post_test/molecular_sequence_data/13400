We have previously shown using gene targeting that zzso is essential for the development of zzso and zzso lineages during fetal liver zzso We now show that zzso is required for the maturation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the differentiation of zzso cells into zzso The role of zzso in regulating target zzso thought to be critical in the development of zzso and zzso has been zzso Early genes such as zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso zzso and differentiated zzso zzso zzso However, the expression of genes associated with terminal zzso differentiation zzso zzso and zzso is eliminated in differentiated zzso zzso zzso Development of zzso is restored with the introduction of a zzso zzso regulated by its own zzso The zzso zzso cells represent an important model for analyzing zzso cell zzso
