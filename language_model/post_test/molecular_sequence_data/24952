zzso zzso zzso have recently become an increasing problem in hospitals in Poland, being responsible for a growing number of zzso zzso In this work, we have analyzed the second outbreak of zzso with the zzso zzso to be identified in the zzso It was caused by zzso dissemination of a single strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and horizontal transmission of zzso resistance genes among several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two similar restriction zzso length zzso types of the zzso gene cluster characterized zzso and zzso zzso and they both contained the same zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recovered from the same zzso during the outbreak, proved to be related to certain zzso zzso and could represent endemic strains that had acquired zzso zzso One zzso and four zzso zzso all identified in the same patient, belonged to a single zzso although they revealed remarkable diversity in terms of zzso zzso patterns, zzso content, and number of zzso gene cluster zzso Most probably they reflected the dynamic evolution of an zzso zzso strain in the course of infection of a single zzso One of the zzso zzso turned out to be resistant to zzso which coincided with the use of this zzso in the patient's zzso Its zzso gene zzso differed by a single zzso from that found in other zzso however, it also lacked a large part of the zzso gene zzso including the regulatory genes zzso and zzso and the zzso promoter zzso zzso of the resistance genes zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in the zzso and this phenomenon was responsible for its unusual zzso
