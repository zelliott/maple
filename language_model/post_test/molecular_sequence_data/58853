We have determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso virus zzso at zzso A zzso The structure has been solved by the multiple zzso replacement zzso method using a zzso crystal zzso The results show that the zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso with marked structural similarity to zzso coli zzso In both zzso the zzso strand of an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of an adjacent zzso to form an zzso biologically functional zzso In the zzso crystal form one zzso packs on the zzso zzso and another on the zzso axis so that there are two independent zzso per zzso zzso A zzso zzso is coordinated by three zzso zzso on the zzso axis of each zzso zzso of 17 zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences reveals five zzso zzso Four of these map onto the interface between pairs of zzso defining a putative active site zzso the fifth resides in the zzso 16 zzso which is zzso in the zzso zzso motifs from all three zzso are required to create a given active zzso With respect to viral protein zzso it is particularly interesting that the gene for zzso zzso resides in the middle of the Pol zzso the zzso cassette of the zzso zzso Other zzso zzso in the Pol zzso including zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and most likely zzso zzso are zzso zzso which implies that the zzso of expression of active zzso zzso is distinct from the other zzso zzso Additionally, due to structural constraints, it is unlikely that zzso can attain an active form prior to zzso from the zzso
