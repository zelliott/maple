We have determined the DNA sequence of the gene zzso the protein of the plasma membrane zzso in zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the plasma membrane zzso shows zzso to zzso regions of known plasma membrane zzso and contains the known binding sites for zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso as well as the zzso zzso all characteristics common to plasma membrane zzso The deduced molecular weight for this sequence is 131 zzso The zzso of this gene will assist in the studies of the mechanisms by which this excitable cell removes calcium entering through zzso gated calcium channels and the pump functions in zzso signal zzso
