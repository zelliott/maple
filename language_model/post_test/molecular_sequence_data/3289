The zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso gene is a G protein coupled zzso that zzso signaling via a zzso zzso zzso that prepares zzso cells for zzso To establish the range of allowed zzso acid zzso within zzso segments of this zzso we conducted extensive random zzso of receptors followed by screening for zzso zzso A total of 157 zzso acid positions in seven different zzso libraries corresponding to the seven predicted zzso segments were zzso yielding 390 zzso that retain at least 60 % of normal signaling zzso These zzso contained a total of zzso unique zzso acid zzso including 61 % of all the possible zzso acid changes that can arise from single base zzso The zzso exhibits a surprising tolerance for zzso acid zzso Every zzso acid in the zzso regions of the zzso regions could be zzso by at least one other zzso Polar zzso acids were tolerated in functional receptors at 115 different positions zzso % of the zzso zzso zzso acids were tolerated in functional receptors at all zzso zzso zzso introducing zzso zzso were recovered at 53 % of all positions where they could be brought about by single base zzso zzso with charged zzso could also be tolerated at 53 % of all positions where they were accessible through single base zzso The spectrum of allowed zzso acid zzso was characterized in terms of the zzso radius of zzso and charge of the allowed zzso and mapped onto zzso zzso By comparing the patterns of allowed zzso with the recently determined structure of zzso structural features indicative of zzso interactions can be discerned in spite of the extreme sequence divergence between these two zzso
