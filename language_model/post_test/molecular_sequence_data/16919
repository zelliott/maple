The genes zzso zzso toxin zzso the major zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso coli, are carried in the zzso of zzso that belong to the zzso family of zzso Previous studies demonstrated that induction of zzso zzso zzso significantly enhances the production and/or release of zzso from the zzso zzso factors that regulate the switch between zzso and zzso growth, zzso zzso operator sites, and associated zzso zzso play important roles in regulating the production and/or release of zzso We report the results of genetic and zzso studies characterizing these elements of the zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso has three operator repeats in the right operator region zzso but unlike zzso and all other studied zzso zzso which have three operator repeats in the left operator region zzso zzso only has two operator repeats in zzso As was observed with zzso the zzso OR and OL regions regulate zzso from the early zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso fails to produce zzso unlike a zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso This finding provides direct evidence that measurable expression of the zzso genes zzso by a zzso zzso requires induction of that zzso with the zzso initiation of zzso gene zzso
