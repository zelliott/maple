The zzso or prion protein plays a key role in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is the product of a single host gene which is composed of 2 or 3 zzso a single open reading frame and a zzso rich zzso The structure of the gene and the sequence of the protein are highly zzso in various zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is found in zzso of the central and peripheral nervous system but other zzso do express zzso at least at some stages of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and processing of the initial gene product result in a 210 zzso acid protein with zzso zzso of the complex type which zzso itself to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The function of this protein is zzso Development of the zzso zzso zzso and increasing zzso of the zzso zzso are associated with the zzso in and around cells of zzso zzso of zzso which are partially resistant to zzso zzso These abnormal deposits of zzso and the normal zzso are transcribed from the same gene and so any zzso modification of the protein must be zzso No zzso zzso modifications of zzso have yet been found and some simple, zzso change in its secondary, zzso (or zzso structure may zzso its role in these zzso zzso in the zzso gene of different species have been associated with disease but none of these changes in primary structure appear to cause zzso resistance per zzso zzso zzso of disease zzso can already be made using zzso zzso analysis in man and some animals but developing a cure for these diseases, whether by drug or gene therapy, will require a much greater understanding of the molecular and cell biology of this gene and its zzso This article presents current views and understanding of the zzso zzso
