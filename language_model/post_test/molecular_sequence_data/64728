zzso peptides zzso have been extensively studied during the past decade, because of their ability to promote the cellular zzso of various cargo zzso zzso zzso and zzso In a recent study of the zzso of several zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in live zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was found that both zzso and zzso zzso pathways are involved in the zzso of these zzso In the present study, the membrane interactions of some of these novel zzso all containing a zzso zzso to facilitate zzso studies, are zzso The peptides exhibit a strong affinity for large zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso with binding zzso decreasing in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso lipids indicate that the zzso zzso of the peptides are buried to a similar extent into the zzso with an average zzso depth of approximately zzso A from the zzso zzso The membrane zzso of the peptides was investigated using an zzso based on resonance energy transfer between zzso and a zzso labeled zzso zzso distributed zzso in the zzso of zzso By determination of the energy transfer efficiency when zzso was added to zzso with zzso present exclusively in the inner zzso it was shown that none of the peptides investigated is able to zzso across the zzso zzso of zzso By contrast, zzso laser scanning zzso studies on zzso peptides showed that all of the peptides rapidly traverse the zzso of giant zzso zzso zzso The choice of model system is thus crucial for the conclusions about the ability of zzso to zzso across zzso zzso Under the conditions used in the present study, zzso interactions alone cannot explain the different cellular zzso characteristics exhibited by these zzso
