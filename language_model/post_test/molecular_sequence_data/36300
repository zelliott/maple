Close relationships between the nervous system and immune systems at molecular levels have now become zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso factors which play important roles in the nervous system, share a close structural similarity to those for zzso which is a zzso acting in the immune zzso zzso for these three factors belong to a zzso of zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso We have constructed a higher zzso structure of the zzso for zzso based on its known primary zzso The zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso in addition to common zzso of the zzso zzso similar to those cell surface molecules of the neural zzso gene super zzso These zzso appear to have similar structures to the zzso These lines of evidence suggest that the class zzso zzso zzso was formed as a result of those fusion of the genes for a more primitive zzso zzso zzso and for the neural zzso super gene family, and that, likewise, many molecules regulating neural development and those which act in the immune system have a common evolutionary zzso
