The zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso at pH zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso are zzso and a functional interaction of zzso with zzso is zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso at pH zzso are of high quality, detailed zzso studies of zzso zzso could be performed only at slightly zzso pH values and high salt zzso zzso is a putative zzso zzso related to the zzso and zzso regulation systems in zzso zzso which is the component in this system that can be zzso The zzso zzso which shows sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso was identified as the possible zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was confirmed by zzso mass zzso and native gel zzso and zzso was identified as the zzso site using zzso zzso zzso The solution structure of zzso at pH zzso has the same global fold as free zzso at pH zzso with an zzso zzso consisting of a central zzso beta sheet and three alpha zzso but the regular secondary structure elements wrapping the zzso core of the protein undergo subtle zzso changes upon zzso
