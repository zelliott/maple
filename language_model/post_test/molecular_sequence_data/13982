zzso A4 zzso interacts with zzso receptors in human zzso and differentiated zzso zzso Recently, we characterized a zzso zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Maddox, zzso zzso Perez, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 180, zzso zzso earlier as a related zzso zzso zzso zzso To examine the selectivity of this zzso we tested its preference for specific binding of zzso versus zzso zzso When zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells were exposed to either zzso or zzso the zzso affinity for zzso exceeded by zzso that of zzso zzso zzso vs 5 zzso Upon zzso zzso cells acquire zzso binding sites and respond to both zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis of differentiated zzso cells using an zzso probe showed a characteristic band at zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to an zzso zzso zzso selectively lost zzso binding as well as zzso zzso zzso that paralleled the loss of zzso for zzso In contrast, the specific zzso for the zzso zzso zzso specific zzso and zzso zzso D activity were still zzso Treatment of human zzso with zzso raised against a zzso in the zzso third zzso domain also resulted in selective zzso of zzso specific binding with zzso zzso zzso without blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso (which at zzso M gave approximately 1 log unit shift to the right in the zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso did not alter zzso responses in zzso but completely blocked zzso zzso These results indicate that altering the expression of the zzso protein by zzso of zzso mechanisms or hindrance of the zzso zzso zzso leads to loss of zzso specific binding and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, they indicate that in zzso cells zzso interactions are zzso from those of zzso and that zzso regulates zzso on the zzso zzso
