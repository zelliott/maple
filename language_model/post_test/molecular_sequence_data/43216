A family of structurally related proteins zzso to the zzso mothers against zzso zzso gene product have been implicated in signal zzso by members of the zzso zzso One of these MAD related proteins zzso has been cloned as a candidate zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in growth regulation by zzso related zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso induced growth zzso and zzso response is demonstrated here, by the introduction of zzso in the zzso and zzso insensitive breast zzso cell line zzso from which the zzso gene is zzso zzso of zzso in this cell line restores both growth zzso and the induction of a zzso sensitive reporter construct zzso by zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso acid zzso zzso and cloned from another zzso and zzso resistant breast zzso cell line zzso does not restore the induction of the zzso reporter by zzso We also show that in this latter cell line zzso resistance is partly due to the absence of a functional zzso type zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is part of the zzso zzso cascade and mediates zzso induced growth zzso Together with the deletion of zzso from zzso zzso these results suggest a role for zzso as a zzso zzso
