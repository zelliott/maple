zzso is a zzso zzso zzso essential for development in zzso and critical to stress responses in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a serious opportunistic zzso The study of zzso and gene expression in this ancient zzso has pharmacological relevance and may facilitate the understanding of these processes in higher zzso Here we show that the disruption of zzso zzso zzso yields viable zzso which were subsequently employed in a zzso study to identify gene products affected by its zzso zzso analysis of these zzso zzso which were mostly zzso specific, reveals a zzso zzso zzso The loss of zzso does not zzso zzso in an in zzso mouse zzso We also discovered that zzso zzso is the only zzso reported to date possessing a second zzso zzso zzso harbors a zzso divergent zzso domain required for nuclear zzso Despite high zzso between the zzso zzso the two zzso exhibit differing zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which exclusively targets zzso 18 of zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso in the zzso zzso We also identify two zzso zzso that interact differently with the zzso zzso has the potential to compensate for zzso which probably arose from a gene zzso unique to zzso zzso Our work reveals an unexpected complexity in the zzso machinery of this primitive zzso
