zzso receptors zzso play crucial roles in innate immunity by acting as pattern recognition zzso Although zzso are widely documented in zzso data on their occurrence and functions in ancient zzso are zzso In this study, we report, to our knowledge, the first cloning and functional characterization of an zzso zzso from zzso fish zzso zzso This zzso zzso was identified as a zzso to zzso scavenger zzso class A member 5 with the zzso structure of a class A zzso zzso contained zzso in a type II zzso zzso including an zzso zzso domain, two zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain, and a short zzso zzso region with an unexpected zzso factor zzso consensus motif similar to that in human zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso may be an ancient member of class A zzso resulting from the close relationship between scavenger zzso class A member 5 and zzso zzso in zzso associated with the subtle differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was a cell membrane zzso with zzso forms involved in the recognition and zzso of zzso from surface zzso into zzso zzso zzso expression was dramatically induced by zzso zzso zzso served as a negative regulator in zzso zzso zzso by the competitive recruitment of zzso factor 2 from the zzso signaling zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that zzso plays an zzso role in zzso inflammation by zzso with the zzso inflammatory zzso These findings contribute to a better understanding of the biological and evolutionary history of the zzso zzso
