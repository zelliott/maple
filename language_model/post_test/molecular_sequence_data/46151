Although zzso acid zzso regulates a wide variety of zzso zzso its targets remain poorly characterized in human zzso By zzso with zzso zzso we identified several zzso proteins including zzso zzso transport zzso zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Except for zzso protein binding to zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with PA whereas zzso bound to PA or zzso with the same zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso the selective inhibitor of zzso zzso or of PA formation with primary alcohols reduced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of PA zzso with zzso enhanced zzso zzso recruitment to zzso zzso also redistributed zzso to zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Though zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso different zzso appear to be zzso Cell zzso revealed that a pool of zzso was zzso with primary, secondary and zzso zzso and plasma membrane markers in resting zzso zzso with zzso enhanced zzso zzso with zzso a plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso structures at the cell periphery and double labeling with zzso zzso showed a partial zzso with secondary zzso in control and zzso zzso zzso of these putative zzso proteins constitutes another step forward for a better understanding of the role of zzso PA in zzso zzso
