zzso expression of the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso can be zzso in zzso coli with only the zzso structural gene zzso the negative regulator zzso and the positive regulator zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso coli suggest that negative control of zzso expression by zzso is zzso by a zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso in equilibrium dialysis studies, and therefore zzso appears to be the sensory partner of the zzso pair of regulatory zzso responding to the presence of zzso zzso analysis techniques suggest that zzso is a member of the structural family of zzso binding zzso but has a distinct and novel zzso zzso
