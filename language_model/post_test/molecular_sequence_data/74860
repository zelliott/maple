To express an increased level of zzso zzso zzso zzso adhesive zzso in soluble form, we constructed expression zzso zzso truncated zzso signal zzso fusion zzso zzso signal zzso zzso is the 21 zzso zzso zzso of the 23 zzso zzso signal sequence zzso by signal zzso zzso We successfully produced increased levels of soluble zzso zzso zzso with various deletions of zzso and found that the increased expression was caused by the increased zzso of the zzso of the fusion proteins zzso or zzso zzso All the zzso signal zzso segments of zzso zzso acids in length had the same zzso value zzso Our results suggest that the zzso value of the truncated zzso zzso play an important role in directional signaling for the fusion zzso but we found no evidence for the presence of a zzso zzso in zzso For practical applications, we increased the expression of soluble zzso with zzso peptides as directional signals, and obtained zzso with the native zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso leader sequence that contains the recognition site for zzso zzso
