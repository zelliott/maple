A zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso from zzso coli was constructed in order to study the unusual characteristics of zzso signal zzso which share a strictly zzso zzso the consensus zzso zzso Although the zzso signal zzso fusion protein was processed much more slowly than the fusion of zzso with its own signal zzso the system zzso several features expected for zzso zzso in zzso coli, including increased export under zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso the first zzso zzso of the consensus box, to a zzso completely inhibited export and processing of the fusion zzso The same zzso of zzso located outside the consensus box, had almost no zzso The data indicate a specific role for the consensus box sequence in the export mechanism for zzso
