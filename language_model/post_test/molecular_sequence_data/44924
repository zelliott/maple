An array of zzso zzso zzso ranging in length from zzso to zzso was zzso on the surface of a glass plate and used to measure the potential of zzso for zzso formation with rabbit zzso zzso The zzso were complementary to the first 122 bases of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and bases 1 to 69 of the first zzso zzso few zzso gave significant zzso zzso zzso activity, measured in a zzso H zzso and by in zzso translation, correlated well with yield of zzso on the zzso These results help to explain the variable success that is commonly experienced in the choice of zzso zzso For the optimal zzso the concentration required to inhibit translation by 50% was found to be five times less than for any other zzso We find no obvious features in the zzso sequence or the predicted secondary structure that can explain the variation in zzso zzso However, the zzso provide a simple empirical method of selecting effective zzso zzso for any zzso target of known zzso
