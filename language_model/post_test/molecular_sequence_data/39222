The gene zzso the branching zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was fused with a twin zzso zzso protein zzso signal sequence from zzso coli and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso BE was zzso using zzso interaction and gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso activity at 50 degrees C and pH zzso With zzso the BE displays high zzso and extremely low zzso zzso The conversion of zzso and linear zzso was zzso by applying zzso zzso exchange zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was converted to a major extent to products displaying molecular masses of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso could be zzso for the production of starch or zzso with narrow molecular mass zzso The majority of the transferred zzso determined after zzso zzso of the newly zzso zzso zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso which zzso to a degree of zzso zzso of zzso The minimal donor chain length is zzso zzso Furthermore, the obtained results support the hypotheses of a random zzso mechanism of BE and the occurrence of zzso zzso
