zzso are known for their capacity to form harmful zzso zzso zzso zzso and as symbiotic, zzso partners for zzso These zzso zzso have permanently condensed, zzso zzso and immense nuclear zzso sizes, often several times the size of the human zzso Here we describe the first draft assembly of a zzso nuclear zzso providing insights into its zzso organization and gene zzso 

zzso reads from zzso zzso were assembled into zzso zzso zzso DNA regions that represented roughly half of the estimated 1,500 zzso zzso of this zzso The assembly zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with previous zzso gene number estimates using zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains duplicated genes for regulator of zzso zzso zzso nearly one-third of which have zzso zzso whereas the remainder have most likely been acquired through bacterial horizontal gene zzso zzso genes are enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites are unique, with zzso sites utilizing not only zzso but also zzso and zzso whereas at 3' sites, a zzso G is present after zzso All zzso zzso genes zzso are clustered in the zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso displays zzso aligned genes throughout the zzso forming a zzso gene zzso 

We show here that a zzso zzso exhibits unique and divergent characteristics when compared to those of other zzso Our data zzso the organization and gene inventory of zzso and lay the foundation for future studies of this remarkable group of zzso
