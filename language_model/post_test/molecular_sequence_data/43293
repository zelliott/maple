The success of the mass zzso approaches for the identification of zzso proteins relies upon recovery of zzso without high levels of zzso zzso in zzso compatible with the mass zzso being zzso We sought to determine whether zzso or zzso zzso provided a significant advantage when low to zzso quantities of zzso proteins were analyzed by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso with respect to the number and size of released zzso zzso zzso of five standard proteins of zzso 17,000 to zzso (from 16 zzso to 125 zzso were zzso and subjected to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Patterson, zzso zzso zzso 1997, in zzso or zzso zzso following zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso maps were able to be obtained for all proteins at the detection limit of each method zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 125 zzso and searches of zzso or a zzso database zzso zzso zzso successfully identified all of the zzso except zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso were obtained from more than one zzso per protein at loads down to 250 zzso (except zzso Using the zzso data, a search of the zzso database and a zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso zzso entries total) was able to identify zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso
