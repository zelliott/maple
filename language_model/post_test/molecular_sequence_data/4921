The zzso sequences from increasing numbers of organisms allow for rapid and organized examination of gene zzso Yet current zzso zzso for gene recognition are limited and likely to miss genes expressing zzso zzso or zzso with small open reading frames zzso We have zzso two strategies to determine if there are additional transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso that were not identified in previous analyses of the zzso In one approach, we identified strong consensus zzso III promoters based on zzso and determined zzso if these promoters drive the expression of an zzso zzso III zzso This approach led to the identification of a new, zzso 170 zzso zzso zzso An alternative strategy analyzed zzso expression from large sequence zzso zzso between predicted zzso Fifteen unique zzso transcripts ranging in size from 161 to 1200 zzso were identified from a total of 59 sequence zzso Several of these zzso contain unusually small potential zzso while one is clearly zzso and appears to be a small zzso zzso These results suggest that there are likely to be additional previously unidentified zzso zzso in zzso and that new zzso for gene recognition will be required to identify all expressed genes from an zzso
