Several zzso molecules that structurally resemble zzso zzso hormone zzso have been identified through zzso zzso zzso or data zzso These molecules share considerable sequence and structural similarities with zzso zzso leading to the current belief that zzso and zzso forms of zzso share a common zzso However, the zzso significance of these zzso zzso molecules remains poorly zzso This knowledge gap zzso our understanding of how zzso has evolved functionally over zzso This review provides a summary of our recent functional characterization of a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and presents preliminary proof for a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal that zzso is a general neural regulator capable of exerting diverse central and motor effects, but plays little or no role in zzso zzso This notion is supported by the abundance of a putative zzso transcript in the central nervous system and the zzso Comparing these results to the available functional data from a zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso that zzso zzso molecules are likely to assume a wide range of zzso roles, and zzso zzso is not an zzso zzso role of these zzso Future functional studies using suitable zzso models are required to identify functional changes in zzso zzso molecules that accompany major zzso zzso
