The integrity of zzso structure, stability, and zzso characterization are becoming increasingly important as zzso receive increasing scrutiny from regulatory zzso We altered the zzso bond arrangement of an zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso at the N zzso of the heavy chain constant domain 1 zzso zzso position zzso to a zzso and introduction of a zzso at a variety of positions zzso zzso at the C zzso of zzso An zzso zzso bond is thus formed, which mimics the zzso bond arrangement found in an zzso zzso The zzso species present in the zzso following transient expression in Chinese zzso zzso cells were analyzed by zzso to investigate product zzso and zzso product was analyzed by a zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso We show that the light chain can form an zzso zzso bond with a zzso when present at several positions on the upper hinge zzso zzso and that such engineered zzso bonds can consequently increase the zzso domain zzso stability between 3 and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displaying the greatest increase in zzso zzso stability were also the most homogeneous in terms of zzso bond arrangement and zzso species zzso zzso zzso did not affect the affinity for zzso of the zzso zzso In combination with the previously described zzso zzso we present an zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso stability and reduced product zzso that potentially offers advantages for the production of zzso zzso
