zzso radiation resulting from differential selection acting on functional features is believed to be an important source of zzso In this study, zzso measures and zzso DNA are used to test for zzso radiation within four fish zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso endemic to an ancient island lake zzso zzso zzso zzso using the framework proposed by zzso (The zzso of zzso zzso Oxford University Press, zzso We demonstrate common ancestry and rapid divergence in one zzso zzso based on zzso zzso of zzso sequence zzso We found higher levels of variation in zzso traits (N zzso 8) for zzso relative to the other zzso while no differences were found for sexual display traits (N zzso 8) or neutral zzso traits (N zzso zzso zzso also had the highest number of distinct zzso patterns among the four zzso These data, combined with the very low productivity of the lake, are indicative of selection driving zzso zzso The zzso divergence in the zzso likely results from selection acting on feeding traits in this low productivity lake, leading to zzso specialization among closely related zzso These results provide indirect but compelling data supporting the zzso radiation of zzso in this zzso
