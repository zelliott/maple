zzso zzso are an important human pathogen associated with acute viral zzso zzso zzso display a significant amount of genetic zzso making it difficult to develop comprehensive detection zzso In this study, primer sets and zzso were designed for a zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso detection zzso The zzso was zzso and zzso as a multiplex real-time zzso zzso for zzso I zzso zzso and a zzso real-time zzso zzso for zzso II zzso zzso The zzso showed high specificity for zzso detection and no zzso was observed between zzso and zzso The detection limit of the zzso was as low as 10 and 50 zzso copies per reaction for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protocol was employed to assess the presence of zzso strains in clinical samples collected throughout Thailand during December 2005 to November zzso The percentage of zzso infections among children with acute zzso zzso was zzso zzso and for children without acute zzso zzso it was zzso zzso The frequency of zzso infections varied zzso with the highest frequency observed in the central region and the lowest frequency in the northern region zzso Of the 149 positive case and control zzso zzso was found to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were successfully obtained from 67 zzso specimens and a zzso analysis was performed to zzso the viral zzso zzso was the most common zzso zzso
