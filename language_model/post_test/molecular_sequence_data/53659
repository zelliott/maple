The crystal structure of the bacterial zzso channel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cohen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and MacKinnon, zzso zzso Science zzso zzso and subsequent zzso have revealed a high structural conservation from bacteria to human zzso zzso Cohen, zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso We have explored this conservation by swapping zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso with those of the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso channel zzso were expressed in zzso coli, and their zzso state was analyzed after zzso We used two scorpion zzso zzso and zzso 1, which bind specifically to zzso to analyze the pharmacological properties of the zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the high affinity scorpion toxin zzso of zzso could be transferred to zzso Our zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso provide direct chemical evidence that a zzso channel structure is necessary for forming a functional scorpion toxin zzso We have obtained zzso zzso with zzso affinities zzso values of approximately 4 zzso like native zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that a zzso of the zzso zzso may be an important zzso of the pharmacological profile of zzso zzso Using available structural information on zzso and zzso we have developed a structural model for the complex between zzso zzso and zzso to aid future pharmacological studies of zzso zzso
