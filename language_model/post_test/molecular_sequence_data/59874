We have investigated the zzso location of the zzso zzso surface zzso zzso by introducing zzso copies of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing three zzso repeated copies of a human influenza zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the mature zzso zzso zzso was able to complement the zzso zzso zzso as well as being recognized in Western blots by both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso into the zzso zzso locus produced a zzso cell line, zzso which was used for studies of the zzso location of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of fixed zzso zzso showed that zzso was evenly distributed over the cell body and somewhat concentrated in the zzso region of the zzso No zzso could be detected in the zzso tip of the zzso zzso zzso of fixed zzso zzso revealed that zzso was predominantly zzso and located on the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of live zzso zzso cells showed a similar pattern of zzso on the zzso but no zzso was detected on the cell body, which was attributed to masking by other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of fixed zzso zzso revealed that zzso which has long been considered to be expressed only in zzso and zzso zzso can be expressed in zzso but it no longer contains the zzso zzso zzso
