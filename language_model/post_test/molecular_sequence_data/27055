A zzso is designed for complete zzso switching of DNA zzso by light zzso for the purpose of using DNA as a material for building zzso zzso attached to zzso that function as zzso are introduced into each DNA strand after every two natural zzso (in the form zzso where N and X represent the natural zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these two modified strands forms a zzso consisting of alternating natural base pairs and zzso zzso In this newly designed zzso each base pair is sandwiched between two zzso zzso and all the zzso zzso are separated by base zzso When the duplex is zzso by visible light, the zzso zzso take the trans form and this duplex is surprisingly stable compared to the corresponding native duplex composed of only natural zzso On the other hand, when the zzso zzso are zzso to the zzso form by zzso light zzso the duplex is completely zzso Based on this design, a DNA hairpin structure is zzso that should be closed by visible light zzso and opened by zzso light zzso at the level of a single zzso Indeed, perfect zzso zzso is zzso This is a promising strategy for the design of zzso such as zzso sticky ends on DNA zzso and other zzso
