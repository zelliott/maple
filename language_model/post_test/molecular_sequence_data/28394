A full length zzso for acid zzso in rat liver zzso was isolated and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence comprises 423 zzso zzso zzso A putative signal zzso of 30 zzso is followed by the zzso sequence of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso sequence is identical with that determined directly for acid zzso zzso from the rat liver zzso zzso The primary structure deduced for acid zzso contains 9 potential zzso sites and a zzso region which could function as a zzso zzso It exhibits zzso and zzso sequence similarities in zzso acids and zzso zzso respectively, to human zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of the putative zzso segment shows a complete similarity to that of the human zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis identified a single species of acid zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in rat zzso
