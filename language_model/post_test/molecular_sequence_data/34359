Nuclear receptors zzso are one of the most abundant classes of zzso regulators in zzso They regulate diverse functions, such as zzso zzso development and zzso zzso zzso are a very important target for drug zzso Nuclear receptors form a zzso of zzso related proteins and have been subdivided into different zzso due to their domain zzso In this study, a zzso zzso called zzso was developed that can be used to identify a query protein as a nuclear zzso or not based on its sequence information alone; if it is, the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it among the following seven zzso zzso zzso hormone like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like, zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso germ cell nuclear factor like zzso and zzso zzso like zzso The identification was made by the zzso K nearest neighbor zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso acid composition formed by incorporating various zzso and statistical features derived from the protein zzso such as zzso acid zzso zzso zzso complexity factor, and zzso zzso spectrum zzso As a demonstration, it was shown through some benchmark zzso derived from the zzso and zzso with low zzso that the overall success rates achieved by the zzso test were about zzso and zzso in the first and second level, zzso The high success rates indicate that the novel zzso predictor can be a useful vehicle for identifying zzso and their zzso As a zzso web server, zzso is freely accessible at either zzso or zzso Each job submitted to zzso can contain up to 500 query protein sequences and be finished in less than 2 zzso The less the number of query proteins is, the shorter the time will usually zzso All the program codes for zzso are available for zzso purpose upon zzso
