zzso zzso zzso are a family of small zzso rich proteins believed to have a number of zzso functions, including both metal zzso zzso and toxic metal zzso zzso zzso bind 7 zzso or zzso zzso into two distinct zzso an zzso zzso that binds 3 zzso or zzso and a zzso zzso that binds 4 zzso or zzso Although zzso zzso to the saturated zzso (where zzso or zzso species would be expected to take place via a zzso mechanism involving the 20 zzso zzso zzso literature reports suggest a cooperative mechanism involving cluster formation prior to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso provides this sensitivity through zzso of all species zzso zzso zzso at each step in the zzso zzso We report modeled zzso spectral data for the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and its two isolated zzso for three zzso conditions: cooperative (where the binding affinities are: zzso zzso cooperative (where zzso and zzso (where zzso zzso zzso zzso data of human zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso are also zzso zzso of the experimental data with the predicted mass spectral data provides conclusive evidence that zzso occurs in a zzso fashion for zzso and zzso binding to zzso zzso
