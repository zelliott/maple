zzso zzso A zzso is a major zzso protein zzso and zzso mainly by the zzso In response to zzso its expression is increased by zzso primarily because of a zzso increase in the rates of zzso gene zzso We have shown that when 304 zzso of zzso zzso region of the rat zzso gene is fused to a reporter zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is induced in a zzso manner in response to zzso media prepared from activated mixed zzso cultures and zzso zzso In this study, deletion of the zzso promoter to zzso zzso with respect to the zzso start site did not diminish promoter zzso however, deletion to zzso zzso renders the promoter completely zzso zzso analysis have demonstrated that a zzso DNA zzso spanning zzso zzso to zzso zzso could zzso zzso responsiveness to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Within this zzso responsive element resided an zzso zzso zzso site and a zzso zzso Although each binding site alone could zzso responsiveness when zzso with zzso media and zzso the response was much weaker than that observed when both sites were zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of either binding site completely abolished zzso promoter zzso Taken together, these results suggest a functional importance for and cooperative interaction of these two zzso binding sites in the zzso expression of the rat zzso zzso
