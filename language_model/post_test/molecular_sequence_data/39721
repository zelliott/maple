zzso zzso fixation of zzso crops is highly sensitive to drought, which results in a dramatic drop of N zzso and zzso The zzso between soybean zzso zzso and zzso zzso because of its extreme sensitivity to drought, was chosen as a model to zzso the response to drought stress at a molecular zzso The zzso differential display technique was performed to isolate zzso markers zzso expressed in zzso zzso of zzso fixation capacity zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso One gene noted, zzso appeared strongly zzso by drought and fully recovered after zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso transcripts were localized in zzso cells of mature zzso indicating that zzso could be considered as a late zzso However, zzso expression was not directly correlated to zzso fixation but mainly responded to zzso zzso Other stresses that lead to decrease of zzso fixation did not affect zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso presented a strong zzso with two soybean expressed sequence tags zzso and with the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso roles of this zzso in adaptation of soybean zzso to zzso stress are zzso
