Throughout its development, common zzso zzso zzso responds to different kinds of adverse zzso and zzso stress by expressing specific genes that allow it to adapt to these zzso In this process, genes in the zzso family zzso zzso regulators involved in diverse zzso and zzso processes play critical zzso Here, we established an extensive picture of the zzso family genes in zzso From zzso 174 zzso of zzso zzso 117 putative zzso family genes were identified by in zzso analysis based on the presence of the zzso zzso domain zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso Based on the model species zzso zzso the zzso zzso from zzso zzso were classified into five zzso with the following number of zzso zzso zzso zzso (47), zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using the available zzso information as a source of expression data, the putative zzso family genes from zzso zzso were detected in nine kinds of zzso zzso of the genes were shown to be most abundant in leaves, followed by roots and seeds, and the least abundant in zzso Most of the zzso zzso zzso family genes showed some tissue zzso
