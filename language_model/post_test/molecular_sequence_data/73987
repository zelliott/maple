New zzso bacteria were isolated from zzso sludge from a wastewater treatment zzso The zzso are zzso to zzso zzso zzso that form neither spores nor zzso They are characterized by a zzso with directly zzso zzso acid zzso A1 zzso by the presence of zzso zzso and by the lack of zzso zzso The strains have complex fatty acid patterns with zzso and zzso saturated and zzso fatty acids as major zzso The G + C content of the DNA is 70 zzso The results of zzso studies and a zzso zzso DNA sequence comparison support our proposal to assign these bacteria to a new zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso 83 zzso zzso zzso
