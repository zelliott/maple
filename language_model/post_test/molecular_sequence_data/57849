Using zzso as the reporter zzso we carried out zzso experiments to investigate the zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso Our results showed that the DNA element, between zzso and zzso is important for the upstream zzso sequence zzso zzso On the basis of the DNA zzso there is a zzso I zzso and a zzso zzso zzso element located within the middle of the zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso analysis of the zzso I sequence has indicated that the internal zzso sequence of the zzso I site zzso is important for gene zzso Furthermore, when DNA elements containing the zzso I sites were zzso into the tester zzso periodic expression of a reporter gene throughout the cell cycle was observed, as evidenced by the zzso activities and zzso zzso Because the possible zzso initiation sites of the zzso transcript have been previously defined zzso and Jong, 1990, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose a model regarding the construct of the zzso promoter zzso This zzso promoter construct contains a zzso region and a zzso I element zzso zzso typical of a family of cell zzso genes involved in DNA zzso Previous genetic studies have not completely defined the zzso execution point in the functional zzso cell cycle zzso Our results favor the possibility that the zzso gene is required, and directly involved, in the initiation of DNA zzso
