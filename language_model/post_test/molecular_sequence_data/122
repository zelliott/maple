Drug design, zzso therapy zzso and drug resistance studies have focused almost exclusively on human zzso virus type 1 zzso resulting in limited information for patients infected with zzso and for those zzso infected with zzso and zzso In this study, 20 patients, 12 infected with zzso and 8 zzso infected with zzso and zzso all treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were followed up zzso for about 3 zzso For zzso patients, viral loads were reduced to zzso zzso the patient whose viral load remained zzso reported adverse effects associated with zzso that had caused him to stop taking all the zzso zzso strains containing zzso in both the zzso and the reverse zzso gene that may zzso drug resistance were observed in two patients with viral rebound, as early as 130 days zzso zzso after the initiation of zzso We conclude that the combination of zzso zzso and zzso is able to provide efficient and durable suppression of zzso and zzso for as long as 3 years in zzso and zzso infected zzso However, the emergence of zzso and zzso strains containing drug-resistant zzso can compromise the efficacy of this highly active zzso
