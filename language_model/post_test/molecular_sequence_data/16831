zzso Whether zzso zzso blood zzso serves as a source of zzso zzso cells zzso is zzso zzso are the best candidates for cellular therapy of orthopedic skeletal zzso In order to explore the possibility of zzso as a useful source of zzso we identified, expanded in culture, and characterized zzso from zzso harvests on a large zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from zzso harvests zzso were cultured in media supplemented with zzso zzso zzso cells cultured from each zzso harvest were expanded ex zzso by successive zzso zzso harvests with a more than zzso expanding capacity zzso were examined for surface zzso zzso and in zzso differentiation zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso out of a total of 411 zzso units zzso generated zzso cells during zzso Nine zzso units zzso yielded zzso with more than zzso expansion zzso These cells positively expressed zzso zzso but did not express zzso zzso or zzso zzso These cells also possessed multiple capacities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso of zzso harvests producing zzso in culture was low, some of them showed a more than zzso expanding capacity, which is enough in cell numbers to be an zzso source for cellular zzso Our results may encourage the use of zzso as an attractive target for zzso cellular therapeutic options in tissue zzso
