zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso flounder, zzso zzso caught in Vietnam seawater, and the zzso gene was cloned using a shotgun zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence zzso zzso corresponded to a protein of 338 zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso The zzso had zzso and zzso identities with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained a putative leader zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso and zzso hole sequence zzso The protein from the strain zzso was produced in both a soluble and an zzso form when the zzso coli cells harboring the gene were cultured at 18 degrees zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso was observed at a temperature of 40 degrees C and pH zzso using zzso as zzso however, relative activity still reached to zzso even at 5 degrees C with an zzso energy of zzso zzso which indicated that it was a zzso zzso The zzso was a zzso and was active against zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso this zzso retained much of its activity in the presence of commercial zzso and organic zzso This zzso zzso will be zzso as zzso for reaction in the presence of organic zzso and zzso
