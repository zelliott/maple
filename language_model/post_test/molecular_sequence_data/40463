zzso zzso the transfer of zzso onto zzso zzso zzso The zzso belongs to a large family of bacterial membrane proteins required for initiation of the synthesis of O zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that the last zzso zzso and zzso tail region of zzso zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the zzso location of the zzso zzso tail and show that zzso domain zzso fused to zzso zzso exhibits improved protein folding and enhanced zzso zzso zzso replacement of highly zzso charged or polar zzso acids identified seven critical zzso for zzso activity in zzso and in zzso Four of these zzso are located in regions predicted to be zzso These regions and their secondary structure predictions are zzso in distinct zzso family members, suggesting they may contribute to form a zzso zzso zzso
