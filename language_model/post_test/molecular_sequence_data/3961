zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso suggested to have a role in host zzso It forms linear and zzso zzso with each ring segment being composed of two zzso We have produced zzso human zzso fragments zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso 3 and 4 zzso in zzso human kidney cells to characterize structural and functional properties of zzso Both fragments were obtained in a native and zzso form, as analyzed by CD zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that both fragments are autonomous folding zzso All three potential zzso sites in zzso and all four in zzso were found to be zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells contained no zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not zzso zzso revealed that zzso is zzso zzso in the zzso range reflecting the properties of intact zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso is thus identified as the zzso domain of zzso because it has been formerly shown that zzso domain 1 is zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso and zzso of different size and shape were shown by electron zzso In contrast to this irregular zzso of zzso it has been formerly shown that a zzso zzso zzso 2-4 still has the ability to form zzso structures, although the rings are zzso and thus domain 2 appears to be indispensable for ring zzso Solid phase zzso showed that zzso contains binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso V and zzso whereas zzso is inactive in zzso Both fragments showed no cell adhesive activity in contrast to native zzso suggesting that a concerted binding action and/or zzso interactions of rings are necessary for cell zzso
