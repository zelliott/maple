A system has been developed for the quantitative analysis of gene expression within individual zzso zzso cells in infected zzso The system is based on the zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso et zzso 1997) cloned between a zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso on an zzso zzso zzso were inserted into zzso and zzso levels measured in individual cells by quantitative zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso folds rapidly following gene zzso and is turned over rapidly following gene zzso zzso single cell zzso zzso are likely to reflect ongoing gene expression levels with reasonable zzso zzso expression levels were relatively constant during growth of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso forms, and during growth in zzso in the mouse model of systemic zzso zzso zzso provides a useful control for this quantitative zzso system in future analyses of zzso zzso molecular responses during zzso zzso
