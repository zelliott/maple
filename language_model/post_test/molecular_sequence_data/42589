The most zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso is zzso releasing hormone zzso and increased zzso zzso is critical for this zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso gene has several potential binding sites for regulatory zzso To characterize the region between zzso zzso and zzso which includes a zzso site and an adjacent zzso consensus zzso and to study its role in zzso zzso gel mobility shift zzso and transient expression of zzso zzso were zzso In transient zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso treatment led to significant increases in zzso expression compared with zzso treatment of cells zzso with the zzso zzso However, no response to direct zzso of zzso dependent protein zzso or protein zzso C was zzso Despite the high zzso of the sequence zzso to the consensus zzso binding site zzso the nuclear zzso in zzso cells binding to this region appears to be different than authentic zzso since neither a competitor zzso having the authentic zzso sequence nor zzso against zzso or zzso affected the gel shift pattern of a probe having the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso to zzso region of the zzso zzso gene contains a functional zzso responsive element and that second zzso systems that zzso the zzso signal to this element do not exert their actions solely through zzso of zzso or zzso
