zzso expressed zzso in an zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as driver zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso derived from the wild cells by zzso zzso as tester zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso levels of six genes were increased significantly in the zzso zzso after exposure to Al stress when compared with the wild zzso Two genes accumulated in both the presence and absence of Al stress and four genes were induced by Al stress in the zzso zzso zzso fragments were amplified by rapid amplification of zzso ends and zzso to obtain full-length zzso of the six zzso Two genes were novel or predicted ones and the others showed significant zzso to known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are induced by environmental stresses in zzso and zzso zzso These zzso activities increased in the zzso zzso when compared to those in the wild cells, showing that not only the levels of gene expression but also the levels of zzso activities increased in the zzso zzso
