It has been suggested that canine zzso zzso consist of zzso zzso and a group of strains that has been zzso designated zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to compare 22 zzso zzso that were obtained from zzso specimens of dogs in Sweden zzso zzso zzso Norway zzso zzso zzso the United States zzso zzso zzso Australia zzso zzso 2) and Germany zzso zzso 1) with type and reference zzso as well as field zzso of zzso species by five zzso tests and determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso In an evolutionary tree derived from zzso zzso zzso the canine zzso grouped into three zzso One cluster included the type strain of zzso zzso zzso whereas a second larger zzso which was zzso contained a canine strain that was identified previously as zzso zzso The third cluster consisted of three canine zzso of zzso origin, which grouped together with the type strain of the species zzso zzso zzso to zzso These three zzso which were identified on the basis of zzso zzso zzso corresponded to four zzso groups based on zzso zzso Two zzso tests, zzso zzso and zzso production, were sufficient for rapid identification of each canine zzso
