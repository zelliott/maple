zzso zzso first found in zzso led to the identification of zzso genes in all zzso These genes are exceptional in that they are arranged in an ordered zzso in which they are positioned in the same order along the zzso as they are expressed along the zzso axis to specify the corresponding body zzso They share a highly zzso DNA sequence of 180 zzso the zzso which encodes the zzso a 60 zzso acid zzso involved in specific DNA and zzso binding and in zzso zzso The discovery of the zzso has uncovered for the first time a universal principle of zzso of the body plan along the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso has been determined by zzso zzso and by X-ray zzso However, the mechanism by which the zzso proteins find their target genes in the nucleus of a living cell has been zzso zzso analysis indicates that there are hundreds of target genes to be zzso both positively and zzso to ensure normal zzso In the following, we show by Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso and single zzso imaging in live zzso zzso cells, that the mechanism of recognition is purely zzso The zzso associates and zzso rapidly (in the zzso zzso with zzso all along the zzso If, however, it associates with a specific binding site in a puffed zzso region, it remains bound for seconds or minutes to exert its function, by forming a complex with zzso or zzso zzso These direct zzso solve an old zzso of how zzso zzso factors find their target genes in the nucleus of live zzso
