To detect the relationship of zzso zzso with inherited deafness and the reason for zzso hypersensitivity to zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso investigations were zzso The blood samples were obtained from 12 zzso and DNA was extracted from the isolated zzso After that, zzso fragments were amplified by zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by zzso 26 I, zzso I and zzso I restriction zzso zzso respectively, and then sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis showed that all the zzso carried zzso zzso among them, 10 zzso carried zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso no pedigree was found to harbor the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene showed that the zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso that carried zzso or zzso zzso showed zzso or zzso hearing zzso The zzso or zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso gene zzso led to zzso hypersensitivity to zzso zzso
