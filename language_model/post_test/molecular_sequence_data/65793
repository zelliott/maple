zzso in DNA mismatch repair zzso are the molecular basis of certain zzso including zzso zzso The defects are often caused by zzso in coding regions of zzso genes or promoter zzso of the zzso However, in many cases, despite that a zzso zzso is detected in a patient, no zzso of zzso genes can be zzso We report here a novel mechanism that a zzso in the zzso zzso region zzso leads to zzso zzso A relapsed leukemia patient displayed zzso instability, but no genetic and zzso zzso in key zzso genes were zzso Instead, a zzso zzso deletion in the zzso zzso was found in the patient's blood zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to significantly reduce the expressions of both a zzso zzso reporter gene and an zzso zzso gene in model cell zzso zzso with these zzso a significant reduction in the zzso level of zzso zzso was observed in white blood cells of the zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso can cause a severely zzso zzso activity zzso leukemia zzso likely by zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso Although the exact mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is not known, our findings provide a novel marker for zzso with zzso zzso
