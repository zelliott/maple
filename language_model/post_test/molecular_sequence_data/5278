This study examined the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso within the first zzso domain, by a zzso regulated 100 zzso protein zzso exhibiting significantly greater activity in the embryonic rat brain than in the adult rat zzso This protein zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with both zzso and zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso the present protein zzso activity was shown to zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of any protein or zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso with this protein zzso significantly reduced the zzso interaction, and the effect was significantly greater with zzso protein zzso preparations from embryonic brain than with preparations from the zzso zzso 262 is zzso extensively in paired zzso filament zzso zzso from Alzheimer's disease zzso brain, to a lesser extent in fetal zzso and only to a very minor extent in zzso human zzso Because the 100 zzso protein zzso activity zzso zzso 262 and is higher in the fetal brain than the adult brain, it is hypothesized that an inappropriate zzso and/or zzso of this or a similar zzso regulated protein zzso could contribute to the zzso of zzso 262 in zzso and thus play a role in the zzso of zzso
