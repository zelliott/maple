We have tested the hypothesis that cellular zzso events occurring in T zzso and zzso and zzso through zzso of the zzso factor zzso B are dependent upon the zzso zzso status of these zzso We used zzso zzso zzso antioxidants zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, or zzso zzso zzso to show that zzso radical scavenging in zzso and zzso or zzso cells blocks the functions depending on zzso B zzso zzso was found to suppress not only zzso or zzso but also zzso zzso activity zzso to an zzso of zzso B binding activity in both zzso T zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso This was also true for zzso zzso zzso binding activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso the product of another zzso zzso zzso was abolished by zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso but not zzso content in zzso and zzso T cell, whereas zzso stimulation itself barely modified the cellular zzso zzso zzso stress obtained by the addition of zzso to the culture medium of zzso or zzso cells could not by itself induce zzso B zzso These observations suggest that zzso and zzso do not lead to zzso B zzso through induction of changes in the cell zzso zzso Rather, zzso and zzso can exert their effect only if cells are in an appropriate zzso status, because prior modification toward reduction with zzso treatment prevents this zzso It appears that a zzso zzso equilibrium tending toward zzso is a prerequisite for full zzso of zzso pathways regulating the activity of zzso zzso zzso
