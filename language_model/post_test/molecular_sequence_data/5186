Three satellite DNA families were identified in three species of burying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso sequence analysis of individual randomly cloned repeats shows that these satellite DNA families are highly abundant in the zzso are composed of unique repeats, and are zzso The repeats do not have identifiable core elements or zzso that are similar in all three families, and most zzso sequence similarity is confined to zzso runs of A and zzso Satellite DNA from zzso zzso and zzso zzso show zzso zzso among repeats, but zzso zzso characterize most of the repeat zzso Although the repeat units are of similar lengths zzso zzso and 354 zzso and A + T composition zzso zzso and zzso respectively), the average zzso divergence among zzso repeats is very low zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios from the consensus sequence are zzso zzso and zzso zzso
