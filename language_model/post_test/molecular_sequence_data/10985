zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso box protein of the putative zzso zzso zzso family, is a zzso factor that functions late in the zzso zzso zzso to facilitate zzso zzso In this paper we report zzso cloning and characterization of zzso an apparent zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid sequence comparison revealed that the two proteins are approximately zzso identical over a zzso region spanning the central zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso in zzso was sufficient to restore growth at the zzso zzso This functional zzso was specific, as mouse zzso failed to complement zzso in related zzso factor genes zzso or zzso Finally, double label zzso experiments performed with zzso cells revealed zzso of zzso and zzso factor zzso in zzso nuclear zzso Thus, the hypothesis that zzso represents the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is supported by its high sequence zzso functional zzso and zzso with a known zzso factor in the zzso Our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that the zzso machinery that mediates zzso dynamic changes in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso has been highly zzso through zzso
