We report the sequence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso a gene that is zzso expressed at the zzso boundary of the cell zzso The position of zzso sequences which can act as binding sites for zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso box factors as well as other potential zzso sequences have been zzso The organization of these zzso sequences in the promoter of the human zzso gene (another gene that is zzso expressed at the zzso zzso are shown for zzso The potential role that these sequences may play in the zzso regulation of these genes is zzso
