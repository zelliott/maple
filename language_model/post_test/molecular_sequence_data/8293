zzso the first zzso of zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso from zzso and zzso Here we report that the higher plant, zzso zzso contains a zzso expressed gene family zzso zzso localized forms of zzso zzso Three zzso from zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were isolated by their ability to functionally complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was reported previously zzso zzso and zzso reported here, have zzso and zzso zzso frames zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The translation products of both clones are highly zzso to zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso over their entire zzso including zzso terminal sequences resembling transit peptides for zzso zzso Both clones are less zzso to zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed only three genes with zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is the most highly expressed member of this gene zzso The zzso zzso share zzso with zzso from zzso a marine zzso and a zzso zzso but, not from zzso coli or zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso showed that the protein is structurally and zzso similar to zzso zzso but very different from the zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso with specific activities zzso primary product zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso 25 degrees zzso for zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Despite the zzso zzso and kinetic differences between higher plant and zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso are able to functionally complement zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
