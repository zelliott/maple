The zzso and zzso of dissolved organic carbon zzso by marine zzso is a major process in the ocean carbon zzso However, little information exists on the specific zzso functions of participating bacteria and on whether individual zzso specialize on particular components of the marine zzso zzso Here we use experimental zzso to show that coastal communities are populated by zzso capable of zzso a wide variety of organic carbon zzso zzso DNA captured from bacterial community zzso zzso a single model component of the zzso pool zzso zzso or zzso showed substantial overlap in gene composition as well as a diversity of zzso capabilities beyond the selected zzso Our direct measure of niche breadth for bacterial functional zzso indicates that, in accordance with ecological theory, zzso in the composition and supply of organic carbon to coastal oceans may zzso zzso zzso In the important interplay between microbial community structure and zzso zzso coastal zzso communities may be controlled less by transient changes in the carbon zzso that they process and more by factors such as zzso interactions and physical zzso
