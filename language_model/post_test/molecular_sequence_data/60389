zzso zzso genes are zzso regulators that control development of the zzso zzso Although they are mostly active during embryonic life, some of them remain expressed in the zzso zzso suggesting their involvement in regulating differentiated functions of the neuroendocrine zzso We show here that zzso a zzso domain gene originally described in cells of the immune system, is one of the controlling components of the zzso signaling process underlying the zzso regulation of female zzso zzso of the anterior zzso cause sexual zzso and zzso some of the events leading to the normal initiation of zzso zzso among these events is an increased zzso expression of the gene zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in the zzso control of zzso zzso The present study shows that such zzso result in the rapid and selective increase in zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso surrounding the zzso zzso In both zzso and normal zzso there is a preferential increase in zzso expression of the zzso and zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso with an increase in zzso zzso zzso levels preceding that in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso steroid zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso alpha gene via recognition motifs contained in the zzso alpha gene zzso zzso of zzso synthesis reduces zzso alpha expression in zzso cells and delays the initiation of zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene is one of the upstream components of the zzso to zzso signaling process that controls the onset of female zzso in zzso
