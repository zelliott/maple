We have investigated how zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso the host range of this zzso zzso zzso were introduced into the zzso gene of zzso which resulted in the zzso of the zzso protein from a zzso 354 zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso and 193 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso genes from a zzso virus zzso zzso resulted in normal zzso and processing of the zzso to zzso and zzso or the truncated TM proteins zzso and zzso When expressed on the surface of zzso cells, all three zzso zzso fusion of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso were capable of efficient replication in zzso peripheral blood zzso and zzso zzso in contrast, only zzso that contained zzso were capable of rapid infection of zzso zzso Both truncated zzso were capable of efficiently zzso infection of both zzso and zzso cells by an zzso human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso however, was unable to mediate human zzso virus infection of zzso cells when zzso with this zzso An analysis of the protein composition of zzso released from infected zzso cells showed that the zzso zzso contained significantly higher levels of zzso compared with the wild zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso domain removes a block at the level of zzso virus entry into zzso cells and points to a role for zzso density in determining virus zzso
