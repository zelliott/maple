Development of the zzso system is dependent on the activity of zinc finger zzso factors zzso by the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso resulting from a zzso and a zzso zzso in this gene suggest that zzso proteins act in concert with another factor with which they form zzso Here we report the cloning of zzso a gene which encodes an zzso zzso that zzso with zzso zzso In contrast to zzso is expressed from the zzso stem cell to the mature zzso is first detected in more committed zzso with a zzso potential and is strongly zzso as these differentiate into zzso and zzso cell zzso The expression patterns of zzso and zzso the relative zzso activity of their zzso and zzso complexes, and the dominant interfering effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso activity all strongly suggest that zzso acts in concert with zzso during zzso zzso We therefore propose that increasing levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso complexes in zzso zzso are essential for normal progression to a mature and zzso zzso
