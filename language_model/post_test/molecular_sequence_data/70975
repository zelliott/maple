zzso control of zzso at the zzso zzso locus is crucial for development of the gamma delta and alpha beta T cell zzso Because the zzso delta locus is embedded within the alpha zzso zzso of any V zzso alpha zzso the delta zzso zzso expression of a functional gamma delta zzso zzso 100 zzso spanning the C zzso alpha region has been zzso from both human and zzso and comparison has revealed an unexpectedly high degree of conservation between the zzso Of interest in terms of regulation, several highly zzso sequence blocks zzso zzso over zzso 50 zzso were identified that did not zzso to known regulatory elements such as the zzso alpha and delta enhancers or to coding zzso One of these blocks lying between J alpha 4 and J alpha 3, which appears to be zzso in other zzso has been shown to augment zzso alpha zzso function in zzso and zzso bind factors from nuclear zzso To further assess a plausible regulatory role for this element, we have created mice in which this zzso sequence block is either deleted or replaced with a zzso resistance gene driven by the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso of this zzso sequence block in zzso did have a local effect on J alpha zzso echoing the in zzso zzso However, its replacement with zzso had a much more dramatic, long range effect, perhaps zzso the importance of maintaining overall structure at this zzso
