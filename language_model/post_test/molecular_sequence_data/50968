A procedure utilizing immobilized zzso I that allows the efficient amplification of zzso by zzso from a single cell in the absence of zzso zzso DNA is zzso zzso I treated, total zzso derived from single cells was reverse transcribed into zzso followed by zzso using zzso and zzso specific zzso that recognize different zzso of the respective zzso zzso products corresponding to zzso but not to zzso zzso were detected after treatment with immobilized zzso I in samples previously shown to be contaminated with zzso zzso This method allows the efficient removal of DNA zzso total zzso derived from a single zzso
