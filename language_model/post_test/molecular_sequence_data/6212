We report an extension of zzso zzso zzso technology to the identification of transcribed sequences from zzso artificial zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing mouse zzso DNA was zzso and used as the target DNA for the zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel direct zzso approach was employed to increase the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso product was then used to generate a zzso zzso zzso chosen individual zzso from this library were zzso and the results indicate that zzso met sequence criteria characteristic of zzso zzso whereas zzso were background from identified zzso zzso mapping efforts suggest eight putative last zzso present within this zzso whereas zzso studies demonstrate that three reside within valid expressed zzso
