The sequences of more than 600 zzso zzso produced as a consequence of in zzso DNA replication on an zzso zzso DNA template by the zzso coli zzso I zzso zzso or its large zzso zzso zzso were zzso Four categories of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso base zzso zzso zzso deletions and zzso complex zzso zzso that change both the base sequence and the number of bases in a concerted zzso zzso The template sequence zzso previously identified as a zzso hotspot for zzso deletions opposite G, is also a hotspot for zzso A zzso warm spot for zzso deletions was zzso Among base zzso transitions were more frequent than zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletions were found only after zzso zzso Although each of these deletions can be explained by a zzso zzso by directly repeated DNA zzso deletion zzso were often different for repeats of the same zzso Both zzso and zzso produced many complex zzso zzso The new sequences at the zzso sites are exactly complementary to nearby DNA sequences in the newly zzso DNA zzso In each case, zzso zzso could mediate the zzso needed to initiate the zzso zzso The zzso DNA synthesis accounts for the zzso changes at the zzso site and for zzso that could direct realignment of the DNA onto the zzso Most of the complex zzso sequences could be initiated by either zzso zzso involving zzso structures in newly zzso DNA or by zzso during zzso zzso The striking differences between the zzso of complex zzso zzso and zzso deletions by zzso and zzso identify the existence of zzso zzso that influence the frequency and specificity of zzso zzso and zzso
