zzso placement of the division zzso in zzso coli requires the zzso action of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso interact to form a zzso division inhibitor that blocks zzso at all potential division zzso zzso is able to antagonize zzso in a zzso sensitive manner, as it restricts zzso activity to the unwanted division sites at the cell zzso Here, we show that the zzso specificity function of zzso zzso in a structurally zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and circular zzso zzso indicate that this domain includes both alpha and beta secondary structure, while zzso zzso reveals that it also contains a region responsible for zzso zzso While zzso zzso indicates that the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso does not form a tightly folded structural domain, zzso analysis of a zzso corresponding to zzso indicates that this region forms a nascent zzso in which the zzso rapidly zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso region of zzso may be poised to adopt an zzso zzso when it interacts with the target of its zzso activity, presumably zzso
