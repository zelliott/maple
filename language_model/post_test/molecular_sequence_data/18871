The zzso complex zzso constitutes the major zzso antenna of zzso zzso zzso contains a characteristic sequence zzso termed zzso zzso consisting of zzso mostly zzso zzso zzso This motif is shared by a number of zzso proteins from zzso zzso that are termed zzso zzso zzso To gain insights into the functions of zzso proteins and their zzso zzso we functionally characterized a plant zzso zzso zzso This protein has been shown previously to stabilize zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso functions to anchor zzso to zzso First, we zzso the zzso domain of zzso or that of zzso zzso to zzso and expressed these zzso proteins in an zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso As a result, the transgenic plants restored zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is active as long as it is anchored to zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso we addressed the question why the zzso motif is zzso in the zzso zzso We modified the zzso domain of zzso which contains the zzso zzso by substituting its zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso with zzso As a result, the zzso transgenic plants partly recovered the zzso zzso However, in these transgenic plants, the zzso complexes were partially zzso zzso these results indicate that the zzso motif of zzso is involved in the complex formation of zzso and zzso which might contribute to the zzso zzso
