The zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso 4 zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso and requires zzso DNA to catalyze DNA zzso We report that optimal rates of unwinding of zzso DNA require zzso tails of 55 zzso on the zzso strand and 15 zzso on the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso bound to a zzso zzso fully zzso for the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that excluding the zzso DNA strand from the center of the zzso is an essential aspect of the mechanism of zzso zzso DNA zzso We also report that zzso bound to a zzso zzso within the zzso strand of the zzso region zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso bound to a zzso zzso within the zzso region of the other strand has no zzso These results zzso demonstrate that the zzso gene 4 protein is a zzso zzso and imply that during DNA unwinding the zzso strand zzso the center of the ring while the zzso strand is excluded from the center of the zzso zzso for zzso between a zzso and other zzso complexes are zzso
