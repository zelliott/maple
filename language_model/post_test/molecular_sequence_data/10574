Unlike the random distribution of fiber types seen in skeletal muscles of most zzso pig muscle exhibits a zzso pattern consisting of zzso of slow fibers surrounded by concentric circles of type zzso and zzso zzso Within each zzso of slow zzso one of the central fibers is a primary zzso whereas all others are secondary zzso The present study demonstrates that a zzso of the slow secondary fibers zzso expresses zzso heavy chain zzso Two zzso libraries were made from zzso zzso skeletal muscle of zzso zzso and adult pig zzso the latter muscle is mainly composed of zzso zzso of the libraries with a human zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of positive zzso clones in both zzso the zzso sequence of the zzso region zzso was identical in both zzso As this zzso zzso had zzso zzso with the human zzso it was identified as pig zzso Using specific zzso zzso and zzso against pig zzso and zzso I zzso we studied the expression of these zzso in developing pig zzso muscle by combining in zzso zzso and zzso on serial sections at 90 days of zzso and at 1, 6, 35 days and 6 months of zzso The results showed that a zzso of secondary fibers that directly abut primary zzso zzso produced zzso both at the levels of the protein and its zzso zzso these zzso expressed zzso At 1 day, zzso showed that zzso of the secondary fibers expressed zzso among which zzso did not yet express zzso At 6 days, zzso and zzso were mostly present in the same zzso zzso zzso of the secondary zzso zzso the proportion of secondary fibers reacting with zzso zzso decreased to zzso at 5 weeks and zzso at 6 months, whereas zzso was still accumulating in about 38% of the secondary zzso During the period zzso the distribution of zzso and zzso transcripts closely matched that of the corresponding zzso zzso of zzso was not detected in primary type I muscle fibers and slow type I secondary fibers at the periphery of the zzso of slow zzso This study is the first unequivocal demonstration of a zzso expression of zzso in a zzso of secondary fibers in a limb skeletal muscle during zzso zzso
