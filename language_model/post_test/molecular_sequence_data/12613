zzso a gene that suppresses zzso in two essential zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was isolated on a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene revealed an open reading frame predicting an zzso zzso This protein is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene product that has a cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso of zzso is zzso indicating that zzso is essential for cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso progression is defective at the zzso temperature, followed by cell division with unequal zzso segregation accompanied by loss of zzso is synthetic lethal with any one of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at all zzso Moreover, zzso cells are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is a part of the DNA zzso II complex during zzso DNA replication and also acts in a checkpoint zzso during the S phase of the cell cycle to sense stalled DNA zzso
