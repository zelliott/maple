zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso acid to zzso in most zzso except humans and certain zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence for zzso zzso zzso was determined and used in a novel procedure for generating complementary DNA zzso zzso to this zzso acid zzso The procedure is based on the zzso chain reaction and zzso mixed zzso zzso complementary to the reverse translation products of an zzso acid zzso This rapid and simple zzso cloning procedure is generally zzso and requires only a partial zzso acid zzso A zzso probe developed by this procedure was used to isolate a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and to demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso sequences in zzso
