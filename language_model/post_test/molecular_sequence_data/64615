zzso in zzso platforms used in gene array analysis experiments can lead to significant differences in zzso zzso In this study we used quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso to investigate zzso results between the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences zzso and zzso zzso platforms used to evaluate zzso gene expression changes in rats exposed to zzso zzso zzso platform zzso results showed decreases in gene expression levels for the high-dose zzso zzso pooled samples compared with their zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso platform showed increases in expression levels for these zzso zzso gene expression zzso provide an explanation for the discrepancies observed for these zzso In the case of zzso there is a zzso sequence in the zzso clone that is absent in the zzso zzso The zzso based on the zzso clone shows zzso zzso suppression relative to the day 7 high-dose zzso zzso These data demonstrate the importance of using a zzso zzso such as zzso to confirm key zzso results as well as to understand the sources of discrepancies resulting from different zzso zzso
