The zzso acid sequence for the Class II zzso on 70 zzso cell lines was compared with the zzso reactions produced by 13,000 zzso zzso against these zzso Many of the zzso reaction patterns correlated completely with unique zzso acids at a given zzso zzso we zzso that the zzso were reacting directly with these zzso zzso zzso Among 131 variable zzso zzso several zzso zzso were found to 64 zzso Among 94 zzso zzso zzso were found to 59 zzso The location of these zzso defined zzso on the zzso is shown in the zzso We conclude that much of the zzso reactions of Class II can be explained by zzso to the zzso zzso zzso It can be shown that many of the zzso that were previously considered zzso are directed against these zzso These zzso defined zzso are clearly zzso and are probably important in transplant zzso
