zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso factor zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein degradation, in zzso Previously, we zzso a highly dispersed gene family, zzso whose members could potentially zzso different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso located at zzso zzso is the only identified family member with zzso and encodes a zzso sequence identical to that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions was performed to establish which are transcribed under normal zzso conditions and after heat zzso zzso activity was observed only with the zzso zzso the minimal promoter lying within a region 100 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso No evidence for the presence of zzso or zzso transcripts was observed in human or zzso zzso and cell zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso and zzso are likely to zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso promoter contained no zzso or zzso zzso zzso interaction studies confirmed the presence of binding sites for the zzso factors zzso and zzso in the zzso minimal zzso zzso of these binding sites indicated that these factors are crucial for zzso of this zzso
