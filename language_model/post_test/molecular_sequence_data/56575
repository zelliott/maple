zzso zzso from zzso in the zzso group vary in size from 28 to 101 zzso zzso of genes has shown that the three smallest zzso of zzso zzso have the same gene order, whereas the three larger zzso zzso of zzso zzso are rearranged relative to the smaller molecules and between zzso To examine the relationships between these zzso a zzso tree has been constructed by sequence comparison of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from the six zzso zzso to zzso the tree shows that the larger rearranged zzso are more closely related than the smaller zzso This result indicates that the gene order of the smaller zzso zzso zzso is ancestral and that larger zzso molecules zzso zzso are more prone to zzso than smaller zzso
