zzso zzso proteins provide an ideal model for studying zzso integration at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso There are multiple pathways for delivering zzso proteins from the zzso to the zzso membrane yet, whereas an zzso route zzso none of the zzso components involved had been zzso In this study we have directly addressed this issue and identify novel interactions between a model zzso protein and the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso To investigate their function, we have zzso the membrane integration of zzso proteins using zzso zzso zzso we find that a combination of zzso and zzso can completely substitute for the zzso factors present in zzso On the basis of this in zzso analysis, we conclude that this zzso pair can efficiently facilitate the zzso integration of zzso zzso
