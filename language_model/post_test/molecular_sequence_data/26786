zzso is expressed through early development and strongly during inner ear development zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso of zzso during early zzso development interferes with zzso zzso zzso labeling showed that zzso expression was concentrated on and within the zzso zzso was faintly detected at the lateral surface zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells and in the zzso zzso labeled zzso containing zzso were detected within the zzso (the fluid within the zzso zzso and associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso structures detected in the zzso were larger and more numerous in zzso zzso zzso We present evidence supporting a working model that zzso structures containing zzso (perhaps containing zzso zzso are exported from the zzso zzso into the zzso adhere to one another and to the surface of the growing zzso zzso zzso zzso
