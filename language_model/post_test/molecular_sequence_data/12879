A 297 zzso zzso of the zzso 16 zzso gene was zzso from 35 zzso originating from normal cervical zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso and cervical zzso zzso from South African zzso A total of six point zzso that differed from the zzso zzso 16 sequence were detected in various combinations, giving rise to six distinct types of zzso Only one of the zzso had a sequence identical to the zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso gene is zzso and there is no evidence that specific viral zzso zzso zzso are associated with specific zzso
