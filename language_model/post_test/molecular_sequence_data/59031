The zzso sequencing and expression in model systems of the previously unidentified beta zzso recently led to an extensive functional zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso studies helped define a specific profile that is quite distinct from that of the beta zzso and beta zzso but strongly reminiscent of most of the zzso zzso responses reported in earlier pharmacological zzso More recently, a naturally occurring variation in the human beta zzso has been correlated with zzso obesity and with increased dynamic capacity to add on weight and develop zzso dependent diabetes in Western obese zzso zzso zzso and France zzso describe how results now provide a consistent picture of an important role for the human beta zzso in the regulation of zzso metabolism and as an obvious target for drugs to treat some forms of obesity and zzso
