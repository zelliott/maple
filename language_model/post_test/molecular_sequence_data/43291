A number of proteins from a zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso gel of mouse liver zzso zzso were identified by zzso mass mapping and sequence database zzso The excised protein spots were processed by in zzso reduction and zzso followed by zzso zzso The masses of the resulting zzso zzso were measured with a zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso These masses were used successfully to search a protein sequence zzso zzso silver zzso and zzso protocols allowed proteins to be identified routinely at the low zzso zzso The high mass accuracy and resolution provided by delayed extraction were important for high specificity in the database zzso zzso zzso data obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not only provided confirmation of zzso zzso but could be used to identify the protein from a single zzso without spectral zzso
