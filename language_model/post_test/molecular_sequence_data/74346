To begin zzso and molecular studies on the zzso of the type II zzso chains on zzso zzso we adopted a zzso approach to identify and systematically zzso the putative zzso zzso responsible for zzso the zzso linkage from zzso zzso from zzso zzso These analyses confirmed that 20 members of the zzso family contained zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso data confirm that members of this family are expressed throughout all zzso making them likely candidates for the assembly of the zzso found zzso One member, zzso was selected for further analysis including location studies that confirmed its presence in the zzso and preliminary zzso zzso specificity studies that demonstrated zzso zzso This zzso study of zzso zzso was validated by the recent report of zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso 2007) that another member of this family zzso zzso encodes a zzso involved in the zzso of the Lewis a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
