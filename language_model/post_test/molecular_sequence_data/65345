zzso a method is described to increase the information density of sequencing experiments used to zzso zzso acid zzso The method is facile and should be zzso to any selection zzso A critical feature of this method is the use of zzso zzso to amplify and zzso a zzso restriction site on both ends of a zzso zzso After amplification, the zzso reaction is captured onto zzso zzso washed, and zzso directly on the zzso zzso zzso zzso clean product that is devoid of partially zzso products and unincorporated zzso zzso The product's complementary ends are zzso and zzso together with T4 DNA zzso Analysis of zzso products shows formation of zzso of different length and little zzso zzso zzso results produced data that routinely contained three to four copies of the zzso This method allows for more efficient zzso of zzso relationships since multiple active sequences are identified from a single zzso
