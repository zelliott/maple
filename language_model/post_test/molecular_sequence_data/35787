The human zzso factor zzso binds to the zzso zzso core zzso sequence in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The consensus binding site for zzso resembles that of members of the zzso domain protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso requires a zzso binding zzso Analysis of binding sites containing point zzso revealed that zzso binding is determined by the core zzso of the binding site, while zzso zzso is determined both by the core and some peripheral zzso that do not affect zzso We have zzso zzso and analyzed its two constituent zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso approximately zzso makes the primary DNA zzso zzso beta zzso approximately 50 zzso forms a zzso complex with zzso alpha both in solution and on a zzso binding zzso zzso of both zzso zzso is necessary, but not zzso for zzso zzso We present zzso and functional evidence that zzso alpha is related to the zzso zzso protein zzso alpha and that zzso beta is related to the zzso protein zzso zzso
