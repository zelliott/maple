zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso That is, it is not detected in normal mouse skin, however, a significant increase in expression is detected in the skin of zzso zzso strains of mice after zzso zzso In this study, we found zzso zzso zzso expression is a result of increased zzso in zzso primary zzso and further investigated zzso regulation of zzso expression by cloning its zzso The cloned zzso promoter ( approximately 2 zzso in which a zzso initiation site was mapped at zzso from the zzso has neither a zzso box nor a zzso zzso However, the promoter was highly responsive to zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso primary zzso We then identified a zzso binding site located zzso to zzso from the zzso that is a zzso element zzso of the promoter and that zzso zzso and zzso proteins bind to the zzso We also found that the binding of these proteins to the zzso was significantly increased by zzso treatment and zzso of the binding by zzso A decreased zzso promoter activity as well as zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that increased binding of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso of the zzso promoter is a mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso
