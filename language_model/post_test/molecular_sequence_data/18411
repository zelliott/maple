B and T cell zzso expressed on the surface of zzso a major constituent of the envelope of zzso B virus zzso are essential for zzso protective immunity against zzso zzso A segment of the zzso sequence encompassing zzso zzso is a portion of overlapping B and T cell zzso This sequence is zzso among distinct zzso zzso of zzso and has a zzso zzso with an analogous sequence in zzso of nonhuman zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso having zzso acid replacements within the zzso sequence were discerned zzso The impact of zzso acid replacements within this sequence on its zzso recognition at both the B and T cell levels was explored by zzso replacement set zzso zzso of the analysis permit discrimination between tolerated and forbidden zzso acid replacements and provide a background for the development of zzso and zzso specific for emerging zzso zzso
