To identify specific bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso we exploited zzso zzso which zzso both bacterial and human zzso The X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso showed multiple binding modes of the zzso which prevented a classical zzso drug design zzso To overcome this issue, we zzso two zzso libraries that were tested against zzso zzso and then we performed X-ray zzso screening of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso higher affinity for bacterial zzso than human zzso The X-ray zzso screening characterized the binding mode of six zzso in complexes with zzso Of these, zzso zzso and zzso showed a common unique binding mode, whereas zzso showed a different, unique binding zzso A comparative analysis of the zzso X-ray complexes that were obtained with the zzso zzso enabled the selection of compounds zzso and zzso as specific compounds and starting points to be exploited for the specific zzso of pathogen zzso
