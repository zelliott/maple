The zzso zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso creates a hot spot of zzso zzso A single base zzso the zzso zzso is situated within the open reading frame, near the zzso zzso It has previously been shown that the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso which includes the zzso zzso is required for hot spot zzso The zzso zzso deletion encompasses the promoter and the first 23 zzso of the open reading frame, ending 112 zzso upstream of zzso zzso of the promoter in zzso to zzso zzso hot spot activity, while deletion in trans to zzso has no zzso zzso deletion of the promoter also eliminates zzso hot spot activity, indicating that the zzso created through deletion of the promoter per zzso is not responsible for the loss of hot spot zzso Thus, DNA sequences other than the zzso zzso zzso zzso which must be located at the zzso end of the zzso zzso appear to be required for hot spot zzso While the zzso hotspot stimulates crossovers associated with zzso conversion, it does not affect the crossover frequency in the intervals adjacent to zzso The zzso marker zzso a zzso created by zzso of the zzso gene upstream of zzso turned out to be a hot spot zzso It shows disparity of conversion with preferential loss of the zzso The frequency of conversion at zzso is reduced when the zzso hot spot is active 15 zzso away, indicating competition for zzso factors by hot spots in close zzso
