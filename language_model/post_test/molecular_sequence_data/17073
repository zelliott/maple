The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso the fusion of zzso with host zzso During the fusion process, three zzso zzso and three zzso zzso pack in an zzso direction to form a zzso zzso X-ray zzso analysis of the zzso core demonstrated that within each zzso zzso there is a deep and large pocket, formed by a cluster of zzso in the zzso zzso In this report, we systematically analyzed the role of seven zzso zzso that are either lining or packing this pocket on the zzso and zzso interaction using novel zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso that are lining the side chain and right wall of the pocket are important for establishing a productive zzso zzso zzso and zzso completely abolished zzso while replication of the zzso and zzso zzso was significantly attenuated relative to wild zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso that insert into the pocket are essential for zzso The impaired zzso of these seven zzso is in part attributed to the loss in binding affinity of the zzso zzso zzso modeling of the crystal structure of the zzso further shows that zzso substitution of those zzso zzso the zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso domain play a key role in zzso infection and this zzso pocket is a good target for development of zzso against zzso In addition, our data indicate that the novel zzso polarization zzso described in this study could be valuable in screening for zzso that block the zzso interaction and zzso zzso
