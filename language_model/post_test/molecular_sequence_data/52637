zzso transformation is accompanied by altered cell surface zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso branches are associated with tumor invasion and zzso zzso compounds that can enter cells and block zzso of zzso zzso without overt zzso are potential zzso zzso We have developed a homogeneous zzso zzso for detection of such zzso The method enables identification of agents that block zzso zzso expression after incubation for zzso h with zzso tumor cells, thereby protecting the cells from the subsequent addition of zzso a zzso plant zzso We observed that zzso cell number is directly zzso to the level of zzso alkaline zzso activity measured zzso in cultures after the addition of zzso The alkaline zzso zzso was capable of detecting as few as 1,500 zzso The zzso was readily adapted for zzso screening as zzso costs are low and no cell harvesting and washing steps are zzso Under zzso operating conditions, the zzso of variation for controls was found to be zzso The results suggest that measurement of alkaline zzso in this cell zzso format may be adapted for wider applications in zzso screenings for compounds that relieve cells from other growth zzso
