We evaluated a spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso which was zzso in an infant mouse and had reduced expression of zzso toxin and zzso in response to environmental zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes in the zzso were normal, but zzso of zzso was zzso A zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso The zzso resulted from a zzso in a string of nine G zzso within zzso similar zzso zzso in zzso arose at a frequency of zzso during overnight growth and in the majority of colonies by the end of 5 days of growth in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was regulated by temperature and pH independently of zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso couples environmental signals zzso and zzso to expression of the zzso zzso and provide a model for phase variation in the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso
