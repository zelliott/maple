The human immune system contains T and B zzso which respond in an zzso manner to foreign zzso These foreign zzso are recognized by zzso receptors expressed on the cell surface of T and B zzso The zzso that make up the T and B cell zzso complexes have been identified, but their zzso and positions in the complex remain to be zzso zzso of the zzso structures is necessary to understand the molecular basis of signal zzso events which follow zzso recognition and will contribute to the design of drugs that can zzso T and B cell zzso Here, I will discuss recent insights into the zzso structures of the zzso and zzso and the striking similarities between the two, both in the structures of the zzso and in the overall zzso zzso In addition, the zzso assembly processes of these zzso complexes will be discussed, as well as the recent realization that these processes appear to be zzso by zzso proteins that zzso bind to partial zzso and zzso zzso Similar to the role of zzso which mediates assembly processes of B cell zzso a recently identified zzso protein of 90 zzso called zzso appears to play a role in zzso and zzso assembly zzso zzso of the zzso protein might contribute not only insight into the folding and assembly processes in zzso but also into those of newly zzso proteins in many different cell zzso
