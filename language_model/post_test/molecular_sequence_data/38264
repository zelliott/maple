The importance of zzso in zzso stems from its central role in inducing cell cycle arrest or zzso in response to cellular zzso We have identified a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to human zzso binding sites, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function renders cells resistant to X zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is required for the zzso response to DNA zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso appears unable to induce a zzso cell cycle block when zzso and zzso of zzso activity does not affect X zzso cell cycle zzso These data reveal an ancestral zzso function for zzso and identify zzso as an ideal model system for zzso the zzso zzso zzso induced by DNA zzso
