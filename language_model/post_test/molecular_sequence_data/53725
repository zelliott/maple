zzso 21 is the smallest human zzso An extra copy of zzso 21 causes Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic cause of significant mental zzso which affects up to 1 in 700 live zzso Several anonymous zzso for zzso disorders and zzso for common complex disorders have also been mapped to this zzso and loss of zzso has been observed in regions associated with solid zzso Here we report the sequence and gene zzso of the long arm of zzso zzso We have zzso zzso base pairs zzso of DNA with very high zzso the largest zzso being zzso zzso Only three small clone gaps and seven sequencing gaps remain, zzso about 100 zzso Thus, we achieved zzso coverage of zzso We also zzso zzso zzso from the short zzso The structural features identified include zzso that are probably involved in zzso abnormalities and repeat structures in the zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso revealed zzso known zzso 98 predicted genes and 59 zzso
