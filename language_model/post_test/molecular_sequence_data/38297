The present work zzso zzso interactions underlying the zzso affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso site of the muscle zzso zzso zzso We zzso all zzso zzso in zzso zzso expressed the zzso zzso form of the zzso in zzso human embryonic kidney cells, and measured binding of the zzso toxins by competition against the initial rate of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all decrease affinity for zzso zzso by zzso Side chains at these four positions zzso to a restricted region of the known three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso reveal major contributions to zzso zzso affinity by zzso in the alpha zzso and by the selectivity zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the delta zzso By using double zzso cycles analysis, we find that zzso of zzso zzso interacts strongly with all three selectivity zzso in the delta zzso and that zzso and zzso are zzso in stabilizing zzso We find additional strong interactions between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and selectivity zzso in the delta zzso and between zzso and zzso and zzso in the alpha zzso The overall results reveal the orientation of zzso zzso when bound to the zzso interface and show that primarily zzso interactions stabilize the zzso
