An escape zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso which was selected by serial passage in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso exhibited remarkable zzso formation and zzso cell death in zzso cells but no difference in zzso for the zzso inhibitor zzso from that of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso virus also had higher replication and plaque formation zzso The zzso virus acquired two zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso at position 170 and Ala to zzso zzso in fusion zzso zzso but no zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using cells zzso F and zzso genes with zzso zzso we demonstrated that a point zzso of zzso to zzso at position zzso which was estimated to be located in zzso F zzso zzso repeat 1, was required for obvious zzso formation and zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso F zzso induced no zzso formation or cell zzso The findings suggest that a single zzso acid zzso of zzso F zzso promotes zzso formation that is followed by zzso cell zzso
