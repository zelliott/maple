The zzso zzso binding protein of zzso coli serves as an initial zzso for the active transport of and zzso toward zzso The three-dimensional structure of the binding protein zzso with zzso has been previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the structure of the zzso form of the binding protein refined to zzso zzso This structure, combined with that for the zzso form, provides the first zzso evidence that a major zzso zzso change occurs in a zzso binding zzso The zzso structure shows a zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso by approximately 35 degrees, relative to the zzso structure, opening the sugar binding site groove located between the two zzso In addition, there is an 8 degrees twist of one domain relative to the other zzso The zzso changes observed between this structure and the zzso structure are consistent with current models of zzso transport and zzso zzso and solidify a mechanism for zzso differentiation between the zzso and zzso forms in signal zzso
