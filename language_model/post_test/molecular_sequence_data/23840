zzso calcium binding proteins have remarkable sequence zzso and structural zzso yet their response to binding of calcium is diverse and they function in a wide range of biological zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso protein sequences to zzso specific zzso properties has been significantly advanced over the past 10 years by determination of atomic resolution zzso These data lay the foundation for addressing how functional selectivity is generated from a generic zzso zzso This review presents current ideas about the structural mechanisms that provide the selectivity of different zzso proteins for specific cellular targets, using zzso and zzso family proteins to demonstrate the critical zzso Three factors contribute significantly to target zzso molecular architecture, response to binding of zzso zzso and the characteristics of target binding zzso Comparisons of zzso and zzso proteins provide insights into the role these factors play in zzso the variety of binding zzso necessary for recognizing a diverse set of zzso
