Our recent study demonstrated that defects in zzso result in zzso zzso that is very similar to that observed in zzso zzso We revealed that the zzso fit the zzso signal zzso complex and played a zzso role in the development and function of B zzso In humans, most children with primary zzso zzso have zzso in the zzso whereas a few have defects in the components of the zzso signal zzso zzso But little is known about the genetic variation of zzso in children with defects in zzso zzso of unknown zzso Sixteen patients from 15 unrelated families and 112 normal controls underwent sequence analysis to identify genetic variations of the zzso zzso frequency in each group was also zzso and zzso We identified five single zzso zzso zzso exchanges in both patient and control groups with similar zzso zzso which did not contribute to the zzso Three of them are novel zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso exchanges are zzso zzso and zzso zzso The novel zzso was in complete linkage zzso with the known zzso in our study of Taiwanese zzso In addition, one novel single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in one boy with typical clinical features of primary zzso zzso and could not be found in either his family or the normal control zzso By atomic structural analysis of the zzso acid as well as the alignment comparison between species, it resulted in the replacement of the zzso zzso acid E with the zzso zzso acid K at zzso zzso located in the highly conservative and important zzso functional zzso Our findings could shed light on further understanding the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and different zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso raised the attention and warranted further extensive analysis to zzso the role of zzso in human zzso
