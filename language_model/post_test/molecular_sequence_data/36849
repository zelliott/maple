The mixed inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso area zzso of rats to determine if zzso zzso can zzso zzso transmission in the zzso zzso The concentration of zzso zzso content in the nucleus zzso was monitored using in zzso zzso simultaneously with measuring motor zzso zzso zzso into the zzso produced a zzso increase in motor activity and zzso zzso in the nucleus zzso While the change in zzso zzso was modest as compared to zzso stimulation by a zzso zzso such as zzso there was a marked increase in the zzso content of zzso and zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso transmission is under zzso control of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso area zzso
