zzso are ubiquitous essential zzso which have significant role in the zzso acid zzso Using in zzso approaches in the recent past we have identified a number of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In the present study we report zzso and detailed characterization of a novel zzso from zzso zzso Our results indicate that this zzso is a zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso and human, zzso The zzso characterization shows that it contains DNA and zzso zzso zzso acid dependent zzso and zzso binding zzso It is interesting to note that this zzso can unwind DNA duplexes in both zzso to 3' and 3' to zzso zzso Using truncated derivatives we further show that Q motif is essentially required for all of its zzso These studies should make an important contribution in understanding the zzso involved in zzso acid metabolism in the zzso
