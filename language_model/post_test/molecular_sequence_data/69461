An zzso zzso region of the promoter of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and its regulatory function zzso by deletion studies in an zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso box, a 10 zzso motif zzso zzso was found to be mandatory for zzso zzso This zzso motif is located between zzso zzso and zzso and is identical in 9 of 10 zzso with the regulatory motif found in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the 10 zzso sequence show high zzso zzso while elimination or zzso at three zzso positions, of the zzso motif in the context of an otherwise zzso promoter leads to total loss of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells is regulated by the zzso precursors zzso and zzso no such influence is seen in cells bearing zzso in the zzso regulatory genes zzso zzso and zzso There is no regulation by zzso and zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso However zzso not containing this sequence zzso intact to positions zzso or zzso are still controlled by zzso Other zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrogen mustard and nitrogen half mustard do not regulate expression of zzso
