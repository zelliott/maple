zzso zzso is assumed to be a key zzso in zzso zzso but direct in zzso evidence to support this hypothesis is still zzso In the present study, we found a new natural zzso purple eye zzso of zzso zzso zzso ( zzso ), which was a zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso of zzso The zzso resulted in a predicted protein with 15 additional zzso acids as compared to the zzso zzso Further analysis of protein structure showed that the predicted zzso protein probably had two more zzso which may cause instability of two zzso near the zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso binding zzso zzso ( zzso ) zzso showed eye color zzso with decrease of zzso level, as well as zzso content zzso The zzso zzso could be fully rescued by expression of wild type zzso in the zzso ( zzso ) background by zzso zzso ( zzso zzso ( zzso ) transgenic zzso All taken together, it can be concluded that the zzso in zzso is responsible for zzso reduction in zzso zzso ( zzso ), which provides key in zzso evidence to support the hypothesis that zzso is involved in zzso zzso
