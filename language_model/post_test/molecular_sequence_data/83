zzso host and cell zzso are determined by specific interactions between the viral spike zzso protein and host cell zzso Avian coronavirus infectious zzso zzso has been adapted to zzso chicken eggs, primary chicken kidney zzso cells, monkey kidney cell line zzso and other human and animal zzso Here we report that acquisition of the zzso fusion activity by zzso acid zzso in the S protein determines the zzso of zzso in cultured zzso zzso of S protein derived from zzso and zzso strains showed efficient induction of membrane zzso However, expression of S protein cloned from the third passage of zzso in chicken zzso zzso did not show apparent zzso zzso By construction of zzso S zzso and zzso zzso a point zzso zzso at zzso acid position zzso in the zzso repeat 1 region of S protein was shown to be responsible for its acquisition of the zzso fusion zzso Furthermore, a zzso point zzso in the zzso domain, which was acquired during further propagation of zzso zzso in zzso cells, could enhance the zzso fusion activity of the zzso zzso of zzso back to the S gene of zzso zzso allowed recovery of zzso that contain the introduced zzso However, zzso zzso in zzso and some distant regions of zzso were required for restoration of the zzso fusion activity of S protein carrying zzso and for the zzso of the recovered zzso in cultured zzso This study demonstrates that acquisition of the zzso fusion activity in S protein determines the selection and/or adaptation of a coronavirus from chicken zzso to cultured cells of human and animal zzso
