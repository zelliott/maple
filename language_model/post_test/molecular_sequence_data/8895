zzso zzso zzso establish the rules of the genetic code by zzso the formation of zzso The quality control for zzso is achieved by editing activity, which is usually carried out by a discrete editing zzso For zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1) domain is the editing domain responsible for zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain is universally present in zzso except zzso zzso mobile zzso The substitute of zzso in zzso is a zzso zzso In the present study, we show that the zzso which is critical for the zzso activity of zzso could zzso remarkable zzso activity on the inactive zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso could functionally compensate for the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso editing zzso These investigations provide a zzso framework for the modular construction of zzso and their zzso to achieve zzso efficiency and zzso These results also show that the zzso editing function of zzso originates from its zzso synthetic domain and shed light on future study of the zzso
