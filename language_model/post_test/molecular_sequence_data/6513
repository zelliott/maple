zzso growth factor zzso is a member of the zzso growth factor zzso group of zzso zzso In the present study we sought to determine whether zzso is expressed in human pancreatic zzso Using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso a zzso zzso of zzso was cloned and used to analyze Northern blots of zzso isolated from normal and zzso human pancreatic zzso Seven of 16 zzso pancreatic cancer samples revealed significant zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript by comparison with the normal zzso Northern zzso analysis failed to reveal the zzso transcript in several cultured human pancreatic cancer cell zzso However, by zzso analysis, some of the cell lines expressed zzso zzso Furthermore, 5 of 7 tested cell lines expressed the zzso zzso and the growth of one cell line was enhanced by human zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may participate in zzso zzso and zzso pathways in human pancreatic zzso
