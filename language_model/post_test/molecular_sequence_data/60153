The zzso of the zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso acid zzso gene was zzso c DNA was cloned from Poll zzso zzso Poll zzso calves affected with Maple zzso zzso Disease to identify the zzso responsible for the disease in Poll zzso zzso containing the c DNA sequences inherited from the Poll zzso zzso of the affected calves were zzso zzso clones were zzso and a zzso to zzso transition was found at zzso zzso The zzso is predicted to substitute zzso in place of a highly zzso zzso at zzso zzso A zzso chain reaction procedure was developed for detection of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Three Poll zzso parents of affected calves and three affected Poll zzso zzso Poll zzso calves were zzso and an affected Poll zzso calf was zzso for this zzso An improved zzso chain reaction procedure was also devised to zzso Poll zzso for the zzso zzso The procedures will facilitate disease prevention programs and assist in differential diagnosis of conditions in zzso calves that present with a rapid onset of progressive neurological disease and are zzso zzso by zzso zzso Maple zzso zzso Disease zzso is an zzso zzso zzso reported in humans zzso and zzso zzso and in Poll zzso zzso and Poll zzso zzso calves zzso et al 1986, zzso et al zzso The clinical, zzso and pathological manifestations of the disease are identical in the two breeds of zzso and are zzso by the rapid onset of progressive neurological disease, leading to death within a few days of zzso The disease is caused by a zzso of activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso This zzso leads to elevated zzso in blood and zzso of zzso chain zzso acids and their zzso the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consists of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso by separate zzso and zzso may result from zzso of any of the zzso In zzso zzso the disease in caused by premature termination of translation, of the zzso zzso that is induced by a zzso to zzso transition zzso 2 zzso that converts the zzso zzso zzso to a stop zzso zzso Zhang et al zzso We have shown that zzso zzso zzso calves are zzso at the zzso zzso illustrating molecular zzso exists for bovine zzso zzso and Dennis zzso The fact that these zzso calves are affected, indicates the zzso like the zzso zzso resides in the zzso zzso
