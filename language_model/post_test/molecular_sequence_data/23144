Over the past 10 years, resources have been established for the genetic analysis of pearl zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an important staple crop of the semi-arid regions of India and zzso Among these resources are detailed genetic maps containing both zzso and zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso and simple sequence repeats zzso zzso maps produced in four different crosses have been integrated to develop a consensus map of 353 zzso and 65 zzso zzso Some zzso of the markers are clustered and occupy less than a third of the total map zzso This phenomenon is independent of the zzso Our data suggest that extreme zzso of zzso toward the zzso ends, resulting in gaps on the genetic map of 30 zzso or more in the zzso regions, is typical for pearl zzso The unequal distribution of zzso has consequences for the transfer of genes controlling important zzso traits from donor to elite pearl zzso zzso The paper also describes the generation of 44 zzso markers from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, pearl zzso zzso had been generated from zzso zzso and the relative merits of both zzso are zzso
