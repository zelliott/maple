The zzso gene is zzso in familial zzso zzso zzso as well as in sporadic zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene is a 300 zzso zzso protein associated with the adherence junction protein zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso blocks zzso cell cycle progression from zzso to the S zzso zzso zzso identified in zzso and/or zzso zzso were less zzso and partially zzso the activity of the normal zzso The zzso blocking activity of zzso was alleviated by the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with this result, zzso activity of zzso was significantly zzso in cells zzso zzso although its synthesis remained zzso while zzso activity was barely zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle by zzso modulating the activity of zzso zzso
