zzso differences in the zzso zzso gene family in zzso zzso were studied on three zzso zzso within a zzso zzso within a population and zzso between species zzso zzso and zzso zzso The average difference within the zzso gene within a zzso was zzso per zzso site, about zzso of that within a population zzso The proportion of divergent sites between the two species was zzso which is about zzso times the difference within a zzso The distribution of divergence between species was similar to that of variation within a zzso zzso and variation were noted to be greatest in the 3' zzso region and least in the coding zzso zzso intermediate between these were found for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and variation in silent sites exceeded those in the total coding region, thus indicating possible zzso selection for zzso zzso zzso relations among zzso genes and genetic differences on these three levels are evidence for the concerted evolution of the zzso gene zzso The molecular mechanism by which variation is produced and maintained is zzso
