We previously obtained gene expression profiles of 8 matched zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso using DNA zzso To identify novel tumor zzso genes involved in zzso zzso we here analyze genes showing lower expression in zzso tumors than in normal zzso zzso A search for loss of zzso zzso in 49 regions that harbor consistently zzso genes revealed zzso in only 4 regions and in just a very small number of zzso To determine whether the zzso might be due to promoter zzso we used combined zzso restriction analysis and zzso sequencing to study 7 zzso zzso Loss of expression of zzso and zzso is accompanied by zzso in the zzso regions of these zzso but zzso was not seen in other genes zzso Combined treatment with the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso resulted in zzso and zzso of the zzso gene in the cell line zzso Treatment with zzso alone restored zzso expression in a zzso cancer cell line, zzso In conclusion, zzso is a remarkably rare mechanism of loss of gene function in zzso In contrast, zzso of promoter zzso islands seems to occur at higher zzso zzso and zzso are novel genes that are likely involved in the zzso of sporadic zzso
