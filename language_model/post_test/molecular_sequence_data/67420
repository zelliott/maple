zzso is a process in which genetic drift and selection cause divergence over zzso However, there is no rule dictating the time required for zzso and even low levels of gene flow hinder zzso so that zzso may be poised at the threshold of zzso for long periods of evolutionary zzso We zzso zzso DNA zzso and eight nuclear zzso zzso to estimate zzso levels of differentiation and gene flow between the zzso common teal zzso zzso zzso and the North American zzso teal zzso zzso zzso These ducks come into contact in zzso zzso Asia and zzso North zzso and have probably done so, perhaps zzso since the zzso transition, zzso zzso when they apparently began zzso They have zzso differences in male zzso and are zzso divergent in the zzso control region, with only 1 of 58 zzso and 2 of 86 zzso having zzso grouping with the zzso Two nuclear zzso were likewise strongly structured between these teal zzso zzso zzso but six zzso were zzso or only zzso structured zzso zzso zzso Gene flow between zzso and zzso was zzso individual per generation in both directions in zzso but was zzso in zzso with zzso and zzso individuals per generation immigrating into zzso and zzso zzso This study illustrates that species zzso using a single marker zzso the complexity of the zzso process, and it suggests that even with divergent selection, moderate levels of gene flow may stall the zzso process short of zzso
