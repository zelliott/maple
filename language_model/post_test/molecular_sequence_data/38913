The complete sequences of the zzso and zzso genes coding for the zzso and zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences indicated a number of zzso binding consensus sequences whilst zzso secondary structure analysis revealed a similar pattern of zzso and zzso structures between the two zzso which was indicative of gene zzso
