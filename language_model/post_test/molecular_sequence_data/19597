zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor that supports zzso stem cell survival and expansion and is the principal regulator of zzso growth and zzso Several small, zzso molecules have been identified as selective human zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand how the small zzso zzso mimic zzso interacts and activates zzso we performed zzso domain swap and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso interacts specifically with the zzso zzso region zzso and the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and solid-state zzso structural studies using a zzso containing the zzso sequences showed that this region of zzso unexpectedly, consists of two zzso separated by a few zzso zzso zzso interacts specifically with zzso in the TM domain and a few distinct zzso in the zzso region and affects several specific zzso TM domain zzso The unique structural information provided by these studies both sheds light on the distinctive mechanism of action of zzso and provides valuable insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso
