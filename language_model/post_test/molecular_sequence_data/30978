For zzso of zzso from the late zzso promoter of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso which zzso with zzso is required, together with the product of zzso gene zzso Using our zzso zzso technique for generation of precise zzso we have confirmed that deletions removing DNA downstream of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso start point zzso zzso zzso do not affect the efficiency of zzso zzso at the same time we found that deleting one more zzso zzso the right-hand boundary to zzso zzso reduces zzso by only zzso zzso another 5 or 6 zzso zzso or zzso zzso right-hand zzso zzso decreases zzso by about zzso These deletions reduce the zzso repeat zzso or zzso in zzso to only the five zzso zzso Similar strong reduction in zzso (by about zzso was obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which also contained zzso or zzso insertions between zzso zzso and zzso or between zzso and zzso Since the latter deletions retain only zzso zzso of the direct zzso it appears that zzso is dependent on the length and zzso of the direct zzso
