To examine how zzso acid sequences outside of the zzso domain of zzso influence the functional activity of this zzso we have introduced deletion zzso within the zzso half of zzso These zzso caused distinct changes in the zzso properties of the zzso gene products and in the properties of cells infected with zzso carrying these zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso which contains a deletion of zzso acids 15 to 89, displayed a zzso zzso zzso formed zzso tightly packed colonies in soft zzso and contained elevated levels of cellular zzso zzso Thus, deletion of zzso acids 15 to 89 can activate the zzso activity and transforming potential of the zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso acids 112 to zzso however, did not increase the zzso activity or transforming ability of zzso indeed, deletion of these sequences in zzso suppressed zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso expressing the zzso or zzso gene products zzso deletions of zzso acids 15 to 225 and 55 to zzso zzso displayed a zzso zzso zzso and formed diffuse colonies in soft zzso the zzso proteins displayed an increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, only a few cellular proteins contained elevated levels of zzso in zzso Thus, deletions downstream of zzso acid 89 severely restricted the ability of zzso to zzso cellular zzso in zzso without affecting the intrinsic zzso zzso activity of the zzso gene zzso These results suggest the existence of at least two zzso regions within the zzso half of zzso that are important for the regulation of zzso zzso activity and for the interaction of zzso with cellular zzso
