zzso is a zzso gene product reported to be required for cell fusion zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso Because Northern blots revealed expression only in muscle and bone, the suggestion was made that zzso is expressed exclusively by zzso cells in these zzso zzso and zzso We studied expression of zzso zzso in a panel of zzso and cell lines using the zzso chain reaction and found it widely zzso zzso zzso was readily detected in the zzso the most abundant cell type in zzso In zzso zzso analysis on sections of zzso mice revealed high levels of expression in the zzso zzso of long bones, the zzso regions of the zzso and its underlying zzso We conclude that expression of zzso zzso is not restricted to zzso cells and that, in bone, the zzso is the major zzso
