A rapid increase in research on the relationship between zzso modifications and their subsequent reactions in the nucleus has revealed that the zzso modification system is complex, and robust against point zzso The prevailing theoretical framework (the zzso code zzso is inadequate to explain either the complexity or zzso making the zzso of a new theoretical framework both necessary and zzso Here, we develop a model of the regulatory network of zzso modifications in which we zzso zzso modifications as zzso and regulatory interactions between zzso modifications as zzso This network has zzso properties and zzso with a zzso symmetry structure, which supports the zzso of the zzso modification zzso In addition, we show that the zzso tail regions of zzso are suitable for the acquisition of this zzso zzso Our model and related insights provide the first framework for an overall architecture of a zzso modification network system, particularly with regard to the structural and functional roles of the zzso zzso tail zzso In general, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso unfolded regions zzso may function as signal routers for the robust processing of the large amounts of signaling zzso
