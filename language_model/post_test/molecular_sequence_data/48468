zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from a broiler chicken with zzso zzso has a highly zzso zzso that is correlated with the zzso We describe the isolation and zzso and molecular characterization of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso culture zzso The zzso was zzso using a zzso procedure zzso zzso with ammonium zzso extraction with organic zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso and highly resistant to zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso bacteria ranged from zzso for zzso zzso through zzso for zzso strains up to more than zzso for zzso zzso zzso was ineffective against the zzso strains tested at the zzso concentration zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is similar to that of zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso occurred in two zzso zzso distinguishable in the restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso I, identified in zzso zzso zzso dominated in zzso zzso strains of poultry origin, although strains with zzso II were also identified in this zzso zzso zzso strains of human origin were characterized exclusively by zzso zzso
