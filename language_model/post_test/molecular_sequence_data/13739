The ability to transfer sufficient DNA to specific target cells remains one of the main limitations to the development of gene zzso For this reason much attention is being paid to the development of new gene delivery systems, both viral and zzso We describe gene transfer with a zzso complex which contains an zzso zzso zzso gene delivery has several potential zzso Such complexes are less likely than other zzso gene delivery complexes to be constrained by the size of the zzso The zzso are small zzso resembling naturally occurring zzso zzso which zzso the possibility of complexes inducing an immune response in zzso
