The zzso zzso is one of two zzso zzso originally used to define the zzso locus of zzso zzso We now show that it blocks zzso after completion of zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso is expressed zzso probably from a zzso zzso promoter, and its expression is shut down at the zzso level at about the onset of zzso DNA sequencing reveals that the locus defined by zzso which we now designate zzso consists of a zzso zzso However, only the first gene is essential for zzso the function of the second zzso is zzso The predicted zzso product has an zzso of zzso It probably forms a zzso and is rich in basic and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso abolish the zzso of zzso genes transcribed by the zzso G form of zzso zzso but not zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso product could be involved in a signal zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso to events in the mother cell, or it could be necessary for essential zzso interactions between the two zzso
