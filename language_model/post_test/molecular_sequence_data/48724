zzso are plant specific zzso factors with zzso basic zzso zzso While zzso zzso has 24 zzso involved in cell proliferation and zzso their mode of action has not been fully zzso Using zzso tools, we demonstrate that zzso zzso factors belong to the zzso zzso proteins zzso family and that disorder is higher in class I zzso than in class II zzso In particular, using zzso and zzso approaches, we have characterized zzso a class I zzso zzso exhibits three zzso zzso regions zzso made of more than 50 consecutive zzso in which zzso zzso zzso are mainly zzso zzso of zzso that belongs to the central zzso was confirmed by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed that the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso tends to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments carried out on a truncated form of zzso lacking the zzso zzso indicated that it is effectively required for the pronounced zzso of zzso These data were reinforced by the prediction of a coiled zzso domain in this zzso The zzso zzso acts thus as an zzso domain and also a zzso zzso Moreover, many zzso zzso Features zzso were predicted, indicating that zzso could interact with several partners to fulfill a fine regulation of zzso in response to various zzso
