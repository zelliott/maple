Heavy metals have the potential to engage in strong bonding interactions and can thus function in essential as well as toxic or therapeutic zzso We conducted zzso analyses of heavy zzso binding to the zzso core particle and found that zzso and zzso zzso associate with the DNA major groove, in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found to bind only zzso to minor groove elements of the DNA, in particular at narrow AT zzso zzso Furthermore, relative to zzso the aggressive coordination of zzso and zzso to zzso bases is observed to induce a shift in zzso register around the zzso center by stabilizing DNA stretching over one region accompanied by expulsion of two bases at an opposing zzso These zzso transition metals also associate with multiple zzso protein sites, including zzso zzso and display a zzso for coordination to zzso zzso binding and the ability to induce structural zzso at specific locations in the zzso may contribute to genetic and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso
