Human zzso against zzso have been sought to study zzso events on the molecular level, and for possible use in passive immune zzso The development of zzso display techniques has opened the possibility of rapidly generating human zzso zzso with desired zzso We and others have isolated human zzso zzso zzso fragments using this zzso zzso expression of isolated clones does, however, differ broadly both in expression levels and functional zzso In addition, intact zzso cannot be expressed in zzso By transferring the genes of isolated zzso clones to a zzso expression system we could perform a comparison of functional activity between zzso expressed in bacterial and zzso cells, as well as zzso and whole zzso zzso fragments expressed in zzso cells showed increased virus zzso activity compared to the same zzso clones expressed in zzso coli, underlining the inefficiency of zzso zzso No difference in zzso zzso capacity was detected between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso Thus, zzso does not always zzso improved zzso zzso
