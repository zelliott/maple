During both spontaneous and zzso hormone zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in its liver which are necessary for its transition from an zzso zzso to a zzso zzso Although this transition ultimately results from marked increases in the activities and/or de zzso synthesis of the zzso cycle zzso the precise molecular means by which zzso exerts this zzso response are presently zzso Recent reports, using zzso from whole zzso zzso zzso zzso and indirect means of measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest a correlation between the zzso of zzso zzso and the general zzso changes occurring during zzso zzso To assess whether or not this same relationship exists in a zzso zzso such as liver, we isolated and characterized a zzso clone containing the complete zzso sequence for a zzso zzso zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso clone containing a portion of the zzso domain of a zzso zzso zzso beta zzso Through use of these zzso sequences and a zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso we directly determined the relative levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in liver from spontaneous and zzso zzso Our results establish that zzso affects an zzso of zzso for its own zzso prior to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, results with cultured zzso liver demonstrate that zzso in the absence of any other hormonal influence, can affect an zzso of both the zzso beta and zzso zzso
