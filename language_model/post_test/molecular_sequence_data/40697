zzso typified by zzso zzso zzso zzso was established to accommodate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to zzso these zzso from members of zzso section zzso zzso zzso has been zzso as zzso but its relationship to zzso with poorly differentiated zzso zzso remains zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso is closely related to zzso similar species of zzso and to further explore the zzso of zzso we analyzed nuclear zzso and zzso gene sequences of zzso identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso positioned all zzso except zzso zzso in a single, zzso zzso that consisted of three zzso zzso 1 included zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that did not zzso when exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 contained zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso that produced fluorescent colonies and possessed a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Neither lineage zzso the zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso but the former isolate was zzso as sister to zzso zzso zzso 3 included all zzso of zzso zzso a species recognized here as zzso zzso zzso zzso A fourth isolate of zzso zzso that was zzso to zzso 3 is described as zzso zzso zzso zzso The positions of zzso zzso zzso zzso a species based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not resolved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not closely related to zzso
