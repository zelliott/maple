Both zzso A zzso a zzso zzso toxin from scorpion zzso and zzso A, derived from the zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso interact specifically with the skeletal zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso channel in the zzso zzso but with considerably different zzso zzso activates zzso with zzso zzso whereas zzso A activates zzso at zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis for zzso zzso of zzso by zzso we have determined the zzso solution structure of zzso and identified its functional surface by using zzso zzso A detailed comparison of the functional surface profiles for two zzso zzso revealed that zzso exhibits a large functional surface area zzso zzso zzso where 1 zzso zzso based on a short zzso zzso zzso structure, while zzso A bears a much smaller functional surface area zzso 800 zzso with the five consecutive basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso being clustered at the zzso end of the zzso The functional surface of zzso is composed of six essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and several other important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso make up over the half of the toxin zzso with the exception of zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the site where zzso A binds to zzso belongs to a subset of zzso capable of being occupied by zzso resulting in differing the affinity and the mode of zzso
