The effect of linear zzso on the zzso of synthetic peptides was studied using either zzso peptides (representing zzso acid sequences zzso and zzso of bovine zzso major zzso or zzso peptides zzso and zzso which were constructed by zzso synthesis of the former peptides and an zzso acid sequence representing a zzso recognized by T helper cells zzso It was found that the two zzso peptides were rendered zzso by linear zzso Moreover, zzso also enhanced the zzso of zzso but not that of zzso In the three cases where zzso enhanced zzso a reinforced zzso pattern was predicted in the neighborhood of the junction of the zzso The possibility that zzso might have generated a new T cell zzso is zzso
