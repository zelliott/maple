To identify zzso on zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso or on zzso human zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso inflammation in patients with zzso juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso 

We used a proliferation zzso and zzso production to evaluate the immune responses of zzso fluid zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso peptides derived from either zzso or zzso regions on bacterial and human zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed in order to zzso and sort zzso zzso zzso cells were then analyzed for the expression of the zzso box zzso zzso zzso factor, and their regulatory capacity was tested in zzso zzso 

T cell responses to E coli zzso zzso peptides were eminently zzso zzso peptides derived from human zzso zzso induced zzso zzso production from zzso of patients with zzso zzso A positive correlation was found between disease with a better prognosis zzso zzso zzso and recognition of 3 human zzso zzso zzso The recognition of the human zzso zzso also induced a significantly greater amount of zzso in patients with persistent zzso zzso than in those with extended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from patients with persistent zzso zzso with this human zzso increased the percentage of zzso cells and zzso zzso It also induced the recovery of zzso activity by zzso zzso 

This is the first description of a zzso immune zzso circuit active during zzso inflammation through recognition of zzso zzso with different functional zzso These zzso induce T cells with regulatory zzso Such induction zzso with disease severity and zzso
