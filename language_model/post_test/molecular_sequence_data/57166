The zzso portion of the plasma membrane zzso contains different regulatory zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the human plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to study the role of two zzso zzso acid stretches located on either side of the zzso binding domain, corresponding to synthetic peptides A18 zzso zzso James, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso McCormick, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso fragment, as determined by zzso zzso mass zzso was higher by 39 mass units than the calculated value zzso zzso This difference was the result of an zzso zzso zzso which was located by zzso zzso in a zzso corresponding to the last 37 zzso acids of the expressed zzso Fluorescence experiments on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with increasing amounts of free zzso revealed two additional zzso binding sites with affinities corresponding to zzso values of about 30 and 300 zzso zzso zzso All zzso of different synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso of the expressed zzso indicated that the site with the zzso of 30 zzso was probably located in the zzso sequence on the zzso side of the zzso binding domain zzso zzso the site with the 300 zzso zzso was apparently located on the zzso side of the zzso binding domain zzso zzso or, zzso formed by the cooperation of distant zzso of the zzso
