zzso hairpin zzso were isolated by in zzso selection from a zzso hairpin zzso zzso Two new zzso zzso catalyze their own zzso zzso in the presence of free zzso Both zzso have zzso requirements for zzso zzso similar to the zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso studies in the presence of various other small molecules were zzso The data suggest that zzso does not induce zzso zzso in the same manner for both zzso In addition, investigations of pH effects on zzso rates show that both zzso zzso are more active in basic conditions, suggesting that they use new zzso zzso strategies in which zzso could be involved zzso The discovery of hairpin zzso dependent on zzso for their zzso zzso presents considerable zzso and evolutionary interests because we show that zzso is able to use zzso zzso molecules to enhance its own zzso zzso Such a mechanism may have been a means by which the zzso of the zzso world enlarged their chemical zzso
