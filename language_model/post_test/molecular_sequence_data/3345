A newly discovered zzso designated zzso which is located on a zzso zzso zzso acquired copper resistance in zzso zzso was identified in an isolate from a zzso The zzso gene encodes a putative protein belonging to the zzso zzso family with zzso zzso to the zzso protein from zzso zzso The zzso gene was found in zzso zzso isolated from pigs zzso zzso zzso calves zzso and humans zzso but not in zzso from zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso grew on brain heart infusion zzso plates containing up to 28 zzso zzso compared to only 4 zzso for the susceptible zzso zzso resistance, and therefore the presence of the zzso zzso was strongly correlated to zzso and zzso resistance in zzso from zzso and the zzso gene was shown to be located on the same zzso zzso as the genes responsible for resistance to these two zzso zzso The frequent occurrence of this new copper resistance gene in zzso from zzso where copper zzso is being used in large amounts as feed zzso suggests that the use of copper has selected for zzso
