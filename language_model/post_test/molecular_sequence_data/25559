Mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were isolated from a zzso library and the zzso sequences of the two genes were zzso The two genes have similar three zzso structures and a high similarity in the part of zzso 1 zzso zzso or zzso zzso and in zzso 2 zzso the central core of zzso They are linked together in a tail to tail orientation separated by a short zzso zzso zzso sequence and are transcribed from opposite zzso Both genes have a single zzso initiation site downstream from a zzso sequence and a single zzso transcript of about 760 zzso for the zzso zzso and about 700 zzso for the zzso zzso
