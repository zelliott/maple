zzso zzso zzso zzso which are classified as a type II zzso protein zzso due to their unique biological function and the potential medical and therapeutic application in cancer cells, receive a rising zzso The zzso zzso contain the zzso with zzso activity and the zzso with sugar binding zzso In recent years, studies involving the zzso from the white berry European zzso zzso zzso and the yellow berry Korean zzso zzso album zzso have been zzso However, the detailed mechanism in exerting unique zzso effect on cancer cells still remains zzso Here, we aim to understand and define the molecular basis and biological effects of the type II zzso through the studies of the zzso Korean zzso zzso To this end, we zzso zzso the zzso Korean zzso zzso zzso and investigated its molecular characteristics in zzso its zzso and ability to induce zzso cell death in cancer zzso To gain structural basis for its zzso activity and sugar binding properties, we performed zzso modeling studies based on the high degree of sequence identity and zzso secondary structure prediction between Korean and European, Himalayan zzso zzso and zzso
