zzso liver disease zzso is an increasingly recognized condition that may progress to zzso liver zzso In addition to alcohol consumption, genetic factors, dietary fatty zzso gender and viral infection zzso the severity of alcoholic liver zzso In humans, significant gender differences in zzso to zzso are zzso In the zzso infusion rat model of zzso female rats developed more severe liver injury than zzso To understand the effect of gender on the development of more severe zzso in female rats, we performed a zzso based expression profiling of genes in rats fed with fish oil and ethanol zzso A large number of genes showed significant changes in female zzso compared to zzso The zzso genes in female liver were involved in zzso zzso activity, zzso activity, zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso genes were involved in zzso activity, zzso activity, and electron transport activity in the female liver as demonstrated by biological theme zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis tools were used to identify specific regulatory networks of genes operative in promoting liver zzso These networks allowed us to identify a large cluster of genes involved in zzso zzso development, cellular growth and zzso zzso zzso and various signaling zzso Genes listed in this article that were significantly increased or decreased zzso two fold or more) were assigned to pathological functional groups and reviewed for relevance to establish hypotheses of potential mechanisms involved in zzso in female liver zzso
