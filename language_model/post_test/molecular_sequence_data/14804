zzso in the type IV collagen alpha 1 gene zzso cause zzso inherited cerebrovascular zzso We seek to determine the extent to which zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso in 96 patients with sporadic zzso The presence of putative zzso was tested in 145 zzso zzso The effects of rare coding zzso on zzso zzso were compared to previously validated zzso that cause zzso small vessel disease, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

We identified 2 rare zzso zzso in zzso patients that were not detected in controls, 2 rare zzso zzso in controls that were not detected in patients, and 2 common zzso zzso that were detected in patients and zzso No zzso found in controls affected zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso found only in patients changed zzso zzso acids and impaired zzso zzso much like zzso that cause familial cerebrovascular zzso 

This is the first assessment of the broader role for zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso beyond a contribution to rare and severe familial cases and the first functional evaluation of the zzso consequences of an zzso series of zzso zzso that cause cerebrovascular zzso We identified 2 putative zzso in 96 patients with sporadic zzso and showed that these and other previously validated zzso inhibit zzso of zzso Our data support the hypothesis that increased zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso or both, contribute to sporadic cerebrovascular disease and zzso
