zzso is a zzso zzso protein in bovine adrenal zzso The protein is zzso to zzso zzso and other zzso zzso It protects zzso zzso from zzso damage by a zzso system zzso in the presence of a small amount of zzso In this study we zzso a second zzso protein with Mr zzso which zzso with zzso to protect zzso zzso and other proteins from zzso zzso Without zzso the protein had no protecting zzso We determined zzso acid and zzso sequences of the protein and its zzso respectively, and found that it was a protein of the zzso zzso The zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso had a zzso composed of 59 zzso acids that seemed to be a zzso targeting zzso zzso extract prepared from adrenal zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was thought to have zzso zzso activity, since the zzso activity was zzso by zzso We partially zzso the zzso zzso from bovine zzso zzso In the presence of the partially zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the activity to protect zzso against zzso zzso Furthermore, with the three protein components zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was oxidized in the presence of hydrogen zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso with the disappearance of an zzso amount of hydrogen zzso Without any one of the protein components no zzso and zzso zzso activities were zzso From these results we concluded that zzso is zzso zzso zzso or so-called zzso zzso in zzso from the adrenal zzso
