zzso (a zzso and zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso by shedding the zzso of a number of different zzso zzso is followed by subsequent zzso zzso leading to the liberation of zzso zzso capable of nuclear zzso zzso zzso have been found at zzso contacts and are apparently involved in zzso interaction and cell zzso Here we have investigated the cellular mechanism that guides zzso to zzso at zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso trafficking of zzso critically requires a novel sorting signal within its zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso domain and zzso zzso suggest that a potential zzso zzso zzso domain is essential for zzso zzso In a polarized zzso cell line this motif not only targets zzso to zzso junctions but is also strictly required for zzso function in zzso processing and cell zzso
