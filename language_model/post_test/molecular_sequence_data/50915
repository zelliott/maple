The zzso chain reaction zzso allows rapid amplification of DNA of known zzso In many situations, part of a genetic sequence is known, but adjacent sequences of interest are zzso This is common in investigations of zzso zzso genes from B and T zzso which are composed of a constant region of known sequence and a variable region, for which the sequence may not be zzso zzso is described a method to amplify DNA when sequence information is available for only one zzso This procedure zzso a primer of known sequence in conjunction with a mixture of short random zzso Application of this method to the amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
