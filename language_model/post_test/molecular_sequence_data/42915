zzso zzso 2 zzso is a ubiquitous zzso protein zzso zzso that has been implicated in the control of cell growth and zzso By employing zzso action in the prostate as a model of growth control, we have previously documented that zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in a tissue specific zzso Here we have investigated the role of zzso control of zzso zzso in zzso regulation of its zzso We first cloned and zzso full length zzso zzso the alpha and beta zzso of rat zzso The zzso sequence zzso the alpha zzso corresponded with previously reported sequences for other species, as well as with the derived partial zzso acid sequence reported for a rat zzso The cloned zzso for rat zzso zzso not reported zzso was also identical in zzso acid sequence to that of other zzso The zzso for alpha and beta zzso were employed as zzso to examine the effects of altered zzso status on zzso of zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso deprivation caused a slow decline in zzso of the a zzso so that no change was noted at 24 h zzso however, at later periods of zzso deprivation a progressive but relatively slow decline was zzso Administration of a single dose of 5 zzso (5 zzso to zzso zzso animals did not elicit an early expression of new zzso for zzso and beta zzso However, a significant expression of zzso for the two zzso was apparent at 8 h zzso later stages of the zzso zzso reaching a peak in the zzso phase of zzso growth zzso at zzso zzso following zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso is not an early event related to zzso action, but is substantial in the zzso phase of zzso cell proliferation zzso by zzso Further, zzso stimulation of the zzso expression for the alpha and beta zzso of zzso appears to be zzso
