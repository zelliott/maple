A DNA zzso zzso (formerly zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso protein displayed a significant similarity to zzso IV from both zzso zzso and zzso In addition, whereas zzso did not complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso it zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso breaks in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assigned to zzso zzso Several zzso zzso sequences were identified in the promoter region of the zzso including the DNA sequence element zzso which is required for periodic zzso of several zzso genes in zzso zzso The level of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso varies during the zzso cell zzso zzso formed cells contained zzso levels of transcript which increased to a maximum level when cells were in late zzso zzso levels of transcript dropped as DNA replication was zzso Our results suggest that zzso may perform an important role during the zzso cycle of zzso zzso
