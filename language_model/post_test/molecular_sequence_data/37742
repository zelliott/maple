zzso repeats zzso are loosely zzso zzso acid sequence motifs that have been shown to function as scaffolding structures to mediate zzso zzso zzso have been identified in a number of proteins with diverse functions and cellular zzso Recent studies suggest that individual zzso motifs can zzso specificity in promoting zzso and/or zzso zzso often in a mutually exclusive zzso These features are best exemplified by the zzso zzso an influenza zzso cellular inhibitor of the zzso protein zzso whose different zzso motifs mediate interactions with distinct zzso zzso which possesses zzso and zzso properties, represents a unique class of zzso proteins containing a zzso Here we review recent progress on the structural and functional characterization of zzso and discuss the possible mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in view of present knowledge of zzso proteins and molecular zzso
