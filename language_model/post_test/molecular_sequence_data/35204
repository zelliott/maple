African zzso fever zzso is a highly lethal and economically significant disease of domestic pigs in Eastern Africa particularly in Uganda where outbreaks regularly zzso zzso analysis of variable zzso regions have been extensively used for molecular zzso studies of African zzso fever virus zzso zzso By combining zzso zzso and zzso zzso a high level resolution approach is achieved for viral zzso The major aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the genetic zzso of zzso outbreaks that occurred between 2010 and 2013 in Uganda to contribute to the clarification of the zzso situation over a four year zzso 

zzso samples from infected domestic pigs associated with an zzso outbreak from 15 districts in Uganda were confirmed as being infected with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification zzso zzso recommended by zzso The analysis was conducted by zzso based on sequence data from three single copy zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso the structural protein zzso and part of the gene zzso the zzso protein was used to delineate zzso zzso resolution of viral relationships was achieved by analysis of zzso zzso acid repeats within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

Twenty one zzso zzso outbreaks were confirmed by the zzso zzso diagnostic zzso zzso only 17 zzso were successfully aligned after zzso Our entire zzso cluster with previous zzso viruses in zzso IX isolated in Uganda and Kenya using zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso gene generated three zzso one with 23 zzso zzso acid repeats zzso with an additional CAST zzso the second with 22 zzso while one isolate zzso zzso had 13 zzso 

We identified two new zzso zzso different from previous zzso This study constitutes the first detailed assessment of the molecular epidemiology of zzso in domestic pigs in the different regions of zzso
