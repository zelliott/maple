zzso is a zzso flexible zzso DNA binding protein zzso in many human zzso To understand why the zzso zzso proteins associated with human tumors fail to bind DNA, we mapped the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso and examined its regulation by changes in the protein zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso were shown to form the zzso DNA binding zzso Two highly zzso regions within this domain, regions IV and zzso were implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso bound DNA as a zzso each zzso recognizing five zzso of the 20 zzso DNA zzso zzso shifts of the zzso domain zzso to the zzso DNA binding domain, regulating DNA binding activity, but did not affect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso shifts could also be zzso within certain zzso zzso rescuing DNA zzso One of these zzso was the mouse equivalent of human zzso zzso which is frequently associated with human zzso
