We compared the gene expression patterns of zzso zzso fresh zzso bodies and zzso bodies 3 days after harvest, by suppression zzso zzso to characterize the zzso changes that occur after harvest, such as zzso zzso and cell wall zzso of the zzso body, which are responsible for the loss of food quality and zzso We found increase of zzso levels of several zzso zzso zzso such as, two zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and several cell wall zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso We isolated a putative zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso with high similarity to zzso from zzso zzso which is involved in zzso of the cap during spore zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso which suggests that its target genes are zzso after zzso These zzso and the zzso factor may be involved in zzso zzso zzso body zzso
