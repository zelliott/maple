zzso particles contain two zzso zzso zzso linked together by zzso bonds that can be zzso under mild zzso We studied zzso zzso of zzso and zzso avian zzso viruses zzso in an attempt to zzso better understand the zzso of zzso zzso zzso examine whether the primer binding site (PBS) and zzso primer are involved in zzso and zzso determine the structure of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We showed that extensively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melt zzso This implies a complex secondary and/or zzso structure for these zzso that extends well beyond the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso complex in zzso we analyzed zzso zzso from zzso viruses in which the zzso PBS had been replaced with sequences zzso to the 3' end of six other chicken zzso We found the zzso zzso of these viruses are zzso that zzso at the same temperature as zzso viral zzso which suggests that the identity of the PBS and the zzso primer do not affect zzso zzso We studied two zzso zzso zzso one containing a large zzso inversion spanning the 3' end of gag and much of zzso rendering it deficient in zzso reverse zzso and zzso and another with a point zzso in zzso In both of these zzso zzso the zzso zzso appears to be either primarily or exclusively zzso These data suggest that zzso can package its zzso as zzso that subsequently zzso
