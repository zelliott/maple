Brown zzso tissue zzso and skeletal muscle are important sites of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso of zzso zzso in BAT and the recently described ubiquitous zzso zzso has been implicated in energy zzso In an attempt to better understand the zzso events underlying zzso zzso in muscle, we screened a human skeletal muscle zzso library and isolated three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The novel zzso was 57% and zzso identical to human zzso and zzso respectively, highly skeletal zzso and its expression was unaffected by cold zzso This new member of the zzso family is a candidate protein for the zzso of the respiratory control in skeletal zzso
