Using zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso structural data on the zzso domain of human zzso we have defined the binding region for zzso Previous structural studies of rat and human zzso indicate that this zzso domain is zzso Here we report that the zzso binding site is a zzso charged surface area covering approximately 770 zzso on the zzso face of the zzso beta zzso This site contains zzso zzso in the zzso half of the F strand (including zzso and zzso the top of the C strand zzso and zzso and the zzso strand zzso which are all zzso zzso In addition, several exposed zzso on the zzso loop zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso loop zzso and zzso and the zzso loop zzso and zzso form this zzso In contrast, neither zzso on the more peripheral G and zzso strands of the same zzso surface nor zzso on B, zzso and D strands of the opposite face are involved in zzso zzso This zzso binding site is predicted to lie most zzso to the zzso surface zzso with ready access to zzso on the surface of the opposing zzso zzso
