In this study zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from activated zzso According to the zzso characteristics and analysis of zzso zzso the strain was identified as zzso zzso The results of this study showed the optimal pH value and optimal temperature which influenced the degradation rate in zzso pH zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso of degradation reaction had been performed at different initial zzso and different zzso zzso with zzso software, the zzso degradation can be described as the same exponential model when the initial zzso concentration was lower than zzso zzso The zzso equation was zzso C zzso zzso + A, with the degradation half life of zzso in wastewater zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of zzso degradation by zzso zzso zzso
