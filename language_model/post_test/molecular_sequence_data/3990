The zzso zzso zzso has potent zzso activity in many model systems when expressed locally at very high levels from the time of tumor zzso We now demonstrate that systemic administration of zzso human zzso to animals bearing established highly zzso zzso tumors also leads to significant growth zzso We had shown previously that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso protein 10) is observed in zzso zzso but not zzso control zzso We now demonstrate that treatment of zzso mice with zzso to either zzso partially reverses the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso growth in animals treated with both zzso is comparable with that of zzso control zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the parental tumor cell line before transplantation also results in smaller zzso This tumor growth zzso is associated with increased numbers of zzso cells, consistent with a zzso zzso activity for zzso No change in zzso as indicated by zzso cells, was observed in either zzso or zzso zzso Thus, an zzso activity for either zzso could not be zzso zzso and zzso are critical to the therapeutic response resulting from high levels of zzso and, zzso zzso as a single agent also has zzso activity in a model of breast zzso
