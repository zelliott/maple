Cell specific expression of the insulin gene is achieved through zzso mechanisms operating on zzso zzso DNA zzso In the zzso of rat I insulin zzso two zzso the zzso and Far boxes, located at positions zzso and zzso respectively and containing the same zzso motif are essential for B cell specific zzso zzso zzso sequences are present in the human insulin zzso While studying the binding of nuclear proteins from zzso cells to the zzso region of the human insulin zzso we observed a previously zzso protein binding site in the zzso I region between zzso zzso and zzso The binding activity was present in insulin producing cells such as zzso and zzso zzso cells but not in zzso or insulin negative zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso I zzso and gel zzso interference experiments allowed us to define the core binding site of the zzso binding factor as a zzso zzso This factor is also capable to bind to a related zzso zzso to the zzso element in rat and human insulin zzso The binding of the zzso binding factor in this critical region of the insulin gene zzso may participate in the regulation of insulin gene zzso
