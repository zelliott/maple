Mice exposed to zzso zzso of zzso zzso are highly resistant to challenge infection, and zzso from these mice can zzso partial resistance when transferred to zzso zzso These zzso recognize zzso present in zzso and adult zzso among them an zzso of 200 zzso A zzso zzso a zzso portion of this zzso was zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso clone shares zzso with zzso of other zzso To assess the zzso potential, we carried out vaccination trials in mice using the zzso zzso expressed as a fusion protein with zzso presented in the form of zzso complexes with the outer membrane protein of zzso The level of protection achieved was zzso and this level could be increased to zzso by removal of those zzso acids included in the fusion protein that were derived from the zzso to yield a zzso designated zzso A similar level of protection was achieved when mice were zzso with the same dose of zzso in the form of protein complexes but without outer membrane zzso suggesting that protection did not require the use of zzso However, at least three zzso were necessary to achieve zzso Using zzso and zzso from mice vaccinated with zzso we demonstrated that the native protein recognized by zzso against zzso is a zzso protein that is expressed on the surface of newly transformed zzso The protection achieved with zzso in mice encourages additional studies of its potential as a vaccine candidate for the prevention of zzso
