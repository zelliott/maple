zzso zzso is the major zzso in influenza vaccines, and zzso is known to influence its zzso zzso zzso eggs are traditionally used for influenza vaccine production, but vaccines produced in zzso and insect cells were recently zzso This raises the concern that vaccines produced with different cell systems might not be equivalent due to differences in their zzso zzso Thus, we developed an zzso method to monitor vaccine zzso through a combination of zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso We then used this method to examine zzso of zzso from two different influenza H5N1 strains produced in five different platforms, including zzso eggs, three different insect cell lines zzso Five, zzso and zzso zzso and a human cell line zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is not necessarily equivalent in different cell types, zzso there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the overall zzso patterns and structures produced by different cell types, zzso zzso of the zzso on the zzso produced by High Five cells are core zzso structures, which may be zzso in humans, and zzso our method can be used to monitor differences in zzso during the cellular zzso stages of vaccine zzso
