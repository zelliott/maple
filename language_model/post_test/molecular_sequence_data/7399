Recently, a zzso zzso cascade was discovered that is triggered by stress and heat zzso and leads to the stimulation of zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Surprisingly, this process turns out to be independent of the classical zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in turn, results in the zzso of small zzso proteins zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that has extensive sequence similarity to the zzso zzso As in zzso zzso the zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso site and a nuclear targeting sequence located zzso to the zzso zzso However, in contrast to its zzso counterpart, it lacks the zzso zzso region proposed to form zzso domain 3 zzso binding zzso A zzso zzso message is expressed throughout development, while two shorter transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso appear to be specifically expressed in the zzso The zzso transcript results from the usage of an zzso zzso zzso signal zzso located early within the 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso is located at zzso position zzso in the zzso zzso
