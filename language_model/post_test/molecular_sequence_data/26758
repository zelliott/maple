zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the breakdown of zzso to zzso zzso In this report, three zzso zzso were identified in the tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the three zzso are highly similar over most of their coding regions with the exception of their zzso zzso zzso expression of the individual full-length zzso zzso fused to the green fluorescent protein in tobacco zzso cells revealed their distinct zzso zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso and that the specific targeting of the zzso and zzso zzso is zzso by their predicted zzso zzso zzso of the zzso targeting zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso yielded good recovery of the soluble zzso proteins in zzso coli when they were zzso with the zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that all three zzso zzso possess both zzso and zzso zzso activities, although the zzso zzso has a specific activity that is significantly higher than that of its zzso and zzso zzso Finally, differential expression patterns of the three zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso suggest unique roles for each zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these findings, together with recent information about rice and pepper zzso indicate that the zzso distribution of zzso in the plant kingdom is highly zzso
