zzso zzso is a 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso originally identified in zzso zzso zzso as a fertility zzso The zzso was completely zzso The analysis of the 31 317 zzso sequence revealed 34 zzso zzso putative proteins from 31 to zzso zzso long, most of them lacking similarity to known zzso Three functional regions had been identified zzso the replication region, the transfer and spreading region, and the stability zzso Three genes were identified in the stability region which contribute to the stability of zzso as shown by zzso stability zzso The first zzso zzso encodes a new member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso The two genes downstream of zzso were called zzso and zzso The gene product, zzso shows similarity to a family of zzso involved in zzso zzso An increase of zzso stability could be seen only when both genes were zzso By deletion analysis, the replication region could be narrowed down to a zzso zzso region, consisting of a 650 zzso zzso region and two zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of 161 and 131 zzso Only zzso exhibits similarities to DNA binding elements and contains a putative zzso zzso The zzso gene that is essential for DNA transfer and zzso formation was identified zzso zzso of zzso 10 zzso were found in the same orientation as zzso which might be involved in zzso and DNA zzso together with one gene in the opposite orientation with similarities to zzso regulators of DNA zzso Two zzso elements were found on zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso The second element, zzso shows the highest similarity to the zzso element located in the terminal zzso repeats of the zzso zzso zzso
