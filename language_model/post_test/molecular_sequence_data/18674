zzso zzso coli zzso the leading bacterial pathogen of zzso zzso is routinely detected by an established DNA zzso protocol that is neither sensitive nor zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso that detect the zzso toxin genes zzso zzso and zzso in clinical stool samples were developed and tested using donor stool zzso with known quantities of zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso is zzso compared with zzso for the DNA zzso zzso and the limits of detection are zzso lower than the DNA zzso zzso performed in zzso zzso clinical stool samples, previously characterized by DNA zzso were tested using the new zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin profiles were observed for 22 samples, notably, four samples originally typed as zzso negative were zzso zzso The zzso zzso are unique in their sensitivity and ability to zzso the three toxin genes in clinical stool zzso
