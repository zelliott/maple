Animals sense and adapt to variable environments by regulating appropriate sensory signal zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso plays a key role in regulating the gain of sensory zzso responsiveness across multiple zzso zzso zzso animals bearing a zzso zzso in zzso a zzso A zzso exhibit zzso zzso including many zzso sensory zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso is consistent with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes a behavioral zzso consistent with zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso the impaired zzso response of zzso zzso to an zzso zzso is caused by zzso which is zzso by a zzso causing defective zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso calcium entry activates zzso which in turn zzso regulates multiple aspects of sensory zzso
