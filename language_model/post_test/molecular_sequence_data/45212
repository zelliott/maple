zzso can cause life-threatening disease in zzso zzso Experimental infection in mice has revealed that the genetically determined natural resistance to zzso zzso zzso may be zzso either by direct recognition between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso or by zzso interaction between zzso and the host zzso zzso Using stocks of zzso zzso mice as a source of genetic diversity, we found that zzso zzso mice were naturally resistant to zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso the zzso Analysis of zzso to susceptible zzso mice revealed that the zzso was controlled by a major dominant locus effect linked to the zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of 41 zzso markers in the zzso region suggested that zzso mice may share a common ancestral origin with zzso zzso in the latter, zzso resistance is dependent on zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso mice retained viral resistance against zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate the presence of yet another zzso zzso viral resistance zzso named zzso which most likely encodes for a new zzso zzso zzso Identification of zzso will expand our understanding of the specificity of the innate recognition of infection by zzso zzso
