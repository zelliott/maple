A cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso selected as zzso transcribed when zzso was the sole carbon source, was introduced in extra copies at zzso zzso by zzso Sexual crossing of zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso with zzso and restriction site changes within both the zzso DNA and the normally located zzso Such changes are typical of the zzso zzso disruption (the zzso zzso first described by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Jensen, and zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso The zzso had the unusual zzso of growth on ethanol but not on zzso as the carbon zzso In a cross to the wild type of a zzso strain in which the original zzso gene sequence had been removed by zzso the zzso zzso zzso invariably zzso together with a zzso zzso site at the normal zzso This zzso was transformed to the ability to use zzso by the cloned zzso The locus of the zzso designated zzso was mapped between zzso and zzso on linkage group zzso The transcribed portion of the zzso identified by probing with zzso was zzso and a putative zzso open reading frame with two zzso was zzso The zzso usage was found to be strongly biased in a way typical of most zzso genes zzso so zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shows no significant resemblance to anything previously zzso These results provide a first example of the use of the zzso effect to obtain a zzso zzso for a gene previously known only as a transcribed zzso DNA zzso
