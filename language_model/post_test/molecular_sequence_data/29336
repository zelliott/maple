zzso markers are important tools required for the molecular dissection of gene function in many organisms, including zzso zzso Moreover, the presence of gene families and zzso often makes it necessary to delete more than one zzso We recently introduced a new and efficient gene disruption cassette for repeated use in budding zzso which combines the zzso dominant zzso resistance marker with a zzso marker removal zzso Here we describe an additional set of four completely zzso zzso marker zzso carrying the genes zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the dominant resistance marker zzso from the bacterial zzso zzso which zzso resistance to the zzso zzso All five zzso zzso gene disruption zzso can be generated using the same pair of zzso and all can be used for gene disruption with high zzso For marker rescue we have created three additional zzso expression zzso carrying zzso zzso or zzso as the zzso selection zzso The set of disruption zzso and zzso expression plasmids described here represents a significant further development of the marker rescue system, which is zzso suited to functional analysis of the zzso zzso
