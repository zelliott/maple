The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of bovine heart has been determined by analysis of five zzso of the zzso placement of the zzso 330 zzso has been confirmed by interpretation of the corresponding partial zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso of two identical N zzso zzso chains of 921 zzso each with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The zzso region, zzso zzso of the zzso comprises a zzso domain that is zzso in all zzso sequences except those of zzso 1 from zzso zzso and a zzso zzso from zzso A second zzso region, zzso zzso is zzso to corresponding regions of the alpha and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso domain specifically binds zzso and is involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso This regulatory domain contains two tandem, internal repeats, suggesting that it evolved from an ancestral gene zzso Common zzso zzso binding properties and a distant structural relationship provide evidence that the zzso and regulatory zzso within the zzso and zzso zzso are also related by an ancient internal gene zzso
