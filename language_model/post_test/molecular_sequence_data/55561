zzso class I zzso proteins of the zzso immune system require zzso peptides for maintenance of mature zzso and immune function via specific recognition by zzso zzso T zzso New zzso molecules in the zzso zzso are held by zzso in a zzso zzso transition state pending release by tightly binding zzso In this study, we show, by zzso zzso and molecular dynamics methods, dramatic movement of a hinged unit containing a zzso zzso zzso that flips from an exposed zzso position in the zzso transition state to a zzso position with buried zzso side chains in the zzso mature zzso zzso of hinged unit zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso H chain, zzso with zzso zzso demonstrates zzso exposure of these zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics predict how this segment moves to help form the A and B pockets crucial for the tight zzso binding needed for stability of the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
