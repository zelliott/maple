The zzso zzso of the freshwater zzso snail zzso zzso a zzso system controlling egg laying and zzso behavior, produce several zzso One of these zzso zzso causes the influx of zzso into the zzso zzso a female sex zzso of the zzso In the present study zzso was zzso and the zzso acid composition was zzso The ratio of the zzso acids appeared to be very close to that of one of the predicted peptides present on the zzso hormone precursor of zzso This zzso was zzso and shows a clear biological activity in the zzso Furthermore, it shows a zzso behavior similar to that of the natural zzso Based on these zzso it is concluded that the sequence of zzso is: zzso zzso shows a remarkable zzso with the sequence of one of the predicted peptides on the zzso hormone precursor of the marine zzso zzso zzso
