We examined the zzso sequences preceding 23 zzso zzso genes held in common by zzso rice, zzso sugar zzso zzso zzso and zzso to look for features related to translation initiation and to assess the degree of conservation in zzso zzso leaders among these zzso We observed broad variation in sequence similarity as illustrated by dot plot analysis, ranging from a level rivaling that of coding sequences to complete absence of zzso due to zzso DNA zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso predominated in the latter category, whereas ones zzso zzso c zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso were primarily of the highly zzso zzso Within the region immediately preceding initiation zzso in most cases we did not observe motifs consistent with a zzso zzso interaction to assist in zzso zzso nor was any other consensus sequence zzso In fact, zzso in the form of tandem repeats were seen among zzso from different zzso We did, however, observe a bias for high zzso and low zzso in the zzso approximately 30 zzso compared with further zzso zzso of some sequences in our data set were found to be associated with more than one gene within a zzso Indeed, 3 such families of upstream zzso were identified, and they exhibit a zzso distribution among zzso Moreover, the presence of related sequences at zzso sites distant from known genes raises the possibility of future recruitment as regulatory zzso Our observations point to a dynamic nature in the makeup of the zzso leaders of plant zzso zzso and an apparent plasticity in zzso control zzso
