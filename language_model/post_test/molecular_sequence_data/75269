The magnitude of the response to zzso and the requirement for individual elements in the promoter of the zzso gene were shown to be zzso and dependent on the type of zzso zzso Three DNA sequences in the promoter were found to bind zzso nuclear zzso Two of these sequences are in functionally defined zzso regions and also bind to the zzso factor zzso The third sequence is part of the region involved in zzso regulation and is zzso to the zzso element of the zzso beta zzso A model for zzso regulation of zzso promoters is zzso
