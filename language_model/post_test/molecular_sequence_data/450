The zzso zzso zzso proteins comprise a zzso family of zzso zzso that act as potent zzso of zzso and zzso The A3 locus on the zzso 28 of the horse zzso contains multiple A3 zzso two copies of zzso five copies of zzso and a single copy of zzso indicating a complex evolution of multiple gene zzso We have cloned and analyzed for expression the different zzso A3 genes and examined as well the zzso distribution of the corresponding zzso Additionally, we have tested the functional zzso activity of the zzso and of several of the human and zzso A3 proteins against the zzso infectious anemia virus zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso and the zzso virus type 2 zzso zzso cells of horses express at least five different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas circulating zzso the natural target of zzso express only part of the A3 zzso The five zzso tandem copies arose after three zzso recent zzso events in the horse zzso after the split between zzso and zzso The duplicated genes show different zzso activities against different zzso zzso zzso and zzso are potent zzso of zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso showed only weak zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restricted zzso and all zzso zzso except zzso inhibited zzso We zzso that the horse A3 genes are undergoing a process of zzso in their respective viral zzso which might provide the evolutionary advantage for keeping five copies of the original zzso
