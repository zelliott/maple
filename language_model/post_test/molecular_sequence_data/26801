Human zzso growth zzso factor zzso is able to inhibit the outgrowth of zzso As compared with the zzso acid sequences of zzso 1/2, zzso contains two zzso a zzso at position 5 and an zzso zzso zzso close to the zzso Moreover, all zzso growth zzso factor sequences contain a zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that the zzso motif is pivotal to its zzso but no specific role has been assigned to the unique zzso zzso To investigate the potential structural and biological significance of the zzso zzso several zzso were constructed and investigated in zzso zzso deletion of the zzso insert (the zzso zzso reduced the zzso activity, whereas the zzso of other zzso did not change zzso Then, zzso characterization and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to investigate the potential causes of the reduced zzso of the zzso zzso It was found that the zzso interaction mechanism of zzso was different from that of zzso zzso It was also shown that the zzso insert could regulate the zzso interactions in zzso leading to the structural change in the zzso which resulted in the zzso of the zzso accessibility and metal release ability, thus playing an important role in the biological activity of zzso Our studies provided useful information on the zzso interaction at the molecular level for the first time, and shed new light on the mechanism of the zzso of zzso
