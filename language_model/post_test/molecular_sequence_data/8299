The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso 1) exhibits peculiar chemical features which may account for its importance as a bacterial zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso constitutes a zzso of an unusual sugar, zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of which about zzso zzso are zzso Due to the lack of free zzso groups, this zzso renders the cell surface highly zzso and, therefore, supports adherence to the membrane of target cells including zzso zzso zzso of the zzso specificity of the zzso 1 zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso which recognizes an zzso located in the environment of the zzso group of zzso zzso According to zzso studies, this zzso appears to be associated with zzso zzso zzso The outer core zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibits also zzso properties due to the presence of zzso and zzso groups as well as zzso zzso The inner core expresses both similarities and differences as compared to zzso core zzso in containing zzso but lacking zzso and zzso zzso zzso A possesses some unique structural features since its backbone consists of a zzso zzso zzso with only zzso zzso groups having zzso carbon zzso Long chain fatty acids zzso and zzso possessing the double length as zzso zzso groups, may be responsible for the low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
