zzso zzso and zzso are frequent and zzso brain tumors that are infiltrated by T zzso Whether these cells result from zzso inflammation following zzso barrier disruption or an zzso specific immune response is zzso In this study, an in-depth characterization of zzso diversity in tumor and blood zzso zzso was performed in a series of 16 patients with zzso zzso zzso there was no obvious restriction of the zzso and zzso gene segment zzso zzso region 3 size analysis and sequencing of amplified zzso transcripts revealed multiple T cell zzso expansions in all zzso zzso zzso T cell clones were present in different adjacent areas of a given zzso but never detected in the zzso zzso of the number of zzso zzso transcripts per zzso of tumor zzso indicated that certain T cell zzso expansions may represent at least 300 zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the in zzso expanded clones were almost exclusively confined to the zzso zzso Overall, these data suggest that spontaneous zzso immune responses may be zzso against human zzso despite the zzso zzso generated by the brain and the tumor zzso However, the ultimate failure of the immune system to control tumor growth could be the consequence of a deficient zzso zzso component of the zzso This observation could have important consequences for the development of zzso for zzso zzso
