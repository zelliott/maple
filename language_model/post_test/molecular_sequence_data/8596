The zzso acid sequences of the rat zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso were deduced from the sequences of zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has zzso zzso zzso the molecular weight is zzso zzso is the smallest zzso zzso it has 25 zzso acids and a molecular weight of zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 7 to 8 copies of the zzso and 9 to 12 of the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso is about 1,500 zzso in length and that for zzso about 500 zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is exceptional in that it has, in addition to a short zzso sequence at the zzso end, a second stretch of 15 consecutive zzso near the site of initiation of zzso The 3' zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is unusual in that it is at least 246 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are related to zzso proteins from other zzso
