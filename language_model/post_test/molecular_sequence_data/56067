Despite considerable knowledge of the zzso and profile of the T cell zzso zzso zzso repertoire, very little is known about the repertoire of the V alpha and J alpha segments of the zzso in man or zzso We have used the anchored zzso chain reaction zzso to analyze the human zzso zzso repertoire at the zzso level in peripheral blood zzso We find marked differences in the usage of individual V alpha zzso The V alpha repertoire is determined both by differences in the use of individual V alpha gene segments at the time of gene zzso and by genetic influences on the selection of the expressed V alpha repertoire, presumably during zzso zzso Analysis of the J alpha repertoire shows zzso usage of individual J alpha segments but no obvious relationship to zzso zzso We also report three new V alpha zzso three new J alpha segments and possible zzso variation in V alpha gene zzso Two unusual zzso alpha transcripts are described which add new information on the nature of zzso alpha transcript zzso
