zzso zzso combined with increased zzso zzso is associated with reduced survival in several zzso but is particularly of interest in zzso cell zzso zzso where evidence suggests the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso We set out to identify zzso proteins in zzso cells that could act as zzso of zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso We identified the zzso cells 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso as an zzso protein using both a zzso strategy zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a zzso zzso screen of a zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso The zzso interaction is highly specific, as zzso zzso zzso acid zzso does not interact with zzso in zzso zzso zzso proteins display well-documented cell zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso contributes to zzso suppression under conditions where zzso is expressed at normal zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso the ability of zzso to suppress zzso zzso when zzso expression is zzso in these cells using small interfering zzso the zzso activity of zzso is zzso confirming that zzso expression causes the loss of zzso cell zzso regulatory zzso Thus zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells can act in a dominant manner to abrogate the function of a potent zzso of zzso and zzso Our studies identify a novel zzso interaction between zzso and zzso which suggests a mechanism that could explain the link between zzso expression and poor patient survival in zzso
