The zzso protein zzso is one of several zzso recognized by zzso from scrub zzso patients infected with zzso zzso The zzso protein genes from six zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso zzso zzso were cloned and their sequences were determined and compared to each other and to the Karp strain sequence listed in zzso The sequence alignment revealed that the promoter regions of these seven strains were highly zzso However, the zzso exhibited some zzso The zzso analysis of the DNA sequences indicated that among the seven strains zzso zzso and zzso were the most closely zzso while Karp and zzso were the most zzso zzso The information gained from this analysis will facilitate our selection of zzso zzso strains from which zzso should be derived to be included in a zzso vaccine candidate for scrub zzso
