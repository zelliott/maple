The zzso zzso zzso open reading frame 50 zzso protein (called zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso of the virus from zzso We previously demonstrated that a truncated zzso of zzso lacking its zzso zzso zzso domain, called zzso formed mixed zzso with zzso zzso zzso and functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso For this report, we investigated the requirements for zzso of zzso in zzso and viral zzso We analyzed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using Blue Native zzso gel zzso and size exclusion zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins form zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso is necessary but not sufficient for zzso formation and functions in concert with the central portion of zzso zzso 245 to zzso The dominant negative zzso zzso requires the zzso to form mixed zzso with zzso zzso and inhibit its zzso In the context of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or replacement of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso from the zzso or zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso of zzso are sufficient for zzso and viral zzso zzso of zzso that are unable to form zzso but retain the ability to form zzso zzso are reduced in function or are zzso We concluded that the zzso content, but not the zzso content, of the zzso is critical for determining the zzso state of zzso
