The zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined in the immature female zzso zzso At a dose of 75 zzso of zzso for 3 days, the zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not induce zzso zzso activity at doses up to 500 zzso and only zzso zzso induced zzso a zzso response at the 500 zzso zzso The relative zzso of zzso different zzso zzso were also determined, and the structures of these compounds differed with respect to the degree of zzso zzso to zzso and substitution zzso The relative zzso of these compounds were estimated by comparing their induced activities at the high dose zzso or 100 zzso with that of zzso The most potent zzso were zzso and zzso at a dose of 150 zzso the zzso activity induced by zzso was comparable to that observed for zzso zzso was the most potent zzso and zzso zzso activity in rats treated with 150 zzso was zzso zzso this value was higher than that observed for zzso at a dose of 75 zzso A second group of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso activity zzso or zzso zzso zzso at the 150 zzso dose, and this value was zzso 50% of the zzso response observed for zzso The remaining compounds, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all relatively weak zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity ( zzso 450 zzso In parallel experiments, western zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso protein showed that zzso the zzso zzso and zzso induced both zzso Previous studies have identified a zzso DNA element that plays a role in regulating zzso gene expression and binds nuclear zzso zzso induced by zzso The results of gel zzso mobility shift zzso with nuclear extracts showed that both zzso and zzso induce formation of a common retarded band using a zzso zzso corresponding the the zzso DNA promoter zzso Both zzso and zzso appear to induce zzso via a common zzso Although the results of this study do not define zzso zzso relationships for zzso two compounds, namely zzso and zzso were identified as highly potent zzso
