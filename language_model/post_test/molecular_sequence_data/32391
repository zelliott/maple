This paper reports the zzso properties of two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso One of the two zzso proteins is a product of the gene with zzso as the zzso start zzso zzso which is originally assigned in the zzso The other is a product of the gene with a new zzso start zzso zzso which is inserted at 153 bases upstream of the original zzso zzso Although zzso showed activity and zzso zzso showed neither activity nor zzso The zzso region in zzso was also zzso in all of the zzso zzso deduced from genes from newly isolated zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the actual start zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso is not the originally assigned zzso but rather is located at about 100 bases upstream of this zzso
