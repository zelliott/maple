zzso integration is the step which leads to establishment of the zzso zzso and zzso regions of the human zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso including the attachment site zzso at the ends of the zzso viral DNA and the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso have been identified as being important for zzso We investigated the role of each of these regions in the context of an infectious zzso molecular clone through point zzso of the zzso site and the zinc zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The effect of each zzso on integration activity was examined by using a zzso infection system with zzso zzso The relative integration efficiency was estimated by monitoring the levels of viral DNA over time in the infected zzso The integration activities of zzso domain point zzso and zzso site deletion zzso were estimated to be zzso and zzso of zzso activity, zzso However, in contrast with previous in zzso zzso integration studies, zzso of the highly zzso CA zzso resulted in a zzso which still retained zzso of zzso integration zzso The relative levels of expression of each zzso as measured by a zzso reporter zzso correlated with levels of zzso This observation is consistent with those of previous studies indicating that integration is an obligatory step for zzso gene zzso Interestingly, we found that three different zzso zzso bearing point zzso in the zinc zzso domain zzso much lower levels of viral DNA after infection, suggesting impairment of these zzso before or at the initiation of reverse zzso Western zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso levels of reverse zzso within the zzso zzso In zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso indicated that all three zzso in the zinc zzso domain had zzso levels of reverse zzso zzso These data indicate that in addition to integration, IN may have an effect on the proper course of events in the viral life cycle that zzso zzso
