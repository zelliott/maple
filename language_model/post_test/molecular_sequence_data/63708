Recent experimental and theoretical efforts have highlighted the fact that binding of zzso factors to DNA can be more accurately described by continuous measures of their binding zzso rather than a discrete description in terms of binding zzso While the binding affinities can be predicted from a physical model, it is often desirable to know the distribution of binding affinities for specific sequence zzso In this paper, we present a statistical approach to derive the exact distribution for sequence models with fixed zzso zzso We demonstrate that the affinity distribution of almost all known zzso factors can be effectively zzso by a class of generalized extreme value zzso Moreover, this zzso also describes the affinity distribution for sequence backgrounds with variable zzso content, such as human promoter zzso Our approach is zzso to arbitrary sequences and all zzso factors with known binding preferences that can be described in terms of a motif zzso The statistical treatment also provides a proper framework to directly compare zzso factors with very different affinity zzso This is illustrated by our analysis of human promoters with known binding sites, for many of which we could identify the known regulators as those with the highest zzso The combination of physical model and statistical zzso provides a quantitative measure which ranks zzso factors for a given zzso and which can be compared directly with large-scale binding zzso Its successful application to human promoter sequences serves as an encouraging example of how the method can be applied to other zzso
