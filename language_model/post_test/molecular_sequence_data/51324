zzso regulation of genes important in iron zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is achieved through regulated binding of a zzso zzso the zzso element binding protein zzso to zzso zzso motifs known as zzso elements zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso translation and zzso degradation of the zzso zzso The zzso senses iron levels and accordingly zzso binding to zzso through a novel sensing zzso An zzso cluster of the zzso zzso binds zzso when zzso iron levels are zzso the cluster becomes depleted of iron and the zzso acquires the capacity to bind zzso When zzso iron levels are zzso the zzso loses zzso binding capacity, but acquires zzso activity as a functional zzso zzso binding and zzso activity are mutually exclusive activities of the zzso and the state of the zzso cluster determines how the zzso will zzso
