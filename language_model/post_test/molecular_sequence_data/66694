zzso and zzso are zzso factors that control zzso and zzso development, zzso The two proteins have been shown to function in an zzso fashion, with zzso zzso zzso activity during zzso and zzso zzso zzso function during zzso It has also become clear that this functional antagonism involves direct interactions between the two zzso However, the molecular basis for these interactions is not known, and a number of inconsistencies exist in the zzso We have used a range of zzso methods to define the molecular details of the zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso data and extensive zzso revealed that the zzso domain and the zzso zzso zinc finger zzso form a low affinity interaction in which specific regions of each protein are zzso Surprisingly, the interaction cannot be disrupted by single zzso substitution zzso suggesting that binding is distributed over an extended zzso The zzso basic tail region of zzso appears to be sufficient to mediate an interaction with zzso and neither zzso nor zzso of a zzso corresponding to this region zzso zzso indicating that the interaction is not dominated by zzso zzso The zzso basic tail shares significant sequence zzso with the zzso interacting motif from zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso might compete to bind zzso Taken together, our data provide a molecular perspective on the zzso interaction, resolving several issues in the existing data and providing insight into the mechanisms through which these two proteins combine to regulate blood zzso
