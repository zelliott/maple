The two P domain zzso zzso channel has been cloned from human zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso of zzso with its mouse zzso The zzso gene has been mapped to zzso zzso and the study of its organization indicates that the zzso open reading frame is contained in six zzso zzso is expressed abundantly in brain and zzso In zzso cells, zzso currents are zzso instantaneous and zzso These currents are insensitive to the classical zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but are strongly zzso by application of zzso acid as well as other zzso fatty zzso zzso can also be activated by a stretch of the zzso
