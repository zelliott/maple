A zzso scan for the signatures of selection for zzso functional zzso acid differences was performed with zzso zzso This recently developed method makes it possible to zzso the target sites of selection under the pressure of gene zzso We found that two gene pairs have strong signatures of zzso The two pairs of duplicated genes happened to be heat shock genes zzso zzso and zzso which have similar protein structures to each other, although the zzso acid sequence identity between zzso and zzso is not high ( approximately zzso Interestingly, the two gene pairs exhibit signature of selection at almost identical positions within the zzso domain zzso Because this domain specifies the zzso zzso it is presumed that functional divergence may be advantageous in this zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the observed divergence in the two gene pairs has been maintained in many zzso species zzso suggesting long-term operation of strong zzso
