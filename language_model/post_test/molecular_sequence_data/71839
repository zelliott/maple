Recently, a single zzso zzso has been identified which is zzso in patients with zzso muscular zzso type zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso This is of interest because these diseases have been considered as two distinct clinical conditions since different muscle groups are the initial zzso zzso the protein product of the zzso is a novel zzso without zzso to any known zzso zzso We have now raised a zzso zzso to zzso and report on the expression of this new zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso of approximately 230 zzso on western blots of skeletal muscle, with zzso to the muscle zzso membrane by zzso at both the light and electron microscopic zzso A specific loss of zzso zzso was observed in patients with zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, patients with two different zzso zzso demonstrated very low levels of zzso protein in a manner reminiscent of the zzso expressed in many zzso zzso Analysis of human fetal tissue showed that zzso was expressed at the earliest stages of development zzso at Carnegie stage 15 or 16 zzso age 5-6 zzso zzso is present, therefore, at a time when the limbs start to show regional zzso Lack of zzso at this critical time may contribute to the pattern of muscle involvement that develops later, with the onset of a muscular zzso primarily affecting zzso or zzso zzso
