Two different types of genes for rice zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 1 zzso and gene 2 zzso were zzso Both zzso proteins contain a zzso domain highly zzso among zzso family proteins in their zzso zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso expression of both zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso apparently increased when cell proliferation entered the zzso phase, and rapidly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily zzso zzso analysis indicated different expression patterns of these genes in developing zzso zzso was zzso but strongly expressed in zzso while zzso was expressed in both zzso and zzso In zzso zzso showed that they were strongly expressed in the root zzso zzso zzso and shoot zzso zzso zzso but little signals were detected in mature zzso zzso expression of zzso fusion proteins in onion zzso cells revealed that both zzso proteins localized to the zzso or cell zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso were involved in cell division and might play diverse roles in zzso of zzso
