zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed at the surface of infected zzso and are zzso by the zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The 3' region of the zzso gene locus zzso the 205 zzso zzso zzso expressed in the zzso zzso was found to be altered compared to the zzso parental zzso Here we report that this zzso is the result of a DNA zzso and that the original and altered 205 zzso zzso appear to zzso bona fide zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences are zzso in similar apparent quantities as determined by quantitative real-time zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification zzso However, expression of the 205 zzso zzso protein at the surface of the infected zzso is not characteristic of the zzso zzso and the 205 zzso transcript has not been detected in zzso zzso by northern zzso zzso Furthermore, we report that many distinct zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso library zzso zzso Of special interest, in light of these data, distinctive differences at the 3' end of the zzso and zzso zzso are observed, which may be of functional zzso An analysis of the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso genes in more than 100 sequences revealed a surprising common sequence pattern characterized by blocks of imperfect, zzso zzso repeated motifs zzso zzso followed by A and T rich zzso zzso zzso and in a large number of zzso zzso segments zzso zzso We show that this region zzso extensive zzso and that the preferential stability of the 205 zzso transcript in zzso zzso may be associated with the presence of its specific Block III zzso We speculate that the zzso yet zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparable regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso function in the zzso and zzso regulated zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
