Not all members of the order zzso are zzso Some are zzso and a few, such as the giant zzso zzso zzso are almost exclusively zzso Although a number of adaptations to increased plant-eating are recognized within zzso few have been studied at the molecular zzso One molecular adaptation to diet that is spread widely across zzso is the differential zzso targeting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which tends to be zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and both zzso and zzso in zzso In the present study, we have analyzed the targeting of zzso in zzso in relation to zzso natural zzso We show not only that there has been an zzso shift in zzso targeting from the zzso toward the zzso as diets have shifted from being mainly carnivorous to ones that are more zzso and zzso but also that in one zzso namely that of the giant zzso there is evidence for positive selection pressure at the molecular level on the zzso zzso targeting sequence to decrease its efficiency, thereby allowing more zzso to be targeted to the zzso
