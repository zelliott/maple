The zzso content of the zzso zzso zzso protein was measured by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso in two transformed zzso cell zzso rat zzso and human zzso zzso zzso Low levels of zzso zzso were detected compared to a high expression of this zzso in primary cultures of rat zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso with a human zzso alpha or zzso beta zzso gene showed a decrease zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas their zzso zzso content was more than zzso increased compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso The inverse proportion between zzso activity and zzso zzso content suggests that zzso may act as a growth zzso factor in rat zzso zzso
