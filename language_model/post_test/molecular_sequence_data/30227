The molecular dimensions of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso determined by scanning transmission electron zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso stained zzso zzso of molecular mass zzso of zzso specimens with the microscope gave zzso zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso zzso X-ray scattering zzso gave a diameter of zzso zzso zzso radius of zzso zzso zzso zzso and volume zzso zzso zzso The zzso had no zzso and its iron content was found to be zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a minimum zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of the zzso zzso showed that it consisted of three zzso which have apparent zzso values of 12 zzso 25 zzso and 29 zzso zzso The reduced zzso consisted of four zzso I (12 zzso II zzso zzso III zzso zzso and IV (30 zzso zzso 1 corresponded to zzso I, zzso 2 to zzso III and IV and zzso 3 to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were obtained for zzso 1, the two chains of zzso 2 and one of the two chains of zzso 3, suggesting that the zzso consists of at least five different zzso zzso The percentage fraction of the three zzso zzso was determined by zzso of zzso gel patterns and quantitative determination of zzso zzso dye bound to the individual bands in reduced and zzso patterns to be, zzso zzso I) : zzso zzso zzso 2) : zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso : zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This corresponded to a zzso of 74 zzso 11 : 37 zzso 5 : 38 zzso 6, assuming the molecular masses to be 17 zzso 30 zzso and 34 zzso taking into account the zzso high mobility of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso calculated from the zzso acid compositions of the zzso and the three zzso was 82 zzso 12 : 29 zzso 4 : 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at pH zzso at neutral pH subsequent to zzso at pH 4 and at neutral pH in the presence of zzso and zzso provided no evidence for the existence of a putative zzso of the whole zzso zzso zzso 300 zzso Furthermore, the largest zzso obtained had zzso of 60 to 100 zzso and had a much decreased content of zzso 2, suggesting that the zzso was not a simple zzso zzso zzso reconstruction from microscope images provided a model of zzso zzso that is very similar to the reconstruction of zzso zzso the zzso mass distribution zzso are virtually zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
