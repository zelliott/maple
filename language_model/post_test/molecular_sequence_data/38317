In studies to define mechanisms of zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells, we have observed an inverse correlation between zzso complex formation and zzso zzso That is, we were able to zzso the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso with the zzso protein zzso in zzso from suspended cells that had low zzso activity, but we could not do so or could do so less efficiently in zzso of adherent cells with increased zzso zzso zzso with the presence of a functional zzso complex, we detected more zzso zzso in suspension than adherent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso in suspension cells, the latter two zzso also zzso zzso complex zzso Finally, we have also observed that certain zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso but also in a manner that correlated with levels of a zzso zzso Thus, these data suggest the involvement of zzso in an zzso suppression zzso zzso by zzso complex formation and downstream signaling from activated zzso
