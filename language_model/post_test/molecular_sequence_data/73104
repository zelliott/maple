zzso screening of an zzso zzso library constructed from the plant zzso harvested 1 h after wounding resulted in the isolation of zzso zzso clones zzso et zzso zzso The zzso clones could be broadly classified into two groups according to the expression time of their zzso Nine clones from the 10 different zzso zzso were rapidly zzso reaching a maximum level in approximately zzso h and then were progressively reduced after zzso The zzso clone zzso 31 showed steady zzso of the transcripts and reached the maximum value at a later time point of zzso h and then started to zzso The corresponding gene of the zzso 31 in which the coding region was interrupted by an zzso had an open reading frame that predicted a protein of zzso zzso zzso However, the gene product did not show any significant zzso to other known proteins in the zzso Northern zzso study using the zzso probe revealed that the gene was not regulated by other environmental stresses such as drought, high salt, low temperature, or a zzso zzso treatment, indicating that the zzso clone zzso 31 was specifically induced by zzso
