The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso I) is an integral membrane protein that contains two highly zzso zzso within putative zzso zzso We employed complex I from zzso coli zzso to study the role of these zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were replaced by either zzso or zzso zzso and the effects of the zzso on cell growth and zzso of electron transfer from zzso to zzso zzso were zzso Additional zzso that carried zzso zzso at selected positions within this domain were also prepared and zzso The results indicated that two closely located zzso zzso zzso in zzso are essential for high rates of zzso reduction, a prerequisite for the growth of zzso zzso zzso coli cells on zzso as the main carbon zzso The two zzso zzso do not have to be on adjacent zzso and mutual location on the same zzso either zzso 2 or 3, at an zzso of three zzso acids (about one turn of the putative zzso resulted in high activity and good growth zzso Nevertheless, shifting only one of them, either zzso or zzso toward the zzso side of the membrane by about one turn of the zzso severely hampered activity and growth, whereas moving both zzso zzso together to that deeper membrane position zzso the zzso zzso activity of the zzso but not cell growth on zzso suggesting impaired energy conservation in this zzso
