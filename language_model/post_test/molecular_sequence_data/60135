zzso and zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso channels, but they are expressed in the different zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms of zzso and zzso expression of zzso channel zzso the rat zzso gene promoter was cloned and compared with that of zzso In the zzso pair zzso region of the zzso zzso no zzso box was identified around the zzso start site, and the zzso region zzso to zzso was characterized by a zzso motif that had a significant sequence similarity to that of the previously isolated zzso gene zzso In contrast, the zzso portion did not have significant sequence similarity to that of zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso analysis revealed that the zzso motif and the binding of a specific zzso to this element were indispensable for the zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso element may have an important role in the promoter activities of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but that the zzso alone is not sufficient for the strict regulation of zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso
