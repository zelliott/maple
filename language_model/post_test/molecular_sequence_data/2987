zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso are an ancient and pervasive component of the innate zzso mechanisms used by zzso organisms to control the natural zzso and combat zzso zzso also produce such zzso to maintain ecological niches free of rival zzso Several hundred different peptides have been zzso to date, and they show a marked degree of zzso in both sequence and structure, having evolved to act against distinct microbial targets in different zzso zzso Many of these peptides appear to function via a selective, but not zzso zzso of microbial zzso while others interact with specific membrane associated or zzso zzso This review presents a broad survey of different zzso structural classes, zzso both their molecular diversity and underlying zzso The mode of action of these peptides and potential for biomedical and other application is also briefly zzso
