zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family 2, zzso C, zzso 9) gene zzso zzso and the zzso zzso K zzso zzso complex, zzso 1) gene zzso greatly impact the maintenance dose for the drug zzso zzso patients for their zzso before prescribing the drug zzso a faster individualized determination of the proper maintenance dose, minimizing the risk for adverse reaction and zzso of zzso zzso With current zzso therapy can be delayed by several hours to 1 day if zzso is to determine the loading zzso A simpler and more rapid zzso method is zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso version 2 zzso 2) to analyze zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Blood from zzso participants was used directly in a zzso real-time zzso without DNA zzso to obtain results within 1 h after blood zzso 

We analyzed 125 blood samples by both zzso 2 and zzso zzso The results showed perfect zzso 

The results validate the accuracy of the zzso 2 for determination of zzso critical to personalized zzso zzso zzso 2 offers speed, simplicity of sample preparation, the convenience of zzso amplification, and zzso flexibility, which are significant advantages over conventional zzso zzso In this example and other clinical scenarios in which genetic testing is required for immediate and zzso therapeutic decisions, zzso zzso zzso have key zzso
