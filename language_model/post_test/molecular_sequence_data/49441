We showed earlier that the kinetic behavior of the zzso zzso of the zzso differs from the ubiquitous zzso zzso primarily by a shift in the zzso zzso equilibrium of zzso in favor of zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to identify regions of the alpha chain that zzso the zzso distinct behavior using a zzso and zzso zzso zzso to assess shifts in zzso equilibrium included zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso measured at zzso zzso under which condition zzso zzso zzso + zzso becomes zzso zzso changes in zzso for low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso activity, and zzso the rate of the partial reaction zzso zzso zzso We first confirmed that interactions between the zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso shifts are fundamentally similar to those of zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso for zzso zzso is due to differences in primary structure of the two zzso zzso behavior of the zzso zzso indicates that the difference in zzso poise of the two zzso cannot be accounted for by their notably distinct N zzso but rather by the front segment extending from the zzso N zzso to the zzso end of the zzso loop between zzso 3 and 4, with a lesser contribution of the zzso divergent portion within the zzso loop near the zzso binding zzso In addition, we show that the zzso shift of zzso results primarily from differences in the zzso transition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso
