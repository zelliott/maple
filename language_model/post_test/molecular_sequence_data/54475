zzso zzso zzso are among the plants best known for their medicinal zzso Many zzso species are endangered due to zzso of natural resources - a situation difficult to remedy while there are no reliable, practical methods for species zzso We screened zzso candidate DNA zzso zzso to establish an accurate and effective zzso species identification system, both for commercial and conservation zzso We used 95 zzso samples, representing all the species in the zzso We found considerable differences in the performance of the potential zzso zzso The sequencing of zzso was unsuccessful due to zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso regions were found to be mostly zzso with only four to eight variable zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we could identify four to six out of eight considerably divergent species but only one to five out of zzso clusters within the zzso zzso species zzso zzso and ITS were the most variable zzso working very well both in species and cluster zzso We demonstrated that the combination of zzso and ITS is sufficient for identifying all the species and clusters in the zzso
