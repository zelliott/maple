After several years of research, there is now a consensus that America was populated from Asia through zzso probably at the end of the zzso But many details such as the timing, zzso and origin of the first settlers remain zzso In the last decade genetic evidence has taken on a major role in zzso the zzso of the zzso To study the early zzso of South America, we zzso the control region of zzso DNA from 300 individuals belonging to indigenous populations of Chile and Argentina, and also obtained seven complete zzso DNA zzso We identified two novel zzso zzso zzso preliminarily designated zzso and zzso which together with the recently described zzso zzso have locally high zzso and are basically restricted to populations from the extreme south of South zzso The estimated ages of zzso and zzso about zzso years zzso together with their similar population dynamics and the high zzso diversity shown by the networks, suggests that they probably appeared soon after the arrival of the first settlers and agrees with the dating of the earliest archaeological sites in South America zzso zzso Chile, zzso zzso One further zzso zzso appears to be restricted to zzso populations and reinforces our hypothesis of the continuity of the current zzso populations with the initial zzso Our results indicate that the extant native populations inhabiting South Chile and Argentina are a group which had a common origin, and suggest a population break between the extreme south of South America and the more northern part of the zzso Thus the early colonization process was not just an expansion from north to south, but also included movements across the zzso
