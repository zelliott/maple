zzso is a 27 zzso zzso zzso expressed early in infection by zzso The N zzso of zzso is thought to play a vital role in the functions of this protein through its interactions with membrane zzso The solution structure of a zzso zzso corresponding to the N zzso of zzso zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso zzso In zzso solution at pH zzso and 281 K, this zzso underwent zzso zzso with zzso existing in zzso and trans zzso in nearly equal zzso In methanol solution, however, the zzso adopted a zzso zzso structure from zzso 6 to 22, with the zzso and zzso regions having a less ordered zzso On the basis of a comparison of chemical shifts and zzso it appeared that this zzso structure was maintained in zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent in a solution of zzso zzso When the zzso group was replaced by either an zzso or a free ammonium group, there was little effect on the three-dimensional structure of the zzso in zzso zzso of the C zzso also had no effect on the structure in zzso In water, the zzso zzso zzso The similarity between the sequences of zzso and zzso is reflected in the similar structures of the two zzso although the zzso zzso of zzso is more zzso This similarity in structure raises the possibility that zzso not only interacts with zzso but also may be capable of zzso them and causing cell zzso This type of interaction could contribute at least in part to the killing of bystander cells in zzso zzso during zzso zzso
