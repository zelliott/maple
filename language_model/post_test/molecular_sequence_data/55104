zzso zzso in zzso zzso may have a relevant and unpredictable impact on clinical safety and zzso zzso their sensitive analysis is important throughout zzso zzso The two stage zzso approach presented here provides a quick zzso clone comparison of candidate production cell lines as a first stage, followed by an in-depth analysis including identification and zzso of zzso sequence zzso of selected clones as a second zzso We show that the differential analysis is a suitable tool for sensitive and fast batch to batch comparison of zzso zzso The zzso approach allows for detection of not only single zzso acid zzso in unmodified zzso but also zzso in zzso modified peptides such as zzso for detection of truncated or zzso sequence zzso as well as double zzso acid zzso or substitution with zzso acid structural zzso within one zzso In two case studies we were able to detect sequence zzso of different origin down to a zzso percentage zzso One of the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso could be correlated to a zzso to zzso substitution at DNA zzso zzso zzso In the second case we were able to correlate the zzso percentage substitution zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid limitation in the chemically defined zzso zzso
