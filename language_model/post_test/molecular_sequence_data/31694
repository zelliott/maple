Five novel zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found through a survey of zzso beef zzso zzso analysis of ITS domain and zzso zzso genes showed that the new strains represent a distinct lineage within the zzso zzso closely related to zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso zzso zzso % zzso The main difference of strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to strains of known zzso species is the maximum growth temperature, which is below 20 zzso for the new zzso whereas related species grow at 25 zzso Furthermore, the strains differed from known zzso species in zzso and zzso patterns of carbon zzso Based on these zzso the five strains are considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso number of the type strain is zzso zzso
