zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that acts as a protective barrier to zzso and zzso zzso To begin understanding the role of zzso zzso capsule in zzso we sought to identify the genes involved in zzso zzso export and zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA that zzso with DNA zzso specific for the zzso zzso type b cap export region was cloned and zzso This zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso four open reading zzso designated zzso The zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso contained a high degree of zzso to the capsule export genes of zzso zzso type b zzso zzso zzso group B zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso and zzso When present in zzso the zzso gene cluster zzso zzso or zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso and by restored sensitivity to a zzso zzso A zzso probe zzso to zzso DNA from all zzso zzso zzso tested, indicating that this DNA was zzso among zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso produces a group II family capsule similar to those of related zzso zzso
