Recent work has shown that the incorporation of an zzso zzso into peptides can greatly increase their zzso zzso leading to an improvement in pharmaceutical properties such as zzso stability, zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso peptides thus show promise as a new class of drugs capable of zzso intractable targets such as those that engage in zzso zzso zzso The extent of zzso stabilization provided by zzso has proven to be substantially context dependent, requiring cumbersome screening to identify the optimal site for staple zzso In certain cases, a staple encompassing one turn of the zzso zzso at zzso i and zzso zzso greater zzso stabilization than one encompassing two turns zzso zzso which runs counter to expectation based on zzso zzso These findings highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of the forces that zzso zzso stabilization by hydrocarbon zzso Here we report zzso zzso Carlo folding simulations comparing unmodified peptides derived from zzso A and zzso zzso with various zzso and zzso zzso versions zzso The results of these simulations were found to be in quantitative agreement with zzso determined zzso zzso We also discovered that staples can stabilize zzso decoy zzso and that the removal of these states plays a major role in determining the zzso stability of zzso zzso Finally, we critically investigate why our method works, exposing the underlying physical forces that stabilize zzso zzso
