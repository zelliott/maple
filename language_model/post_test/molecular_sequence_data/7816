In zzso zzso zzso zzso carries the genes coding for zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation plus mercury zzso The zzso genes specifying zzso and zzso zzso are organized in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso Physical and DNA sequence analyses revealed that the zzso and zzso genes were identical and were located within a longer zzso repeat of zzso zzso Similar zzso structures were observed among other zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso long and capable of zzso a zzso of 32 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso indicates that it is a member of the zzso zzso Investigation of the regulation of the zzso gene clusters through the construction of a zzso defined deletion zzso zzso which lacks a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso repeat region carrying the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso showed that zzso zzso strains containing zzso became zzso negative, but zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso and a cloned zzso gene rescued the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso
