We isolated 44 strains of rapidly growing zzso zzso from 19 patients with pulmonary infections assisted at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 2004 to zzso Identification at the species level was performed by zzso restriction zzso length zzso analysis zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso by zzso yielded 3 zzso zzso one identical to zzso zzso type I zzso zzso another to zzso zzso type II, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a third typical for zzso zzso type I zzso zzso When comparing analysis of the 3 zzso more discrimination was obtained by zzso gene zzso which allowed good distinction between group I, II, and III strains and zzso of group II strains in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that the description of new zzso species requires the establishment of standardized procedures for zzso identification and the alert of the zzso about their involvement in pulmonary disease and the necessity of treatment for control and zzso
