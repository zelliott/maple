zzso of the genes zzso zzso zzso the invasive associated protein zzso zzso O zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for a range of zzso zzso zzso of different origin and zzso Several zzso sequence variations were found in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso No differences were found for the zzso zzso but our approach does not exclude the existence of differences between single copies of these zzso Based on the sequence differences, the zzso zzso strains can be divided into three distinct sequence zzso Further, the presence of only a small number of sequence differences within each group indicates a strong degree of conservation within the zzso There was a complete correspondence among the groups of strains formed according to the analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the grouping zzso with zzso zzso field gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the region zzso the zzso repeat units in the zzso gene revealed some striking zzso zzso type 1 strains were found to have zzso repeats, sequence type 2 strains had zzso repeats whereas the two sequence type 3 strains zzso had only 11 zzso Furthermore, within a 19 zzso segment there was a 37% difference between the sequences of type 1 and 2 strains and that segment was absent in type 3 zzso Within the zzso repeat region the zzso differences gave rise to four zzso acid changes; however, all were changes among the three zzso acids present in the repeat structure indicating a strong selective pressure on the composition of this zzso
