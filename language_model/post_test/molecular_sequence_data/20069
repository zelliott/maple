zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have been shown to play important roles in lateral organ formation and zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice zzso zzso zzso and zzso in rice leaf zzso Rice zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas rice zzso is highly zzso with zzso narrow zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed that the expression of both genes was excluded from the shoot zzso zzso but the transcripts were detected in leaf zzso young leaves, and zzso zzso without any polar zzso The function of the two genes was studied by both zzso and zzso interference zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso induced twisted and knotted leaves lacking specialized structures such as zzso and zzso while no zzso change was observed in zzso zzso plants, suggesting that rice zzso may be required for leaf cell growth and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and showed a zzso zzso zzso The expression of class I zzso zzso zzso genes was zzso induced in leaves of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Data from zzso zzso expression and zzso interaction zzso suggested that zzso acted as a zzso zzso of zzso These data reveal a regulatory network involving zzso zzso and zzso genes required for rice leaf zzso
