A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected near the zzso zzso It contained zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso alcohol as the zzso fatty zzso zzso as the major zzso and zzso type zzso zzso Based on these zzso strain zzso was assigned to the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence placed strain zzso within the zzso zzso and showed a sequence similarity of zzso % with members of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso SK zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified as the most closely related species with zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso The values for zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were below the 70 % threshold value zzso zzso zzso % and zzso % zzso In addition, strain zzso exhibited a number of zzso differences from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the cumulative differences, strain zzso was identified as representing a novel species and the name zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, based on the zzso and zzso zzso the species zzso zzso was reclassified as a species of the zzso zzso and renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, an zzso description of the zzso zzso is zzso
