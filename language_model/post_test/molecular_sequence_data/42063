The effect of zzso size on the zzso detection of zzso zzso after chlorine zzso was zzso Two zzso specific to the zzso zzso zzso gene were used for the zzso zzso a zzso zzso and smaller zzso zzso within the zzso zzso a zzso zzso specific to species zzso coding sequence also was zzso After exposure to zzso viable zzso grown cells were not detected by plate counts or direct counts with zzso zzso after 1 zzso for treatment at 10 zzso after 2 zzso for treatment at 5 zzso and after 4 zzso for treatment at zzso zzso viable water grown cells were present at least 4 zzso after zzso addition even with a chlorine dose of 5 zzso At the zzso zzso zzso products from the zzso zzso were detected on zzso gels up to 16 zzso after zzso even after 24 zzso of zzso the zzso products were zzso using a capture probe zzso zzso However, the zzso target was not detected after 4 zzso chlorine contact time at the same zzso dosage using zzso gels, and zzso products could not be detected by zzso after 32 zzso At lower chlorine zzso a similar pattern was seen with the zzso zzso zzso longer after zzso addition than the zzso zzso amplification zzso On the basis of these data, larger zzso appear to correlate better with viability of zzso zzso in water zzso
