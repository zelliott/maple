zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of halo blight disease in zzso produces a toxin known as zzso whose synthesis involves the products of some of the genes found within the zzso zzso This region, considered a zzso island, comprises 23 genes arranged in five zzso zzso two zzso units zzso zzso and three arranged as zzso zzso zzso zzso most with unknown zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of most of the genes zzso in the zzso region and the synthesis of zzso require the product of the zzso zzso of unknown function but that has been proposed to have a regulatory zzso In order to evaluate the role of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed a comparative zzso analysis with the wild type and a zzso zzso strains using zzso The zzso data analysis showed that zzso regulates the expression not only of genes within the zzso region, but also alters the expression of zzso genes outside it, indicating that this gene has been integrated into the regulatory machinery of the zzso The expression changes of many of those genes were confirmed by zzso This study also demonstrated the importance of the zzso protein in the process of iron response, and suggests that the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso stress zzso observed in this study, appears to be indirect through its influence on the zzso protein zzso
