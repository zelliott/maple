zzso upstream of the zzso zzso structure of zzso mosaic virus zzso have been predicted to fold into several zzso and zzso zzso To zzso the functional role of this upstream region, a series of deletions was made in zzso clones of zzso a zzso component not required for zzso These deletion zzso were transcribed in zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso into barley zzso zzso of single zzso structures gave progeny retaining zzso zzso zzso zzso representing deletion of two or three zzso substantially lowered the zzso of progeny zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing deletions of longer sequences or of the entire region zzso zzso zzso zzso poorly, yielding no zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso were found to increase relative to the zzso observed in a complete zzso zzso The stability of delta zzso zzso in zzso was somewhat lower than that of zzso zzso during the first 3 h zzso Little difference in zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso bearing deletions within the zzso region was observed, and Western zzso analysis of viral coat protein produced in zzso zzso showed that protein zzso paralleled the amount of zzso message produced from the various sequences zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso region plays a minor role in zzso control but contributes substantially to the overall replication of the zzso mosaic virus zzso
