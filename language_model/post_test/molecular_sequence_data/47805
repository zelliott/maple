To characterize the variable heavy chain zzso zzso response to zzso zzso we analyzed a panel of zzso and zzso zzso fragments from zzso display zzso libraries from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso isolated had low affinity for zzso were not restricted to a particular zzso zzso zzso and consisted mainly of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso fragments were zzso specific, with high affinity and extensive zzso zzso all were zzso related and were derived from a single zzso zzso gene zzso One zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso region zzso zzso identical to those of zzso zzso zzso and uses similar zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso arose from zzso by zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso in the zzso heavy chain third zzso region results in a zzso affinity increase for zzso which zzso with a similar increase in zzso zzso These results imply that in zzso zzso to zzso zzso switch and affinity maturation may be important for protection and long-term survival in certain zzso zzso
