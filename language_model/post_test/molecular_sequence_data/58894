From a zzso zzso library we have isolated a zzso clone coding for a novel zzso protein which is expressed by human zzso but not by their matched zzso transformed zzso This protein has a molecular mass of 51 zzso and is highly related to the zzso family of zzso zzso from zzso At the zzso end, it contains an zzso domain which may zzso the activity of the associated zzso zzso Our data are consistent with the assumption that the novel protein represents one of the zzso that regulate the availability of zzso by zzso zzso zzso
