An infectious molecular clone of the zzso strain of zzso zzso virus zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library containing zzso DNA prepared from zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso The integrated zzso has a total length of zzso base zzso Three long open reading frames corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso gene coding frames are zzso In addition, an open reading frame zzso the 3' end of zzso in the region that encodes viral zzso factor in the zzso zzso Several short open reading frames are present in the zzso region between zzso and zzso and within zzso which may serve as zzso for production of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences of the zzso proteins with those of other zzso indicates that zzso did not arise recently from any other characterized zzso
