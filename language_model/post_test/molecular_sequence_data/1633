zzso zzso and sequencing of zzso and zzso genes revealed high genetic diversity among root zzso bacteria from the Costa Rican trees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tribe zzso and zzso zzso zzso tribe zzso A total of 21 distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found among the 36 zzso zzso and no zzso were shared in common by zzso from different zzso zzso However, three of the zzso from zzso zzso were identical to zzso zzso zzso detected in prior studies of several other zzso zzso in both Costa Rica and zzso Nearly full-length zzso zzso sequences and partial zzso zzso sequences confirmed that two zzso from zzso zzso were highly similar or identical to zzso strains isolated from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso tribe zzso in zzso zzso sequences for five zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not closely related to any currently known strains from Central America or elsewhere, but had affinities to the reference strains zzso zzso zzso 110 (three zzso or to zzso zzso zzso 76 zzso zzso A zzso tree for 21 zzso strains based on zzso zzso of the zzso gene showed several significant conflicts with the zzso tree, suggesting that zzso relationships may have been altered by lateral gene transfer zzso
