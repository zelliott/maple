Sixteen zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso Analysis of repetitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns, zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso zzso showed that the zzso belonged to various groups within the zzso zzso One group of zzso could be assigned to zzso zzso and a second to zzso zzso Two groups could be differentiated zzso from each other and from all other currently known zzso zzso Analysis of the fatty acid composition and zzso and zzso tests allowed differentiation of these groups from their closest zzso zzso and they therefore represent two novel species within the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed, with strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as the type zzso
