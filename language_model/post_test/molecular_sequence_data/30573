We show that a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso 22 zzso of the zzso c zzso zzso IV zzso blocked import of zzso IV into zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not alter the electrical potential across the zzso inner membrane (the delta zzso zzso of import was zzso and could be overcome by the addition of increased amounts of zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to, respectively, the zzso 16 and 23 zzso of the same zzso also blocked import of zzso zzso However, zzso was a much weaker inhibitor of import, while the zzso effect of zzso was due to its ability to completely collapse the delta zzso zzso seems to be a general inhibitor of zzso import, in that it also blocked zzso of several other zzso These included the precursors of the zzso proteins zzso c zzso zzso zzso the zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In addition, zzso of two zzso precursor proteins zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by the zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso did not block the initial recognition or binding of proteins to zzso Rather, our results suggest that the zzso acts at a subsequent zzso step which is common to the import pathways of many different precursor zzso
