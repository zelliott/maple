A zzso chain reaction able to amplify zzso tuberculosis DNA from clinical samples of zzso origin is zzso The zzso amplified a zzso base pair DNA zzso spanning positions zzso to zzso of the 65 zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso The procedure enables amplification of target DNA at quantities as low as 1 zzso of zzso material and less than 1000 zzso present in clinical zzso The reaction zzso zzso tuberculosis DNA as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso In 34 zzso clinical samples zzso 18 rendered positive results and two zzso results; compared to classical diagnostic procedures, the sensitivity was zzso and specificity zzso The zzso approach to diagnosis of tuberculosis of zzso origin is a valid diagnostic alternative to classical zzso
