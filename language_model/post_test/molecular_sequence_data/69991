zzso of the zzso precursor of human zzso A zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso zzso from culture medium zzso by zzso mouse myeloma zzso A zzso zzso zzso A solution was activated to a maximum of zzso of the activity produced by zzso zzso zzso simply by its incubation at 37 degrees C for 12 zzso though at lower starting zzso the rate and extent of zzso were zzso zzso was shown to be the result of a single zzso zzso at the zzso zzso bond that removes the zzso and converts the zzso zzso 72,000 zzso into the zzso zzso zzso active species also produced by zzso zzso It is proposed that this zzso is a zzso event zzso by previously activated zzso zzso The addition of zzso increased by approximately zzso the initial rate of zzso A zzso zzso but did not affect the zzso of a deletion zzso that lacked the zzso domain zzso zzso The zzso that this increase resulted from an interaction between zzso and the zzso domain was supported by the finding that, unlike zzso A, both full-length zzso A and the isolated zzso domain were able to bind to zzso zzso and that, at zzso zzso sufficient to abolish this zzso zzso had no zzso We conclude that zzso is able to enhance zzso zzso by acting as a template that zzso zzso zzso A and suggest that a similar mechanism may account for the zzso zzso of this zzso
