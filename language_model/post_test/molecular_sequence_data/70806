Analysis of the recently completed zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso 50 encodes a protein with zzso to the zzso virus zzso zzso factor zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso zzso to zzso 50, is interrupted by two zzso and that the spliced zzso is translated into a zzso protein that has zzso to the zzso zzso factor zzso The newly characterized zzso protein forms zzso but does not zzso with other members of the zzso protein zzso
