A marine fish cell line derived from the kidney of zzso zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was established and zzso The zzso cells multiplied well in Leibovitz's zzso medium containing zzso zzso bovine serum at 25 zzso and have been zzso for more than 90 zzso zzso zzso typing and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso had a modal zzso zzso number of 82 and was a zzso cell line originated from zzso A severe zzso effect was observed in zzso cells incubated with Singapore grouper zzso zzso but not with zzso turtle zzso viral nervous necrosis virus or spring zzso of carp zzso zzso replication was further confirmed by zzso electron zzso and virus zzso zzso Bright zzso was observed after zzso with fluorescent protein reporter zzso indicating that zzso cells can be used to identify gene functions in zzso In addition, the cell zzso including zzso and zzso zzso changed and zzso around virus factories after zzso infection, suggested that the zzso cell line could be an important tool for investigation of zzso zzso
