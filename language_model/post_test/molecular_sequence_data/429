The present work reports a zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulation of a bovine zzso zzso based on a recently reported zzso model obtained by fitting two zzso from the crystal structure to atomic force zzso maps zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso zzso The simulation shows that the zzso arrangement is stable although subtle zzso in its zzso elements are observed during the first 60 zzso of the zzso The comparison with a parallel zzso zzso simulation of a single zzso in the same conditions and using the same protocol allows the study of zzso interactions on the zzso interface together with the structural effects associated to the zzso zzso The present study describes the interface of a zzso zzso at an zzso level including an analysis of the energy contributions to the interaction of each part of the protein zzso We also compare the differences in the structure of the single zzso with those of the zzso zzso with the aim of understanding the changes required for the zzso zzso
