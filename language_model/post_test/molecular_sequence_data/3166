zzso (or zzso is an imprinted gene located on human zzso zzso that is expressed predominantly from the paternal zzso In the zzso zzso is associated with embryonic growth and maternal zzso Human zzso is transcribed from two zzso the transcript from promoter zzso is derived from both parental zzso and the transcript from zzso is exclusively from the paternal zzso We characterized the zzso and zzso transcripts in various normal and zzso zzso In the normal zzso zzso was transcribed from both promoters zzso and zzso whereas in six of eight zzso zzso zzso was transcribed exclusively from promoter zzso zzso sequencing demonstrated high levels of zzso zzso in the zzso region of DNA from a lung zzso In the region between zzso and zzso we identified a novel transcript, zzso in an zzso orientation to zzso zzso is a spliced transcript and was detected as a strong zzso band on a Northern zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcript were expressed exclusively from the paternal zzso zzso of DNA from within the zzso region between zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso to a zzso zzso reporter zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso This DNA exhibited strong promoter activity in both the sense and zzso directions, indicating that zzso and zzso zzso share a common promoter zzso Treatment of the zzso DNA fragments with zzso zzso abolished the promoter zzso Of interest, zzso was expressed predominantly in zzso and in mature zzso zzso indicating a possible role for this transcript in human zzso physiology and zzso
