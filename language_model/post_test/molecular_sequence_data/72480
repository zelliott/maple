To obtain zzso human zzso zzso zzso a zzso for the coding region of mature human zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso zzso was produced as a fusion protein with zzso zzso followed by the zzso recognition site for zzso zzso just preceding first zzso acid of the zzso zzso The human zzso was found to be in the soluble zzso This previously zzso human zzso synthetic zzso was zzso to zzso zzso with a specific activity of zzso zzso of protein using a zzso zzso zzso column and gel zzso zzso human zzso exhibits homogeneous behavior during high performance liquid zzso zzso and the zzso zzso confirmed by protein sequencing, revealed a single zzso zzso In its active form, human zzso is a zzso According to the zzso properties derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso has a nearly zzso zzso Additionally, naturally occurring zzso to zzso zzso zzso has been also expressed in zzso coli and further zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso value of zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso for the wild zzso The zzso efficiency zzso constant, zzso of the zzso zzso was four fold lower than zzso zzso The activity measurement of the zzso zzso showed higher zzso sensitivity as compared with wild type zzso The measured zzso for zzso zzso is zzso compared to zzso for wild zzso The pH zzso for the zzso and zzso protein are zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso does not affect zzso formation and both normal and zzso zzso exhibit identical zzso zzso The zzso zzso of both wild type and zzso zzso was found to be zzso The zzso zzso contained a significant amount of tightly bound zzso zzso No metal association was found either in wild type or in zzso zzso The availability of the zzso human zzso will aid in structural and zzso zzso
