zzso signaling plays critical roles in cell zzso zzso and migration, and it is generally accepted that to regulate these zzso functions accurately, localized zzso zzso is zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that control the targeting of zzso regulation molecules to the proper sites are zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso cell spreading and migration on zzso are dependent on the localized zzso of zzso D zzso However, the mechanism underlying zzso zzso by zzso is largely zzso Here we demonstrate that protein zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso is activated and zzso to the edges of zzso where it zzso with zzso The zzso of zzso activity inhibited zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Finally, we show that zzso of zzso is directly zzso by zzso and that zzso zzso in this region prevents zzso zzso zzso zzso to the edge of zzso zzso zzso and cell spreading after zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is a primary regulator of zzso zzso zzso via the direct zzso of zzso which is essential for directing zzso cell zzso
