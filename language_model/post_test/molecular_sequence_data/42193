The zzso tract is one of nature's great zzso zzso if not all, biologically active peptides can be found there, and it is quite likely that others remain to be zzso Our ability to exploit this resource has expanded considerably over the past two zzso Advances in zzso techniques have allowed investigators to rapidly isolate and purify new compounds from tissue zzso zzso and de zzso synthesis of newly discovered peptides are now routine, and the structural modifications required to alter activity and tailor a compound to a particular use are easily zzso A number of gastrointestinal peptides or their zzso for use in clinical studies are available from commercial sources (see Table zzso zzso is the first gut zzso to successfully complete development and yield a pharmaceutical compound with a broad range of zzso Several of the peptides discussed in this article have similar zzso zzso stands out as a candidate because of its effectiveness in the treatment of experimental spinal zzso injury and a variety of shock zzso Such a broad range of action in critical fields may justify the intensive development required to yield zzso zzso and highly specific zzso Similarly, the zzso and zzso properties of the zzso offer promise for new therapies in the treatment of zzso zzso and zzso Studies with zzso may lead to new and more precise regimens of blood sugar control in zzso diabetics and could in turn, prevent some of the worst long-term effects of the zzso The development of effective zzso forms of zzso could spare children with zzso zzso the distress of repeated injections and help to prevent excessive zzso blood zzso zzso zzso or zzso might be used one day in cardiovascular emergencies, and zzso or its zzso could prove effective in the treatment of zzso Although preliminary results with many of these peptides are encouraging, further progress will require the development of standardized experimental models and a more rigorous approach to experimental zzso Many of the studies reported here suffered from small patient numbers, a narrow or nonexistent range of doses, or the use of only one or two dosing zzso Lack of objective criteria for determining the level of response, zzso in studies of mental illness or degenerative diseases, and the ethical problems of withholding treatment from some patients to establish proper controls further hamper research in this zzso If the questions of efficacy and safety are to be zzso zzso zzso trials will be zzso
