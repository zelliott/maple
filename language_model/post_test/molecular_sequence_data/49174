A zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from zzso This zzso made a halo on a zzso culture containing zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene sequence showed that the zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso electron zzso showed the zzso is a rod and has no zzso structure on the surface of cells growing on zzso suggesting that this strain is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were detected in the culture zzso A major zzso product from zzso cellulose was zzso This strain has a potential to convert cellulosic biomass to zzso zzso
