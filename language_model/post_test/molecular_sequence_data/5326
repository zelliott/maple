The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a large number of zzso zzso complexes are rapidly cleared from the circulation by binding to a cellular zzso zzso via the zzso binding domain zzso which is made up of a 20 zzso zzso stretch of the 180 zzso zzso of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described which zzso with the zzso form of the zzso the so called transformed zzso zzso By screening of a zzso display library an zzso in the zzso of the inhibitor was identified that zzso with zzso zzso Out of 25 zzso clones a zzso sequence zzso was obtained containing identical zzso acids in three zzso A consensus zzso zzso was zzso and found to zzso zzso from binding to zzso zzso and to zzso The specificity of competition was demonstrated by a reversed zzso and a control zzso By structural comparison it was found that the consensus zzso mimics a zzso zzso constrained zzso present in the zzso of the zzso This is the first report describing the detection of zzso zzso by zzso display using a short linear zzso
