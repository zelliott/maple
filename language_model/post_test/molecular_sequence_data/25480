zzso the zzso zzso heavy and light chains the zzso B cell zzso of the zzso class contains a zzso of two zzso proteins zzso and zzso By zzso sequencing of zzso and zzso we have identified the genes zzso these proteins as zzso and zzso zzso Both genes are B cell specific and have been previously cloned from B minus T cell zzso zzso zzso We have constructed expression zzso of the two genes and demonstrate that expression of the zzso and zzso genes can influence the surface expression of zzso in zzso myeloma zzso From the known sequences of the zzso and zzso proteins and from the results of previous zzso experiments with various zzso expressing the zzso chain we have developed a structural model of the B cell zzso zzso of class zzso which we compare with that of the T cell zzso zzso
