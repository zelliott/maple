zzso zzso cells were used to select zzso of zzso that zzso activate the zzso for zzso stimulating factor zzso or zzso One zzso changed zzso zzso to zzso within a zzso rich region of the zzso tail and a second changed a nearby, highly zzso zzso zzso for zzso A third zzso zzso changed zzso 802 to Val within the alpha zzso 9 region of the zzso zzso domain, so supporting the zzso evidence that this region triggers zzso zzso A zzso zzso exactly equivalent to zzso was previously identified in a zzso cell line and was demonstrated here to be zzso Surprisingly, although zzso zzso transformed zzso cells, it could not induce zzso zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso It is suggested that the accelerated zzso degradation induced by zzso may account for its cell specific zzso
