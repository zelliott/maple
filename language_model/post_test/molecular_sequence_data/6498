The zzso mediates binding of zzso X zzso zzso zzso to DNA while the zzso and zzso in the zinc fingers of steroid hormone receptors play roles in zzso specificity and zzso zzso We investigated the function of these elements in the human vitamin D zzso zzso by mutating a zzso pair of zzso acids in the zzso and by altering the zzso and zzso to the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed attenuated vitamin D responsive element zzso binding in the presence of zzso and was severely compromised in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the rat zzso zzso and zzso near normal zzso zzso The zzso zzso uniquely exhibited dominant negative properties, highlighting the significance of this region of zzso for zzso zzso zzso
