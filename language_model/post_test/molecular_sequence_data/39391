The zzso drug zzso has been recently approved as the first oral drug active against visceral zzso We have previously identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso at the plasma membrane of zzso zzso Here we show that this protein is essential but not sufficient for the zzso zzso activity and, thus, for the potency of the zzso Based on recent findings in zzso we have identified the putative beta zzso of zzso named zzso as another protein factor required for the zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family, proposed as likely beta zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was identical to that of the zzso including a zzso in the zzso of zzso generally considered as not affected in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso normally localized to the plasma membrane but were retained inside the zzso zzso in the absence of the other protein or when zzso point zzso were introduced in zzso zzso the expression levels of either protein zzso we show that any one of them could behave as the protein limiting the level of zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso seem to form part of the same zzso machinery that determines zzso activity and zzso sensitivity in zzso further supporting the consideration of zzso proteins as beta zzso required for the normal functioning of zzso
