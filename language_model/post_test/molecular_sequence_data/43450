The rat brain zzso calcium channel clone has been expressed in zzso cells together with the zzso accessory zzso zzso and zzso From reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso experiments, we have obtained no evidence that these cells contain any zzso calcium zzso zzso cells were identified by zzso of a zzso for the reporter Green Fluorescent zzso From zzso evidence, a high degree of zzso was obtained between Green Fluorescent zzso and individual calcium channel zzso When all three calcium channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso evidence was obtained that all zzso were present at the cell zzso zzso calcium currents were observed between 24 and 72 h after zzso with the three calcium channel zzso The current density for the combination zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the current produced was slowly zzso The time constant of zzso of the maximum zzso was 332 zzso 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso had zzso of half zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and there was little overlap between the two zzso The zzso current was completely blocked by 100 zzso zzso and was also blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and analysis of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso both revealed apparent zzso values of approximately 11 zzso for zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso expressed in these cells has some resemblance to the P type component of calcium current observed in native zzso although it shows a somewhat greater degree of zzso than native P zzso more similar to the Q type current zzso It also has an affinity for zzso zzso zzso fold lower than reported for P zzso but approximately zzso higher than reported for Q zzso
