zzso systems are, zzso being studied from comparative zzso The analysis of the zzso systems of zzso such as fruit flies and zzso is an important part of this zzso These systems are zzso natural zzso zzso and zzso This is in contrast to the zzso T and B systems that characterize zzso zzso immunity whose properties can be zzso as zzso zzso specific, zzso and zzso In this review, we will focus on the earthworm zzso zzso like other complex zzso possess several zzso types and zzso and zzso a variety of zzso zzso The system as a whole effects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of foreign zzso At least two major zzso small zzso and large zzso mediate zzso reactions against several zzso zzso of tumor cells in zzso shows that zzso and natural killer cell responses are distinct properties of zzso A third type, the zzso cell, zzso and sheds zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso three have been identified and zzso zzso zzso zzso and another has been discovered zzso while three other zzso zzso zzso zzso share zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to these, zzso I is the only known zzso of the earthworm system that is zzso but zzso zzso the cellular and zzso components of the earthworm system function to distinguish between self and not self, dispose of internal zzso damaged components and external zzso zzso The evolutionary context of the earthworm innate immune system is discussed at the end of this zzso
