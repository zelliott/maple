The magnetic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso stems and zzso base pairs, could be tentatively assigned by means of the sequential nuclear zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso does not contain the zzso zzso base pair, the zzso base pair exists between the D and T zzso which was not found in the X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso and temperature on the zzso of this zzso have also been examined based on the behavior of the assigned resonance zzso zzso stabilize the D and T stems and the zzso structure between the D and T zzso zzso affects the zzso of the D and zzso zzso and zzso but does not stabilize zzso While the zzso stem melts zzso from both ends zzso and zzso with increasing temperature, the zzso stem melts from only one end zzso and the zzso base pair is the most zzso In the zzso structure between the variable loop and D zzso zzso melts first and zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been zzso and the results were compared with those for zzso zzso zzso
