Studies were carried out with zzso zzso cells cultured on zzso zzso dishes in order to analyze the mechanism of cell and nuclear shape control by zzso zzso zzso To examine the role of the zzso in shape determination independent of changes in zzso zzso pressure, zzso of adherent cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso using a buffer that maintains the functional integrity of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that addition of 250 zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells and zzso in a manner similar to that observed in intact living cells following detachment using zzso zzso image analysis confirmed that zzso cells remained essentially rigid in the absence of zzso and that zzso was zzso in a zzso manner as the concentration of zzso was raised from 10 to 250 zzso zzso zzso occurred by 30 zzso with projected cell and nuclear areas being reduced by 69 and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also accompanied by a zzso of zzso resulting in formation of a dense net of zzso surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in cell, zzso and nuclear form were prevented in zzso cells using a synthetic zzso zzso zzso that has been previously shown to inhibit zzso filament sliding in zzso In contrast, both the rate and extent of cell and nuclear zzso were increased in zzso cells exposed to zzso when the soluble zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso immobilized zzso from cell surface zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
