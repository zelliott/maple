zzso displays unusual resistance to zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso some such zzso as zzso despite a high degree of conservation with other zzso zzso zzso of zzso for the generally zzso zzso has been implicated as a critical zzso of the unusual behavior of zzso toward protein zzso zzso Another relatively zzso zzso near the zzso active site, zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso but not zzso forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain zzso nitrogen of the zzso ' zzso of a bound zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso we zzso zzso position 39 in zzso and human zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso We assessed zzso zzso and zzso rates of zzso zzso zzso bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso inhibitor domain by zzso and zzso zzso zzso finding that the presence of zzso relative to zzso results in a zzso to zzso poorer binding affinity and a zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso We also report the crystal structure of the zzso complex, in which we observe an zzso between zzso OH and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the presence of zzso in zzso and corresponding absence of a single zzso to the inhibitor zzso makes a small but significant functional contribution to the resistance of zzso to zzso and the ability of zzso to zzso zzso
