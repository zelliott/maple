In the current study, we wished to determine if the V regions zzso the naturally occurring zzso Cold zzso zzso zzso differ from zzso zzso CA that are exclusively zzso by the zzso zzso After zzso transformation of B zzso we generated one zzso zzso clone from each of two zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso and clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses a zzso gene sequence that is zzso zzso to the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso also expresses a zzso gene that is zzso zzso to the zzso rearranged zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso from individual SC is zzso zzso to the zzso gene zzso For zzso we studied zzso CA zzso zzso from 15 normal zzso and found no or relatively small amounts of zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso Five cold zzso zzso contained large amounts of zzso zzso zzso to pooled normal zzso by virtue of their binding to modified protein zzso A zzso and zzso of three CA zzso with modified zzso specifically removed zzso binding specificity zzso zzso the data indicate that naturally occurring zzso CA may be zzso to a large extent by zzso zzso and that the zzso gene is not uniquely required for zzso zzso
