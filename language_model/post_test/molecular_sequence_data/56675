In cultured rat and human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rat insulin I gene through the zzso zzso located between zzso zzso and zzso The zzso element was delineated to the region zzso to zzso The zzso bound zzso nuclear proteins to form three major complexes zzso A zzso zzso spanning the sequence zzso to zzso was sufficient to retain all binding activities of the entire zzso The zzso sequence of the human insulin promoter zzso with rat zzso nuclear extracts to form a single complex, corresponding to the C1 complex of the rat insulin I zzso C1 was present only in zzso zzso it was the major complex detected in isolated human zzso with both rat and human insulin zzso Furthermore, the DNA binding activity of the C1 zzso was selectively modulated by zzso zzso in a zzso manner; a zzso increase in binding intensity was detected when rat zzso were incubated for 1-3 h in the presence of 20 zzso 1-2 zzso zzso We therefore suggest that the zzso involved in the C1 complex zzso to the zzso factor and, consequently, may play a determining role in zzso expression of the insulin zzso
