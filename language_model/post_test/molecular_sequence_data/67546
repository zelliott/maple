zzso spectrum disorder zzso is a zzso disorder with substantial zzso most of which is zzso zzso has a population prevalence of one percent and affects four times as many males as zzso Patients with fragile X E zzso intellectual zzso which is caused by a zzso of the zzso gene zzso display a number of zzso zzso zzso and deletions at the zzso locus have also been reported in cases with moderate intellectual disability and zzso We hypothesized that other rare zzso sequence zzso at the zzso locus might contribute to zzso We zzso the zzso zzso region in 202 male zzso zzso and found that zzso of males zzso had zzso zzso at highly zzso evolutionary zzso When compared with the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso X zzso from unaffected controls, we saw a statistically significant enrichment in patients with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, we identified rare zzso 3' zzso zzso at zzso sites which alter gene expression in a zzso zzso These data suggest that rare variation in zzso may be a previously zzso zzso zzso locus and may help explain some of the male excess of zzso
