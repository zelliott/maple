Mobile group II zzso found in bacterial and zzso zzso are both zzso zzso and zzso zzso They use an extraordinary mobility mechanism in which the excised zzso zzso reverse zzso directly into a DNA target site and is then reverse transcribed by the zzso zzso After DNA zzso the zzso remove themselves by zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby minimizing host zzso Here we discuss the experimental basis for our current understanding of group II zzso mobility mechanisms, beginning with genetic observations in zzso zzso and culminating with a detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms shared by zzso and bacterial group II zzso We also discuss recently discovered links between group II zzso mobility and DNA zzso new insights into group II zzso evolution arising from bacterial zzso sequencing, and the evolutionary relationship between group II zzso and both zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we describe the development of mobile group II zzso into zzso zzso zzso which have zzso target zzso
