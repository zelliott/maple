We have cloned a full-length zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso from a goldfish brain and zzso zzso library, which represents the first for zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of goldfish zzso zzso shows that this zzso is highly zzso across zzso The mature region of goldfish zzso zzso shares zzso zzso acid identity with that of zzso zzso zzso of goldfish zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso including zzso zzso brain and liver, suggesting a wide range of zzso roles for zzso A in the zzso The identity of the cloned goldfish zzso zzso was confirmed by expressing the protein in the Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells followed by detection of the specific zzso activity in the culture medium using zzso differentiation factor zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines producing high level of zzso goldfish zzso A were established and zzso
