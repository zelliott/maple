Cell wall extracts from the zzso zzso zzso strain were used as the zzso to obtain a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognizes a specific zzso we have named zzso the walls of cells of zzso zzso zzso runs as a zzso band of over 180 zzso in sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of zzso extracts of cell walls, although an analysis of the zzso pattern of the zzso shows that at the level of zzso zzso it behaves like a discrete band of 140 zzso zzso analysis with the zzso showed that zzso lies at the inner layer of the cell wall, being accessible to the zzso only after the outer layer of zzso is disturbed by treatment with zzso The screening of a zzso zzso expression library enabled us to identify the open reading frame zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso frame zzso codes for zzso zzso zzso of which over zzso are zzso or zzso and contains a putative zzso site and a putative zzso attachment zzso Both disruption and zzso of the zzso caused increased sensitivities to zzso white and zzso red, while the disruption caused an increased sensitivity to zzso zzso suggesting for zzso a structural role in association with zzso
