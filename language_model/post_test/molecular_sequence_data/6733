zzso zzso also known as zzso transpose by reverse zzso of an zzso zzso Their mechanism of zzso is apparently different from that of zzso and similar to that of zzso of zzso The I factor is responsible for the zzso system of hybrid zzso in zzso zzso zzso strains contain several functional I factors whereas zzso strains do zzso zzso of I factors can be zzso zzso they are stable in zzso zzso but transpose at high frequency in the zzso of zzso known as zzso zzso produced by crossing zzso females and zzso zzso We have constructed an I element, called zzso marked with the zzso zzso the coding sequence of which was interrupted by an zzso zzso of the zzso can only occur in the transcript initiated from the I element zzso zzso copies expressing a zzso zzso zzso were recovered in the zzso of zzso females in which I factors were actively zzso This indicates that zzso of a defective I element, deficient for the second open reading frame, by functional I factors can occur in the zzso of zzso zzso
