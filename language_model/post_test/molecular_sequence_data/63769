zzso zzso carrying zzso that cause zzso dominant zzso zzso in humans have been used to study rod zzso zzso in various model organisms including zzso zzso To date, the only zzso shown to cause rod zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been either zzso zzso or zzso versions of zzso based mainly on zzso zzso zzso sequences but with a zzso zzso Since the zzso sequence of zzso is highly zzso in zzso and divergent in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso may have unexpected properties as zzso we decided to test whether a zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying only the zzso zzso could also cause rod zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing these zzso indeed had shortened outer segments and, in severely affected animals, the loss of rod zzso but not the loss of cone zzso zzso analyses showed that less than zzso of zzso transgenic zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to produce severe rod zzso zzso As observed in other animal models as well as humans carrying this particular zzso zzso the rod zzso zzso was most severe in the zzso zzso and was modified by zzso Thus, the rod zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in an otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso is generally similar to that seen with zzso zzso and zzso versions of zzso zzso zzso though some differences remain to be zzso
