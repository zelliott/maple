zzso is a growth and survival factor for prostate cancer cells through zzso zzso Here, we have systematically examined the zzso regulation mechanisms of zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were used to determine zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso reporters were generated and their zzso activities were zzso The zzso factors involved in zzso regulation were identified with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and blockade of zzso with zzso or zzso were performed to demonstrate the cooperation between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso 

zzso factor regulatory sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso are responsive to zzso activated zzso production in zzso prostate cancer cell zzso Among these sites, zzso and zzso appear most important, while zzso shows the least effect for zzso promoter activity as determined by zzso zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso Nevertheless, nuclear factor zzso is activated and zzso Such zzso is minimally dependent upon the zzso site, occurring through cooperation with other zzso factors that bind the zzso zzso Cooperation between zzso zzso and zzso did not require a functional zzso binding zzso 

These data support a unique role for zzso zzso as the primary trigger in zzso production of zzso in prostate cancer zzso Furthermore, we describe a novel zzso zzso mechanism for zzso that is independent of its regulatory binding site, occurring through cooperation with other zzso factors that facilitate the neighboring regulatory zzso
