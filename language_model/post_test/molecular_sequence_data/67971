The zzso transcripts zzso which code from an zzso zzso segment of the internal repeat region of the zzso zzso are the only viral transcripts that are present during zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the relative contribution of promoter activity, zzso zzso and elements or regions affecting long term expression of these transcripts in zzso infected zzso To begin to address this question we investigated zzso promoter activity during acute and zzso zzso Mouse zzso were infected with zzso an engineered zzso zzso virus in which both copies of the zzso promoter are used to drive expression of the zzso coli zzso Z zzso Four days zzso zzso abundant zzso zzso protein and transcripts were present within zzso zzso as zzso by zzso zzso and in zzso zzso In contrast, by Day 21 (at which time a zzso infection had been zzso no zzso transcripts were present in infected zzso even when zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso These findings indicate a significant drop in zzso promoter activity between Day 4 and Day 21 zzso To provide zzso evidence for this conclusion we infected mice with a second viral zzso zzso in which the zzso promoter was used to drive expression of the nerve growth factor zzso zzso Four days zzso abundant zzso zzso and transcripts were present in infected zzso zzso but no evidence of zzso of the cloned zzso gene could be found in zzso infected zzso Our findings suggest that zzso promoter activity is severely restricted during the zzso phase of zzso zzso
