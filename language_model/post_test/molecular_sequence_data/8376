A functional DNA replication zzso of zzso zzso contains two overlapping binding sites, A and B, for the replication zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the consensus B site has been used to detect four new zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in addition to the previously identified and closely spaced zzso and zzso All the new zzso lie in the zzso region of the zzso on both sides of zzso and zzso with their positions spanning zzso zzso of its zzso Their DNA sequences are characterized by clearly identifiable A- and zzso zzso They bind zzso in a manner indistinguishable from zzso although precise affinities have not been zzso Each new zzso is functional in causing fork arrest when present in a zzso replicating in zzso zzso Three of the four were tested for polarity in zzso activity and exhibited the polarity zzso The total of six zzso now identified in zzso zzso have been named zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the previously identified zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all but one of the zzso zzso have been established and they conform to an arrangement similar to that in zzso coli in which two opposed groups of polar zzso provide a zzso trap ensuring that the approaching zzso meet within a restricted region of the zzso The development of a zzso similar arrangement of zzso in the two organisms, despite the lack of any zzso similarity in their respective DNA zzso and zzso zzso emphasizes the importance of the zzso trap in each zzso
