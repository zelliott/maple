The four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso share a repetitive domain composed of repeat units rich in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso a fifth member of this family, zzso and shown it to be essential for cell zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a 415 zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 45 zzso containing a zzso domain and an zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso recognize a zzso protein by zzso and decorate the zzso and the surrounding zzso A conditional lethal zzso zzso was zzso growth of the zzso strain in zzso medium zzso zzso zzso In cells depleted of zzso production of zzso zzso is zzso Northern analysis and zzso labeling indicate that zzso processing is inhibited at the late steps, in which zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso
