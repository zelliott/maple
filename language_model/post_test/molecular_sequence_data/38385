Here we describe novel members of a gene family which have similarity to zzso zzso zzso one of the key zzso in the production of zzso zzso zzso In addition to the first animal member of the family described previously zzso zzso a second zzso member has been identified, which appears to differ in zzso distribution from zzso In zzso zzso genes form a zzso family, compatible with a possible function as zzso and zzso zzso In zzso two members have been identified and one member each in mouse and zzso Interestingly, the human zzso gene is strongly expressed in the brain, the very organ many of the zzso zzso act zzso
