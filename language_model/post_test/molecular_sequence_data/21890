zzso and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from clinical samples of a zzso zzso The zzso was identified as a zzso species based on its cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence comparison studies confirmed its identification as a member of the zzso zzso but the zzso did not zzso to any species of this zzso The nearest zzso relative of the unknown zzso from zzso was zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso and zzso sequence analysis showed sequence similarity values of less than zzso % and zzso zzso respectively, with the currently recognized species of the zzso zzso The novel bacterial isolate was distinguished from zzso zzso and other species of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso Based on both zzso and zzso findings, it is proposed that the unknown zzso be classified as a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
