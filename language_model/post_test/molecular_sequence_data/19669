zzso zzso zzso function is key in the progression of an impaired zzso tolerance state to overt type 2 diabetes zzso a transition that can be delayed by zzso We have previously shown that trained rats are protected from heart zzso injury in correlation with an increase in cardiac tissue zzso zzso This trained zzso zzso if induced in the zzso could also prevent zzso failure in the zzso of zzso To assess the effect of training on zzso zzso metabolism and insulin zzso female zzso rats were exercised on a treadmill for 90 zzso 4 zzso for 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of key zzso metabolism zzso and zzso insulin zzso were determined in freshly isolated zzso from trained and sedentary control rats after a 48 h rest period from the last zzso Although this moderate training reduced plasma zzso free fatty zzso and zzso levels by about zzso consistent with reduced zzso from zzso zzso it did not alter zzso zzso zzso nor the zzso expression of key zzso factors and zzso of zzso zzso The training also had no effect on zzso insulin zzso or its amplification by free fatty zzso In zzso chronic exercise training did not cause an intrinsic change in zzso zzso zzso Training did, however, substantially reduce the exposure of zzso to zzso zzso thereby providing a potential mechanism by which exercise can prevent zzso zzso failure leading to zzso
