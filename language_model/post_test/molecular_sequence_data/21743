The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso in zzso A better understanding of the population zzso of its different strains is, however, needed for the development of novel diagnostic tools, zzso and prevention zzso Specifically, the development of effective vaccination policies relies on the proper zzso and zzso of field zzso Although zzso sequence typing zzso has been recently developed, only strains from geographically restricted collections have been zzso so zzso The expansion of the zzso database to include global strains with different geographic origins is therefore zzso In this study, we used a panel of reference strains from geographically diverse origins and field samples of zzso zzso detected from its zzso zzso zzso in zzso areas in zzso 

A total of 31 novel zzso zzso four, six, three, two, five, three, and two for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 19 novel sequence types zzso were zzso Both zzso and minimum spanning tree analyses indicated a high degree of genetic zzso among these zzso No association was observed between zzso and geographic origins, except for four zzso from West African zzso When we performed six different tests for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso four possible zzso events were identified in six different zzso All the zzso zzso were located near gene borders, indicating the occurrence of zzso zzso All four zzso that localized to a distinct group in zzso analysis showed evidence of identical zzso events, suggesting that zzso may play a significant role in the diversification of zzso zzso 

The compilation of zzso data set across the African continent will be particularly valuable for the understanding of the existing genetic diversity of field zzso in African zzso Comprehensive information on the degree of zzso between strains and further understanding of possible relationships between zzso and zzso such as vaccine efficacy are expected to lead to the development of zzso vaccination zzso
