The zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso production from zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso the former zzso is organized in a zzso zzso while the zzso genes form a common zzso unit with the gene zzso zzso a probable zzso zzso zzso This genetic arrangement could reflect zzso requirements at the onset of zzso In addition to zzso two zzso zzso zzso and a zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso analyses showed a sequential order of induction for the different zzso zzso zzso indicating an in zzso function of zzso in low level zzso zzso The zzso roles of zzso and zzso most likely involve high level zzso formation, with zzso being responsible for the onset of zzso and zzso ensuring continued zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in artificially induced zzso synthesis which seems to be zzso by a still unknown set of zzso Although the signal that triggers the shift to zzso has not yet been zzso recent investigations suggest a possible function of DNA zzso as a zzso sensor of the respective environmental zzso
