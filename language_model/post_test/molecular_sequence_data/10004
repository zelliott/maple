The product of zzso zzso is a growth factor with high level of similarity to protein S and was identified as the zzso for zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain zzso four zzso growth factor like zzso and a large zzso D zzso An alternative zzso spliced form zzso having an additional 43 zzso acids between fourth zzso like and D domain was zzso Here we show data indicating that zzso is specifically zzso within the inserted zzso thereby splitting the D domain from the remaining part of the zzso The resulting two zzso products of 36 zzso and 50 zzso were separated and the 50 zzso zzso corresponding to region D was shown to be responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso a deletion zzso of zzso containing only the D domain was shown to similarly activate zzso zzso zzso unequivocally demonstrating that D domain can act as a zzso zzso The possible roles of the zzso processing of zzso in the regulation of growth factor availability are zzso
