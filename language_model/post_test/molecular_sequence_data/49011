zzso which contains one zzso zzso zzso 3 domain, has been previously identified from mouse skin and considered to play an important role in hair zzso formation by interacting with other zzso 

We performed this study to identify proteins capable of zzso with zzso 

We screened a mouse skin zzso library using the zzso domain of zzso as bait in the zzso zzso zzso 

We identified a zzso zzso protein containing a zzso stretch and five zzso zzso zzso which we have termed zzso We confirmed the interactions between zzso and zzso by in zzso binding zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts in mouse skin were expressed in accordance with the hair zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso zzso studies demonstrated that its transcripts were detected predominantly in the zzso cells at the level corresponding to the zzso zone of the hair zzso during the mid and late zzso zzso 

zzso is a novel zzso protein that may be involved in the development of zzso cells during the zzso zzso
