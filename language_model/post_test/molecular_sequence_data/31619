To evaluate the zzso relationships of zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the common orient clam zzso zzso and the zzso structure of this zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso structure of this zzso with those of chicken and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the location of the side chain of the second zzso zzso an zzso acid, and the zzso zzso bound at zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, the zzso acid zzso interacting with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and no other possible zzso acid that could contribute to this interaction was found in zzso zzso zzso It therefore seems that the zzso of the zzso acids at the interface of the zzso zzso zzso are likely to change the zzso state of the zzso zzso
