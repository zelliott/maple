This study examines whether the mimicking of selected properties of naturally occurring zzso zzso in zzso allows efficient zzso of gene expression by in zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso regulatory transcripts are expressed at high levels and have hairpin structures at their zzso features reminiscent of small nuclear zzso zzso which are abundant and stable in the nucleus of all zzso zzso A sequence complementary to zzso zzso zzso interrupted in its center by a zzso zzso was zzso for the zzso protein binding site between the zzso structures of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in dramatic zzso of expression of zzso message and protein in zzso zzso cultured zzso The zzso effect was localized to the zzso The biological properties of zzso zzso may provide a widely zzso vehicle for the in zzso delivery of zzso targeting zzso
