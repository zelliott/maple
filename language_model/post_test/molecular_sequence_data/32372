The zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso contains two zzso each of the zzso and zzso zzso which zzso the important zzso target functions zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso screens were conducted to detect and characterize gene fragments of each of these four genes that could cause growth reduction of zzso zzso when zzso expressed from a zzso zzso Numerous such gene fragments that were overwhelmingly in the zzso orientation were identified for the zzso and zzso zzso while no such orientation bias was seen for the zzso and zzso zzso Gene replacement zzso was used to confirm the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso gene fragments resulted in specific reduction of zzso of their zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso cells to a zzso zzso compound but not to other antibiotics that affect cell wall zzso fatty acid zzso protein translation, or DNA zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso expression caused hypersensitivity to zzso zzso a synergistic response that has also been noted for the zzso zzso zzso These experiments form the basis of zzso detection zzso that can be used in the discovery of novel zzso or zzso zzso drugs that are effective against zzso zzso or other zzso bacterial zzso
