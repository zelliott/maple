The zzso proteins zzso and zzso belong to a family of proteins that contain an zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso Both zzso and zzso function as zzso to target zzso proteins to the zzso through recognition of zzso (four or more zzso zzso by their zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso by their zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso complex are zzso In the zzso the zzso zzso zzso associate through zzso interactions to form zzso zzso ribbons that leave the zzso surface zzso The zzso complex explains the reduced affinity of the zzso domain for zzso compared with zzso and has implications for the regulation of zzso zzso function during zzso zzso zzso A model is discussed in which two or more zzso zzso molecules may selectively bind to zzso zzso
