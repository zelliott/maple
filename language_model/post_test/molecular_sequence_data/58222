The membrane attack complex zzso of carp complement was extracted with zzso from rabbit zzso zzso by carp serum and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso On two-dimensional zzso of carp zzso eight bands were zzso The band of zzso zzso was identified as carp zzso by western zzso using zzso zzso and two bands of zzso 62,000 and one band of zzso 22,000 were confirmed as those of carp zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso respectively, by their zzso zzso acid zzso The bands of zzso zzso and zzso which generated from a 180,000 band under reducing conditions, were those corresponding to human zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso The remaining bands of zzso zzso and zzso were identified as those corresponding to human zzso and zzso as determined by their molecular size, zzso structures and similarities in zzso zzso acid sequences to their zzso zzso zzso scan of the gels showed the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in carp MAC to be zzso Based on these results, it appears that, as with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso fish complement is composed of five terminal components from zzso to zzso
