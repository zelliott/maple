The effect of different carbon sources on the expression in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso was studied from zzso containing its zzso region zzso to zzso which were fused zzso to the zzso gene coding zzso zzso expression was achieved with the zzso zzso ethanol and/or zzso whereas lower levels were found with zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso zzso it, even in the presence of any of these other carbon zzso zzso analyses of the zzso to zzso zzso promoter region permitted the identification of two fragments involved in both zzso repression and ethanol zzso A possible region required for zzso regulation was zzso The zzso promoter contains a zzso zzso box whose deletion caused a zzso increase in the zzso reporter zzso Despite this, expression of the zzso promoter was not zzso
