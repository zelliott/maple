The zzso zzso hypothetical protein zzso belongs to a family of predicted zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso present in many bacterial and zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence motifs common to class I zzso zzso suggested a specific role as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and native versions of the protein were zzso zzso and zzso Two crystal forms of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the native protein with zzso zzso yielded a third crystal form, zzso The zzso structure was solved by the multiple anomalous zzso method and refined at zzso A zzso The zzso and zzso structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined at zzso and zzso A, zzso zzso formed a zzso in the zzso and in zzso Each zzso folds into a zzso structure composed of a small zzso zzso domain, a central zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The three zzso form an overall zzso shape, with the putative active site facing a deep zzso The architecture of the active site is consistent with specific recognition of zzso and zzso of zzso transfer to the zzso zzso The zzso is suitable in size and charge distribution for binding zzso zzso
