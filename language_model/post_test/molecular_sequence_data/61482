zzso zzso is a precursor for several zzso hormones including zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso Fish zzso in four zzso classes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso However, two essential species, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso are still missing in the evolutionary image of this zzso The present study reports analysis of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which belongs to another zzso in the zzso zzso zzso clones were amplified by zzso from zzso zzso prepared on total zzso from a complex of zzso and zzso and subsequently overlapped to obtain a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso excluding the zzso zzso It encodes a signal zzso of 25 zzso acids and zzso of 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso originally found in zzso zzso was also present in zzso zzso suggesting this structure might have appeared after the divergence of zzso from the ancestral zzso Thus, we demonstrated the common occurrence of four zzso in zzso zzso and established a clear understanding of the molecular evolution of zzso in zzso
