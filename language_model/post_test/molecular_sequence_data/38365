To evaluate zzso affinities of zzso species within zzso we zzso the zzso zzso gene from 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of dogs and 1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso from other zzso among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso species and 2 zzso were obtained from zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso group distinct from representatives of other zzso zzso Although zzso our analysis indicated that zzso and zzso are sister zzso and that zzso is zzso to zzso To evaluate zzso affinities among zzso zzso zzso zzso and other species of zzso we examined 18 zzso and zzso features of 13 species currently assigned to zzso This analysis indicates zzso of zzso (as currently zzso because zzso zzso was found most closely related to zzso zzso These results, combined with results of previous studies, support zzso zzso to familial level zzso as originally suggested by zzso in zzso Both DNA sequence data and zzso and zzso characters support a zzso relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
