The zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and their role in plant organ pigmentation is well established in model zzso However, the genetic basis of zzso variation is species specific and understanding this variation is very relevant in many fruit and flower crop zzso Among grape zzso there is a wide genetic variation for berry zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso to dark blue zzso Berry zzso results from the synthesis and zzso of zzso in the berry skin, which in plants is commonly regulated by zzso factors belonging to the zzso and zzso zzso In this work, we aimed to identify the major genetic zzso of berry zzso variation in a large collection of table grape zzso and zzso zzso The genetic analyses of berry zzso in a few grape segregating zzso had previously identified a single locus on linkage group 2 responsible for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso variation for berry skin zzso in zzso zzso had been associated with the presence of a zzso zzso in the promoter region of zzso a zzso gene whose expression is associated to skin zzso The results show that zzso is the gene underlying the mapped locus controlling berry zzso in zzso Additionally, the molecular analyses indicate that genetic and zzso berry zzso variation can be associated to molecular variation at zzso in more than zzso of the analyzed zzso Thus, zzso is a major zzso of berry zzso variation in table grape and its instability is the major cause of zzso variation for this zzso
