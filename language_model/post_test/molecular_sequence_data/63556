A synthetic human zzso gamma zzso gene was fused to zzso and zzso two zzso artificial signal peptides to transport the zzso to the zzso of zzso coli zzso The processing efficiency of both zzso and zzso was dependent on the culture medium as well as the zzso zzso Both precursors were processed completely when cells were cultured using minimal medium and a zzso temperature of zzso degrees C, and only the processed zzso was zzso The zzso signal zzso was more efficient than zzso for the zzso of zzso Sixty percent of the total zzso was zzso to the zzso using the zzso signal zzso and a zzso temperature of 20 degrees zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso soluble zzso was recovered with a purity of zzso
