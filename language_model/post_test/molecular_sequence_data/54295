Various zzso modifications zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso In this study, we investigated previously unidentified zzso of zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the molecular mass of the zzso zzso of zzso was increased by zzso which could represent zzso zzso or zzso zzso To discriminate between these zzso zzso the molecular mass of the zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso The high magnetic field zzso provided zzso mass zzso revealing that the zzso zzso was modified by zzso We could also detect the existence of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso point zzso with zzso replacing the zzso zzso showed dramatically reduced zzso and short zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso may be essential for the zzso of functional zzso
