zzso zzso has attracted substantial attention for its application in zzso acid production in recent zzso In the present study, the fungus zzso was isolated and identified as zzso zzso based on its zzso its zzso zzso DNA zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso resting cells were determined, and the optimum activity was achieved at 40 zzso with pH zzso The zzso of the zzso at 30, 40, and 50 zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso showed a wide zzso spectrum with high specificity for zzso and zzso zzso It remained extremely active in zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso and excess zzso inhibited the zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso and zzso improved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso acid within 30 zzso whereas only zzso of zzso was zzso The results show that this zzso zzso is a promising candidate for commercial application in zzso acid zzso
