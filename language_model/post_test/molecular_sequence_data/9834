zzso and zzso studies have indicated the presence of many zzso substances in the zzso nervous system zzso of the crab Cancer zzso In zzso studies, many of these substances zzso the motor output of neural networks contained within this zzso Previous work in the zzso suggested the presence of zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we isolate and characterize two novel peptides from the zzso borealis nervous system that show strong zzso acid sequence identity to the zzso zzso The central nervous systems of 160 zzso were extracted in an zzso zzso after which four zzso zzso column systems were used to obtain pure zzso A zzso zzso muscle contraction zzso and a zzso zzso employing an zzso to zzso I zzso zzso I) were used to monitor all collected zzso The zzso acid sequences of the isolated peptides were determined by zzso zzso Mass zzso and chemical synthesis confirmed the sequences to be zzso and zzso zzso is approximately zzso more abundant in the crab central nervous system than is zzso We have named these peptides Cancer borealis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both peptides are zzso in the zzso zzso muscle contraction zzso with zzso zzso being approximately 500 times more potent than zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso zzso borealis zzso zzso zzso extract revealed that zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso of synthetic zzso zzso with the isolated zzso excited the zzso motor zzso These effects were suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I had no effect on the actions of the unrelated zzso zzso zzso in the zzso There was no consistent influence of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Given its zzso acid sequence and minimal biological activity in the zzso zzso zzso may be a breakdown product of zzso zzso
