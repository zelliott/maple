A zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso was found to complement the zzso zzso zzso coli strain zzso Transformation with a zzso zzso harboring this zzso zzso the capacity to grow on a minimal medium containing only 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified a single gene responsible for the zzso This gene coded for an apparent zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso analysis of the cloned region also revealed three additional open reading zzso These zzso a gene zzso a zzso to the zzso gene product of zzso zzso a zzso regulatory gene which was found to enhance zzso resistance in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso in a separate zzso test, and an zzso with no significant similarity to sequences deposited in zzso
