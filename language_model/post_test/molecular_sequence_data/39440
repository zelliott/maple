We investigated the role of the zzso proteins in developing and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are simple zzso zzso a zzso of zzso surrounded by a zzso zzso embedded and covered with unique proteins called zzso zzso observations have suggested that zzso maintain zzso as small single units preventing their zzso during seed zzso To understand the role of zzso during seed development or zzso we created lines of zzso in which a major zzso is zzso or severely zzso This was achieved using zzso interference techniques and through the use of a zzso zzso event, which appears to interrupt the major (18 zzso seed zzso gene of zzso and results in zzso of zzso zzso suppression resulted in an zzso zzso of zzso cells that contain unusually large zzso that are not normally observed in zzso Changes in the size of zzso caused disruption of storage zzso altering zzso of lipids and proteins and causing delay in zzso The zzso zzso were reversed by reintroducing a zzso zzso Based on this direct evidence, we have shown that zzso are important proteins in seed tissue for controlling zzso structure and zzso zzso
