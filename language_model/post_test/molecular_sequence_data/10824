The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown previously to exhibit a zzso restriction of long-distance movement of tobacco etch zzso zzso In zzso both zzso and zzso strains are capable of zzso amplification and zzso movement, but only zzso is capable of systemic infection by zzso long-distance zzso To investigate the basis for zzso movement of zzso zzso virus zzso were assembled from zzso and zzso zzso containing the zzso coding regions for zzso and/or zzso protein zzso two proteins that are known to be essential for zzso long-distance movement, failed to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso viruses zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso were able to zzso zzso zzso The critical region controlling the infection zzso in zzso was mapped to a zzso segment containing zzso differences, but only five zzso acid differences, between zzso and zzso In zzso zzso experiments, a restricted strain had no effect on systemic infection by a long-distance zzso zzso strain, suggesting that the restricted strain was not inducing a generalized systemic resistance zzso These data suggest that the zzso domain, which is zzso attached to the zzso end of zzso zzso interacts either directly or indirectly with host components to facilitate long-distance zzso
