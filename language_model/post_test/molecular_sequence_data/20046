The oak zzso zzso zzso is distributed across the Western zzso from Morocco to zzso It belongs to a zzso of zzso zzso species that requires host zzso in two sections of zzso zzso zzso to complete its zzso a requirement that has restricted the historic distribution and zzso of members of this zzso Here we present nuclear and zzso sequence evidence from the entire geographic range of zzso zzso to investigate the genetic legacy of zzso range zzso We show zzso zzso as currently understood to be zzso or zzso with three zzso independent (but partially zzso lineages that zzso zzso 10 million years ago zzso The similarities in zzso structure that have justified recognition of single species to date thus represent either strong conservation of an ancestral state or striking zzso All three lineages originated in areas to the east of Europe, underlining the significance of Turkey, Iran and the Levant as zzso of zzso zzso One of the three lineages gave rise to all European zzso and range expansion from a putative Eastern origin to the present distribution is predicted to have occurred around zzso zzso
