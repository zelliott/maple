The zzso gene is part of the zzso segment A of infectious zzso disease virus zzso It has been identified as the major zzso zzso of zzso and is known to contain zzso dependent protective zzso A zzso pair segment covering the zzso region of this gene from three recent zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso United States, two zzso from the zzso Peninsula, and three zzso standard viruses were amplified and zzso using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and cycle sequencing zzso This was done to determine the molecular similarity among zzso that differ zzso and zzso zzso analysis suggested that the Arkansas zzso and Mississippi zzso zzso evolved closely and separately from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in contrast to the other zzso zzso Georgia zzso which is more closely related zzso to Delaware E zzso All zzso except for zzso underwent a shift in zzso acid number 222 from zzso to zzso The sequence of zzso BD virus, a commercially available intermediate zzso was markedly different, evolving from a separate lineage than the zzso zzso zzso sites could differentiate most zzso Except for zzso zzso do not have zzso site at the larger zzso zzso All zzso lost their zzso zzso and zzso cutting sites with a change in base number zzso The zzso site is in zzso whereas the zzso site is absent in the standard vaccine zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in all virulent zzso including zzso but not in the attenuated zzso BD and zzso zzso 3) and published zzso and zzso zzso
