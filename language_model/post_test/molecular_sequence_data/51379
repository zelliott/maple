The zzso solution structure of the zzso domain isolated from zzso zzso B is compared with the X-ray crystal structure of the corresponding segment in the intact zzso For the region of the zzso chain that has a zzso three-dimensional structure in solution, zzso the backbone atoms of zzso zzso and 25 zzso acid side chains in this segment that form a zzso core in the zzso domain, the zzso distance between the two structures is zzso There are no significant differences in average atom positions between the two structures, but only the zzso structure shows increased structural disorder in three outlying zzso located along the same edge of the zzso zzso These regions of increased structural disorder in the free domain coincide only partially with the interface to the zzso domain in the zzso
