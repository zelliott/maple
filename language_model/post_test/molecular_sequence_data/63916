The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso which mediates most of the toxic and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be the major reason for the exceptionally wide zzso zzso sensitivity difference in acute toxicity of zzso between two rat zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso and resistant zzso zzso zzso but there is another, currently unknown contributing factor zzso In the present study, we examined zzso structure and expression in these rat strains to find out whether zzso could be this auxiliary zzso zzso cloning of zzso coding region showed that consistent with zzso proteins in other species, the zzso end of rat zzso is highly zzso but zzso B and zzso zzso are severely truncated or zzso zzso structures were recorded in both zzso Next, the zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso was determined using quantitative real-time zzso In liver, zzso expression was very low in zzso rats, but it increased rapidly after zzso exposure zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso expression of zzso whereas zzso zzso and heart showed the highest induction of zzso in response to zzso zzso Again, no marked differences were found between zzso and zzso rats, zzso that zzso is not the auxiliary contributing factor to the strain difference in zzso zzso However, simultaneous measurement of zzso zzso reinforced the view that zzso is an important zzso of zzso responsiveness to zzso
