Two transgenic tobacco lines were genetically engineered to contain zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed from the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso One zzso contained two copies of a construct including the first 60 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to target the zzso zzso to the zzso The other zzso contained a single copy of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of in zzso zzso expressed the zzso and contained a novel zzso zzso which assembled into active zzso zzso zzso about zzso of the total zzso zzso In in zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso the novel zzso was found to be associated with the zzso zzso in zzso the size of the novel zzso was not that predicted of the precursor zzso zzso but was about 39 zzso the same size as the authentic zzso gamma zzso in zzso These results are consistent with the precursor being imported into the zzso and zzso near the fusion junction between the two zzso These experiments have therefore shown that the zzso of the zzso zzso has successfully targeted the zzso gamma zzso to the zzso of transgenic tobacco where it has assembled into an active zzso However, in fully zzso plants growing zzso in zzso conditions, although the zzso were still zzso the gamma zzso did not accumulate to the same levels as in in zzso zzso and new zzso activities were now barely zzso zzso in leaves of the mature zzso plants, the gamma zzso was found to be associated with the zzso fraction of the zzso The results of these experiments are zzso
