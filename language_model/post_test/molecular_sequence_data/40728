The use of zzso for virus discovery in clinical samples has opened new opportunities for understanding the zzso of unexplained zzso This study explores the potential of this zzso approach in a zzso setting, by systematic analysis of samples cultured from patients with unexplained illness through a combination of zzso zzso and viral zzso In total, zzso zzso zzso were collected between 1994 and 2007 through the zzso Surveillance zzso in the zzso During the 13 year period, seven samples that exhibited zzso zzso effects in cell culture tested negative in standard zzso zzso for a range of zzso In order to fill the diagnostic zzso viral zzso was applied to these culture zzso resulting in the rapid identification of viruses in all of the zzso The unexplained samples contained BK zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso disease virus and the recently discovered zzso viruses zzso (which dominated the unexplained zzso zzso The full zzso sequences of four zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso which share zzso zzso identity with known zzso zzso are zzso Further screening for zzso in additional zzso unidentified clinical zzso from 2008 and 2009 resulted in identification of another zzso zzso Although the zzso of the identified viruses has not been established, this study demonstrates that viral zzso is a powerful tool that can be integrated into zzso monitoring efforts to investigate unidentified viruses in cell cultures from clinical zzso where standard zzso zzso fail to detect zzso
