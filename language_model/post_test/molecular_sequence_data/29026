zzso is essential for loading zzso proteins into zzso complexes zzso during replication licensing and has been found in organisms as diverse as zzso zzso and zzso We have identified a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso which is required for zzso zzso We show that, like zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus during zzso phase and is excluded from the nucleus later in the cell cycle by zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso complex, and the nuclear zzso of these proteins during zzso is zzso This zzso of zzso and zzso represents a novel level of zzso zzso
