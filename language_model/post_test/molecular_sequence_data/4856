The zzso family of zzso factors consists of two zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso is required for cell zzso and is necessary for fruit fly zzso zzso activity is a target for regulation by the zzso gene family, which includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice develop zzso probably as a result of zzso in the activity of zzso indicating the importance of zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso development, we have examined the patterns of expression of zzso through zzso and zzso in the developing nervous system by in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are first detected in the zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso forms extends zzso thereafter and includes the developing brain and the upper half of the zzso zzso spinal zzso By zzso zzso these zzso factors are expressed throughout the central nervous zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in proliferating, zzso zzso zzso As zzso differentiate and migrate to the outer marginal zones in the nervous system, expression of these zzso members is zzso In the developing zzso another zzso zzso zzso expression is also confined to the proliferating, zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression is zzso as zzso differentiate into the zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso high zzso transcript levels are present in regions corresponding to zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso transcripts are very abundant in the zzso cortex, which contains immature zzso We conclude that individual zzso forms are zzso regulated during the development of distinct zzso and especially during zzso zzso
