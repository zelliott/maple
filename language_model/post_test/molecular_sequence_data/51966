In this paper we describe a method for the statistical reconstruction of a large DNA sequence from a set of zzso zzso We assume that the fragments have been assembled and address the problem of determining the degree to which the reconstructed sequence is free from zzso zzso its zzso A consensus distribution is derived from the assembled zzso zzso based upon the rates of sequencing errors in the individual zzso The consensus distribution can be used to find a minimally redundant consensus sequence that meets a zzso confidence level, either base by base or across any region of the zzso A zzso procedure for the zzso of the sequencing error rates, which zzso an zzso zzso algorithm, is zzso Prior knowledge of the error rates is easily incorporated into the zzso zzso The methods are applied to a set of assembled sequence fragments from the human zzso zzso We close the paper with a brief discussion of the relevance and practical implications of this zzso
