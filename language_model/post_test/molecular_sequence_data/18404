The preferred zzso and zzso modes of the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso carbon zzso respectively, were determined in solution as well as in the crystal state by infrared zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance and zzso zzso A zzso zzso energy zzso study was also carried zzso In the crystal state zzso zzso are absent in both zzso However, the change in zzso of the carbon atom carrying the zzso group and the presence of a zzso water zzso in the zzso zzso induce partially different backbone and zzso side chain zzso and divergent zzso zzso schemes in the two zzso A marked propensity to zzso is seen in zzso of low zzso The two zzso however, are largely zzso in zzso of high zzso zzso energy zzso indicate that in zzso both zzso exhibit a significant flexibility and the zzso presenting absolute zzso are not stabilized by any zzso zzso
