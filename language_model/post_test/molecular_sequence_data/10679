The secondary structure of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso like zzso and zzso has evolved to serve a variety of functions such as controlling gene zzso exposing binding sites for the zzso and zzso zzso allowing strand separation and so zzso On the other hand, all of these zzso have to perform in bacterial cells in which various zzso splitting zzso are zzso We therefore examined whether zzso zzso structure is under selective pressure by host zzso Here we show this to be true for zzso zzso A fully zzso hairpin of 17 zzso which is an zzso III target, was inserted into a zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso In an zzso zzso these zzso survived but in zzso bacteria they did zzso Here the stem underwent zzso evolution to a structure that was no longer a zzso for zzso zzso This was achieved in three different ways: zzso the perfect stem was maintained but shortened by removing all or most of the zzso zzso the stem acquired zzso zzso that replaced zzso base pairs by zzso zzso the stem acquired small deletions or insertions that created zzso These insertions consist of short stretches of zzso A or U zzso Their origin is ascribed to zzso at the site of the zzso III cut (in the + or - zzso either by zzso coli zzso zzso or by idling zzso zzso
