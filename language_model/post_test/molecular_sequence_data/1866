zzso zzso and its mouse and human zzso are expressed zzso in the zzso zzso We found previously that an element in the zzso promoter region of zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is similar to a nuclear factor 1 zzso site, is critical for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso We proposed that this element might be important for zzso zzso zzso The goals of the present study were to characterize zzso proteins and to obtain more definitive evidence for the role of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso proteins were isolated by zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso Mass spectral analysis indicated that zzso corresponding to all four zzso genes were present in the zzso zzso zzso Further analysis of zzso proteins led to the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso which was derived from alternative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso an zzso zzso previously identified in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter, whereas zzso which lacks the zzso domain, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso proteins are associated with the zzso promoter in zzso in rat zzso zzso but essentially not in the liver where the zzso promoter is zzso and zzso is not zzso These data strongly support a role for zzso zzso factors in the zzso zzso of zzso
