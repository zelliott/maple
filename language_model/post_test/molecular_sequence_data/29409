zzso studies support the concept that protein zzso recognition by the zzso complex of zzso is achieved by interactions at extended zzso recognition sites zzso distinct from the active site of factor zzso within the zzso We have used this formal kinetic model and a zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso to investigate the contributions of surfaces on the zzso to zzso protein zzso recognition by zzso zzso bound zzso to a fluorescent zzso of factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but had no effect on active site function of factor zzso or factor zzso zzso assembled into zzso In contrast, zzso was a slow, tight binding inhibitor of the zzso of either zzso 2 or zzso zzso 1 by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso binding to factor zzso within zzso selectively leads to the zzso of protein zzso zzso without interfering with active site zzso zzso zzso could adequately be accounted for by a kinetic model in which zzso 2 and zzso bind in a mutually exclusive way to zzso These are properties expected of an zzso zzso The zzso on factor zzso responsible for zzso binding were evaluated by identification of zzso fragments following chemical zzso of human and bovine zzso and were further confirmed with a series of zzso expressed zzso These approaches suggest that zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain contribute to zzso zzso The data establish this zzso as a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and suggest that the zzso of a surface on factor zzso zzso removed from the active site, is sufficient to block zzso recognition of the protein zzso by zzso
