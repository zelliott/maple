In the budding zzso zzso zzso mother cells switch mating types between a and zzso forms, whereas daughter cells do zzso This zzso asymmetry arises because the expression of the HO zzso which zzso the zzso of a and zzso mating type zzso is extinguished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso When daughters become mothers in the subsequent cell cycle, zzso must be eliminated to enable a new zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso elimination of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and consistently, zzso binds to and is zzso by zzso in a zzso manner in zzso The zzso of a critical in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso site zzso on zzso reduces its zzso and rate of degradation in zzso and decreases the frequency of mating type zzso zzso associates with active zzso zzso in zzso and is targeted to zzso in a zzso fashion in zzso and in zzso zzso recognition by zzso appears to be zzso by at least three zzso sites that form two redundant zzso zzso The zzso elimination of zzso by the zzso system thus zzso zzso asymmetry in budding zzso
