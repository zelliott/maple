The zzso family of DNA zzso is emerging as an important group of proteins for the prevention of human disease, cancer, and zzso zzso zzso was identified by its association with breast cancer, and is implicated in zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity to zzso are important for maintenance of zzso zzso zzso in genes zzso proteins related to zzso designated zzso in human and zzso in zzso result in sister zzso cohesion zzso zzso zzso in zzso show zzso as well as zzso deletions in genes containing zzso zzso zzso knockout mice are embryonic zzso and embryonic stem cells show zzso loss and zzso zzso zzso also shares sequence similarity with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso The recently solved structure of zzso has provided new insight to the zzso core and accessory zzso of sequence related zzso 2 zzso The functions and roles of members of the zzso zzso family will be zzso
