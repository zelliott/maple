Human urine contains several zzso which inhibit calcium zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso with a molecular weight of approximately 35 zzso is one such zzso Here we report the characterization of zzso extracted from rat urine using three zzso steps including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Q column and compare it with human zzso The molecular weight of rat zzso zzso is similar to that of human zzso zzso being approximately 35 zzso as estimated by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso Their zzso acid compositions are zzso they contain a high percentage of zzso and zzso acids and they react positively in the zzso reaction, suggesting that they contain zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso and zzso were zzso on a calcium zzso zzso system in zzso using zzso zzso Both exert a strong zzso suggesting that zzso like zzso plays an important role in preventing and reducing calcium zzso zzso in the zzso On Western zzso analysis, both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Nevertheless, using the zzso zzso technique, there was no zzso line between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we zzso that zzso is related to zzso and that they may have the same zzso but are not completely zzso We conclude that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso which contribute to the regulation of the calcium zzso zzso zzso
