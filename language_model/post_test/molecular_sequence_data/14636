zzso zzso bond linkage in a protein represents an important challenge for mass zzso zzso zzso protein structure analysis as it reduces the backbone zzso efficiency for zzso zzso This study presents a strategy for solving this critical issue via zzso zzso zzso online with a zzso zzso zzso In this approach, proteins undergo zzso reduction in an zzso cell to break zzso bonds and then undergo online zzso into gaseous zzso for analysis by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso reduction of proteins allows one to remove zzso bond constraints and also leads to increased charge numbers of the resulting protein zzso As a result, sequence coverage was significantly zzso as exemplified by zzso A (24 vs 75 backbone zzso before and after zzso reduction, zzso and zzso (5 vs 66 backbone zzso before and after zzso reduction, zzso This methodology is fast and does not need chemical zzso which would have an important impact in zzso zzso zzso
