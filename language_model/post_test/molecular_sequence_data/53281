The three-dimensional structure of zzso buffalo zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of zzso human zzso as a search model and was refined by simulated zzso zzso The final model comprises zzso protein atoms for all zzso zzso two zzso and two zzso zzso The final R factor was zzso for 11 711 reflections in the resolution range zzso zzso The folding of buffalo zzso is essentially similar to that of the other members of the zzso zzso The significant differences are found in the dimensions of the binding zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso interactions are predominantly zzso in nature, thus zzso the sliding of two zzso zzso to external zzso The zzso interactions are comparable in the N and C zzso
