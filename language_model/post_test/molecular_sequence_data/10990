zzso a zzso protein from the saliva of the zzso zzso bug zzso zzso is a potent and selective zzso zzso Its zzso complex with bovine zzso was zzso and its crystal structure was solved by Patterson search methods and refined at zzso resolution to an R value of zzso The analysis revealed that zzso is a compact zzso zzso essentially consisting of an zzso zzso The eight strands A to H are arranged in the order zzso with the first four strands exhibiting a zzso zzso zzso zzso Except for the zzso zzso the zzso fold exhibits the regular up-and-down zzso of zzso In contrast to the typical zzso zzso however, the zzso barrel encloses a zzso core intersected by a unique zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso exclusively via its zzso zzso Surprisingly, most of the interface interactions are zzso A prominent exception represents zzso zzso side chain, which extends into a zzso zzso pocket forming partially buried salt bridges with zzso and zzso of the zzso The fully accessible active site of zzso in this complex is in agreement with its retained zzso activity toward small zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso converting activity or of its zzso protein C zzso capacity upon zzso binding is explained by usage of overlapping interaction sites of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso via a novel and unique mechanism that might be of interest in the context of potential therapeutic zzso
