The pattern of zzso of adjacent zzso zzso in several peptides based on the zzso region of human cardiac zzso I has been zzso by PAGE and zzso zzso zzso to identify the zzso With zzso protein zzso zzso is rapidly zzso and subsequent much slower zzso of zzso occurs only after zzso of zzso is almost zzso zzso of the zzso at zzso was not detected at any zzso On replacement of zzso with Ala or Met the sole zzso target was zzso zzso being considerably slower than for zzso in the zzso zzso while zzso could not be detected after prolonged zzso The results zzso the importance of the zzso sequence zzso for the function of cardiac zzso I and imply that in human cardiac muscle zzso by zzso zzso I is zzso on zzso Comparative two-dimensional zzso data indicate that in the zzso form at zzso pH values, specific structural constraints are imposed on the zzso zzso zzso These constraints result in the effective screening of the two zzso groups from each other by the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso pair and zzso of the structure in the region of zzso zzso which is adjacent to a site of interaction between zzso I and zzso zzso These zzso changes presumably zzso the decrease in calcium sensitivity of the zzso zzso that occurs after adrenaline zzso
