In a recent zzso screen, we identified the gene coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as a putative zzso target of zzso and of other zzso with a zzso in position 50 of their zzso We now show that the nuclear addressing of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in immortalized human zzso zzso expressing zzso This zzso is not observed with zzso a zzso of zzso in which a single zzso zzso its zzso binding to target DNA, thus strongly suggesting that zzso zzso zzso reflects their specific recognition of zzso sites in the zzso zzso This is further confirmed by zzso I zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso that zzso within the cloned zzso promoter, several sites of direct interaction with zzso and zzso zzso experiments in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cells show that zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso promoter activity and that this regulation is zzso Finally, using a mouse line with zzso inserted within the zzso zzso we identify the zzso of the zzso zzso including the zzso cells of the zzso zzso as a strong site of zzso expression throughout zzso We therefore propose that zzso a 230 zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso and participating in the maintenance of zzso at the zzso border, is directly regulated by zzso zzso zzso
