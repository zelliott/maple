zzso hormone receptors zzso bind as zzso to specific DNA response zzso We have used a genetic approach to identify zzso acid sequences required for zzso of the zzso beta zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso composed of the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso beta zzso binding domain are immune to zzso infection as a consequence of zzso activity provided by the zzso zzso The zzso of deletions and point zzso of the zzso beta sequences map zzso activity to a zzso of the zzso binding domain that is highly zzso among all members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso These results confirm and extend previous findings indicating that this zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso beta and other zzso zzso
