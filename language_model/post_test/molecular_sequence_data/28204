A procedure for the construction of double stranded DNA zzso is described that overcomes the natural limits of established zzso zzso Starting with two synthetic zzso which are able to form zzso shaped structures, two subsequent zzso reactions yield a zzso of double stranded DNA of 42 base zzso This is by far the smallest circle of double stranded DNA yet zzso These zzso can be constructed in quantities required for high resolution structural analyses such as X-ray zzso and zzso zzso
