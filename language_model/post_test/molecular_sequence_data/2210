The third component of human complement zzso a central zzso in both the classical and alternative pathways of complement, is comprised of two zzso termed the alpha and beta zzso zzso of zzso zzso the alpha chain into two fragments, zzso an inflammatory zzso and the zzso chain which remains zzso linked to the beta zzso zzso fragments derived from the zzso chain during zzso and regulation of complement play a significant role in host defense and regulation of the immune zzso Two zzso clones covering the zzso chain region were used to characterize the structure of this portion of the zzso zzso The zzso chain is zzso by 24 zzso which range in size from 52 to zzso base pairs zzso with an average size of 115 zzso The zzso donor sequence at the beginning of zzso 12 has a rare sequence zzso of zzso instead of the usual zzso zzso Ten zzso have been completely zzso and were surprisingly short, ranging in size from 85 to 242 zzso with an average of 140 zzso Other zzso range in size from 250 zzso to over 4 zzso in zzso The gene size for this portion of zzso is estimated to be zzso zzso zzso of zzso structure with protein zzso and with zzso mapping studies demonstrates that several binding sites on zzso are zzso by single zzso These data support the hypothesis that individual zzso can code for functional protein zzso
