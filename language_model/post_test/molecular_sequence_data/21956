zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a route for therapeutic intervention in diabetes and cardiovascular zzso We report crystal structures of human zzso zzso 2 zzso with zzso and synthetic zzso Several of the zzso structures disclosed have zzso cross arms that span a large trough region between the zzso regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The structures containing bound zzso and zzso demonstrate variation in the zzso of the active site zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso beta and gamma zzso at the active site in the zzso zzso zzso We have identified three novel zzso binding sites located in the R domain of zzso zzso zzso binds at the zzso binding site in the center of the R domain, which together with zzso zzso significant changes at the active zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind at the zzso binding site that is located at one end of the R zzso zzso (an zzso zzso binds in an extended site at the other end of the R zzso We conclude that the zzso domain of zzso has a key regulatory function and propose that the different inhibitor classes act by discrete zzso The structures we describe provide insights that can be used for zzso design of zzso zzso
