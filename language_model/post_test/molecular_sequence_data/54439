We report the zzso characterization and microbial community analysis of closed circuit microbial fuel cells zzso and open circuit zzso cells continuously fed with zzso as zzso zzso in power output between zzso correlated with their polarization behavior, which is related to the maturation of the zzso zzso The microbial communities residing in the zzso growing on the zzso zzso zzso membrane and zzso chamber liquor of zzso zzso were characterized by restriction zzso length zzso screening of zzso zzso gene clone zzso The results show that the zzso zzso was enriched in several zzso related to known zzso active and zzso zzso reducing bacteria, mostly from the zzso zzso to the detriment of zzso abundant in the zzso zzso The results also evidenced the lack of a specific zzso community in the liquor zzso The zzso growing on the zzso membrane of the zzso was found to be composed of a zzso community dominated by two zzso species of the zzso and zzso zzso
