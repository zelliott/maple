The recent solution of enteric bacterial zzso structure, and new insights into the mechanism by which outer membrane zzso proteins recognize and zzso specific zzso advocates the zzso of zzso transport zzso In this zzso we discuss the potential structural features of zzso receptors and zzso and use this analysis to evaluate both existing and new models of energy and signal zzso from the inner membrane to the outer membrane of zzso zzso
