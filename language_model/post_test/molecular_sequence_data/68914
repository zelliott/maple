A rat zzso zzso zzso has been prepared by zzso of Lewis rats with a highly zzso preparation of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso This zzso specifically binds zzso L cell zzso but not zzso L cells, and zzso vigorous proliferation of highly zzso small dense B cells obtained from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso B cell proliferation can be zzso by the addition of zzso and is inhibited by zzso zzso soluble mouse zzso Interestingly the same zzso zzso specifically zzso the in zzso growth of zzso zzso B zzso zzso The specificity of this zzso can be demonstrated by reversing the effect with zzso zzso soluble mouse zzso These data zzso zzso as a possible target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of B zzso
