The zzso zzso zzso gene from an efficient strain of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment revealed that zzso was a member of the zzso zzso 13 zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso protein was estimated at zzso by zzso The zzso had an optimal pH and temperature of zzso and zzso respectively, with a K zzso of zzso and V zzso of zzso for zzso To the best of our knowledge, the zzso zzso has the most zzso optimum pH for zzso zzso When the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso cells were used for zzso zzso almost complete conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso was achieved in zzso with high zzso yields zzso The immobilized zzso coli cells remained stable for more than zzso in a zzso zzso zzso This indicated that the zzso zzso could continuously and efficiently produce zzso
