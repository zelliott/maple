zzso Africa suffers from an excessively high zzso of zzso B virus zzso but little is known about the prevalent zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso genes of zzso viruses obtained from 12 locations in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nigeria, zzso and the Democratic Republic of zzso Except for those obtained from the Cameroon zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso 96 of 105 sequences belonged to zzso zzso E zzso and viral DNA was very similar zzso zzso throughout this vast zzso zzso which spans zzso zzso across zzso The low diversity suggests that zzso may have a short evolutionary zzso Considering a typical zzso rate of DNA zzso it would take only 200 years for the strain diversity of zzso viruses to develop from a single introductory zzso The relatively recent introduction of zzso into humans would also explain its conspicuous absence in the Americas, despite the forced immigration of slaves from west Africa, until the early 19th zzso zzso during infancy is mostly associated with chronic carrier status, and this combination can account for the explosive spread of virtually identical viruses within a community, but whether other routes of long-range transmissions must be considered becomes an important zzso
