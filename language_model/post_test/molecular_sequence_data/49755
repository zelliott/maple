The zzso and zzso neural zzso zzso zzso plays important functional roles in the developing and adult nervous zzso zzso is zzso processed at two distinct sites within the zzso domain, leading to the generation of different zzso In this report, we present evidence that the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso that zzso zzso in the third zzso type III domain, whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not effective in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso revealed zzso to be the site of zzso generating the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was present in the zzso which expresses zzso but was not zzso in the zzso which does not express zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be tightly associated with the full-length zzso zzso zzso The complex zzso from the membrane upon zzso by a zzso acting at a more zzso site of full-length zzso This zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and enhanced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso processing of zzso by a zzso is involved in zzso zzso
