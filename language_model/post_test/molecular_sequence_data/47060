zzso zzso regulate a wide range of biological functions including cell migration, cell zzso and cell zzso Recently, results from studies in zzso in zzso mouse and humans have demonstrated the involvement of these zzso in mechanisms controlling zzso differentiation and the development of the central nervous system zzso However, the zzso pathways underlying these functions and the proteins directly regulating zzso in developing zzso are poorly zzso Here we report the structure and expression pattern of the zzso zzso of zzso a human gene zzso a zzso partner expressed in male germ cells zzso zzso zzso Timmons, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast with that from humans, zzso zzso encodes two distinct zzso Both are zzso zzso A zzso zzso transcript is strongly expressed in mature zzso and is zzso with zzso A 3 zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso and is expressed primarily in the zzso during the zzso phase, decreasing after zzso In zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso mouse zzso demonstrates a preferential expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zone of the zzso In addition to the expression of zzso in male germ cells already reported in humans and suggesting an involvement in zzso we characterize an embryonic transcript whose expression is closely correlated with zzso This result addresses the question of the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
