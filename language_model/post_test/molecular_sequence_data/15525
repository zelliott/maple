To better understand the mechanisms of zzso trafficking and presentation of zzso peptides by zzso cells zzso we compared the handling of overlapping zzso peptides from zzso zzso either mixed or zzso linked in tandem in one zzso Once zzso peptides zzso not only to zzso but also to zzso and activated zzso and zzso T zzso In contrast, whole protein was found to traffic only to the zzso zzso and primarily activated zzso T zzso Finally, with zzso overlapping peptides were capable of protecting against lethal viral challenge, whereas the intact protein was less zzso These data suggest that overlapping long peptides are zzso through more varied zzso routes and are more efficient in zzso protective immunity than the whole zzso
