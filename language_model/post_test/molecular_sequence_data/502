The mechanism of resistance to zzso was studied in four strains of zzso zzso included in a zzso mixture, which is administered to humans for prevention of gastrointestinal side effects due to oral zzso zzso By cloning experiments, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for a putative zzso acid zzso protein was identified in zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence displayed from zzso to zzso identity with 56 zzso proteins from other zzso bacterial zzso The zzso gene was also detected by zzso in the three other zzso zzso strains resistant to zzso whereas it was absent in the three control strains susceptible to zzso zzso gel zzso of total DNA zzso by zzso followed by zzso with a zzso probe as well as unsuccessful repeated attempts of in zzso transfer of zzso resistance to various recipient cells indicated that zzso was zzso located in all four resistant zzso zzso zzso
