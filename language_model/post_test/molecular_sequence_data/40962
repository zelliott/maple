The zzso gut zzso evolved in an environment typified by periodic fluctuations in zzso zzso yet little is known about its responses to host feeding and zzso As many model species (for example, zzso are adapted to lifestyles of frequent small meals, we turned to the Burmese zzso a zzso zzso snake that zzso large prey at long intervals zzso zzso to examine the effects of a dynamic zzso milieu on the gut zzso We used zzso zzso zzso gene zzso to characterize bacterial communities harvested from the zzso of zzso and digesting zzso and from their zzso zzso In this unprecedented survey of a zzso host, we found that zzso and zzso zzso dominated the python zzso In the large zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with reduced overall zzso A marked zzso shift in bacterial community zzso zzso Between zzso and 3 days after zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gradually outnumbered the zzso zzso and overall zzso diversity increased zzso Most lineages seemed to be indigenous to the python rather than zzso with the zzso but a dietary source of zzso could not be ruled zzso Thus, the observed large-scale zzso of the gut zzso that accompany the Burmese zzso own dramatic zzso and zzso changes during feeding and zzso emphasize the need to consider both microbial and host cellular responses to zzso zzso The Burmese python may provide a unique model for zzso these zzso
