Three zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso nearly homogeneous by zzso and their apparent relative molecular masses were estimated to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso As indicated by several criteria including the zzso sequence and zzso zzso the three zzso forms of zzso were distinct from each other and from all the other zzso currently known in zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso state, whereas zzso was in the zzso zzso Studies to zzso by Western zzso analysis, the zzso of these zzso zzso with zzso raised against rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3A and rabbit zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso strongly zzso with zzso zzso and zzso moderately with zzso zzso As determined by zzso zzso and zzso represented a great portion of the total zzso zzso In a zzso system with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was more active in the metabolism of zzso compounds zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso than towards zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso at lower rates but exhibited total zzso rates of the above sex hormones higher than those of zzso From the comparison of the zzso zzso and structural properties, it was zzso that zzso and zzso are the bovine zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, the only two zzso zzso previously zzso from zzso zzso which showed low activity toward some zzso and zzso compounds, represents a novel zzso zzso zzso possibly belonging to the 3A zzso These results are consistent with a specific presence of zzso and structurally similar zzso at least for the major ones, in the zzso zzso of zzso
