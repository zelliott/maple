Major zzso complex zzso class I molecules associate with peptides that are delivered from the zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso Liver zzso of zzso and Lewis rats, which express different zzso of TAP zzso and zzso respectively), accumulate different sets of zzso Use of zzso zzso rats assigned this difference to the zzso independent of the class I products zzso Both the zzso and zzso TAP complexes zzso peptides with a zzso zzso zzso but zzso of peptides with a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is unique to zzso Thus, the specificity of the TAP zzso zzso restricts the peptides available for zzso zzso
