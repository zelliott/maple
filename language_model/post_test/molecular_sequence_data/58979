We have studied the role of zzso in the function of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso a member of the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis has identified a basic region within zzso which appears to be the major zzso of zzso binding and we have now produced a zzso of zzso lacking the basic charges on two of the zzso acids within this zzso binding zzso This zzso zzso zzso appears to have lost the ability to bind to zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicates that it has retained stem cell zzso properties but has a compromised activity as a zzso zzso thus suggesting zzso of these two properties of zzso zzso studies have indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso on human zzso zzso with its inability to bind to zzso a cloned human zzso zzso In addition, studies using zzso deficient cells zzso with zzso have indicated that the zzso binding site in zzso is a site that is also involved in the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso The site for interaction with the stem cell zzso must therefore be zzso suggesting that zzso zzso different receptors for these two different biological zzso
