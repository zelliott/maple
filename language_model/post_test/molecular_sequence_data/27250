zzso is a small basic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and variable concentration in individual zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the end of zzso 2 and the signal intensity differed significantly between the two zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso zzso gene is scarcely expressed in the zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso zzso in the zzso of a total of 23 zzso from diverse Brazilian localities by zzso as well as the copy number of both zzso and zzso genes by real-time zzso zzso was found to constitute zzso of zzso proteins varying greatly among individual zzso The zzso gene exists from 1 to 32 copies per zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene is present from 1 to 7 zzso Furthermore, we observed that the zzso concentration and zzso gene copy number are positively correlated zzso zzso the variation of zzso in zzso results from the variation of the gene copy zzso zzso of 50 independent copies of zzso and zzso genes from four different zzso revealed the presence of six zzso zzso with a single zzso acid difference from the original zzso zzso whereas only two additional zzso zzso were zzso Taken together, our results suggested that after zzso from a common zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have zzso in such a way that the zzso gene underwent repetitive zzso to increase its copy number, whereas the zzso gene diversified its zzso
