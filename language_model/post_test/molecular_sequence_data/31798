The evolutionary zzso zzso complex functions as one of the zzso of zzso integrity in zzso it is required for the zzso break repair, zzso DNA checkpoint, and zzso zzso To better understand the role of the zzso gene in zzso we performed comparative analysis of several zzso zzso with respect to zzso stability and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso presumably produce truncated zzso proteins composed of the first zzso and 529 zzso zzso zzso Although the putative zzso truncated proteins differ only by 30 zzso zzso the zzso exhibited zzso different zzso in regards to growth zzso zzso stability and zzso While the zzso zzso are fully fertile and undergo normal zzso the zzso plants are sterile due to zzso repair of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso probably disrupted the putative zzso interaction and/or zzso domain, which is assumed to be preserved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso plant into the zzso background renders the double zzso zzso a zzso not observed in either parent zzso This data indicate that zzso partially compensates for zzso zzso in zzso of zzso
