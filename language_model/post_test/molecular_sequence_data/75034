Analysis of zzso hypersensitivity of regions zzso the zzso chicken zzso gene has revealed an zzso zzso hypersensitive site whose sensitivity is influenced by both the zzso stage and sex of the zzso The site is located zzso upstream from the zzso in a block of middle repetitive zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the block consists of zzso copies of two elements with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso copies per zzso zzso zzso of zzso spanning the repeats has revealed that the higher frequency element is a member of the zzso zzso The adjacent lower frequency repeat can also be found next to another member of the zzso family located in the 3' zzso region of the zzso zzso The hypersensitive site has been mapped to one of the two most highly zzso regions of the zzso zzso This region displays zzso with a zzso sequence recently identified in a zzso element zzso the chicken zzso zzso
