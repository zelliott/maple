In zzso zzso a zzso plant, P protein of the zzso system is zzso by a small gene family consisting of at least five zzso active zzso We have cloned and zzso two of these zzso zzso and zzso and provide the first detailed report on the complete structure of zzso zzso zzso Based on the lengths of zzso and intervening zzso the zzso genes can be subdivided into two zzso In both cases the zzso region consists of one very long zzso followed by a long zzso In contrast, the zzso parts show a complex mosaic structure of relatively small zzso and zzso A highly zzso zzso motif was identified, which is supposed to participate in the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript derived from the zzso sequence zzso perfectly to a leaf zzso isolated zzso zzso zzso experiments show that both genes are zzso active in zzso zzso contain distinctly less P protein zzso and the relative level in roots is very low but still clearly zzso In all three zzso but most significantly in roots, the zzso transcript level is distinctly higher than that of zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in transgenic tobacco suggests that zzso elements enhance the zzso activity of both genes in leaves relative to zzso The analysis of zzso zzso promoter deletions reveals the presence of regulatory elements acting with a distinct organ preference and indicates their approximate zzso
