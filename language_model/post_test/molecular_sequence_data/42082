zzso and point zzso of the zzso zzso was investigated in a series of zzso by an zzso approach, and direct sequencing of the zzso DNA, zzso In 2 of the 16 cases zzso both of which were high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso one was ordinary type and the other a clear cell zzso However, no zzso was observed in the other cases including nine of low grade, ordinary type, three of low grade, clear cell type, and two of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing, following zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso of the zzso gene in 14 cases, in which fresh materials were available, successfully demonstrated base substitution zzso in only two cases with zzso zzso zzso on zzso Their details were zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 157 in zzso 5, and zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso 273 in zzso zzso No zzso was detected in the other 12 cases which were negative for zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the biologically aggressive zzso and possibly in the process of tumor progression in human zzso
