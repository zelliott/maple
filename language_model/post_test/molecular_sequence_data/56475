zzso collagen VI in zzso and zzso unfolded form was shown to promote zzso and zzso attachment and spreading of various cell zzso On the zzso zzso no zzso of cell zzso was observed with several synthetic zzso peptides except in the case of zzso melanoma zzso In contrast, zzso to the unfolded zzso was highly sensitive to zzso zzso Nine synthetic peptides were designed according to 10 zzso sequences present in the zzso sequence of human collagen alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso Only one zzso corresponding to the zzso end of alpha zzso chain, showed substantial zzso activity, whereas several peptides were active in direct zzso zzso when used as zzso zzso zzso tests with zzso to zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso binding with zzso zzso zzso 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha V beta 3, and alpha zzso beta 3) were used to identify collagen VI zzso zzso to the zzso zzso is zzso by alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 2 beta 1 zzso zzso of both zzso to collagen VI was weaker than that to zzso I and/or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso by beta 1 and beta 3 zzso zzso was shown for alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha V beta 3 and zzso for alpha zzso beta 3 but not all alpha zzso possibly involved were zzso zzso sets of receptors were also involved in zzso cell binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso even though in this case both interactions could be efficiently inhibited by zzso zzso
