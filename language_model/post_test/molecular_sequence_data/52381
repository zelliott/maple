zzso zzso a product of activated zzso has been recently shown to zzso the metabolism of zzso zzso components in human skin zzso cultures zzso et zzso J Cell zzso zzso zzso In this study we focused our attention on the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso This zzso zzso has a broad spectrum of zzso activity and it is also required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of skin zzso cultures with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels, the maximum enhancement being up to approximately zzso This effect was abolished by zzso suggesting a requirement for ongoing protein zzso zzso cell zzso with a zzso gene construct containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA of the human zzso gene linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated enhancement of promoter activity by zzso This enhancement was abolished by a single base substitution in the zzso binding site of the zzso Furthermore, gel mobility shift zzso demonstrated enhanced zzso binding activity in nuclear extracts from cells incubated with zzso However, zzso did not alter the activity of a construct containing three zzso sequences in front of the zzso zzso promoter linked to the zzso zzso These results collectively suggest that zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso is zzso by zzso regulatory elements which are necessary, but not zzso for gene zzso
