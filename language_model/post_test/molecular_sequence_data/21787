The diversity of attached and zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso zzso gene zzso was investigated in a zzso lake during two periods of contrasting zzso zzso zzso analyses showed a zzso difference between attached and zzso communities for the two bacterial zzso For zzso the zzso zzso was detected at all sampling dates in zzso and attached bacterial communities and was the dominant zzso contributing to zzso of the total retrieved operational zzso units zzso For zzso the zzso cluster was found to be dominant, followed by zzso contributing to zzso and zzso of the total retrieved zzso zzso This study allows the determination of eight new putative zzso among the zzso termed zzso and a new putative zzso named zzso belonging to the zzso The seasonal dynamics of zzso and zzso communities have been reflected as changes in distinct bacterial zzso for both attached and zzso zzso For attached communities, relationships were observed between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, within zzso communities, few zzso zzso were found to be dependent on either nutrients or zzso communities, whereas zzso were mainly associated with biological parameters zzso zzso and zzso zzso
