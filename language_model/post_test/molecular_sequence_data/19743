zzso zzso top virus zzso C4 zzso with two members of the zzso protein zzso family zzso and zzso and a putative zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Tomato golden mosaic virus zzso zzso also bound with similar efficiency to zzso and zzso but was unable to interact with the zzso zzso C4 interaction with zzso was confirmed using an in zzso binding zzso The protein zzso were capable of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso C4 at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly less zzso The zzso did not efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso C4 zzso to the cell periphery in zzso zzso was dependent on an intact zzso zzso zzso consistent with plasma membrane zzso The intact motif was also required to produce the zzso disease zzso zzso expression of zzso C4 and zzso zzso derivatives in zzso zzso identified additional zzso acids within a central domain that contribute to the zzso The interaction with zzso indicates that zzso C4 interacts with the zzso zzso zzso
