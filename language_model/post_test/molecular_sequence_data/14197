The structure of the zzso A of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso of the tropical zzso zzso zzso was investigated by chemical compositional zzso mass zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso A backbone was composed of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso revealed that the zzso was connected to the reducing end of the zzso zzso via an zzso zzso zzso The zzso A was deprived of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso A preparation was a mixture of molecules due to the occurrence of different zzso zzso The zzso zzso backbone was zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso positions with zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso fatty acids as well as zzso were found to be zzso They were attached to zzso groups of primary zzso fatty acids giving three zzso zzso Thus, the complete zzso A from zzso zzso comprised seven zzso zzso Part of the zzso A molecules was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso did not incorporate zzso zzso very long chain fatty acids zzso zzso into the zzso A, which makes this zzso of zzso unusual among zzso lipids zzso
