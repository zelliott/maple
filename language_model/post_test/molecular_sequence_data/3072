zzso zzso zzso which are defined by an zzso zzso region and a zzso zzso domain zzso provide useful models for studying the role of the zzso in sorting within the zzso zzso Previous work has shown that a short zzso is required to keep zzso zzso proteins from escaping to downstream compartments of the zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso in zzso protein zzso we used model zzso which consisted of zzso linked at its zzso to the tail region of zzso zzso with zzso of differing length or zzso zzso of these zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that the feature determining exit from the zzso is zzso and that if exit occurs, at least a part of the protein reaches the cell zzso To investigate which zzso to the surface is followed by zzso zzso zzso we expressed the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso with 22 and 25 zzso zzso were zzso zzso but addition at the zzso of a zzso zzso containing an zzso site resulted in zzso relocation of approximately 50% of the protein to the zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso proteins may reach the zzso surface without a signal or that our zzso contain a weak zzso zzso that is zzso to the zzso information carried by the zzso To assess the effect of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was linked to the tails of zzso 3 and 4, which zzso to the zzso and zzso surface, respectively, of zzso zzso The two zzso fusion proteins showed a different surface distribution, which is consistent with a role for the two zzso zzso in zzso zzso
