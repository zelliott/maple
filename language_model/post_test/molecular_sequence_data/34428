The development of zzso division and associated genetic zzso paved the way for evolutionary zzso However, the secondary and zzso structure and functional zzso of many of the proteins involved in genetic zzso have not been studied in zzso We used the human zzso gene product along with secondary and zzso domain structures of zzso coli zzso protein to help determine the molecular structure and function of zzso zzso which is required for zzso complex formation and cell cycle zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso using rice zzso zzso as an zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was used for zzso its 3-D structure, and functional analysis was made with the zzso software, showing significant identity of the zzso gene product in zzso zzso with that of Homo zzso Based on these results, the zzso and motives of zzso and zzso as zzso binding sites, a zzso site zzso zzso the putative zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso the putative zzso binding zzso a zzso zzso the zzso rotation zzso and a small zzso domain were proposed for zzso zzso zzso
