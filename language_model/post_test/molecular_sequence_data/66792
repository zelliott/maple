In an attempt both to zzso 3' regulatory region zzso zzso disease and to improve our understanding of the structure and function of the 3' zzso we have performed a systematic analysis of zzso zzso in the 3' zzso of human zzso zzso We have previously zzso the zzso that have occurred in two specific zzso of the 3' untranslated region zzso zzso as well as in the 3' zzso zzso Here we have focused upon 83 known zzso within the upstream sequence zzso between the zzso termination zzso and the upstream core zzso signal zzso of the 3' zzso To place these zzso in their proper context, we first performed a comprehensive survey of known zzso elements within the zzso and the mechanisms by which they effect zzso gene zzso Although this survey supports the view that zzso regulatory elements function within the context of specific secondary structures, there are no general rules governing how secondary structure might exert its zzso We have therefore addressed this question by systematically evaluating both functional and zzso (based upon in zzso reporter gene and/or zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences against known zzso motifs within the context of predicted zzso secondary zzso This has allowed us not only to establish a reliable and objective means to perform secondary structure prediction but also to identify consistent patterns of secondary structural change that could zzso the discrimination of functional zzso zzso from their zzso zzso The resulting rules were then used to zzso potential functionality in the case of some of the remaining functionally zzso zzso zzso from their predicted secondary zzso This not only led us to identify further patterns of secondary structural change but also several potential novel zzso motifs within the 3' zzso zzso
