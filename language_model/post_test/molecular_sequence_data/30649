zzso zzso zzso are prime examples of zzso zzso We isolated and characterized zzso and a zzso clone for a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso into the zzso fraction during zzso isolation through an zzso zzso However, the results of sequencing of the zzso clone suggested that the zzso did not contain a zzso zzso Instead, the zzso sequence revealed a zzso zzso tract directly upstream from the typical zzso hairpin loop of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso tract consisted of 14 zzso zzso interrupted by one zzso zzso zzso We concluded that this short zzso stretch zzso binding of the zzso to zzso even after stringent washes with zzso M zzso indicating that rather short zzso sequences can ensure binding to zzso The zzso and zzso clones contained an zzso sequence at the end of the coding zzso It has been suggested that this sequence contains a zzso signal in some zzso and mouse zzso but it does not function as a zzso signal in the zzso transcript described in this zzso
