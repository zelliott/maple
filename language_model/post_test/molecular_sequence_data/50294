We have developed modifications to direct zzso selection that allow the rapid and zzso isolation of low abundance zzso zzso by large zzso zzso zzso cloned zzso zzso are zzso in solution with zzso zzso The zzso clones and attached zzso are captured on zzso coated magnetic zzso the zzso are zzso and zzso We have applied this protocol to a zzso zzso that contains the human zzso and zzso zzso After two cycles of enrichment zzso zzso were zzso all of which were zzso to the zzso DNA sequencing revealed that nine zzso were zzso zzso to the zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso zzso Six clones were zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso with zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso The nine remaining clones were unique within the sequence databases and were non zzso All of the selected zzso were initially present at very low abundance and were enriched by as much as zzso in two cycles of zzso This modified selection technique should be readily zzso to the isolation of many candidate disease zzso as well as the derivation of detailed zzso maps across large zzso zzso
