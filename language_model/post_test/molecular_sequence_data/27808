zzso levels of zzso calcium zzso are known to induce eye lens zzso and a variety of zzso factors has been proposed, including zzso zzso and zzso of the lens proteins zzso We have specifically looked in some detail at the interaction of zzso with various zzso and its zzso zzso incubated in solutions containing 10 zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso of zzso with zzso revealed that this zzso binds to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso dialysis showed that four zzso zzso bind to one zzso zzso with an affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of zzso reveals the presence of a zzso zzso or zzso calcium zzso binding zzso motif in the region zzso zzso zzso This is a novel feature of the zzso not reported so zzso No other zzso appear to have this zzso zzso also binds four zzso zzso unit of mass 160 zzso with an affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso presumably in the zzso of the zzso that is rich in zzso and polar zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the binding of calcium zzso leads to subtle zzso changes in the zzso notably in the zzso zzso
