A general structure for the zzso zzso zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso has been proposed based on zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of this membrane protein zzso zzso Porter, zzso zzso zzso Miller, zzso zzso zzso Scarborough, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is believed to possess a large zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso a single zzso zzso anchor zzso zzso zzso and a short zzso tail zzso zzso zzso As a means of testing the structure and proposed cellular orientation of this zzso we have employed the technique of in zzso zzso to prepare a zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso cells using a zzso virus zzso results in zzso of a truncated soluble form of the zzso zzso which binds native zzso and synthetic zzso zzso with a specificity similar to that of the native zzso zzso In contrast to the native zzso zzso that exists predominantly as a zzso on the cell surface, the zzso zzso exists as a zzso zzso The results are consistent with the proposed structure of this zzso with the zzso domain containing the zzso site oriented zzso to the plasma zzso In addition, these data demonstrate that the zzso does not require association with the plasma membrane or its native zzso zzso in order to bind zzso zzso with high affinity and zzso
