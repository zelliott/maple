There are eight zzso and nine zzso of zzso Small differences in geographical origin are associated with sequence changes in the surface zzso Here, we compared core gene sequences from different zzso and geographical zzso zzso combinations of 24 zzso acid zzso at nine zzso allowed allocation of a sequence to a zzso Six of these nine zzso were located in different T cell zzso depending on zzso geographical area and/or zzso zzso zzso changes were associated uniquely with specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso were found in a majority of sequences from specific countries as well as within zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motifs were defined for zzso Indian, Chinese, Italian and Pacific region zzso Finally, we observed zzso acid motifs that were common to either zzso Asian or Western zzso irrespective of zzso We believe that zzso strains spread within constrained ethnic groups, result in selection pressures that define sequence zzso within each zzso It suggests that particular T cell zzso are specific for geographical regions, and thus ethnic zzso this may affect the design of zzso zzso
