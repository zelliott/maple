zzso sequences in zzso and zzso region of 10 zzso of zzso B5 from three outbreaks were compared with published sequences of another zzso zzso zzso zzso disease virus, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso B5 from the same outbreak showed close relations, not exceeding zzso in zzso zzso zzso were greater between zzso from different outbreaks, varying between zzso and zzso We have also shown that zzso B5 viruses from an outbreak in 1967 are more similar to viruses from an outbreak in 1983 than to the viruses isolated from an intervening outbreak in zzso The sequence comparison of zzso B5 zzso with other zzso B viruses and zzso zzso study, zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, and sequencing, are suitable for rapid zzso B virus detection and identification of zzso relations between viruses originating from different zzso
