zzso a zzso zzso toxin produced by the plant zzso zzso zzso generates the highly toxic zzso oxygen zzso upon exposure to zzso zzso shows broad toxicity against a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, zzso plants, and zzso however, zzso zzso are resistant to its zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso strain of zzso zzso by genetic zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso sensitive and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso encodes a putative protein of 550 zzso acids with four putative zzso zzso regions, however zzso shows no strong similarity to any other protein in sequence zzso Northern analysis identified two transcripts zzso and zzso zzso that are unaffected by the presence of light or zzso Southern analysis demonstrated that zzso is present in a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso and can be detected only in zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso resulted in zzso that, like zzso are sensitive to zzso However, unlike zzso zzso disruption zzso are not zzso in toxin zzso Both zzso and the zzso disruption zzso are unaffected in their response to other zzso zzso suggesting that zzso functions specifically against zzso rather than against zzso
