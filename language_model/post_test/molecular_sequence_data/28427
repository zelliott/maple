zzso studies using zzso to zzso proteins have provided conflicting data on the components of paired zzso filaments zzso due solely to zzso zzso To avoid such zzso we developed a protein chemical approach to the identification of the zzso zzso After treatment with zzso acid, zzso were zzso with zzso and the zzso peptides were separated by zzso All major zzso were zzso for their zzso acid compositions and zzso From the zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso and beta protein were zzso zzso in zzso appears to be in a zzso form, while its target protein remains zzso zzso is integrated into zzso at the site of its zzso zzso The presence of beta protein fragments is best interpreted as being due to contamination of zzso filaments in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are the two zzso components of zzso
