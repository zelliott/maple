A novel zzso of 11 zzso zzso 1 (11 zzso zzso was identified from the zzso liver by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and was named 11 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso product revealed that 11 zzso zzso was the product of an alternative zzso within the 11 zzso gene in which zzso 5 was spliced zzso Although it caused a deletion of 48 zzso acids in the deduced 11 zzso zzso this alternative zzso did not result in a shift within the predicted open reading frame of 11 zzso zzso Thus, 11 zzso zzso was predicted to code for a protein of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we also examined the expression of 11 zzso zzso in zzso fetal zzso and in maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The 11 zzso zzso was expressed zzso similar to 11 zzso zzso but at a lower zzso Furthermore, since levels of 11 zzso zzso were directly related to those of 11 zzso zzso there is no zzso for this shorter transcript and the only factor regulating its production appears to be 11 zzso zzso zzso To determine whether 11 zzso zzso zzso a functional zzso we inserted the zzso into the expression zzso zzso and zzso the construct into Chinese zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells expressed a zzso of expected size but contained no zzso 11 zzso zzso When combined with cellular extracts of 11 zzso zzso zzso cells, they also did not alter either the zzso or zzso zzso The functional significance of the 11 zzso transcript lacking zzso 5 (11 zzso zzso remains to be zzso
