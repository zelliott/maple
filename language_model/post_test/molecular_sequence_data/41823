zzso and zzso cells were isolated from the zzso zzso cells of five patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso carrying the Philadelphia zzso zzso Analysis of zzso hybrid zzso in individual colonies from a single cell using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso demonstrated the presence or absence of the hybrid zzso For patient 1 in the chronic phase of zzso the hybrid zzso was detected in all colonies derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, for patient 2 in the chronic phase of zzso the zzso was detected in all individual colonies from zzso zzso but not in any from zzso zzso For patient 3 in the chronic phase of zzso the zzso was detected in all individual colonies from zzso but in only some of the colonies from zzso zzso For patients 4 and 5 in the acute crisis of zzso the zzso was found in a portion of colonies from zzso and zzso zzso These results indicated that normal clones can persist in zzso zzso in some patients with zzso even when zzso analysis detects the Ph zzso in all zzso of bone zzso zzso
