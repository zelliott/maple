To improve the overall yield of zzso zzso a zzso approach, based on the zzso formation of an zzso zzso between two zzso was zzso zzso reductive zzso of zzso with zzso generated the corresponding zzso zzso in yields zzso zzso on different zzso The investigation of a variety of reducing agents is discussed together with a kinetic analysis of the selected zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso exhibited slightly reduced in zzso zzso activity and cell zzso
