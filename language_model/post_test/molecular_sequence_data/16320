zzso maps of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso clone zzso were constructed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Southern zzso indicated that the zzso zzso contains five dispersed regions of zzso sequence zzso The zzso gene of zzso was located within zzso and the sequence of the zzso zzso coding region and zzso zzso of zzso DNA was zzso A zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso start points in other zzso was identified at 44 to 57 zzso upstream from the start zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid zzso sequence showed a high degree of zzso with a previously determined protein sequence for zzso zzso zzso and with deduced zzso acid sequences for three other zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment of the four sequences indicated that zzso zzso possesses a single zzso zzso at zzso 4 and a single zzso deletion at zzso zzso
