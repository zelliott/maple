The zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso are unique zzso that can inhibit zzso zzso zzso their mouse zzso has already been identified, and its zzso property has been zzso however, its biological role has remained zzso Furthermore, no other mouse zzso of zzso has been zzso We characterize three mouse members of zzso molecules including zzso in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were functional, zzso both zzso and zzso zzso with different zzso profiles due to the difference of two zzso acids in their zzso site zzso zzso was zzso expressed in most zzso whereas expression of zzso was limited to zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso may play different roles by zzso intrinsic or zzso zzso with different expression zzso and different zzso zzso
