The replication of human zzso virus type 1 zzso requires the concerted action of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is in turn moderated by the viral zzso zzso zzso We show here that the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso and was distinguished by zzso of zzso protein and reduced zzso zzso zzso defective in both the rev and zzso genes zzso was also zzso but had normal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with Rev caused a decrease of both the zzso level and the rate of synthesis of zzso This was accompanied by enhanced synthesis of viral structural zzso Rev induced even greater levels of virus production from the zzso double zzso In contrast, zzso Rev did not augment virus production from zzso zzso zzso production from zzso and zzso zzso induced by Rev was zzso by zzso zzso The repression induced by zzso could not be reversed by zzso zzso The ability of Rev to zzso zzso expression solely from the zzso and thereby relieve the zzso zzso of zzso from the viral long terminal zzso reveals a delicate balance of the functions of these two proteins that might zzso the switch between zzso and zzso
