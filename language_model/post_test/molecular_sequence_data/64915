zzso rings are vital for zzso bone zzso and zzso protein 2/3 complex is a pivotal regulator of zzso zzso zzso protein 2/3 complex was found in the zzso of zzso zzso A short interfering zzso knocked down expression of zzso protein 2 in zzso and disrupted zzso rings, suggesting that the complex is crucial to zzso ring zzso 

To zzso bone, zzso form an zzso zzso compartment zzso by a zzso zzso This is dependent on an zzso ring that is composed of zzso zzso organized into dynamic structures called zzso The zzso protein 2/3 zzso complex is a vital regulator of zzso zzso We tested whether the zzso complex is a component of zzso rings and is important for zzso ring zzso 

Western zzso analysis was used to determine levels of zzso and zzso two components of the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso for zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso complex in zzso Short interfering zzso zzso zzso were made against zzso and used to knock down its zzso 

A zzso increase in zzso and zzso was detected during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells into zzso zzso zzso complex was concentrated in zzso rings and enriched near the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso with zzso a component of zzso but not zzso which surrounds zzso zzso against zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells 5 days after stimulation with zzso reduced zzso protein levels zzso compared with cells zzso with ineffective zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso in which zzso was knocked down revealed fewer zzso and no zzso rings, although many cells remained well zzso 

These data show that zzso complex is a component of zzso rings and that the presence of zzso complex is vital to the formation of zzso zzso In addition, the results show the use of zzso for the study of zzso zzso zzso zzso
