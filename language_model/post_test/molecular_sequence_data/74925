zzso zzso are divided into four zzso designated zzso to zzso by the use of zzso T zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of a functionally zzso group of zzso that are not recognized by zzso zzso or zzso zzso lines while it is indistinguishable from zzso by zzso zzso The structure of an zzso zzso expressed on donor zzso has been established by comparative zzso mapping with zzso and zzso zzso It was found to differ from zzso by a single zzso acid change of zzso to zzso at position zzso This position is only moderately zzso and has not previously been found to vary in any other zzso or zzso zzso The nature of the change is compatible with its generation by zzso zzso from zzso The only other previously characterized zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso by a single zzso acid replacement at position zzso Both zzso 9 and 99 are located in zzso positions within the alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso zzso The results shown contribute to the molecular interpretation of the zzso of zzso recognition within the zzso group of zzso
