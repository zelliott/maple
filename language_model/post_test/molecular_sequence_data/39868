Using the rice zzso zzso as a bait in a zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso of the type I zzso targeting signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from a zzso rice leaf zzso zzso The proteins were produced from a single gene by alternative zzso which generated a full-length zzso zzso and a zzso that lacked zzso 7, zzso zzso contained 11 copies of the zzso motif zzso in its zzso and seven zzso repeats in its zzso zzso of zzso and zzso predominantly occurred in leaf zzso and was induced by various zzso such as exposure to the pathogen zzso zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or hydrogen zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which does not zzso in the absence of zzso and was resistant to zzso acid zzso was perfectly rescued by zzso of zzso but not by zzso Using transient expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso both zzso and zzso proteins into the zzso by interacting with zzso whereas zzso is involved only in zzso import in zzso
