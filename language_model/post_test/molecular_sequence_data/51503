In zzso cells, transport of membrane proteins to the zzso plasma membrane has been shown to require a distinct zzso domain zzso Although the zzso is often related to signals used for zzso in zzso pits, zzso of the coated pit domain in the human LDL zzso did not affect zzso zzso By expressing zzso and zzso LDL zzso we have now identified two independently acting signals that are individually sufficient for zzso zzso The two zzso mediate zzso sorting with different zzso but both contain zzso zzso critical for zzso The first zzso was zzso with, but distinct from, the coated pit domain of the zzso The second was found in the zzso region of the zzso domain of the zzso and, although zzso did not mediate zzso The results suggest that membrane proteins can have functionally redundant signals for zzso transport and that a zzso motif may be a common feature of multiple zzso sorting zzso
