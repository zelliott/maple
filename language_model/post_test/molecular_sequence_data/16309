The zzso sequence coding for the coat protein of cucumber mosaic virus zzso Y zzso was zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso The sequence contains an open reading frame that encodes the coat protein composed of 218 zzso zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the coat protein of this strain were compared with those of the Q zzso the zzso of the sequences were zzso and zzso zzso Further study of the sequences gave an insight into the zzso organization and the molecular features of the coat zzso The coding region can be divided into three characteristic zzso The zzso region has zzso features in the positively charged structure, the zzso pattern and the predicted secondary structure, although the zzso acid sequence is varied mainly due to zzso zzso It is noteworthy that the positions of zzso zzso in this region are highly zzso Both the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the central region are well zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso region is not zzso because of zzso zzso however, the total number of zzso acids is zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso region is zzso but it could form a zzso structure similar to those reported for other zzso zzso investigation suggests that the Y and Q strains are zzso zzso
