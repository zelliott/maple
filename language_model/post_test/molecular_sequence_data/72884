zzso studies of molecules that zzso regulate zzso zzso functions have led to the identification of a large gene family with an zzso zzso domain, termed the zzso zzso It is now understood that zzso proteins serve as zzso proteins for zzso of the zzso zzso We have isolated from mouse zzso a full-length zzso clone zzso a novel member of the zzso protein family, termed zzso as well as the full-length zzso of zzso and zzso zzso distribution analysis shows that the novel zzso is predominantly expressed in liver and zzso and that zzso is zzso expressed in heart and skeletal zzso In contrast, zzso is widely zzso zzso analysis using the zzso response halo zzso and zzso gene induction zzso show that zzso of the zzso gene dramatically zzso zzso response to zzso whereas neither zzso nor zzso has any discernible effect on zzso sensitivity, pointing to a possible functional diversity among zzso zzso In zzso binding zzso reveal that zzso and zzso bind to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not to zzso Based on zzso analysis of the zzso zzso in the zzso domain, we suggest that the zzso binding and zzso protein activity may involve distinct functional structures of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso proteins may exert a dual function in the zzso of signaling via zzso zzso
