zzso transmission from zzso to zzso bipolar cells is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso apparently is coupled to a zzso which activates zzso to zzso zzso levels and thus a zzso zzso zzso We attempted to zzso this system zzso using zzso to various components of the rod zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso the zzso channel, and zzso All of these zzso reacted strongly with zzso but none reacted with bipolar zzso zzso to a different zzso zzso reacted strongly with rod bipolar cells of three zzso species (which are zzso and zzso Also stained were zzso of cone bipolar cells but not the major zzso type in cat zzso zzso zzso also stained certain zzso bipolar zzso Thus, across a wide range of species, zzso is present in retinal bipolar cells, and at least some of these are zzso and zzso
