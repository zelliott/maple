zzso zzso zzso transport zzso transport zzso from the base to the tip of the zzso to assemble and maintain zzso These zzso are distinct in containing two zzso motor zzso together with an accessory zzso We evaluated the significance of this organization by comparing zzso wild type zzso zzso that support zzso in zzso with zzso zzso containing only one type of motor domain that do not support zzso in zzso In zzso zzso wild type zzso moved zzso zzso at a rate intermediate between the rates supported by the two zzso Interestingly, one of the zzso but not the other zzso or the wild type zzso was observed to drive a persistent zzso rotation of the gliding zzso Thus one of the two motor zzso of zzso zzso exerts zzso as well as zzso force as it moves along a zzso which may allow zzso to control its zzso position around a zzso zzso within the zzso
