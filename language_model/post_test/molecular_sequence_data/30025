We have studied the regulation of zzso zzso zzso gene expression by zzso in zzso zzso We found a zzso responsive region zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site, which comprised three zzso zzso designated A, B, and zzso zzso A and B both contain a zzso zzso zzso to a consensus zzso response element zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was achieved when these two zzso were linked with domain C, which by itself did not zzso zzso responsiveness to a zzso promoter nor contained zzso zzso suggesting a functional cooperation among these zzso zzso of competition studies using gel zzso and zzso I zzso zzso suggest that there is a zzso interaction between a zzso binding protein and a domain C binding zzso In gel zzso zzso binding of a nuclear protein to zzso A and B was strongly zzso by addition of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso whereas the protein binding to domain C was slightly zzso suggesting that protein zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
