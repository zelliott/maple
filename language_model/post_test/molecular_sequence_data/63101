A combined chemical, zzso and molecular study was conducted to understand the differential zzso of volatile zzso in melon zzso zzso were present mainly in the zzso of zzso zzso and a great diversity in their composition was found among zzso zzso were generally absent in zzso zzso Two zzso melon zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were further zzso In zzso zzso the main zzso accumulated are zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is the main zzso in zzso zzso zzso activities, mainly restricted to zzso of mature zzso were shown to generate different zzso in each variety according to the compositions found in zzso zzso melon database mining yielded two novel zzso coding for members of the zzso gene family termed zzso and zzso respectively, that are zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso coli of zzso produced mainly zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso produced zzso zzso zzso was mostly expressed in zzso zzso zzso while zzso expression was specific to zzso zzso None of these genes was expressed in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that different zzso zzso zzso by different members of the zzso gene family are active in melon varieties and this specificity zzso the zzso of zzso The genes are zzso zzso regulated during fruit development and according to variety and are likely to be associated with chemical differences responsible for the unique aromas of melon zzso
