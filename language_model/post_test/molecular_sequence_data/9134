zzso zzso is a protein involved in the maintenance of zzso balance during oxygen zzso This zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso to zzso and requires zzso zzso as electron zzso Two examples are the soluble zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This work reports the identification and characterization of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the establishment of its zzso zzso Using a zzso expression system, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein that has zzso zzso activity which can functionally substitute for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we showed that zzso zzso are not affected by presence of salt in zzso indicating that the presence of this gene has no effect on zzso behavior under zzso zzso The fact that zzso expression and zzso activity was present only in zzso stage confirmed existence of at least one zzso zzso zzso in this phase of fungus life zzso This suggests that the zzso behave as zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
