zzso zzso is a major zzso protein component of bone, zzso and, according to our results, zzso zzso of zzso proteins from zzso developing zzso contain a single 67 zzso protein at neutral pH or three proteins zzso 63, and 53 zzso at low pH that were assumed to be zzso a minor class of zzso zzso A more complete analysis of these proteins in this study showed that they were derived from zzso serum zzso zzso This was demonstrated by zzso acid analysis, by zzso sequence analysis, by zzso studies using an zzso zzso and by zzso analysis of the acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso at different zzso stages showed that zzso deposited in zzso from the zzso organ and from the zzso during development, not during the dissection zzso These results indicate that true zzso must represent a very small fraction of the total zzso protein zzso in zzso developing teeth, and this has important implications on the role of zzso proteins during zzso of zzso
