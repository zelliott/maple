zzso mediate zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso a structural component of the zzso slit zzso is a single zzso spanning zzso and belongs to the family of zzso zzso Its zzso causes a zzso zzso zzso We report the previously zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso C zzso The zzso status of zzso zzso regulates zzso the binding of zzso and zzso The zzso member Yes, known to enhance zzso interaction by zzso zzso diminishes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso zzso serves as a molecular switch that determines the integrity of the slit zzso by functional competition between zzso and zzso This concept offers a molecular zzso of slit zzso distortion and opens therapeutic avenues for zzso zzso
