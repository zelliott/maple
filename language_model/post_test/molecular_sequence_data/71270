zzso and zzso are zzso toxins zzso by zzso zzso These toxins activate responses of specific cells and form lethal zzso zzso Their zzso and zzso activities involve the sequential binding and the synergistic association of a class S and a class F zzso which form zzso zzso The components of each protein class are produced as zzso zzso proteins that undergo zzso changes and zzso after recognition of their cell zzso 

The crystal structure of the zzso zzso form of the F component of zzso zzso zzso has been solved by the zzso anomalous zzso zzso method and refined at zzso A zzso The core of this zzso protein is similar to that of zzso but significant differences occur in regions that may be involved in the mechanism of pore zzso The zzso zzso which zzso a major zzso in this process, forms an additional domain in zzso The fold of this domain is similar to that of the zzso and zzso from snake zzso 

The structure analysis and a multiple sequence alignment of all toxic zzso suggest that zzso represents the fold of any zzso zzso protein in this family of zzso zzso zzso The comparison of the structures of zzso and zzso provides some insights into the mechanism of zzso pore formation for the zzso zzso which may diverge from that of the zzso zzso
