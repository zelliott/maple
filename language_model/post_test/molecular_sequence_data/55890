We investigated the use of immobilized DNA templates as zzso for zzso zzso zzso in order to develop a simple method for separating template DNA from zzso zzso zzso DNA molecules with a zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoter at one end and a single zzso zzso at the other end were attached to zzso zzso beads and used in zzso zzso When the zzso was attached by a zzso base on the zzso zzso the zzso complex was moderately stable and could be used for multiple rounds of zzso zzso However, when the zzso was attached through a zzso bond on the template zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso up to zzso of zzso DNA from the zzso zzso zzso DNA bound to zzso beads in this system with a binding constant on the order of zzso zzso These results stress the need for careful evaluation of solid phase adaptations of standard solution reactions in molecular zzso
