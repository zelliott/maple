Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso which causes adult zzso leukemia zzso in humans, establishes a zzso zzso zzso Current therapies are not very effective against zzso zzso A novel therapeutic approach may help to combat zzso zzso A molecular therapy that targets the zzso zzso is favorable because the therapeutic effect occurs specifically in zzso cells, regardless of whether they express viral zzso In this zzso study, we developed a therapeutic zzso based on zinc finger zzso zzso to achieve this zzso We designed a zzso that specifically recognized zzso region of zzso long terminal repeat zzso and introduced it into various zzso human zzso lines, including zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso disrupted the promoter function of zzso zzso and specifically killed zzso zzso We also showed a potential approach of this therapeutic zzso to remove the zzso zzso from zzso cells, something that has not been possible zzso The therapeutic effect of zzso was confirmed in an in zzso model of zzso This strategy may form the basis of a therapy that can eradicate zzso zzso Similar approaches can be used to target other zzso zzso
