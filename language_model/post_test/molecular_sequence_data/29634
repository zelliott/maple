The importance of two putative zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tomato zzso zzso zzso function was zzso The impact of zzso at these positions, corresponding to the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was evaluated in zzso fusion proteins expressed in zzso zzso zzso percent of the zzso zzso proteins were unstable or had complete or partial defects in zzso assembly or zzso The activity of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso was zzso Most zzso of zzso (a zzso zzso resulted in zzso that zzso zzso at slower zzso The zzso zzso (a zzso zzso had more diverse zzso Some zzso abolished activity and others retained partial or complete zzso The zzso zzso zzso had zzso and zzso values similar to the zzso zzso One zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso were essential for zzso activity, as most zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso The zzso zzso that retained the positive charge had partial activity as reflected in the zzso decrease in zzso Surprisingly, while the zzso zzso zzso retained a negative charge at position zzso was zzso the zzso zzso that introduced a positive charge retained partial zzso A model to explain these data is zzso
