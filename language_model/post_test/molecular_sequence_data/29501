Cell cultures infected with zzso a zzso bovine zzso 1 zzso which expresses a synthetic open reading frame zzso the fusion zzso protein of the bovine respiratory zzso virus zzso showed a zzso effect zzso indistinguishable from that induced by zzso zzso although transient zzso experiments demonstrated that expression of the F protein leads to formation of large zzso Since it has been shown that zzso M zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in transient zzso zzso experiments zzso virus zzso M zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso 74 zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of cell cultures with the resulting zzso zzso of zzso led to formation of zzso whereas the zzso in zzso infected cells was comparable to the zzso in zzso infected zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is not essential for zzso replication in cell culture and that zzso is involved in zzso of the cell fusion activity of the zzso expressed zzso F zzso
