Chicken zzso the ancestral form of zzso zzso and zzso is recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized the zzso zzso interaction site by consecutive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of selected zzso Using several fusion proteins that linked the human zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso a binding zzso revealed that both the zzso and zzso zzso were essential for the zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons of chicken zzso with human zzso demonstrated that 11 of the 19 contact zzso important for the zzso zzso interaction have been zzso in chicken zzso although the overall zzso acid identity is only zzso Among the 19 zzso acids at respective positions in zzso the zzso of two zzso in the zzso and two in the zzso domain completely abolished the zzso to zzso binding revealed by two independent zzso Three further zzso substantially altered the zzso zzso modeling on the zzso to zzso crystal structure revealed that all critical zzso although on two zzso are in close zzso The importance of zzso carbohydrates was demonstrated by the failure of the zzso interaction after zzso of the zzso zzso The identification of the zzso zzso zzso region as critical for binding to zzso significantly enhances our understanding of the zzso zzso interaction and allows further conclusions regarding the zzso zzso
