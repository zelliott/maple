A growing body of evidence suggests that the zzso proteins exclusive to the zzso zzso zzso play significant roles in zzso and cell zzso Each of these proteins contains four zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is essential in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso To identify zzso critical to zzso function, we developed a zzso zzso to screen for zzso that complement the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicating that these genes are true functional zzso of zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso 67 and zzso 12 zzso acid zzso are zzso for zzso zzso zzso indicated that three of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso in a predicted loop zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso were poorly zzso The region essential for zzso activity encompasses 6 of the 10 zzso zzso in all seven zzso tuberculosis zzso as well as in most members of the zzso family identified thus zzso zzso structure was found to be sensitive to the presence of a reducing agent, suggesting that the zzso zzso are involved in zzso a metal zzso zzso zzso strongly suggested that zzso contains a bound iron zzso With this information, we have now begun to comprehend the functional significance of the zzso sequence and structural elements in this novel family of zzso
