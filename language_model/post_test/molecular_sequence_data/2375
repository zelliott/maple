The zzso zzso repetitive proteins zzso of zzso zzso are zzso regulated surface proteins zzso by a family of zzso zzso We have determined the complete zzso sequence of a novel member of the zzso gene family and investigated its zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso alpha gene showed a marked conservation of both the zzso and zzso regions compared with other zzso but revealed the substitution of a zzso for the zzso repeating unit that is characteristic of all other zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that expression of the zzso alpha zzso like that of other members of this gene family, is confined to the zzso stage of the zzso zzso life zzso This result implies coordinate regulation of the zzso genetic zzso that zzso zzso
