zzso zzso and their downstream zzso proteins regulate a diverse array of cellular processes during embryonic development, including reorganization of zzso architecture, cell zzso and zzso Changes in the zzso state of zzso zzso are converted into changes in cellular behavior by a diversity of zzso zzso which are activated in response to changes in the zzso binding state of zzso zzso In this study we characterize the expression and function of one such zzso zzso that is present during zzso stages in zzso zzso 

In a search for genes whose expression is regulated during early stages of embryonic development in zzso zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein 2, or zzso was isolated, and found to be highly zzso but not zzso to a zzso sequence previously submitted to the zzso zzso These two gene sequences are likely zzso zzso zzso is expressed at constant levels until zzso to zzso zzso zzso and then strongly zzso at late zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso directed at one or both zzso resulted in a significant delay in zzso closure and zzso with normal embryonic zzso suggesting a role for zzso in regulating zzso zzso The zzso zzso effect could be rescued by zzso with a zzso version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to have no effect on zzso zzso suggesting that the observed effects were due to changes in the behavior of zzso cells, rather than zzso in their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also observed to cause complete zzso of cells zzso animal cap zzso suggesting a specific role of zzso in maintenance or regulation of zzso zzso in early zzso This loss of cell zzso could be rescued by zzso with a zzso version of the zzso zzso 

zzso appears to be an essential component in the early zzso program in zzso zzso zzso is involved in maintenance of zzso zzso and as such may constitute a regulatory component that could help to balance the need for tissue integrity and plasticity during the dynamic cellular zzso of zzso
