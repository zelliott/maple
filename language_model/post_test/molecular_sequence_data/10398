The zzso sequence of an zzso gene in zzso zzso has been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this gene shares a zzso identity with that of a recently reported conventional zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the product of this zzso gene does not fit into conventional zzso or any major zzso protein zzso The zzso gene in zzso zzso contains seven zzso in the coding region and, as described for the conventional zzso zzso it contains several sequences similar to the zzso zzso sequence motif in its zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of the gene shows a zzso pattern different from that of the conventional zzso zzso indicating that these genes are distinct from one zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso shows the messages of the two genes to be very similar in size, yet the message level of the zzso gene is significantly lower than that of the conventional zzso zzso
