zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso couple receptors for zzso signals to zzso second zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso are expressed in a zzso and temporally restricted manner during zzso zzso and, thus, may be responsible for zzso zzso zzso We have used the zzso chain reaction to search for specific G alpha zzso that function primarily during development and not in the adult zzso Using zzso zzso isolated from early zzso zzso 1), we have isolated a zzso coding for a fly G alpha zzso designated zzso zzso This zzso is zzso identical to previously described zzso and zzso G alpha zzso and appears to define an additional family of G alpha zzso zzso alpha transcripts are expressed primarily during zzso zzso and early zzso stages and only at low levels in adult zzso In zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso alpha transcripts are expressed zzso and later during zzso primarily in the developing zzso and zzso in the zzso The zzso alpha gene has been characterized and mapped to position zzso of the zzso zzso
