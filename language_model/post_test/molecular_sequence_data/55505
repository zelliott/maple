The zzso zzso zzso complex directs proper zzso segregation in zzso I by zzso zzso of sister zzso on the zzso I zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso complex that may directly zzso sister zzso We report here zzso characterization of the zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso and of the complete zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso with different zzso combinations, we have determined the zzso and overall architecture of the full zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of zzso bound to a zzso fragment, showing how zzso wraps around the zzso zzso and alters the zzso of zzso binding by zzso We further show that the zzso activity of zzso is altered by zzso zzso and we identify zzso zzso sites on zzso that may affect zzso complex stability and/or zzso binding in zzso
