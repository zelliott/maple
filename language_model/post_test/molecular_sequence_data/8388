Previously, the zzso locus zzso was identified as important for zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that it is an zzso of four genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso 80 zzso 101 zzso and 252 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transcript was zzso in bacteria that activate zzso indicating that zzso regulates zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso predicted gene products were similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins required for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the culture zzso from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that at least 25 zzso larger than 14 zzso could be zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso had significant defects in their zzso protein zzso The invasion and zzso protein profile defects of the zzso zzso were both zzso by a zzso zzso zzso that included zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso transport of proteins by zzso repression of zzso zzso and that zzso proteins may be involved in zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso
