As a result of the inability to resolve the zzso mixture of G protein beta gamma zzso present in zzso it has not been possible to compare different beta gamma zzso of the G proteins in terms of their proposed roles in zzso zzso This study was undertaken to establish the utility of the zzso expression system in producing homogeneous beta gamma zzso of defined composition for the comparative analysis of these zzso in zzso zzso In this study we report the zzso and appropriate zzso processing, of zzso beta 2, gamma 2 and gamma 3 zzso In addition, we show that the zzso beta gamma zzso can be readily zzso and can functionally interact with the alpha zzso of the G zzso
