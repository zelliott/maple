A zzso zzso for the initial screening of potential zzso agents that uses bacterial growth on selective media is zzso The human zzso virus zzso zzso recognition sequence was inserted into the zzso resistance zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso and the modified zzso protein prevented growth in the presence of zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso restored zzso zzso Thus, potential zzso zzso zzso can be identified by their ability to zzso zzso resistance to this bacterial zzso The zzso is simple, zzso and zzso and this concept can be applied to the search for zzso of other viral zzso
