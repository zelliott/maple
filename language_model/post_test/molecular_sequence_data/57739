One of zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene resides zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site and is composed of three protein binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas zzso and zzso contain a zzso zzso the zzso sequence is not related to any known protein recognition zzso yet all three zzso are required to mediate zzso action on a zzso zzso To study the functional cooperation among these three zzso we zzso and cloned a zzso protein zzso from zzso kidney derived zzso zzso zzso comparisons showed that zzso is zzso to mouse zzso and rat zzso zzso is related to a liver specific zzso factor zzso it recognizes the same sequence as zzso and is highly expressed in kidney zzso zzso and zzso recognition sequences are zzso nevertheless both sequences are recognized by in zzso zzso and zzso indicating that binding to the two different sequences is an intrinsic character of zzso In zzso cells, this zzso site was inactive whether zzso was zzso or not, suggesting a requirement for an additional zzso zzso These results may suggest a mechanism by which hormonal control is integrated into zzso gene zzso
