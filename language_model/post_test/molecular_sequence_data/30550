The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important zzso role in zzso zzso between zzso and their zzso cellular zzso This interaction is zzso by binding of zzso to the broadly distributed surface zzso zzso and zzso the recognition function of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso via stabilization of zzso formation between zzso To define better the structural components of the zzso zzso region which are important in zzso cellular zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein has been prepared from zzso zzso of a soluble zzso zzso zzso This zzso domain zzso binds to zzso on human zzso with a zzso constant of zzso zzso possesses functional zzso zzso as defined by the binding of zzso zzso raised to native zzso and retains the ability to inhibit sheep zzso zzso formation with human zzso Thus, all of the zzso functions ascribed to zzso reside within the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the isolated zzso zzso domain suggests the presence of substantial zzso character zzso consistent with earlier computer modeling analyses that predicted a pattern of alternating zzso and zzso within the zzso region of zzso Despite the existence of short stretches of sequence zzso between zzso and zzso zzso members, the circular zzso data provide supporting zzso evidence for zzso of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso or alpha + zzso protein folding zzso
