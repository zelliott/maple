Using zzso zzso we screened honey bee colonies for the presence of several bee zzso including black queen cell virus zzso zzso wing virus zzso Kashmir bee virus zzso and zzso virus zzso and described the detection of mixed virus infections in bees from these zzso We report for the first time that individual bees can harbor four viruses zzso We also developed a multiplex zzso zzso for the simultaneous detection of multiple bee zzso The feasibility and specificity of the multiplex zzso zzso suggests that this zzso is an effective tool for simultaneous examination of mixed virus infections in bee colonies and would be useful for the diagnosis and surveillance of honey bee viral diseases in the field and zzso zzso analysis of putative zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by viruses reveal that zzso and zzso fall into a same zzso whereas zzso and zzso belong to a distinct lineage with other zzso viruses that zzso plants, insects and zzso zzso from field surveys of these viruses indicate that mixed infections of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the honey bee probably arise due to broad geographic distribution of zzso
