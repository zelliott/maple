The sequence of the zzso zzso gene 1 has been determined and compared with the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso virus and the avian infectious zzso zzso The coding sequence of gene 1 is zzso zzso in zzso Within this coding region are two large open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which overlap by 40 zzso In the overlapping region, the zzso zzso can be folded into a zzso structure, an element which is known to mediate zzso zzso zzso in other zzso Assuming that zzso zzso occurs at the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso - zzso zzso product is predicted to be zzso zzso acids in zzso Our sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene 1 has revealed a high degree of similarity within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso is much less zzso zzso which are believed to be necessary for specific zzso zzso and general zzso zzso zzso functions have been zzso This study completes the zzso sequence of zzso zzso which is zzso zzso long and one of the largest known zzso zzso
