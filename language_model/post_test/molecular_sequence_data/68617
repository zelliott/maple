In order to study the contribution of the zzso zzso and zzso properties of the zzso acid zzso at position 3 in zzso C on binding to delta and zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso and zzso ring and zzso zzso acid replacements at position 3 were prepared by solution synthesis zzso In general, the zzso were deleterious for high delta affinity zzso zzso and delta selectivity zzso zzso zzso However, several notable exceptions were zzso peptides containing the zzso zzso structures zzso and (R or zzso zzso enhanced delta zzso but only the latter increased delta selectivity zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso C zzso zzso at the other extreme, delta affinity of N alpha zzso fell zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso or zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso C using guinea pig zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso for zzso and delta zzso respectively, revealed a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and delta binding in brain zzso zzso or zzso C also exhibited the highest biological selectivity zzso zzso zzso which was zzso greater than that observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha zzso and zzso C established that these zzso acid replacements for zzso produce zzso in the backbone zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso which critically affect the flexibility of the zzso and possibly limit accessible zzso for its alignment within the delta zzso zzso The data provide evidence that the delta zzso is sensitive to changes in the zzso zzso and orientation of the side chain of zzso 3 of a linear zzso zzso
