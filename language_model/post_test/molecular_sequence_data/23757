zzso is an zzso zzso zzso involved in Alzheimer's zzso zzso occurs as a high molecular weight complex composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso anterior zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the cellular mechanisms of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso tail of zzso fulfills several functions required for complex formation, retention of unincorporated zzso and zzso zzso The very zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso and may penetrate into the zzso zzso of the last zzso acid is sufficient to completely block zzso assembly and release of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that unincorporated zzso is actively retained within the zzso We identified a zzso stretch of zzso acids within the zzso tail of zzso distinct from the zzso site, which is required to retain unincorporated zzso within the zzso zzso of the retention signal results in the release of zzso from the zzso and the assembly of a zzso zzso complex, suggesting that at least a part of the retention motif may also be required for the function of zzso
