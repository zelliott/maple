zzso zzso is a zzso zzso plant zzso zzso responsible for several economically important crop zzso Here, we present a novel and efficient protein zzso protocol for the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an outer membrane protein that plays important roles in maintaining the integrity of the cell envelope and in bacterial zzso Because zzso has a highly zzso zzso domain, the zzso expression studies necessary for structural and functional protein characterization are zzso once the zzso protein is present in inclusion zzso Our protocol based on the zzso of the zzso inclusion bodies with zzso zzso followed by zzso steps via dialysis proved effective for the zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso allowing us to obtain a large amount of relatively pure and folded zzso In addition, zzso was zzso and functionally zzso The method for zzso reported zzso is valuable for further research on the three-dimensional structure and function of zzso and other outer membrane proteins and can contribute to a better understanding of the role of these proteins in bacterial zzso especially with regard to the plant pathogen zzso zzso
