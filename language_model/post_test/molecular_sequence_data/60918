Although the primary structures of class 1 zzso release factors zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso are known, the molecular basis by which they function in zzso termination remains zzso Because all class 1 zzso promote a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso one may anticipate that this common function relies on a common structural zzso We have compared zzso acid sequences of the available class 1 zzso and found a novel, common, unique, and strictly zzso zzso motif that should be in a loop zzso zzso as deduced by programs predicting protein secondary zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso as a representative of class 1 zzso shows that substitution of both zzso zzso in this zzso zzso and zzso causes complete zzso of the protein as a release factor toward all three stop zzso whereas two adjacent zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso are functionally zzso zzso human zzso zzso compete in release zzso with zzso zzso and strongly inhibit their release zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in this motif do not affect another function, the ability of zzso together with the zzso to induce zzso activity of human zzso a class 2 zzso We assume that the novel highly zzso zzso motif is implicated directly or indirectly in the activity of class 1 zzso in translation zzso
