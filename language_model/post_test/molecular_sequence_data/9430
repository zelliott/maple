zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso syndrome characterized by bone zzso zzso and bone zzso We previously mapped the zzso zzso locus to zzso region zzso but failed to identify zzso in known genes in this zzso We now demonstrate that zzso results from zzso in the most zzso of three previously zzso terminal zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two of these zzso zzso arose from early and independent zzso events in zzso zzso at least 40 million years ago, and since then, their zzso integration has gained a functional zzso zzso is a zzso expressed zzso zzso critical to zzso metabolism and zzso and zzso salvage pathways and was believed to be zzso as a single transcript from the eight previously described zzso Six distinct zzso zzso zzso each of which can physically interact with archetype zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso occur within one of these zzso zzso result in zzso skipping and zzso alternative zzso of all zzso zzso Our results identify a gene involved in the development of bone zzso provide evidence of the zzso evolution of certain parts of an existing zzso and demonstrate that zzso in parts of this gene can result in human disease despite its relatively recent zzso
