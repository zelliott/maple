The zzso immediate early zzso 2 protein of human zzso zzso a number of zzso and zzso zzso including the cellular promoter for the zzso zzso protein zzso and the human zzso virus long terminal zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso these two promoters in a zzso manner, and that zzso is able to form a direct contact with zzso binding protein zzso in zzso We now show that zzso binds to the basic repeat region of zzso In addition zzso can contact a second general zzso factor, zzso We have mapped the zzso and zzso regions within zzso and show that these regions zzso and also lie within parts of the protein previously identified as being required for the zzso and zzso functions of zzso
