Although the zzso clock is a self-sustaining zzso having a zzso of nearly 1 zzso its period length is not necessarily 24 zzso zzso daily adjustment of the clock zzso zzso is an essential mechanism for the zzso clock to adapt to daily environmental zzso One of the major cues for this zzso mechanism is zzso In the zzso green zzso zzso zzso the zzso clock is reset by zzso and red zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely zzso In this study, using clock zzso fusion reporters, we found that the level of zzso OF zzso 15 zzso a clock component in zzso zzso decreased rapidly after light exposure in a zzso zzso Blue, green, and red light were able to induce this process, with red light being the most effective among zzso zzso analyses and inhibitor experiments suggested that this process was regulated mainly by a zzso protein degradation zzso In addition, we found that the other clock zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso was involved in this zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that a zzso zzso showed defects in the zzso of the zzso clock by zzso Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the zzso degradation of zzso protein is one of the triggers for zzso the zzso clock in zzso zzso Our data provide not only a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso zzso but also insights into the zzso mechanisms of zzso clocks in zzso
