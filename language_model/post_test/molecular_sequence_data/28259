The zzso requirements for optimal interaction of zzso zzso zzso with DNA have been investigated using a series of zzso with modified bases such as zzso G zzso I, zzso C zzso zzso or zzso U zzso at specific sites in its preferred zzso zzso zzso zzso A, C, or zzso zzso show that zzso and zzso in place of zzso improve direct strand zzso at the target zzso zzso zzso T greater than A much greater than C greater than zzso whereas zzso and zzso in place of zzso hinder zzso The optimal base target at zzso appears to be determined by its ability to form zzso type base pairing instead of zzso zzso The observed differences in DNA strand zzso patterns can be rationalized by induced changes in target site structure and are compatible with a model for zzso interaction in which the zzso zzso zzso between zzso and the activated zzso lying in the minor groove, abstracts a hydrogen atom from zzso of zzso
