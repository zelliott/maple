The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined with the aid of fragments obtained by zzso with zzso and zzso The fragments were aligned with overlapping sequences and sequence comparison with zzso of other zzso zzso comparison with other species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave an overall identity of zzso and a similarity of zzso The zzso of the alignment indicates that zzso zzso has the closest relationship with the bovine zzso zzso and the most distant with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The close relationship is indicative for the presence of the same structural and functional zzso as in the other zzso zzso comparison of different zzso showed that positions 49 zzso 83 zzso and 161 zzso in the light chain of the zzso zzso may play a role in the interaction between zzso and zzso
