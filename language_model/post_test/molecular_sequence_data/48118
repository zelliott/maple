The gene zzso factor C zzso an zzso signal protein involved in cellular zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and the complete zzso sequence was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length protein consists of 324 zzso acids and has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The mature zzso zzso zzso acid protein zzso zzso is probably produced by zzso off a 38 zzso acid zzso signal zzso Southern zzso detected zzso in several other zzso zzso but database searches failed to identify a protein with significant zzso to factor zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso effect similar to that given by zzso added factor C zzso
