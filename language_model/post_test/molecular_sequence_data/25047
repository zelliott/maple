The mechanisms involved in zzso zzso have remained largely unexplored due to lack of an appropriate zzso Furthermore, with the recent advances in zzso zzso the need for alternative zzso tissue sources is greater than zzso zzso the authors have refined a zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation model that offers an ideal tool to gain insight into zzso growth as well as an alternative source of zzso zzso Recent knowledge in zzso growth has resulted in zzso tissue being derived from human pancreatic precursor tissue in zzso The potential for large scale production of zzso tissue in zzso has been zzso however, more investigation must be done on the various signals and pathways involved in pancreatic development to zzso this zzso The authors believe that their zzso in zzso maturation model provides an ideal tool to study zzso growth and zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso genes of interest zzso zzso or exposure of the zzso to various culture conditions will allow us to determine the effects on zzso zzso An understanding of zzso development gained will not only allow us to mature this unlimited tissue source for optimal zzso but also elude to how human pancreatic zzso precursor cells may be used to solve the current zzso tissue supply zzso
