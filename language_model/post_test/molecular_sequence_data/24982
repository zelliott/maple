Alzheimer's disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by overproduction of zzso zzso which is formed from zzso precursor protein zzso with the subsequent zzso deposition of zzso in regions of the brain important for memory and zzso Recently, vaccination of zzso models of zzso that exhibit zzso deposition has halted or delayed the usual progression of the pathology of zzso Our group has demonstrated that vaccination of a doubly transgenic mouse model zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso protects these mice from the memory deficits they would zzso zzso This report further characterizes the zzso zzso zzso vaccine in zzso zzso response time course analysis indicated that at least three zzso (each 100 zzso were necessary to elicit a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso of at least zzso and these zzso were maintained for at least 5 months after the final zzso zzso binding competition studies indicated that the highest zzso responses are generated against the N zzso of the zzso zzso Also, measurement of specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice demonstrated a zzso zzso and zzso response, suggesting a type 2 zzso zzso cell immune response, which drives zzso zzso Finally, zzso proliferation zzso experiments using zzso peptides and zzso from vaccinated mice demonstrated that the vaccine specifically stimulates zzso zzso present within the zzso zzso
