zzso infection is a major cause of iron zzso anemia and zzso in developing zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso that has previously been isolated from adult zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso zzso zzso site zzso acid confirmed the role of zzso in zzso zzso of the three target zzso zzso By using reverse zzso it was demonstrated that the level of zzso gene expression increased following zzso of third-stage larvae with serum and that the highest level of expression was reached in the adult stage of the zzso zzso studies performed with zzso zzso G raised against zzso zzso showed that the inhibitor localized to the zzso of the adult zzso suggesting that it has a potential in zzso role in zzso zzso zzso at the surface of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso was shown to zzso partial protection against zzso growth delay without a measurable effect on zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso and growth zzso perhaps through zzso of zzso zzso in infected zzso
