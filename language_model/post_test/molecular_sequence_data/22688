In zzso zzso zzso response requires zzso scaffold zzso which ensures efficient zzso recruitment of zzso protein zzso zzso cascade components zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the plasma membrane for zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso which zzso zzso to initiate zzso is activated by binding to zzso zzso zzso anchored via its zzso zzso Less clear is how activated and zzso zzso contacts zzso to trigger invasive growth zzso which also requires zzso and the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso protein associates zzso via an zzso zzso motif domain with zzso and this interaction is required for optimal invasive growth and zzso stress zzso zzso zzso signaling but has a lesser role in zzso zzso We show that a zzso zzso so-called zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso is also essential for invasive growth and zzso signaling in zzso In zzso the zzso zzso domain is not able to associate with zzso but it does associate with zzso and binds to a different face than does zzso zzso domain function can be replaced by the nine zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also suppresses the signaling zzso of zzso zzso specifically defective in invasive zzso Thus, zzso serves as an zzso to zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and can do so via association with zzso thereby permitting the encounter of zzso with activated zzso
