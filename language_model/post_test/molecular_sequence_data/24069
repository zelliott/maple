We determined the complete zzso sequences zzso and zzso base pairs, zzso of the zzso zzso of the South American zzso zzso zzso and the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA sequences were established in an effort to resolve the debated evolutionary positions of the zzso and the zzso relative to land zzso Previous molecular zzso studies based on complete zzso zzso including only the African zzso zzso zzso sequence were able to strongly reject the traditional textbook hypothesis that zzso are the closest relatives of land zzso However, these studies were unable to statistically significantly distinguish between the two remaining zzso zzso as the closest relatives to land zzso and zzso and zzso jointly as their sister group zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso and Meyer zzso zzso zzso and the fish ancestors of the zzso lineage all originated within a short time window of about 20 million years, back in the early zzso (about 380 to 400 million years zzso This short divergence time makes the determination of the zzso relationships among these three lineages zzso In this study, we attempted to break the long evolutionary branch of zzso in an effort to better resolve the zzso relationships among the three extant zzso zzso The gene order of the zzso zzso of the South American and Australian zzso zzso to the consensus gene order among zzso zzso The zzso analyses of the complete set of zzso proteins (without zzso suggest that the zzso are the closest relatives of the zzso although the support in favor of this scenario is not statistically zzso The two other smaller data sets zzso and zzso zzso give inconsistent results depending on the different reconstruction methods applied and cannot significantly rule out any of the three alternative zzso Nuclear zzso zzso which might be better zzso markers for this question, support the zzso zzso relationship zzso et zzso zzso
