zzso we report the first zzso zzso zzso and synthetic utility of a sugar zzso from any zzso source and demonstrate by an zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso its unusual tolerance of heat, zzso and sugar zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a relatively high degree of acceptance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The apparent zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso 1, and 22 zzso 2 zzso respectively, with corresponding turnover numbers of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An initial zzso study indicated an ordered zzso zzso mechanism for this zzso The temperature stability and inherently broad zzso tolerance of this zzso zzso promise an effective zzso for the rapid zzso synthesis of a range of natural and zzso sugar zzso for in zzso zzso studies and highlight the potential of zzso as a source of new zzso for zzso
