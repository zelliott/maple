In zzso cells, the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are required for the correct and efficient repair of DNA zzso zzso zzso comprises two zzso zzso of approximately 69 and approximately 83 zzso which are termed zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso Previously, a number of regions of both zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be involved in their interaction, but the molecular mechanism of this interaction remains zzso We have identified a region in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and a region in zzso zzso zzso that participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that these interaction regions share sequence zzso and suggests that the zzso zzso are structurally zzso On binding to a DNA zzso break, zzso is able to interact with zzso but how this interaction is zzso has not been zzso We show that the extreme zzso of zzso specifically the final 12 zzso acid zzso mediates a highly specific interaction with zzso zzso these zzso appear to be zzso only in zzso sequences from zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso has evolved to become part of the zzso zzso by acquisition of a zzso interaction motif at the zzso of zzso
