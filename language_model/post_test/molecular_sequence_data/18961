The zzso protein family has zzso zzso activity and is related in function to zzso zzso are known to be involved in many biological processes including hormone zzso plant growth, and stress responses through a zzso or an zzso of zzso zzso during protein zzso The availability of complete zzso zzso sequences allowed the identification of 21 zzso genes by zzso and zzso zzso zzso locations of these zzso genes in the zzso zzso were determined and the protein domain and motif organization of zzso zzso were zzso The zzso relationships between zzso zzso were also zzso The expression profiles of zzso zzso gene results revealed that most zzso zzso were expressed in all zzso while a few zzso zzso were specifically expressed in some of the zzso This data could contribute to better understanding of the complex regulation of the zzso zzso gene family, and also provide valuable information for further research in zzso functional zzso
