zzso is a fundamental mechanism for the generation of genetic zzso zzso zzso strains have different zzso of zzso zzso arising from deletions and zzso between DNA repeat zzso as well as zzso zzso facilitated by their natural zzso We identified a zzso zzso that influences zzso zzso in this highly diverse zzso and demonstrate its importance in maintaining zzso integrity by limiting zzso zzso zzso shows zzso to zzso an zzso zzso that in zzso coli allows repair of damaged replication zzso to proceed without recourse to potentially zzso zzso zzso studies done show that zzso can complement zzso coli zzso zzso in trans to the same extent as zzso coli zzso can, indicating that zzso has zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso gene only partially zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso is not involved in DNA repair in zzso zzso although it has the ability to repair DNA when expressed in zzso zzso zzso host context appears critical in defining the function of zzso The fact that in zzso coli zzso zzso are not constant in other species indicates the diverse roles for zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso
