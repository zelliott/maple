zzso zzso of zzso zzso are frequently exposed to stressful conditions in nature, and their zzso development is one response to environmental zzso Here we analyzed an zzso stage abundant zzso zzso zzso to human zzso zzso responsive to stress 1) to understand the mechanisms for the initiation of development and cell fate zzso The zzso cells exhibited reduced viability under zzso zzso They produced smaller zzso on membrane filters and did not form zzso zzso on a plastic surface under submerged zzso conditions, but were normal in sexual zzso During early asexual development, the expression of zzso genes peaked earlier in the knockout zzso Neither zzso zzso in starved cells nor an increase in the zzso level following zzso stress was observed in zzso The nuclear export zzso as well as the zzso domain, in zzso was necessary for stream zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is involved in zzso relay, and that signaling pathways for zzso development have evolved in unison with the stress zzso
