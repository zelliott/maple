The internal motion of zzso zzso transfer zzso is studied by normal mode analysis in extended zzso angle space in which the flexibility of zzso zzso rings is treated faithfully by introducing a variable for its zzso zzso Analysis of global molecular motion reveals that the zzso is very zzso We show that this zzso comes not from the property of the zzso zzso the zzso but from its slender zzso Analysis of zzso distance fluctuations reveals that this zzso can be regarded as consisting zzso of three zzso zzso fluctuations of the zzso zzso angles show rigidity of the zzso zzso They also show flexibility of regions around zzso zzso zzso interactions cause suppression of the correlated functions of zzso zzso angles beyond a zzso zzso We analyze the zzso fluctuation of parameters describing the positions of two adjacent zzso zzso of relative zzso parameters in the zzso and zzso stem regions are found to be larger that those in other stem zzso The relative zzso motions cause the two stem regions to undergo global twisting and zzso zzso We show that the role of zzso motion of zzso is important in regions around bases which are involved in zzso zzso
