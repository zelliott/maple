zzso zzso focusing on immobilized pH zzso followed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso we have obtained a map of zzso zzso zzso from a mixed culture containing all zzso zzso presenting over 2000 spots within the window of zzso points zzso zzso and a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded successful results in 12 out of 24 analyzed zzso All but one of the zzso sequences retrieved zzso zzso sequences in zzso and/or expressed sequence tag zzso zzso related protein sequences found in data banks included zzso in energy metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a fatty zzso zzso a zzso controlled tumor zzso an unknown zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso beta chain, zzso and zzso zzso Experimental determination of zzso allowed us to define sites of signal zzso providing further information on the zzso role of the newly found zzso zzso zzso This report demonstrates the possibility of two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
