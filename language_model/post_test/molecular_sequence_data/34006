zzso zzso metabolism in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso characterized by 50% zzso acid sequence identity, show zzso features of zzso and zzso and are stabilized by zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly specific for zzso zzso while zzso is characterized by a broad zzso specificity with zzso zzso as preferred zzso zzso acid sequence comparison clearly shows that the hypothetical active sites of zzso and zzso are almost identical and that, in zzso with human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso changes at level of the same crucial positions could be responsible for the switch of zzso zzso To validate this hypothesis we changed the putative active site of zzso by zzso zzso zzso specificity and zzso efficiency of zzso zzso were then analyzed by kinetic studies and compared with the zzso zzso We carried out the molecular modeling of zzso and zzso to obtain a picture of the overall zzso structure and to identify structural features as well as interactions playing critical roles in zzso Finally, we zzso the structural models of zzso zzso complex to zzso the functional effects of the zzso
