zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene on high copy plasmids suppresses the zzso growth associated with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso of zzso A zzso that zzso the intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso displays zzso identity and zzso similarity to zzso we explored the possibility that zzso encodes a related zzso In contrast to zzso extracts of strains with zzso zzso in zzso are not defective in transferring zzso from zzso zzso carrier protein to zzso zzso However, extracts of zzso zzso do not efficiently zzso the product formed by zzso designated zzso zzso zzso of strains harboring zzso bearing plasmids zzso zzso zzso very rapidly compared with wild zzso We zzso and partially zzso zzso from an zzso strain, lacking zzso zzso transfers zzso or zzso activated on zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are poor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso about 100 times faster than zzso zzso The slow, but zzso rate zzso zzso acts on zzso zzso may explain why zzso of zzso suppresses the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Presumably, the zzso group generated by excess zzso zzso for the one normally formed by zzso
