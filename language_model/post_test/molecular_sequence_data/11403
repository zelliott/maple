zzso linkage analyses have traced the zzso for multiple zzso zzso type 2A zzso zzso to an zzso on zzso zzso This region encompasses the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso gene expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By means of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification and DNA sequencing, we have zzso 19 individuals from two Japanese zzso 2A families for zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso 10 and zzso We conducted zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso amplified from affected and unaffected family zzso The DNA zzso in the zzso zzso caused substitution of a zzso for a zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso 10 in three patients in one zzso 2A family, 1, and of a zzso for a zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso 11 in six patients in the zzso 2A family, zzso We could find two zzso zzso gene carriers who had no symptoms or signs of zzso 2A by DNA analysis of the zzso zzso No zzso in these zzso were detected in any unaffected normal members of zzso zzso A DNA zzso in the zzso zzso coding sequence in zzso 10 caused a shift on zzso gels that was characteristic of the disease zzso in the zzso 2A family, present only in affected members of the zzso The DNA change could also be detected by restriction zzso zzso with zzso in family zzso Two zzso 2A patients with a zzso for a zzso substitution at zzso zzso in the zzso 11 had zzso zzso We conclude that the identification of a DNA zzso in the zzso gene will permit zzso molecular testing of individuals at risk in these zzso 2A families and the zzso zzso system will be useful for genetic diagnosis of members of these zzso 2A zzso This information, by providing diagnostic zzso should improve medical care for affected family zzso
