zzso is a ubiquitous zzso membrane protein essential for generation and maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in virtually all animal cell zzso zzso and polarized distribution of zzso zzso appears to depend on connection of zzso to the zzso membrane zzso as well as on association with zzso zzso In a previous study we showed zzso and zzso of zzso zzso not only with zzso zzso and zzso but also with two further peripheral membrane zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso In this paper we show by sequence analysis through mass zzso as well as by zzso that zzso 2 is identical to zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family, all members of which have been shown to serve as zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso full-length zzso as well as its zzso domain bind to zzso and that this binding can be inhibited by an zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso loop zzso 3) of the zzso zzso This loop has been previously shown to be a site essential for zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso might not only serve as direct zzso zzso of zzso to zzso filaments but also modify zzso binding at domain 3 of zzso in a way similar to protein zzso zzso the binding of zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
