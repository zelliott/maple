The overall objective of this research was to develop a sensitive, specific, and zzso zzso zzso for the determination of the zzso hormone analog known as zzso zzso in biological zzso zzso cell culture transport media and human zzso zzso was accomplished zzso within zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The mobile phase consisted of zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso with 18 zzso zzso at pH zzso The zzso was 1 zzso with detection at 214 zzso Standard zzso zzso zzso 5) were linear over the concentration range zzso zzso The precision, zzso zzso and zzso variations were good with zzso typically within zzso for zzso greater than 100 zzso This method was applied to a study of the transport of zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso
