We are developing triple zzso zzso zzso as gene targeting zzso in zzso zzso We have described zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a cluster of zzso zzso zzso with all other zzso as zzso were zzso in a gene knockout zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with one or two zzso or three zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso stability analysis of the zzso indicated that there were only incremental differences between the active and inactive zzso However the active and inactive zzso could be distinguished by their association zzso The zzso zzso showed markedly greater zzso than the inactive zzso It appears that the zzso is a better predictor of zzso zzso than zzso zzso Our data are consistent with a model in which a cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso the nucleation event that precedes formation of a complete zzso It is likely that zzso in cells are much less stable than zzso in zzso probably as a result of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso will favor zzso that can bind and zzso zzso targets zzso
