zzso analysis of a barley zzso zzso gene promoter has identified a zzso zzso response complex in the region between zzso and zzso The sequence of the central element, zzso is very similar to the zzso and zzso consensus binding zzso We investigated the possibility that a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in barley zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which encodes a novel zzso was isolated from a barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression in isolated barley zzso layers is zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso expression indicates that it is an early event in zzso gene expression and precedes zzso gene zzso zzso blocked zzso gene expression but failed to block zzso gene zzso indicating that protein synthesis is not required for zzso gene zzso zzso mobility shift experiments with zzso zzso showed that zzso binds specifically to the zzso box in zzso We demonstrated in transient expression experiments that zzso activates zzso of a zzso zzso promoter fused to a zzso reporter gene in the absence of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso is the sole zzso zzso factor required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We therefore zzso that zzso is a part of the zzso zzso leading to zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
