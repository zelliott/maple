The peculiarities of the sequences of zzso zzso included in a zzso DNA segment cloned in zzso zzso are zzso This zzso segment is situated on the X zzso zzso to the main zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence comprised undamaged stretches of zzso zzso with segments characterized by high density of zzso zzso and zzso The observed patchwork arrangement of zzso zzso sequences was considered as evidence of segmented gene conversion events between the normal and damaged genes which are thought to constitute one of the mechanisms of zzso array zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located nearby, zzso to the zzso undamaged part of zzso zzso zzso carries comparable density of randomly distributed zzso zzso with no evidence of zzso
