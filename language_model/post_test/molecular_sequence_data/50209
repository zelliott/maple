The products of three human zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were produced in insect cells using the zzso expression system and zzso to near zzso In this system we observed that the DNA binding forms of the three proteins are not zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in insect cells, while zzso zzso is zzso The three zzso proteins bind to a DNA sequence known to be a target site for zzso protein with a very similar affinity zzso zzso 1-2 zzso zzso zzso We then measured their binding properties to four human sequences present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two of these sequences have been reported to be binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso behaved quite differently, showing low affinity for promoters of genes located upstream from their own gene in the zzso clusters and a higher affinity for regulatory sequences of their own gene and downstream zzso zzso
