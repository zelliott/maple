Comparative analysis of the domain zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso analysis, revealed a fundamental split among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Group I, which includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are characterized by three distinct zzso namely a zzso Barrel zzso zzso domain in the beta zzso a zzso module zzso 1 domain in the zzso zzso and a distinct zzso module in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of remaining bacteria, which comprise Group II, lack these zzso although some additional inserted zzso are present in individual zzso The separation of bacteria into Group I and Group II is generally compatible with the zzso of zzso trees of the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins and might represent the primary zzso in bacterial zzso A striking zzso from this evolutionary pattern is zzso whose zzso zzso cluster within Group I, whereas zzso analysis of zzso proteins identifies zzso as grouping with zzso another bacterial zzso belonging to Group zzso The zzso evolutionary scenario for the zzso zzso includes domain zzso and zzso with some likely horizontal transfer zzso Although evolution of bacterial zzso appeared to be generally dominated by vertical zzso horizontal transfer of complete genes for all or some of the zzso resulting in displacement of the ancestral zzso might have played a role in several zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso
