zzso zzso is an important source of energy for skeletal zzso Human genetic disorders primarily affecting skeletal muscle zzso turnover are zzso but zzso We previously reported that a zzso stop zzso in zzso the gene zzso zzso a key regulator of muscle zzso zzso was present in zzso of participants from a population of white individuals in the zzso However, the functional implications of the zzso were not zzso The objective of this study was to zzso the molecular and zzso consequences of this genetic zzso 

In this study we found a similar prevalence of the zzso in an independent UK white population of zzso participants zzso and, using in zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso studies, demonstrate that human carriers zzso zzso 6) of the zzso have low zzso zzso lower, p zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso Mice engineered to express the equivalent zzso had similarly decreased muscle zzso levels zzso lower in zzso zzso mice, p zzso zzso In muscle tissue from these mice, failure of the truncated zzso to bind zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso and increased zzso zzso activity states, which account for the decreased zzso zzso 

Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is, to our knowledge, the first prevalent zzso described that directly zzso zzso synthesis and decreases zzso levels in human skeletal zzso The fact that it is present in approximately 1 in 70 UK whites increases the potential biomedical relevance of these zzso
