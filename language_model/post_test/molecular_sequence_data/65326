A novel organic zzso zzso selectively expressed at the zzso barrier zzso originally designated zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso and now classified as zzso has been cloned from a zzso zzso program as a partial zzso this study describes the cloning and expression of the full-length zzso from a rat brain zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed the selective expression of the zzso at the zzso and the zzso was expressed after permanent zzso of human zzso cells with zzso zzso either the full length or open reading frame zzso The full-length zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso was highly expressed at the rat brain zzso but not in zzso liver, heart, or zzso or in zzso cells or brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 expression in zzso cells was poor after the zzso of the full-length zzso whereas zzso expression in zzso cells was high after zzso of the open reading zzso The zzso showed zzso kinetic properties in comparison of the influx and zzso of model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the influx of zzso but zzso did not inhibit zzso influx, and zzso only zzso inhibited the influx of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 is a novel organic zzso zzso that is a zzso zzso that may participate in the active zzso of zzso and steroid zzso at the zzso
