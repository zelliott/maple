In zzso T cells develop along two discrete pathways characterized by expression of either the zzso or the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and dog display a low peripheral blood zzso T cell percentage, while sheep accounts for a high proportion of zzso T zzso In all these species, the zzso organization of the T cell zzso gamma zzso locus is well zzso To gain further insight into the evolutionary significance of the zzso T cell zzso the present study has defined the zzso organization of the zzso locus in rabbit zzso zzso another zzso zzso high species, as deduced from the zzso zzso The rabbit zzso locus spans about 70 zzso and consists of ten zzso two zzso zzso and one zzso gene located zzso to 3' in the zzso When we compared the rabbit sequence with the human, zzso zzso and dog counterparts, a higher identity with human as well as sheep with respect to mouse and dog was zzso providing that in the different zzso species, the zzso locus appears to have evolved independently without any correlation with the zzso zzso The complete sequence of the rabbit zzso locus described here provides also a resource for supporting functional studies especially in the context of the zzso T cell zzso
