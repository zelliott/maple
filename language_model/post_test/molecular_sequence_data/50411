zzso is the major component of the eye lens in several Australian zzso The complete sequence of zzso zzso has now been obtained by zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shows similarity with zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso plasmids of zzso zzso Until now, neither zzso zzso nor any structurally related zzso have been observed in zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso shows that zzso is expressed at high abundance in zzso but outside the lens zzso is zzso expressed in neural zzso zzso and zzso An almost full-length zzso for zzso was cloned from human zzso In human zzso zzso zzso is present in neural zzso muscle, and zzso This pattern of expression and relationship to an zzso involved in unusual zzso acid metabolism suggests the interesting possibility that zzso zzso could be zzso participating in processes such as zzso or the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso
