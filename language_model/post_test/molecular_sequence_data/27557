zzso zzso zzso respond to mechanical overload by an zzso zzso growth combined with zzso of zzso which zzso their mechanical zzso zzso zzso is associated with mechanical zzso induction of zzso factors such as zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso critical for vascular development and zzso Here we have demonstrated that mechanical zzso induction of the zzso gene involves signaling zzso through zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling controls serum response factor zzso activity via zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a single zzso box sequence within the zzso zzso Such activity was abolished in mechanically zzso mouse zzso cells or upon zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso either zzso or by zzso Mechanical strain induced zzso zzso of zzso 3 and 4 at the zzso site and within the zzso gene coding zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso activity and its recruitment to the zzso complex, whereas enforced induction of zzso by upstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced both zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso Similarly, mechanical zzso zzso gene expression in zzso was associated with nuclear zzso of zzso and enrichment of the zzso promoter with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso provides a novel connection between mechanical stimuli and zzso gene zzso
