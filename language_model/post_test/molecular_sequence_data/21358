zzso a zzso containing two zzso zzso is enriched on tumor cell surfaces and stimulates zzso zzso zzso production by adjacent zzso zzso Its first zzso domain zzso contains the biologically active zzso The dependence of zzso activity on zzso is zzso We investigated whether synthetic zzso with the shortest sugar is functionally zzso 

The whole zzso peptides carrying sugar zzso a zzso unit or zzso core zzso were zzso by the zzso method and added to zzso to examine whether they stimulate zzso zzso 

zzso carrying a zzso unit, zzso 2, but not zzso without a zzso unit or the zzso unit alone, zzso zzso zzso production by zzso zzso with longer zzso units, zzso also zzso zzso production, but the extent of its stimulation was lower than that of zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso can mimic zzso activity when zzso with zzso the zzso with which zzso zzso
