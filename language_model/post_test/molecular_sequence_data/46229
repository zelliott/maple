Nuclear zzso zzso 4, group A, member 1 zzso other zzso zzso is an zzso gene that encodes an orphan nuclear zzso which play a potential role in the zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso covered the complete coding region zzso and its unique zzso sequences of zzso zzso gene was zzso The reverse zzso chain reaction zzso indicated that zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso heart but at very low level in zzso and not expressed in other zzso Compared the sequence of zzso and its unique zzso of Large White and zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso 5 was found and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso Association of the zzso and litter size was assessed in two populations zzso Large White and an experimental synthetic Line zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that, in the first parity, AG animals in experimental synthetic Line zzso zzso had zzso more zzso born compared to the zzso animals zzso For all zzso in the zzso Large White zzso those with the zzso zzso had an additional zzso zzso born and zzso zzso born alive compared to the AA animals zzso those with the AG zzso had additional zzso zzso born compared to the AA animals zzso In addition, significant additive effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso born and zzso born alive were detected in the zzso Large White lines zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was significantly associated with litter size in two populations and could be a useful molecular marker in selection for increasing litter size in zzso
