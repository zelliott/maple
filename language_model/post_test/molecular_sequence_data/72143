zzso zzso zzso type zzso has become an important emerging zzso zzso of this zzso type often possess resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso has accumulated resistance genes is of interest, since these genes interfere with treatment of zzso infections and might be zzso transferred to other bacteria, even to unrelated zzso Previously, several laboratories have shown that the zzso resistance genes of zzso are zzso zzso and involve zzso The zzso resistance genes zzso the zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso These genes are grouped within two district zzso and intervening zzso zzso This sequence is potentially useful for detection of zzso zzso
