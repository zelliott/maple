The zzso 28 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso execute two zzso zzso and interaction with the negative regulatory zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that these two functions are zzso by single zzso acid changes within this zzso We determined the sequences of four zzso and characterized the abilities of the zzso zzso proteins to activate zzso of the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso can be compensated by a specific zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso These results support the idea that while the zzso zzso function zzso at least minor zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso function is highly zzso and sensitive even to single zzso acid zzso They also argue that the zzso zzso affect the affinity of zzso for zzso and not the ability of zzso to bind zzso
