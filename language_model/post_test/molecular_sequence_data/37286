The zzso member zzso is a potent zzso growth zzso protein in zzso and may play a role in the restriction of zzso zzso after injury and of structural plasticity in the zzso of higher zzso Of the three major zzso of zzso zzso is mostly expressed in the brain, zzso is found in a ubiquitous pattern, and zzso is most highly expressed in zzso Seven additional zzso derived both from differential zzso and differential promoter usage have been zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso promoter zzso shows that zzso zzso and a zzso within the first zzso upstream of the zzso start are responsible for its zzso No major differences in the zzso status of the zzso zzso in zzso expressing or not expressing zzso could be zzso suggesting that zzso elements are involved in the zzso The specific expression pattern of zzso is due to differential zzso The zzso zzso promoter zzso is regulated by a zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso a negative control zzso These data may help to identify factors that can zzso zzso transcription, thus offering an alternative approach for zzso zzso
