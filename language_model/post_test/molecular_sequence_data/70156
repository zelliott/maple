It has been suggested that three distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso determine the three zzso of mouse zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report the putative zzso acid sequence of the zzso common to all forms of zzso the Alpha zzso and the partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso These sequences have little in common, supporting the notion of at least two distinct genes coding for the zzso of the most common form of zzso zzso the zzso zzso A search of zzso showed that these sequences have not been reported zzso The zzso zzso shows significant zzso with zzso a member of the zzso zzso but not enough zzso to assign it to the zzso No zzso exists between zzso zzso and members of the zzso carrier family of proteins nor does zzso show zzso with other zzso zzso Particularly interesting is the observation that there is no relationship to rat zzso steroid binding protein zzso given the similarities in protein zzso structure, the numbers of zzso and their zzso and the earlier observation of zzso zzso material in mouse zzso
