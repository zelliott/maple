Many zzso bacteria have evolved specialized adaptations for life at cold temperatures and high zzso A locus required for both zzso and zzso in the zzso moderate zzso zzso species strain zzso was identified among zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of this locus identified four complete open reading frames zzso which appear to comprise an zzso and a fifth incomplete zzso All zzso insertions isolated are in zzso zzso sequence similarity exists between the translation products of zzso 1-3 and a collection of gene products proposed to include alternative zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso of zzso activity involved in zzso sensing and zzso Based on the similarity between zzso and zzso coli zzso we have tentatively designated this locus the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus zzso zzso zzso showed altered zzso of numerous outer membrane proteins and were both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that displayed enhanced zzso growth also displayed zzso enhanced zzso zzso Most of these zzso possessed DNA zzso at the site of the zzso zzso further demonstrating the importance of the zzso locus to zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso functions in zzso synthesis regulation while zzso is required for zzso and zzso
