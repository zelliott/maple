The zzso scorpion fold consisting of a short zzso and zzso is a structural motif common to scorpion zzso insect zzso and plant zzso that invariably contains three zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the scorpion toxin zzso zzso chemically zzso by inserting two zzso acids in place of the two zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso This zzso is one of the two zzso which connect the zzso to the zzso The solution structure of zzso was determined at pH zzso and 5 degrees C using zzso zzso and simulated zzso from zzso distance and 46 zzso angle zzso The zzso structure of zzso is zzso as judged from the low value of the averaged backbone zzso zzso between the 30 lowest energy structures and the zzso mean structure zzso zzso zzso A for the entire sequence and zzso A for the segment zzso Analysis and comparison of the solution structures of zzso and zzso lead to the following zzso zzso the fold of zzso is similar to that of zzso as indicated by the low value of the averaged backbone atomic zzso zzso between the 10 lowest energy solution structures of the two proteins zzso zzso zzso the packing of the zzso core is zzso underlying the critical structural role of the zzso interactions even for such a small and zzso protein as zzso
