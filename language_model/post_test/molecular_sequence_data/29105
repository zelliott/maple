The zzso zzso juvenile zzso is caused by the zzso of the gene zzso a novel protein called zzso It has been reported that zzso is expressed in the central nervous system and functions as a zzso zzso zzso which suppresses zzso cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus far, however, it remains unknown if zzso is expressed and functions in the peripheral nervous zzso In order to begin to address to this question, we investigated the expression of zzso in bovine peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of zzso transcript in bovine peripheral zzso The obtained bovine zzso zzso sequence was identical to that of human except a single zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the expression of zzso protein in bovine peripheral zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the zzso of zzso in the zzso of zzso nerve zzso the zzso cell zzso and the zzso cell outer zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis indicated the presence of two zzso of zzso in bovine peripheral zzso the zzso fraction and the cell zzso zzso All together, these results point to diverse roles of zzso in not only the central but also the peripheral nervous zzso
