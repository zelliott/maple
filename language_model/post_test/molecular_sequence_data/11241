A synthetic zzso protein gene was expressed in plants and reduced zzso leakage from the leaves at freezing zzso The synthetic zzso was expressed as a fusion to a signal zzso directing it to the zzso space where ice zzso first zzso The gene was introduced to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso screening and expression of the introduced protein was verified by zzso zzso analysis of transgenic plant leaves established a correlation between the level of transgenic protein expression and degree of tolerance to zzso This is the first identification of a zzso associated with zzso protein expression in plant zzso
