The zzso of a synthetic zzso of 46 zzso from zzso was investigated by fluorescence, CD, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is mainly zzso in water but zzso in zzso or zzso zzso although the zzso only associates with zzso at approximately the critical zzso zzso zzso structures of zzso were determined by distance geometry calculations based on 450 (in zzso or zzso (in zzso zzso distance zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso the two zzso regions zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A in zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso was found, suggesting that zzso interactions between the two zzso zzso in zzso are zzso Similar average, curved zzso structures were found in both zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso occupying the zzso face, indicating that zzso interactions zzso zzso zzso experiments, performed in the presence of 50% zzso zzso confirm that the two zzso zzso and zzso in the hinge all interact with the zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso binding is supported by zzso zzso as zzso On the basis of all the data above, we propose a model for the zzso complexes wherein the curved zzso zzso structural motif zzso the zzso The zzso signal assignment achieved for zzso zzso and zzso suggests that such a structural motif is retained in the longer zzso and most likely in the intact zzso
