We present a case report of novel zzso of zzso and zzso identified in a patient who experienced adverse effects during zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed that the patient was most likely an intermediate zzso zzso to the presence of a novel zzso zzso which gives rise to a premature stop zzso in zzso zzso Because defects in zzso may also be important, we zzso the promoter region and all zzso of zzso and identified a cluster of three novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso around zzso 1, as well as the more common zzso zzso The presence of multiple genetic zzso in zzso implies that this patient is potentially a zzso poor zzso and this was confirmed by zzso zzso Combined impairment of zzso and zzso activities, we believe, may have contributed to the development of the observed drug responses in the present zzso
