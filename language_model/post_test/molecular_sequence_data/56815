zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso synthesis with zzso and zzso acid zzso as zzso zzso zzso synthesis was observed only for zzso zzso acid zzso The rate of zzso zzso measured by zzso was in the decreasing order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala, which is consistent with the decreasing order of zzso rates of the corresponding zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso zzso permits the synthesis of zzso peptides with zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the rates of synthesis for other zzso zzso acid zzso are higher with zzso than with zzso
