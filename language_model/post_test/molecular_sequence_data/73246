We previously identified a 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in brain zzso from several zzso Here the zzso sequence of zzso was obtained by zzso using zzso zzso derived from zzso sequences of zzso fragments of the zzso protein and by subsequent screening of a pig brain zzso zzso The derived zzso sequence of 374 zzso acids for zzso zzso is 45 zzso acids shorter at the zzso than zzso from rat zzso zzso and has a calculated molecular mass of 43 zzso From the zzso binding activity present in brain tissue zzso about zzso is found in the zzso fraction and zzso associated with zzso Both activities are due to zzso since zzso a zzso zzso recognizing specifically zzso labels the zzso zzso protein in zzso and in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso both the membrane protein and the zzso protein of 42 zzso zzso the zzso binding activity released by high salt or by alkaline extraction from zzso is identified zzso as the 42 zzso zzso and zzso the affinity for zzso and specificity for various zzso are similar for the zzso and for the soluble zzso The functional importance of zzso is highlighted by the identical affinity for zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso apparently a peripheral membrane zzso which exists also as a zzso protein can transfer the signals zzso by zzso or by zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
