The zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso gene encodes six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are zzso from alternatively spliced zzso The zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and gamma are integral membrane proteins of the inner nuclear zzso We have zzso the zzso gene structure of the zzso zzso zzso as an attractive lower zzso model zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene without regulatory sequences spans approximately 19 zzso of zzso zzso It contains 15 zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso and omega which are zzso in the inner nuclear zzso By radiation hybrid zzso we have located the gene onto linkage group 4 between zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso The identification of a chicken zzso clone zzso the complete coding region of the avian zzso gene enabled us to compare the zzso gene structure amongst zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the chicken sequences do not zzso for an zzso In parallel we searched for an zzso in birds using zzso and zzso zzso zzso specific for the common evolutionary zzso zzso domain present in all zzso We detected zzso as the zzso zzso but no zzso in zzso of zzso chicken zzso and cultured chicken zzso thus confirming the zzso zzso The comparison of each zzso and chicken zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso of the human zzso gene demonstrates that the degree of identity at the zzso acid level is much higher between the human and chicken than between the human and zzso zzso By zzso search with the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the human zzso we did not find any significant zzso in databases of the zzso and chicken zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a novelty of zzso
