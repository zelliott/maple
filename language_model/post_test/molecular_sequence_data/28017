zzso mapping of the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso has revealed specific molecular interactions which are important for zzso and zzso binding to the zzso Previous zzso zzso experiments have demonstrated that the binding of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso involves an interaction between the zzso group of the zzso and the zzso side chain of zzso in the third zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hill, zzso zzso and Dixon, zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now identified 2 zzso zzso at positions 204 and zzso in the fifth zzso domain of the zzso zzso which are critical for zzso binding and zzso of the zzso These zzso zzso are zzso with zzso receptors which bind zzso zzso but not with receptors whose zzso zzso do not have the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso side chain from either zzso or zzso by substitution of the zzso zzso with an zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso at the zzso The effects of these zzso on zzso activity are zzso selectively by the removal of the zzso zzso zzso from the aromatic ring of the zzso The data suggest that the interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso involves two hydrogen bonds, one between the zzso side chain of zzso and the zzso group of the zzso and a second between the zzso side chain of zzso and the zzso group of the zzso
