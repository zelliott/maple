To develop an oral vaccine against zzso zzso infection, we have expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the outer membrane protein zzso zzso zzso in a live delivery vehicle zzso zzso The zzso gene was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso isolated from Korean zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso has zzso and zzso identity with individual zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso fusion zzso produced using the zzso coli expression system, was used to raise a rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was cloned in the zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso and transformed into zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso protein was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso with a maximum level at the log phase without zzso zzso The oral administration of the zzso into mice resulted in the generation of the zzso zzso in serum in two out of five zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso which expresses zzso may be zzso as an oral vaccine to induce protective immunity against zzso zzso
