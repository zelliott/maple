zzso division is produced by the formation of a zzso complex in the middle of the cell, called the zzso formed by more than 10 zzso This process can be divided into two steps, in which the first is the zzso of zzso to form the Z ring in the zzso and then the sequential addition of zzso to anchor the ring at the zzso zzso a stage completed by zzso and zzso In the second step, the formation of the zzso synthesis machinery in the zzso takes place, followed by cell zzso The proteins involved in connecting both steps in cell division are zzso zzso and zzso and their interaction is a crucial and zzso event in the division of different zzso These components are small zzso membrane zzso and their specific function seems to be mainly zzso The purpose of this study was to obtain a structural model of the zzso part of the zzso complex, using zzso tools and experimental data reported in the zzso 

Two zzso models for the zzso region of the zzso zzso coli complex were obtained from zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso based on sequence information and several zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso was added to this complex, through zzso zzso Two final zzso models, one zzso and one zzso were zzso The nature of the zzso contacts was energetically zzso in both models and the overall structures were in agreement with the experimental evidence zzso 

The two models obtained for the zzso complex were stable and thus compatible with the in zzso zzso complex zzso Although the zzso model zzso has features that indicate that this is the most plausible structure, the zzso complex zzso cannot be zzso Both models could be further stabilized by the binding of the other proteins of the zzso The zzso zzso of this kind of protein complex, whose function is mainly zzso provide useful zzso Experimental results should confirm or reject these models and provide new data for future zzso studies to refine the zzso
