zzso is a temperate zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain after zzso C zzso In this work, the gene coding for a zzso protein of this zzso was cloned using a library of zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso activity was detected by its zzso using whole cells of the sensitive strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso The zzso gene was within a zzso DNA zzso of zzso containing six open reading frames zzso and two truncated zzso No sequence zzso with zzso genes was found within the cloned zzso An zzso gene was also present in the fragment, but it was transcribed in a direction opposite that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was verified by zzso amplification from the total zzso DNA and zzso The zzso gene is a zzso sequence zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso whose product had a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso Comparisons with sequences in sequence databases showed zzso with numerous zzso of other zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso and by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso the zzso protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 40 zzso The zzso sequence of the protein confirmed the start zzso zzso of cell walls of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso produced demonstrated that zzso has zzso zzso zzso the zzso exhibited a broad spectrum of zzso activity, as it was active on different species, mainly zzso zzso but also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
