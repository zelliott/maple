The small zzso protein gene zzso is a marker whose expression is frequently associated with zzso cell zzso We observed that the expression of the zzso gene is strongly induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the time course result and the nuclear zzso zzso zzso suggested that the regulation of zzso expression by zzso is controlled at the zzso zzso To understand the nature of this regulation, human zzso clones of the zzso gene were zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the human zzso gene contains two zzso and a single zzso located within the zzso zzso An zzso binding site zzso is found at zzso and a putative zzso zzso element zzso at zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso start zzso A zzso construct containing the zzso region of the zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene was used to zzso zzso cells or monkey primary zzso zzso The zzso activity in zzso cells is zzso zzso by zzso and the stimulation is inhibited by a protein zzso C inhibitor or by zzso cells with zzso to zzso the protein zzso C zzso The zzso activity is also zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso A zzso The zzso by zzso and zzso are zzso These results suggest that protein zzso C and probably protein zzso A play important roles in regulating the zzso of the zzso zzso
