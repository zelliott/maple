Comparisons of the zzso zzso zzso in human, mouse and rat revealed remarkable zzso For example, the mouse and the rat lack the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso 2 zzso In contrast, the zzso region between zzso and zzso is devoid of genes and spans only zzso zzso in humans, but encompasses 23 zzso genes spanning 290 zzso in the zzso To further zzso the evolution of zzso zzso zzso we investigated the structure and organization of these genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a New World zzso We conclude that this species has no zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso gene is a zzso as it contains several zzso that zzso formation of a functional zzso zzso The expression of this gene was probably silenced by a zzso deletion observed in an zzso response element in the upstream promoter zzso zzso the deleted base pairs in zzso with zzso from the human counterpart dramatically restored the zzso activity to a level that even surpassed that of the human zzso We also determined the zzso sequence of zzso and the zzso region between this gene and zzso in the zzso zzso The region between zzso and zzso is zzso between the zzso zzso and humans, and there are no signs of the extension seen in the zzso zzso appeared to be functional, thus, we predict that it generates a zzso with specificity similar to that of the human zzso
