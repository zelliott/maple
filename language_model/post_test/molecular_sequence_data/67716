Since the zzso therapy zzso was introduced to patients infected by human zzso virus zzso the zzso related mortality and morbidity have been significantly zzso The major obstacle for long-term successful zzso treatment is the emergence of drug resistant zzso Current data of drug resistance was mainly obtained on zzso zzso B but rarely on non-B virus, even more rare with newly emerged circulating zzso forms zzso The lack of such data limits the rational management of ART for the increasing number of patients infected by zzso B zzso In this study, a zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso patient and its zzso was zzso and deposited in zzso zzso Potential drug resistant zzso of this zzso virus strain were selected in zzso cultures in the presence of zzso zzso which is the most frequently used zzso drug in zzso Four combination profiles of zzso were identified in the zzso zzso which were initiated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and followed by more than two other zzso at the end of the selections, zzso A total of seven previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and seven novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the reverse zzso gene were found in these zzso zzso zzso analysis in the zzso zzso showed that all the zzso except zzso contribute to zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso reduce zzso zzso for more than zzso while the other zzso cause less than 20 folds drug zzso Although the information obtained in this in zzso selection study may not fully cover resistant zzso which will actually occur in patients, it has still provided useful information for rational management of ART in patients infected with zzso zzso zzso
