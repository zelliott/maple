zzso outbreaks of zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to occur by transmission of zzso between patients, predicting that infection control interventions will limit zzso Despite zzso of such strategies, the zzso of zzso infections continues to zzso We aimed to use zzso to better understand the epidemiology of zzso zzso within a large hospital and investigate the reasons for failure of infection control zzso zzso sequencing was performed on 61 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predominately from blood cultures collected at a single hospital between 1998 and 2009, and on five zzso zzso zzso bacteria isolated from human zzso zzso analysis and precise mapping of the zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso showed that at least 18 of the 36 zzso zzso had acquired the zzso via independent zzso events, indicating de zzso generation of zzso rather than zzso Furthermore, zzso sequences found in 15 of the 36 zzso zzso were the same as the zzso sequence from one of the gut zzso National and international zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso from our hospital, suggesting that our findings might be globally zzso These data demonstrate that zzso generation within a patient is common, presumably occurring in the human zzso during zzso therapy, and help explain our inability to reduce zzso zzso A recommendation from our findings is that infection control practices should include screening patients for specific hospital clones of zzso zzso zzso rather than just zzso 

zzso zzso is an increasingly important human pathogen causing predominantly zzso infections in hospitalized zzso Large amounts of health care funding are spent trying to control zzso bacteria in hospitals globally, yet in many institutions around the world, zzso zzso zzso zzso infections continue to zzso The new findings from this study help explain the failures of our current approaches to controlling zzso zzso in health care zzso Given the importance of this zzso as a cause of zzso infections and the difficulties faced by infection control units in trying to prevent colonization in their institutions, the novel findings from this study provide evidence that a new approach to controlling zzso in hospitals is zzso In particular, more attention should be given to understanding the epidemiology of zzso zzso zzso zzso and patients at higher risk for de zzso generation of zzso need to be identified and zzso zzso
