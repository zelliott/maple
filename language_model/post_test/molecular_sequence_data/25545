Two zzso raised against the zzso core protein of a membrane zzso zzso zzso from human lung zzso also recognize a zzso zzso which accumulates in the culture medium of the zzso zzso studies suggest that the zzso zzso forms act as precursors for the zzso zzso zzso The core proteins of the zzso zzso are slightly smaller than those of the zzso zzso species, but the zzso zzso acid sequences of both forms are zzso The characterization of human lung zzso zzso that zzso the message for these core proteins and the effect of bacterial zzso zzso C suggest that the zzso zzso is zzso through a zzso zzso These data identify a novel membrane zzso in human lung zzso and imply that the shedding of this zzso may be related to the presence of the zzso zzso
