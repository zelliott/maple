The dynamics of several peptides in zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso have been investigated on both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso and the relative rates of zzso relaxation of zzso zzso and zzso on both zzso and C4 zzso were monitored by examining changes in the experimental zzso of these peptides as a function of temperature and column residence time under linear zzso zzso zzso zzso The observed zzso trends were correlated with previously derived retention parameters and zzso zzso of the association process determined for zzso zzso zzso and a control zzso zzso This study confirms that bandwidth zzso can be used as an integral experimental component to study the effect of the secondary structure of zzso zzso on their zzso retention zzso Further, the data demonstrate the utility of zzso as a tool to examine zzso zzso dynamics at zzso zzso The relevance of these results to the general phenomenon of zzso interactions is discussed in terms of the associated evidence for zzso changes in the zzso of these three zzso zzso
