The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rich source of zzso zzso enabling its growth on several zzso and zzso We report here the zzso and the characterization of a zzso from this source, the cloning of its zzso and the expression and the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso the gene for zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso family 42 zzso and it is flanked by a putative zzso regulator, however, the two genes were transcribed zzso The zzso zzso was characterized in detail revealing that it is zzso active and stable at 65 degrees zzso zzso is very specific for zzso with an zzso zzso at their zzso end, with zzso values of zzso zzso and 332 zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the latter as the zzso of the reaction and gave experimental evidence, for the first time in zzso of the role of zzso as the zzso of the zzso zzso
