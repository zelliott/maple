zzso and zzso are two novel zzso proteins isolated in zzso zzso They share zzso identity, except for an additional zzso domain of zzso of 182 zzso acids in zzso Both proteins are found in zzso but similarity to other zzso proteins could not be zzso zzso and zzso are expressed at similar level in zzso and zzso forms, although the relative level of expression of zzso is 11 times zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as it is found predominantly at 110 zzso compared with the predicted 86 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that both proteins accumulated in the zzso of zzso zzso This was confirmed by the zzso of an zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is cell zzso because it zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso progression in both life stages as depleted cells are enriched in the zzso zzso In zzso cells, a reduced growth rate is accompanied by an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso The zzso cells are blocked in late zzso as zzso segregation is zzso zzso depletion in zzso form caused a drastic growth zzso producing cells bearing two zzso and an enlarged nucleus zzso followed by an zzso of zzso cells with connected zzso and zzso zzso These studies of zzso provide a more comprehensive account of proteins involved in zzso events in zzso and should lead to the identification of partners with similar zzso
