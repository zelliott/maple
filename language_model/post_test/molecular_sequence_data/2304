The zzso zzso virus zzso gene product zzso activates the zzso of viral early and late zzso We characterized the DNA sequence elements of the early zzso D zzso gene that play a role in the response to zzso in zzso Using gel mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso we identified three zzso sites, two zzso to the zzso start site and a third within the coding zzso Site II, which gave a footprint between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start site, was previously identified by zzso and Wilcox and contained the reported consensus zzso zzso Site III, which was located between zzso zzso and zzso was very similar to the site II zzso including a core consensus binding zzso zzso The site I sequence zzso zzso to zzso however, did not share significant zzso with either site II or site zzso In zzso zzso experiments from zzso zzso of the zzso promoter indicated that all three zzso sites contribute to the stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso I zzso of the zzso promoter with zzso nuclear extracts of zzso cells showed protection of two very zzso sequences between zzso zzso and zzso We propose that optimal zzso of the zzso gene depends on the interaction of zzso with multiple binding sites across the gene and cellular factors that recognize specific sequence elements in the zzso
