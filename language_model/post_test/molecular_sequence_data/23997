Previous zzso structural analysis of zzso zzso zzso predicted that the high flexibility of zzso zzso the region that contains a zzso zzso motif and forms one wall of the zzso site, could be one of the key features contributing to zzso activity toward third-generation zzso To investigate whether this possible flexibility really affects the zzso profile of this zzso two zzso zzso have been produced, zzso and zzso in which the zzso zzso at position zzso was replaced with a zzso and an additional zzso zzso was zzso Our intent was to introduce a zzso bond between the zzso zzso at positions 69 and zzso and thus to lock the position of zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated formation of a new zzso bridge in the zzso zzso although zzso bond formation was not confirmed in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the activity of the zzso zzso decreased drastically against third-generation zzso while its zzso efficiency against zzso and first-generation zzso was almost identical to that of the zzso zzso This result was consistent with the prediction that flexibility in zzso B3 was critical for activity against third-generation zzso in zzso Furthermore, we have determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso to analyze the structural changes in zzso The structural model clearly shows the introduction of a new zzso bridge and that there is no appreciable difference between the overall structures of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso although the introduced zzso bond slightly influenced the positions of zzso on zzso B3 and zzso on the zzso zzso The results of our kinetic and structural analyses suggest that the flexibility of zzso zzso as well as the positions of zzso and the zzso loop, is critical for the zzso specificity expansion of zzso
