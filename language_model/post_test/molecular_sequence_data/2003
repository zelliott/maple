The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso as well as its zzso and 3' zzso regions, were determined by the zzso chain termination zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes zzso zzso The primary and secondary structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso both exhibit typical zzso zzso The sequence appears to be more closely related to zzso zzso of the zzso group than to those of the zzso zzso zzso comparisons generally support this relationship, although there are several examples in which the zzso zzso in particular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso more strongly resemble their counterparts in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso found in most organisms, the three zzso genes from zzso zzso occur in only a single copy per zzso and appear to be physically zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso gene is flanked by putative promoter and zzso sequences that are comparable to the zzso control signals from other zzso zzso The sequence zzso which is very similar to the zzso promoter consensus zzso is located 18 bases before the probable site of zzso zzso zzso There is a potential zzso termination site immediately downstream from the gene that consists of a relatively stable stem and loop structure followed by stretches of zzso
