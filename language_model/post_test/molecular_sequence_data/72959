The zzso sequence of the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso II of zzso zzso was zzso The gene consists of an zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 103 zzso The zzso zzso site was identified by comparison with the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso II zzso from C zzso The zzso gene is located in close vicinity to the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was isolated from zzso DNA of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein could be zzso using a simple zzso zzso The properties of zzso proved to be consistent with those of zzso II zzso from zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that zzso consists of an zzso zzso domain flanked by a domain of 95 zzso acids with unknown function joined to a type III zzso zzso The zzso domain belongs to the recently proposed family L of zzso zzso 48 of zzso zzso
