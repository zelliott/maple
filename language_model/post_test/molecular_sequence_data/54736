zzso proteins are one of the most widely distributed signal zzso proteins in zzso being ubiquitous in bacteria, zzso and zzso They act by zzso interaction to control the activities of a wide range of zzso zzso factors and transport zzso the great majority of which are involved in cellular nitrogen zzso The regulatory activities of zzso proteins are zzso through their ability to bind the key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the molecular basis of these regulatory effects remains zzso Recent advances in the solution of the crystal structures of zzso proteins zzso with some of their target zzso as well as the identification of the zzso and zzso sites, have improved our understanding of their mode of zzso In all of the complex structures solved to date, the flexible zzso of zzso facilitate interaction with the target zzso The zzso molecules appear to play a key role in modulating the zzso of the zzso and thereby regulating the interactions between zzso and its zzso
