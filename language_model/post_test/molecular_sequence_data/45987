Human zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso produced by the zzso zzso cells in the zzso Because zzso activates several factors participating in zzso zzso that may mediate zzso of prostate cancer, zzso of the activity of zzso is a potential way of preventing tumor growth and zzso Furthermore, specific zzso for zzso are potentially useful for targeting and imaging of prostate cancer and for zzso zzso We have used zzso active zzso zzso captured by a zzso zzso exposing the active site of the zzso to screen zzso display zzso zzso Using libraries expressing 10 or 11 zzso acids long linear zzso we identified six different peptides binding to zzso Three of these were shown to be specific and efficient zzso of the zzso activity of zzso toward a zzso zzso Furthermore, the peptides inhibited the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso acid substitution analyses revealed that motifs of six zzso acids were required for the zzso zzso These peptides are potentially useful for treatment and targeting of prostate zzso
