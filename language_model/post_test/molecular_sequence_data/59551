A structural gene of zzso which is a component of the zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso of zzso DNA fragments and a mixture of zzso zzso with the sequence corresponding to that of zzso acids in the zzso zzso analysis of the structural gene of zzso zzso and its promoter region was zzso The data obtained indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso on zzso Four zzso of 67, 39, 16, and 14 zzso were identified using the system of zzso These zzso are specified by a DNA zzso responsible for zzso synthesis and immunity in a producer zzso Apparently, three of these zzso with molecular masses of 67, 39, and 16 zzso are responsible for zzso production and zzso The 67 zzso zzso is involved in the expression of immunity to zzso and, probably, in zzso zzso
