Local populations of zzso zzso diverge genetically with geographical zzso and this has been attributed to restricted transfer of zzso imposed by the zzso spatial distribution of zzso geothermal zzso We tested the zzso of genetic divergence with distance in zzso species by analyzing zzso of zzso zzso drawn from three populations separated by more than zzso In sharp contrast to zzso zzso the geographically diverse zzso zzso zzso proved to be nearly zzso We could not link the difference in zzso conservation between the two species to a corresponding difference in zzso stability or ecological factors affecting zzso zzso The results provide the first evidence that genetic isolation of local populations does not result primarily from properties intrinsic to zzso and the severe zzso of its geothermal habitat, but varies with species, and thus may reflect zzso interactions that act after zzso zzso
