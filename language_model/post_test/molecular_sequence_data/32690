The zzso treatment of saline zzso using zzso and zzso microbial zzso is of major zzso zzso of zzso zzso is known to occur at high salt zzso However, it seems that the suitable adaptation of an zzso sludge makes possible the treatment of saline zzso In this study, a zzso zzso sludge was zzso in two zzso batch zzso operating with a different zzso zzso zzso and zzso and subjected to increasing zzso zzso The performance of the zzso appeared to be highly dependent on the nature of the zzso and a similar level of zzso zzso around zzso of the specific loading rate and specific zzso zzso was stated at 10 g zzso of zzso with zzso zzso and 60 g zzso of zzso with zzso The characterization of the zzso and its adaptation to increasing zzso conditions were also investigated using molecular tools based on the analysis of zzso zzso zzso The microbial communities revealed a high diversity that could be maintained in both zzso despite the increase in zzso zzso
