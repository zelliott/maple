Major zzso from a human oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined to demonstrate their ability to bind to human plasma zzso by zzso zzso Of three main zzso separated on sodium zzso zzso zzso gels zzso zzso and zzso surface zzso proteins and a zzso zzso zzso protein showed the ability to bind to zzso suggesting that zzso on host cells can mediate zzso of zzso zzso by its binding to the surface proteins or the exposed zzso zzso zzso zzso
