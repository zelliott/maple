The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family was discovered through genetic requirements for cell cycle progression in budding zzso In these zzso zzso an zzso core complex, composed of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso scaffold protein and the zzso zzso domain zzso engages one of a suite of zzso zzso called zzso proteins that in turn recruit zzso for zzso by an associated zzso zzso The zzso zzso architecture has diversified through evolution, such that in total many hundreds of distinct zzso and zzso complexes enable degradation of myriad zzso zzso recognition by zzso often depends on zzso modification of the zzso which thus places zzso stability under dynamic regulation by zzso signaling zzso zzso complexes control cell proliferation through degradation of critical regulators such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A plethora of other processes in development and disease are controlled by other zzso complexes, including those based on zzso zzso protein and zzso domain zzso protein zzso Recent structural insights into zzso complexes have begun to illuminate aspects of zzso recognition and zzso reaction zzso
