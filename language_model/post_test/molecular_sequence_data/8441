Class zzso signals play potential roles in B cell zzso and zzso zzso The regions of the class II zzso participating in B cell signaling are incompletely zzso Our prior analysis of structural requirements of the zzso domain of A beta revealed that only the eight zzso zzso are required for zzso Here, we report that the sequence and position of two of these are critical, and present direct evidence that the A beta zzso domain is also involved in zzso via a zzso distinct from the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that specific regions in both the zzso and zzso zzso of the class II zzso have distinct signaling zzso
