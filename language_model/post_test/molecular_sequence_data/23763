zzso play fundamentally important roles in normal physiology and disease zzso zzso for detection of active zzso may greatly aid in the diagnosis of disease zzso and suggest modes of therapeutic zzso Most zzso for zzso potential are limited by a lack of specificity and/or zzso We have developed a zzso activity zzso for members of the zzso zzso zzso family that is specific and can be used to zzso active zzso zzso The zzso has two principal zzso a capture zzso that zzso the zzso without zzso the zzso active site, and a zzso resonance energy transfer zzso for monitoring zzso at low zzso zzso The zzso was standardized for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The efficiency of the zzso was found to be critically dependent upon the quality of the zzso the use of zzso exhibiting high specific activities for the zzso and zzso samples that are zzso The zzso was applied to studies of zzso and induced zzso activity in human melanoma zzso Analysis of several melanoma cell lines, and comparison with prior studies, correlated higher zzso zzso activity with higher levels of the cell surface zzso zzso zzso to two different melanoma cell surface receptors (the zzso zzso or zzso were found to induce different zzso profiles, suggesting that the zzso zzso can zzso melanoma zzso Overall, the zzso zzso activity zzso was found to be valuable for analysis of zzso activity in cellular zzso The zzso zzso is suitably flexible to allow studies of virtually any zzso zzso for which appropriate zzso and zzso are zzso
