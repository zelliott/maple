zzso of autonomous cellular zzso is an essential aspect of zzso clock function but little is known about its circuit zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso lateral zzso subset zzso of zzso clock zzso zzso zzso rhythms of locomotor zzso The hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso in downstream clock zzso was tested by rendering the zzso zzso via transgenic expression of a low zzso threshold zzso sodium zzso When the zzso are made zzso zzso behavioral rhythms decompose into multiple independent superimposed zzso and the clock protein zzso in the zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso of clock zzso are zzso Thus, regulated electrical activity of the zzso zzso multiple zzso in the fly zzso zzso zzso
