The zzso acid sequences of various zzso zzso have been subjected to zzso cluster zzso A domain of approximately 145 zzso was found to be zzso zzso in zzso A and B from the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso from cucumber zzso zzso and in the zzso H of zzso zzso A prediction of the putative active site region was made upon analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of primary structure zzso a zzso into families of structurally related proteins is proposed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
