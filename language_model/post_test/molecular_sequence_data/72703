DNA replication in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is tightly linked to its zzso cell zzso The initiation of zzso replication occurs zzso with the transition of the zzso zzso cell to the zzso stalked zzso To identify the signals responsible for the cell cycle control of DNA replication zzso we have characterized a region of the zzso zzso zzso containing genes that are all involved in DNA replication or zzso including zzso zzso and zzso The essential zzso gene encodes a zzso of the zzso coli beta zzso of DNA zzso zzso It is transcribed from three zzso one is heat zzso and the other two are induced at the transition from zzso to stalked cell, zzso with the initiation of DNA zzso The single zzso promoter is induced at the same time point in the cell zzso These zzso as well as those for several other genes zzso DNA replication proteins that are induced at the same time in the cell cycle, share two sequence zzso suggesting that they represent a family whose zzso is zzso zzso
