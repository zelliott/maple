Like other bacteria, zzso zzso possesses a family of zzso small zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso identity zzso that are strongly induced in response to cold zzso We show that deletion of zzso or zzso genes did not result in a zzso zzso in contrast, zzso double zzso exhibited severe reduction in cellular growth at 15 degrees C as well as at 37 degrees C, including impairment of survival during the stationary zzso zzso gel analysis showed that protein synthesis was zzso in zzso double zzso and that the loss of one or two zzso led to an increase in the synthesis of the remaining zzso at 37 degrees C and after cold zzso suggesting that zzso zzso production of members from this protein zzso A zzso triple zzso zzso could only be generated in the presence of zzso in trans on a zzso that was not lost, in spite of lack of zzso pressure, indicating that a minimum of one zzso gene is essential for viability of zzso zzso After cold zzso synthesis of zzso in zzso was drastically lower than in zzso cells accompanied by zzso in growth and strong reduction in general protein zzso As zzso zzso and zzso are shown to bind to zzso in a zzso and interactive manner, zzso are suggested to function as zzso zzso zzso the initiation of translation under optimal and low zzso
