zzso zzso and other zzso bearing zzso with the terminal sequence zzso zzso are rapidly removed from the circulation by an zzso zzso zzso expressed at the surface of zzso zzso zzso The zzso isolated from rat liver is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from rat lung both zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso isolated from these zzso nonetheless differ in their ability to bind zzso bearing terminal zzso or zzso In this paper, we have explored the structural relationship between the zzso and the zzso by examining the properties of the zzso zzso in the form of a zzso protein and a soluble zzso fusion protein in which the zzso and zzso zzso have been replaced by the zzso region of human zzso Like the zzso isolated from liver, the zzso fusion protein is able to bind zzso terminating with zzso and Man at independent zzso When expressed in zzso cells the zzso zzso is able to mediate the zzso of zzso bearing either terminal zzso or terminal zzso We propose that the zzso be renamed the zzso zzso on the basis of its multiple and independent zzso
