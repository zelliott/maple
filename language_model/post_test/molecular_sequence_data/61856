zzso which recognize the two zzso zzso zzso zzso a membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso play important roles by zzso external zzso which lead to zzso cell death or zzso zzso a zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso The recently described zzso zzso of similar molecular mass which is zzso identical and zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso is expressed rather zzso in many zzso Here, zzso the gene structure for both zzso we found the human gene for zzso zzso located on zzso 17, position zzso near to the zzso zzso and human zzso on zzso 7, position zzso The two zzso which both have 11 zzso and zzso zzso zzso seem to result from gene zzso Furthermore, we studied binding of the two second zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of the two zzso Using zzso zzso we expressed zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso the proteins to zzso zzso zzso zzso bound both zzso and zzso equally well in zzso Furthermore, fusion proteins of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, with the green fluorescent protein zzso were expressed in zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which was distributed throughout the cell, zzso zzso was concentrated at the plasma membrane already in zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso was released from the membrane upon addition of zzso which zzso zzso zzso however, zzso to plasma membrane upon growth factor zzso Thus, in spite of the high zzso between zzso zzso and zzso and comparable affinities for zzso and zzso both proteins showed clear differences in zzso zzso We suggest a model, which is based on the difference in zzso binding zzso of the two zzso to account for the difference in zzso zzso
