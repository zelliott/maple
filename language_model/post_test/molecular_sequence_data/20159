Two genes zzso zzso carrier zzso like proteins are identified from fourth zzso zzso of the yellow fever zzso Aedes zzso The predicted zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are small, zzso and lacking the zzso targeting sequence at the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to cholesterol with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso The zzso values of zzso and zzso to zzso acid are zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso Both genes are expressed predominantly in gut zzso The transcripts of the zzso gene are only detected in zzso zzso whereas zzso is expressed in zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso increases within 5 h after a zzso and stays at high levels during zzso In in zzso zzso gut tissue cultures, zzso transcripts were increased in the presence of juvenile hormone III, whereas zzso zzso levels increased in the presence zzso The results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso genes are regulated differently through the zzso life zzso
