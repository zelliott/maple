zzso comprise a substantial proportion of green plant zzso However, zzso relationships and zzso of the classes zzso zzso and zzso have been problematic to zzso Some analyses support a sister relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso potentially altering the zzso of two classes, also supported by a shared fragmentation in the zzso gene zzso We sought to determine whether the latter is a zzso or whether the supporting analyses are vulnerable to systematic zzso 

We zzso a portion of zzso spanning the fragmented region in strains for which it had not previously been zzso four zzso six zzso zzso group zzso and zzso and one zzso We then explored the effect of zzso proteins and zzso on zzso reconstruction from a data set of 41 zzso zzso 

None of the zzso or zzso strains possessed the split in zzso including zzso near relatives of zzso but it was found in all zzso zzso We reconstructed alternative zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso using two different protein groups zzso and zzso both subject to zzso zzso A zzso region of zzso remained suitable for analysis of more recent zzso 

The zzso sequences can explain earlier findings linking zzso with the zzso and should be excluded from zzso analyses attempting to resolve deep zzso because their expansion violates the assumptions of substitution zzso We zzso that zzso is a zzso and that fragmentation of zzso has occurred at least twice in zzso zzso
