Five zzso zzso zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in leaf zzso were zzso zzso zzso acid sequences revealed that zzso in zzso contained the zzso targeting signal to zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the zzso with the longest insert contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso which zzso a zzso with zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso A Southern zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso zzso like that of the pumpkin zzso zzso exists as a single zzso Two kinds of pumpkin zzso zzso might be produced from a single gene by alternative zzso but the structure of the zzso DNA indicated that the zzso zzso gene did not undergo alternative zzso We detected a zzso with a molecular mass of 42 zzso in green leaves of zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso protein was exclusively localized in leaf zzso in green zzso These results indicate that zzso is expressed in a form with a zzso targeting signal to zzso and is localized in zzso in zzso suggesting that the differences in the gene structure and the regulation of gene expression of zzso are probably due to zzso differences in zzso
