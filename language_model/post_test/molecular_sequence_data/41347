The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso interactions during the first steps of zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso zzso of zzso in several species is composed of four zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso rather than the three described in zzso pig and zzso In this study, investigations were carried out to unveil a fourth zzso in the rabbit zzso zzso zzso Using total zzso isolated from rabbit zzso the complementary zzso acid zzso zzso rabbit zzso was amplified by reverse transcribed zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of 1825 zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rabbit zzso showed high identity with other zzso zzso identity with human and horse zzso and zzso identity with mouse and rat zzso At the zzso level, peptides corresponding to the four proteins were detected by mass zzso In addition, a molecular zzso analysis of zzso showed that zzso of this gene has occurred at least four times during the evolution of zzso The data presented in this manuscript provide evidence, for the first time, that the rabbit zzso is composed of four zzso
