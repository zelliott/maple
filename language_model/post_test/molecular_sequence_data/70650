In the current study we report the isolation of zzso base pairs of the rat zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence revealed one zzso site, three zzso sites, and a potential zzso box zzso 33 base pairs zzso of the zzso start zzso The tissue specificity of the promoter was determined using transient zzso The promoter was most active in the mature zzso cell line zzso although the promoter also showed activity in the zzso cell line zzso No activity was observed in zzso cell lines or zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso sequence to zzso resulted in a 50% decrease in activity in transient zzso zzso suggesting that the promoter contains a functional zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso we established that the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso bound to the zzso zzso promoter, but only zzso and zzso contributed to zzso zzso zzso using a dominant negative construct of zzso resulted in a 50% decrease in zzso zzso promoter activity, further establishing the role of zzso in zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and human sequence demonstrated that some binding sites are not zzso zzso shifts were performed to investigate differences in protein binding between zzso zzso bound to the rat and human promoter but not to the mouse promoter, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in regulation of zzso zzso expression in these zzso From these results we conclude that, similar to other zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso is regulated by binding of zzso and a ubiquitous factor at an adjacent zzso However, unlike other zzso zzso we have identified zzso as the ubiquitous factor, and demonstrated that the promoter contains a functional zzso zzso
