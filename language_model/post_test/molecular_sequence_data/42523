zzso I activity was detected in zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso The zzso did not require zzso for its conversion of SC DNA to an zzso form, had zzso zzso requirements similar to those of zzso zzso I, and was significantly inhibited by the specific zzso I inhibitor zzso However, zzso failed to inhibit replication of zzso in infected cells at nontoxic zzso and an active site motif for zzso I could not be detected on the zzso zzso These results suggests that zzso does not zzso a novel zzso I, but rather packages the cellular zzso
