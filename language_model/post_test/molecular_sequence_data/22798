zzso replaces zzso in zzso against cellular damage caused by zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso which cause zzso and zzso In zzso major, the first step in zzso zzso is performed by a zzso zzso I zzso containing a zzso zzso all other characterized zzso zzso use zzso In kinetic studies zzso major and human zzso were active with zzso derivatives of several zzso but showed opposite zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso better with zzso major zzso whereas zzso zzso is zzso better with human zzso Similarly, zzso is a zzso more potent linear competitive inhibitor of zzso major than human zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), whereas zzso is zzso more active against human than zzso major zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso major zzso reveals differences in active site architecture to both human zzso and the zzso zzso coli zzso including increased negative charge and zzso character and zzso of a loop that may regulate zzso in the human zzso These differences correlate with the differential binding of zzso and zzso zzso and thus offer a route to the rational design of zzso zzso zzso zzso
