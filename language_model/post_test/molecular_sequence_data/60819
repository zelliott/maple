zzso contain two zzso zzso zzso which are zzso but zzso joined in their zzso regions by a zzso linkage structure zzso Two models have been put forward to explain the mechanisms by which the zzso zzso each model emphasizes the role of specific molecular zzso The zzso model implicates interactions between zzso sequences in the zzso zzso The second model proposes that zzso stretches in the region form zzso quartet zzso Here, we present an examination of the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso in the context of these two zzso zzso were found to form spontaneously in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to earlier reports, we found that deletion of neither the zzso nor the consensus zzso motifs zzso affected the level of zzso formation at low zzso of zzso Rather, different zzso zzso zzso consecutive stretches of zzso were found to enhance both in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso viral zzso zzso evidence further suggests that these zzso zzso stretches form zzso quartet zzso We also found that the zzso sequences could support zzso at significantly higher zzso zzso In addition, the zzso stretches were as important as the zzso sequence for maintaining efficient viral zzso Overall, our data support a model that zzso contributions from both of the previously proposed mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
