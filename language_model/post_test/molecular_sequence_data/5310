Small nuclear zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso are highly zzso In this report the modification of human zzso zzso was studied using cell extracts and in zzso zzso and therefore zzso zzso zzso The formation of zzso zzso at positions 4, 72 and 79 in zzso zzso was dependent on an zzso zzso since the activities in the extracts were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso on zzso zzso and there was a broad peak of zzso activity centered at 14 zzso zzso was not due to additional zzso activity, since the peak fraction was MN zzso zzso zzso H zzso of zzso zzso in the extracts inhibited formation of zzso in zzso zzso From zzso zzso analysis we determined that zzso added zzso zzso that is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso was significantly higher in zzso content than zzso zzso not associated with zzso zzso (8 zzso Competitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate formation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and point zzso in these zzso zzso zzso affected their ability to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso With the aid of these potent zzso it was determined that at least two separate activities modify the zzso at these zzso
