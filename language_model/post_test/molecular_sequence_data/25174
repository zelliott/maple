A primary site of infection by human zzso is zzso zzso However, analysis of the viral control elements and the cellular factors that regulate zzso gene expression in zzso has not been zzso The zzso early region 3 zzso gene products are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by zzso with the class I zzso zzso thus preventing their cell surface expression with a zzso decrease in host zzso zzso To determine whether different cellular factors were involved in zzso regulation in zzso as compared with zzso cells, both DNA binding and zzso analysis with the zzso promoter in both cell types were zzso These studies detected two novel zzso referred to as zzso and zzso with a variety of zzso but not zzso zzso Each of these zzso possessed strong zzso to motifs previously found to bind the cellular factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso gene revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso B motif zzso had minimal effects on promoter expression in zzso cells, but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso B motif zzso had minimal effects on gene expression in both zzso cells and zzso cells but resulted in a small, but zzso increase in gene expression in zzso cells when coupled to the zzso zzso zzso the position and subsequent zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the primary sequence of these motifs rather than their position in the zzso promoter was critical for regulating gene zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
