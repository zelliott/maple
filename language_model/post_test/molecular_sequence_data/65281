The first observation of zzso zzso small zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso oriented in the reverse direction to the zzso of the genes zzso and zzso was demonstrated within the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to be increased after heat zzso The zzso start point of this zzso designated zzso was localized 21 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start point by primer extension analysis, when the total zzso was isolated from cells grown at 30 degrees zzso After heat zzso the zzso start point of an additional species of zzso zzso was detected 19 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso was found to be involved in the synthesis of zzso zzso The 3' end of the zzso zzso was identified using the zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso The length of the two zzso zzso species was thus determined to be 129 and 131 zzso zzso The zzso zzso were found to overlap the zzso region of the transcript of the zzso gene coding for a zzso regulator of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso have a regulatory zzso
