zzso is a human respiratory disease that is endemic to the southwestern United States and is caused by inhalation of the spores of a desert zzso zzso Efforts to develop a vaccine against this disease have focused on identification of zzso zzso derived from the zzso cell wall which can stimulate protective immunity against zzso zzso infection in zzso We previously described a productive zzso approach to the discovery of vaccine candidates which makes use of the translated zzso of zzso zzso and a computer-based method of scanning deduced sequences of zzso proteins for zzso that are predicted to bind to human major zzso zzso class zzso zzso In this study we identified a set of putative cell wall proteins predicted to contain zzso zzso zzso II binding zzso Three of these were expressed by zzso coli, combined in a zzso and tested for protective efficacy in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mice survived beyond 90 days after zzso challenge, and the majority cleared the zzso We suggest that the zzso vaccine stimulates a broader range of zzso clones than the single zzso protein vaccines and thereby may be capable of inducing protection in an zzso zzso human zzso
