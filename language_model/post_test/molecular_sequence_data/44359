The zzso gene of zzso tuberculosis has previously been cloned and zzso zzso zzso Davis, zzso zzso Sedgwick, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the expression of this gene was shown to be zzso in response to various zzso agents by using a zzso fusion to the reporter gene zzso zzso zzso A segment of DNA around 300 zzso upstream of the coding region was shown to be required for zzso However, primer extension analysis indicated that the zzso start sites were 47 and 93 zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso zzso motifs with zzso to two families of zzso coli promoters but also with significant differences were located near these proposed zzso start zzso The differences from the zzso coli consensus patterns would explain the previously described lack of expression of the zzso tuberculosis zzso gene from its own promoter in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso tuberculosis zzso protein was shown to bind specifically to a zzso zzso overlapping one of these putative promoters and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso box involved in the regulation of zzso zzso The region of DNA 300 zzso upstream of the zzso gene was shown not to contain a promoter, suggesting that it functions as an upstream zzso zzso
