Small heat shock proteins zzso maintain cellular zzso by preventing stress and zzso protein zzso While it is known that zzso impacts the ability of zzso to bind zzso zzso zzso the complex zzso structure of zzso zzso has made understanding the significance of specific changes in zzso zzso Here we used zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from six zzso zzso environmentally adapted to temperatures ranging from zzso to zzso to identify correlations between zzso temperature, protein stability and zzso zzso Using sequence and structural modeling analysis we identified specific zzso acid differences between the warm adapted zzso and cold adapted Antarctic zzso that could contribute to these correlations and validated the functional consequences of three specific zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso Site directed zzso of three zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that each impacts either protein stability or zzso activity or both, with the zzso substitution having the greatest zzso Our results indicate a role for changing zzso in the zzso adaptation of zzso zzso and suggest ways to produce zzso zzso with altered zzso zzso These data also demonstrate that a comparative approach can provide new information about zzso function and zzso
