zzso factor zzso increases the level of zzso gene expression zzso by binding to a zzso upstream zzso sequence zzso in the zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and a zzso strain with elevated zzso activity zzso the ability of zzso to activate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso zzso zzso Schuster, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1988) Cell 56, zzso zzso zzso protein was detected at comparable levels in extracts made from zzso or zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso repression is not due to absence of zzso zzso in extracts made from zzso and zzso cells bound zzso DNA with similar affinities despite having greatly different abilities to activate zzso gene expression in zzso A zzso form of zzso zzso by zzso which has an altered consensus sequence for zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso but bound DNA to the same extent as zzso zzso zzso Similarly, normal DNA binding was seen for zzso produced in zzso with altered levels of zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso by zzso has no zzso effect on either DNA binding or zzso levels, zzso probably binds to zzso zzso and zzso prevents it from promoting zzso
