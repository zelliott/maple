An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from seawater surrounding the hard coral zzso zzso zzso collected at zzso zzso Japan, and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that the new strain represented a member of the zzso zzso and shared zzso % sequence similarity with cultivated strains of zzso subdivision zzso zzso acid analysis of the zzso hydrolysate indicated the absence of zzso acid and zzso acid, which suggested that the strain did not contain zzso in the cell zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso zzso was the major zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso were the major fatty zzso On the basis of these data, it was concluded that strain zzso represents a novel species in a new zzso in subdivision 4 of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
