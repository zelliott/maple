The protein zzso zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso domain, is important for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I) in zzso zzso We analyzed the contribution of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the production of the high molecular weight zzso form of zzso zzso zzso though not contributing to zzso I or zzso zzso showed increased expression at high zzso and was expressed in zzso zzso zzso suggesting an involvement in the synthesis of an zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso in zzso affected the production of zzso zzso I, particularly in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso High zzso induced the production of zzso zzso I by the wild type and zzso whereas high zzso had the opposite zzso It was shown that zzso zzso at the inner membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain was strongly increased by zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso motif (formerly zzso zzso located in the zzso domain, suggesting that this zzso could be modulated by zzso changes of the zzso zzso Moreover, deletion of a zzso motif present in the zzso domain abolished zzso and zzso I production and, consequently, the ability to zzso zzso zzso
