zzso a powerful zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso acid zzso sequences of both zzso were zzso These indicated that zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso against zzso nor zzso had any effect on zzso zzso zzso showing that, in contrast to other zzso zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso zzso In addition, partially zzso zzso only affects zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and binding studies with zzso zzso zzso signal zzso in part like zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gamma chain, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, unlike zzso zzso and some other bands are not zzso zzso binds to a zzso zzso membrane component in zzso zzso and to zzso zzso by human zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit both zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor with some specificity for zzso showed differential effects on collagen and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso uses the zzso but not the zzso part of the collagen signaling pathways to activate zzso zzso and zzso of zzso may activate zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma chain and, by a mechanism previously described in zzso and zzso activate zzso that is critical for downstream zzso of zzso
