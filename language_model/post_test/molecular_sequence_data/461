zzso immunity is mainly associated with specialized cells that are directly involved with the immune zzso Nevertheless, both in zzso and zzso other zzso might respond to immune zzso and participate either directly or indirectly in the ongoing immune zzso However, most of what is known about zzso immunity has been restricted to immune zzso cells and little information is available on the immune responses of other zzso or zzso We now focus on the immune reactions of the zzso tissue of an zzso Our study employs a zzso model, the zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso molecules expressed after an immune challenge presented by an zzso injection of zzso zzso The expression profiles of zzso genes expressed zzso between zzso animals and control sea zzso animals were determined using a custom-made zzso zzso with zzso sea cucumber zzso zzso Fifty zzso unique sequences were found to be zzso expressed in the zzso of zzso sea zzso Seven zzso of these sequences represented zzso of known zzso while the remaining zzso had no significant similarity with any zzso zzso or zzso zzso The known sequences corresponded to zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of 11 genes was validated using zzso zzso Nine of these zzso the zzso results and the remaining two showed a similar trend but without statistical zzso Our results show some of the molecular events by which the zzso zzso responds to an immune challenge and provide important information to the study of the evolution of the immune zzso
