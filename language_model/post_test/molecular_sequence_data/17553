Using sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso we have cloned a zzso of zzso from the locust zzso zzso The zzso clone encodes a stretch of 78 zzso acids including the zzso and its zzso regions identical to the corresponding region of zzso We have shown by in zzso zzso that this gene is transcribed and have used an zzso raised against its protein product to examine the expression of zzso during early zzso zzso zzso is a short germ zzso Although the segmented body plan is very similar to that of zzso the segments are generated zzso by a process of growth, not simultaneously by subdivision of a zzso zzso In both organisms, zzso is expressed throughout the abdomen from a sharp anterior boundary located within the first abdominal segment zzso The initial zzso of the genes in the two species zzso zzso zzso expression in a small group of cells in the anterior of zzso shortly after this segment is defined by the appearance of zzso zzso This contrasts with the appearance of zzso expression in zzso which appears simultaneously throughout the entire zzso
