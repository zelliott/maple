G zzso receptors zzso are the largest and most versatile family of zzso receptors in the cell, occupying the highest zzso positions in the regulation of many zzso zzso Although they have been extensively studied in a number of model insects, there have been few investigations of zzso in large zzso such as zzso zzso an zzso that provides a means to perform detailed tissue expression zzso which may help to characterize zzso and their zzso In addition, zzso zzso also known as the zzso is an insect of substantial economic importance, due to its use in silk production and traditional zzso In this work, we zzso identified 90 putative zzso in zzso zzso 33 of which represent novel zzso These zzso were zzso and compared with their zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso from these three insects showed that zzso may easily duplicate or disappear during insect evolution, especially in the zzso and protein hormone zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed a decrease in the quantity and diversity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which may be related to its long history of zzso Moreover, the presence of many zzso zzso suggests that neither zzso nor zzso is good representatives for the zzso in the Class zzso
