Plasma zzso mass zzso has recently been used with success to characterize zzso zzso A zzso the major molecular species present give signals indicating their masses, from which probable compositions could be zzso by using the overall composition determined by chemical zzso In the present study, plasma zzso mass zzso was used to compare structures in zzso A preparations isolated from several smooth and rough strains of zzso and zzso zzso zzso isolated from strains of both zzso revealed considerable variation in degree of zzso zzso of fatty acids and presence or absence of zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso species usually associated with zzso zzso A were found in preparations from zzso zzso In addition, preparations from three different batches of zzso A from one strain of zzso zzso showed significant differences in zzso These results demonstrate that preparations used for biological and structural analyses should be defined in terms of their particular molecular constituents and that no zzso based on analysis of a single preparation should be zzso
