The zzso genetic diversity, and crucial ecological and evolutionary roles of marine zzso have prompted a large number of zzso zzso However, obtaining a thorough understanding of marine zzso has been hampered by the low number of zzso zzso infecting major bacterial groups other than zzso and zzso zzso there is an urgent requirement for the isolation of zzso that zzso abundant marine bacterial zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized zzso a zzso infecting a zzso of the zzso zzso one of the most abundant marine bacterial zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has an zzso zzso zzso that harbors many genes with novel features rarely found in cultured organisms, including genes zzso a DNA zzso with a partial zzso central domain and an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of nearly all zzso genes were predominantly found in marine zzso rather than cultured organisms, suggesting the novelty of zzso and the prevalence of this zzso type in the zzso A significant number of the viral zzso sequences obtained from the ocean surface were best assigned to the zzso zzso The number of reads assigned to zzso accounted for zzso of the total reads assigned to viruses in seven zzso from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, making the zzso zzso the most or second-most frequently assigned viral zzso Given its ability to zzso the abundant zzso zzso and its widespread distribution, zzso zzso zzso could be an important resource for marine virus zzso
