To achieve a better understanding of mechanisms that zzso zzso and to identify novel target molecules for diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso zzso we previously zzso zzso profiles of 20 zzso zzso on a zzso zzso Among the genes zzso in the tumor zzso compared with their zzso counterparts, we focused on a novel gene termed zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso that zzso zzso a zzso protein containing 12 zzso zzso and a zzso box zzso zzso northern zzso analysis revealed it's zzso and zzso expression in normal zzso zzso zzso in soft zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso growth to zzso cells, suggesting its zzso zzso zzso specific zzso for zzso knocked down its expression in zzso cells, which resulted in their growth zzso We identified four zzso proteins including zzso a zzso zzso and three involved in zzso processing zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may play a role in zzso by regulating zzso and/or zzso processing of growth control zzso These data may contribute to a better understanding of liver zzso and to the development of novel strategy for treatment of zzso
