This is the first report of the isolation of a coronavirus from elk zzso Two zzso samples from elk calves with zzso were shown to be positive for zzso particles by electron zzso and the particles were zzso in the human zzso zzso cell zzso After 24 zzso zzso were observed, and cell culture zzso from both samples showed zzso activity with mouse zzso zzso infected with both elk coronavirus zzso zzso reacted with zzso a zzso zzso against the spike protein of bovine coronavirus zzso on an indirect fluorescent zzso zzso The protein profiles of both zzso zzso were similar to that of zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso On Northern zzso analysis, the zzso pattern of zzso was typical of zzso with a zzso set of transcripts with common 3' end zzso Based on a published zzso gene sequence for zzso zzso zzso we arbitrarily designed two zzso for amplification by zzso After zzso the zzso was zzso and a high degree of zzso zzso between the zzso gene sequences of zzso and zzso was zzso Thus, zzso is closely related genetically and zzso to zzso and will be a new member of zzso group 2 of the zzso zzso which possess zzso zzso
