zzso is active against zzso from different zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso studies reveal that resistance zzso are primarily found within the region spanning zzso acid zzso of zzso However, most studies include only zzso B zzso while it is known that especially the zzso region is very divergent among zzso 

To analyze the zzso zzso genetic evolution during failure of zzso salvage regimens in 19 zzso patients infected with strains from different group M zzso 

The zzso sequence was determined at baseline and upon failure in 19 zzso For a subset of 7 patients, samples were available after zzso of zzso 

Our results confirmed the zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso during chronic treatment with zzso were mainly observed within region zzso One novel zzso was identified, zzso zzso in a zzso A1 zzso 

Different zzso escape zzso selective pressure through similar zzso patterns, however a new zzso zzso was zzso The in zzso selection of zzso suggests that it might play a role in zzso zzso zzso it could be considered as a candidate zzso to be included within drug resistance interpretation zzso
