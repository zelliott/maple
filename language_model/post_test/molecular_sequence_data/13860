zzso is a zzso zzso protein originally isolated from zzso zzso of zzso appears zzso although particularly high expression is noted in the zzso of zzso tumors and during zzso To dissect the molecular basis of zzso gene regulation, mouse zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso with an open reading frame of 606 zzso which is identical in length to the human zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high zzso to the human zzso with zzso identity and zzso similarity at the zzso acid zzso zzso comparisons between mouse and human zzso and some zzso zzso confirmed a complete conservation in the position of six zzso as well as numerous other zzso acid zzso indicating an essential structure for potential zzso of zzso The sequence analysis revealed a difference in both sequence and size of the zzso regions between mouse and human zzso Northern analysis of the various zzso from zzso zzso and cow showed the major zzso to be approximately 1 zzso which is similar in size to that observed in zzso Although additional minor bands of zzso and zzso zzso were found in Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso analysis failed to provide evidence that these minor bands are products of the zzso zzso Finally, the genetic map location for this zzso zzso was determined to be on zzso mouse zzso zzso 9 by analysis of two sets of zzso zzso
