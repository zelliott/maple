Strategies are reported that combine in one step a predictable zzso protein zzso with mass zzso zzso zzso zzso groups in peptides and proteins are modified by reaction with a zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso in peptides and zzso and the resulting zzso zzso undergo zzso fragmentation under conditions of low-energy zzso zzso zzso zzso fragmentation of the peptides involves apparent free radical processes including zzso zzso that lead to zzso chain zzso Strategies for directed zzso of peptides by free radical promoted processes are zzso and such strategies may well simplify schemes for protein zzso
