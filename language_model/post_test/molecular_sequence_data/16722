zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso of an alternative zzso signaling zzso based on processing of the zzso precursor zzso which associates with zzso in the zzso This pathway, which activates zzso zzso is required for induction of several zzso genes needed for organization of secondary zzso zzso We investigated the basis for the zzso dependence of the induction of these genes in response to engagement of the zzso beta zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that the promoters of zzso zzso genes are recognized by zzso zzso and not by zzso zzso the ubiquitous target for the classical zzso signaling zzso We identified in the zzso promoters a novel type of zzso site that is zzso recognized by zzso zzso This site links induction of zzso zzso and other important regulatory molecules to zzso of the alternative zzso
