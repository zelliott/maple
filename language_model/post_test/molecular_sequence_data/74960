Using zzso raised against partially zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso we have isolated a zzso from a zzso human breast cancer cell expression library which encodes the putative zzso zzso zzso Since the protein zzso by this zzso zzso with the zzso zzso we have tentatively named it a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso selection and in zzso translation showed that the protein zzso by this zzso was approximately 10 zzso a result confirmed by the zzso acid sequence derived after DNA sequencing zzso The zzso gene product has significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained from the zzso human breast cancer cell library has 37 zzso more zzso information than that of the zzso zzso from human zzso Since the zzso start site for the zzso gene has been confirmed in zzso our data suggest that a different zzso start site may be used in the zzso zzso Isolation and zzso sequencing of the rat zzso zzso showed there was zzso predicted zzso acid sequence similarity with the human zzso and confirmed the highly zzso nature of the zzso gene between zzso The zzso is expressed in most but not all human breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso Northern analyses of zzso from rat tissue indicated that zzso zzso levels vary zzso They are low in the liver, brain, zzso and zzso moderate in skeletal muscle, and high in the zzso zzso and zzso The availability of zzso zzso human breast cancer cell lines, which do zzso and do not zzso 7) express the zzso zzso will allow the investigation of the role, if any, of zzso in zzso zzso
