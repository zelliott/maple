Only few small, regulatory zzso zzso opposite another gene have been identified in zzso Here, we report the characterization of a locus where a small zzso zzso is zzso in zzso to an zzso gene whose product shows zzso to the antitoxin zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein is tightly zzso at multiple levels by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the Lon zzso zzso zzso with zzso and overproduction of the protein leads to cell growth zzso decreased protein synthesis and increased zzso zzso These properties are shared with several zzso zzso toxins of the zzso zzso and we show that the zzso protein represents evolution of a toxin from the zzso fold, whose representatives are typically zzso We suggest that zzso promotion of zzso zzso may be important for the recycling of zzso damaged under zzso zzso
