The evolution of influenza B viruses is poorly zzso zzso of influenza B viruses in nature as a means of genetic variation has not been considered to be a major contributor to their zzso However, the current practice of assigning evolutionary relationships by zzso analysis of the zzso of influenza B viruses would fail to detect zzso In this study, influenza B viruses isolated within the past 10 years from sites in the United States and China were studied by zzso sequencing of the zzso and zzso genes and construction of zzso trees to assess evolutionary zzso A group of viruses represented by zzso possess a zzso derived from a zzso strain and a zzso derived from a zzso zzso A second zzso event between the zzso of a zzso virus closely related to the zzso strain and the zzso of a zzso strain is represented by a single virus, zzso The zzso of the zzso viruses is most closely related to that of zzso viruses currently circulating in zzso zzso A pattern of insertions and deletions in the zzso and the zzso of different strains of influenza B viruses is zzso zzso plays a role in the evolution of influenza B viruses and may zzso a change in the methods used to assess and identify new influenza zzso
