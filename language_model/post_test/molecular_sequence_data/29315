In zzso the 3' end of zzso zzso is not zzso but instead ends with a zzso structure that is required for cell zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes is identical to the consensus sequence of other zzso zzso zzso but the sequence of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes is zzso zzso binds to these novel zzso sequences as well as the zzso zzso with similar zzso zzso derived from females containing a viable, zzso zzso in zzso store greatly reduced amounts of all five zzso zzso in the egg, indicating that zzso is required in the maternal germ line for production of each zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso function accumulate zzso versions of all five zzso zzso as a result of usage of zzso signals located 3' of the zzso in each zzso zzso Since the 3' ends of adjacent zzso genes are close together, these zzso signals may ensure the termination of zzso in order to prevent zzso into the next zzso which could possibly disrupt zzso or produce zzso zzso zzso that might trigger zzso zzso During early zzso zzso ubiquitous zzso zzso gene zzso is activated at the end of the zzso nuclear cycles during S phase of cycle 14, silenced during the subsequent zzso phase, and then zzso near the end of that zzso phase in the zzso zzso domain zzso There is little or no zzso protein provided zzso in zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso is immediately required to process newly made zzso zzso
