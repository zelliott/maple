Published data on the rat zzso zzso zzso gene have so far provided evidence for only one zzso In contrast, the human zzso zzso gene has been reported to be transcribed from three different promoters A, B and zzso In order to facilitate a more in-depth analysis of the promoter organization in the zzso gene zzso zzso of its zzso zzso region were zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso gene is transcribed from a promoter zzso to promoter B in the zzso zzso However, the region corresponding to the human promoter A is much more divergent between the species and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso as well as zzso experiments support the notion that the zzso gene does not contain a functional A zzso Interestingly, a novel zzso zzso zzso containing a previously unknown zzso untranslated zzso was isolated by zzso suggesting the existence of a second, zzso promoter in the zzso zzso Our results show that this zzso zzso zzso C is the only one expressed in rat zzso It thus appears that the zzso gene contains two promoters that are zzso in a zzso zzso
