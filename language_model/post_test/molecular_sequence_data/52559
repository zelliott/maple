zzso is an adhesive protein that zzso in host cell invasion by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Earlier studies established that zzso is zzso into the culture medium by zzso zzso and that release is zzso with zzso zzso Since little is known about zzso processing of proteins zzso by zzso zzso we undertook this study to investigate the zzso events that accompany zzso of zzso We demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso is removed by a zzso termed zzso when zzso is released into the culture zzso Additionally, prior to release, a second zzso termed zzso trims the N zzso of zzso resulting in the release of zzso sized species of zzso Although zzso activity was unaffected by any of the zzso zzso tested, zzso activity was blocked by a subset of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results establish that zzso is zzso modified at multiple sites by two distinct zzso that probably operate on the zzso zzso
