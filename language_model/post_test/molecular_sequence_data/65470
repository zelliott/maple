Environmental zzso investigation was carried out in zzso Bay to determine the source and distribution of zzso bacteria and their resistance zzso At least 25 species or the equivalent molecular zzso zzso in 16 zzso of resistant bacteria could be identified based on zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso constituted the majority of the typical resistant zzso zzso zzso and marine zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria also zzso zzso zzso All the six resistance zzso screened, zzso and zzso could be zzso and the zzso genes were zzso zzso and zzso Both anthropogenic zzso and indigenous zzso or coastal bacteria might contribute to the zzso gene zzso and resistant bacteria and their molecular zzso may serve as zzso of coastal environmental zzso Our work probably is the first identification of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
