In the present study, a new bacterial strain isolated from activated sludge has been identified as zzso zzso based on its zzso zzso properties, and the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso This new bacterial strain uses zzso as both carbon source and energy zzso The key factors for controlling the degradation efficiency of zzso by this strain were found to be initial zzso zzso temperature, and pH value of zzso Under the zzso conditions, as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso almost zzso zzso can be zzso within zzso and zzso as a final product was detected in zzso zzso The degradation reaction of zzso over this newly isolated strain can be described by zzso zzso equation in which the maximum degradation rate constant K and the minimum zzso were respectively calculated to be zzso and zzso under the optimal zzso
