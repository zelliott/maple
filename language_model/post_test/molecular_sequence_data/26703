All zzso zzso zzso except zzso 6 share a common zzso zzso backbone and nearly all variations between zzso are due to zzso and/or zzso modifications of the common O unit zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated and zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a type I modification of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso had not yet been zzso 

The zzso zzso was induced and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical strain zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso has a zzso head and a long zzso tail, characteristic of the members of zzso zzso zzso can convert zzso Y to zzso zzso and zzso X to zzso zzso but cannot convert 10 other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tested, suggesting that zzso has a narrow host zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso gene adjacent to zzso of the host zzso when zzso The complete sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso 66 open reading frames and two zzso zzso zzso zzso shares significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso and is classified into the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to use a zzso mechanism for DNA packaging similar to that of zzso zzso 

zzso contains features of zzso zzso and is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso The characterization of zzso enhances our understanding of zzso conversion of zzso zzso
