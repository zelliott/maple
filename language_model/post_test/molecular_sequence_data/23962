Rice zzso zzso produces zzso zzso for both zzso zzso zzso and defensive zzso zzso raising the question of how this initial zzso step is carried out for these distinct zzso zzso Here, a functional zzso approach has been zzso to identify two disparate zzso zzso zzso from rice zzso and zzso zzso it was very recently demonstrated that only one of these zzso normally operates in zzso zzso as zzso in this gene result in severely impaired zzso Evidence is presented here strongly indicating that the other zzso is involved in related secondary metabolism producing defensive zzso In particular, under appropriate conditions, zzso zzso is specifically induced in leaves prior to production of the corresponding zzso Thus, zzso control of zzso seems to be an important means of regulating defensive zzso zzso Finally, zzso is significantly more similar to the likewise zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso than its class II zzso zzso zzso involved in rice secondary zzso zzso we speculate that this zzso conservation by zzso process reflects derivation of related secondary metabolism from the zzso primary zzso zzso prior to the early divergence between the separate lineages within the zzso family zzso resulting in modern rice and zzso
