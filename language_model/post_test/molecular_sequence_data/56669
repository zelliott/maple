Small fragments of DNA of known length were made with the zzso chain zzso These fragments had zzso molecules zzso attached at their zzso They were subsequently labeled with a zzso protein fusion between zzso and two zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso This zzso species was expected to bind up to four DNA molecules via their attached zzso zzso The zzso complex was deposited on mica and zzso with an atomic force zzso The images revealed the protein zzso at the expected location at the ends of the strands of DNA as well as the expected zzso zzso and zzso of DNA bound to a single zzso
