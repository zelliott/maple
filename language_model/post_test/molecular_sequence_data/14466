A zzso zzso zzso to zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a sea zzso zzso zzso collected from the South Sea, zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso at 30 zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene zzso strain zzso clustered with zzso zzso zzso with which it exhibited zzso sequence zzso at a zzso zzso value of zzso It exhibited zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to the type strains of other recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso as the major fatty acid, which is consistent with data for the zzso zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso properties, together with zzso and genetic zzso demonstrated that strain zzso could be distinguished from all recognized zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
