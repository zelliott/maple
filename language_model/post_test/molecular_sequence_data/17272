zzso strains symbiotic with zzso present an interesting opportunity to study the patterns and causes of zzso diversity and distribution within a particular host zzso zzso We zzso sampled zzso from zzso on zzso plants along an zzso zzso in the southern Sierra Nevada of California, and we also collected zzso from a wider host zzso and geographic range throughout zzso The two sampling scales comprised 36 samples from eight species of zzso representing six of the seven major zzso regions in and around zzso The primary objective of this study was to use a quantitative model to test the relative importance of geographic zzso host zzso and environment in influencing the identity of zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso DNA sequence zzso At both sampling zzso zzso strains symbiotic with zzso exhibited a high degree of genetic zzso zzso strains symbiotic with zzso zzso were within the same zzso as several zzso zzso zzso from a zzso and zzso tree model used to zzso explain zzso zzso groupings demonstrated that the only significant variable in distinguishing between zzso groups at the more local sampling scale was host zzso At the regional scale, zzso zzso groupings were explained by host species and the zzso province of sample zzso We did not find any significant correspondence between zzso and zzso zzso indicative of zzso but we concluded that the identity of zzso strains inhabiting zzso zzso may involve interactions between host species specificity and geographic zzso
