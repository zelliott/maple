The zzso binding protein zzso is a general zzso factor required for initiation by all three zzso nuclear zzso zzso Little is known about how zzso gene expression is zzso To identify sequence elements and proteins contributing to human zzso zzso gene transcription, we have characterized the promoter in two human cell zzso Multiple zzso of zzso zzso mapped throughout a 111 zzso region immediately upstream of a previously reported zzso zzso Upon transient zzso into cells, the zzso zzso region was shown to contain a fairly active zzso The zzso zzso elements responsible for this promoter activity in zzso and zzso cells were localized in zzso by deletion zzso The minimal promoter defined from these experiments was a 54 zzso region that zzso all but one minor start site and contained a functional zzso protein consensus binding site, which was shown to be required for promoter activity in both cell zzso The importance of other potential elements to promoter activity was found to differ between the two cell zzso zzso with that finding, different complexes were formed on zzso DNA fragments upon incubation with nuclear extracts prepared from the different zzso
