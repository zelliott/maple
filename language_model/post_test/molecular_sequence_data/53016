In order to understand better the structural and functional relations between protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso metal and the zzso zzso we built a structural model of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso using the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso and the structure of zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as zzso The overall structure of the zzso zzso is close to the structure solved by zzso et zzso It comprises two zzso which move relative to each zzso The zzso used as zzso is tightly bound to the zzso at specific zzso zzso dynamic calculations in combination with the study of the structural model led us to identify zzso acid zzso close to the zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso sufficiently far from the zzso that could be zzso so as to modify the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso was used to replace by charged zzso both zzso a zzso located within the zzso loop, involved in binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso close to the active zzso zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied with respect to zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso specific zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso increased by factors of 4 for zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a low activity with zzso and no zzso activity with zzso zzso and was also inhibited by zzso An increased zzso of zzso release by zzso and the building of an zzso barrier between zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso could explain these zzso The kinetic properties of the zzso zzso with zzso were not affected, but the zzso efficiency for the zzso zzso increased zzso zzso 177 could interact with the zzso cluster involved in the specificity of protein zzso zzso towards zzso zzso thereby increasing its zzso
