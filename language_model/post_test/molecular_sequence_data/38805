zzso variable fragments zzso are zzso units that hold enormous potential in zzso zzso Their clinical applications, however, require the large scale production and zzso of biologically active zzso zzso In the present study, we engineered and expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The purity and zzso of the zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and competitive zzso The binding affinity constant zzso determined by surface zzso resonance analysis using zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso was 30 to zzso higher than in zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso mice bearing zzso human colon zzso zzso showed equivalent zzso of zzso zzso generated in zzso zzso and bacteria zzso with zzso injected zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, at 6 h zzso Interestingly, the zzso pattern of zzso zzso in zzso mice exhibited a slower clearance of zzso zzso from the blood pool than zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In conclusion, improved yields of zzso zzso were achieved using the zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso and in zzso properties of these zzso suggest possible therapeutic zzso
