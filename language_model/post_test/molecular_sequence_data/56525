We report here the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso the mouse vascular cell zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso acids zzso and shows zzso and zzso similarity with the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three independent zzso clones had a zzso unit structure zzso containing a seven zzso zzso zzso and only sequences corresponding to the 7- (and not to the zzso unit zzso were detected by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso indicating that in the mouse this is the dominant, if not zzso form of this zzso Unlike other zzso zzso the zzso tails (19 zzso of mouse and human zzso are zzso despite a zzso similarity only at the zzso level, suggesting a critical functional zzso
