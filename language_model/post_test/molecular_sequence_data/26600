Previously, we reported that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is correlated with poor zzso prognosis and zzso survival in zzso cell lung cancer zzso In the present study, we further analyzed zzso zzso cases and identified various patterns of zzso zzso composed of zzso ring finger 2 zzso and zzso We detected no zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and attributed these zzso zzso to zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso patterns were detected zzso in each patient, and the pattern sets varied among patients, although the pattern in which zzso zzso 1 was fused to zzso zzso 3 zzso as zzso zzso was detected zzso zzso in a wide screening for zzso zzso in zzso we focused on this zzso pattern as a representative zzso In analyses of 167 zzso samples, zzso zzso was identified in about zzso of the patients, and the presence of zzso zzso was significantly correlated with a high expression level of parental zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the detection of zzso zzso was correlated with poor zzso survival periods in zzso consistent with a previous finding in which zzso zzso was correlated with poor zzso prognosis in zzso This report is the first to suggest a correlation between zzso zzso and the expression level of parental zzso Furthermore, our findings may be clinically zzso suggesting that zzso zzso might serve as a novel zzso zzso in zzso
