The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso which mediates important central and peripheral zzso zzso Our aim was to progress in mapping of the zzso binding site by identifying zzso that interact with the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso because these are crucial for its binding and biological activity, and to determine whether zzso and the selective zzso zzso zzso share a common binding zzso Identification of putative zzso acids of the zzso binding site was achieved by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in a refined three-dimensional model of the zzso zzso as constraints, previous results that identified contact points between zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Martinez, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Martinez, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By this approach, a series of zzso forming connected zzso clusters were zzso zzso and functional analysis of zzso receptors indicated that a network of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is involved in the binding site for zzso and in the zzso process of the zzso Within this zzso network, the zzso nature of zzso 121 seems to be essential for zzso zzso Finally, the biological properties of zzso together with dynamic zzso of zzso in the zzso binding site demonstrated that zzso occupies a region of zzso binding site which interacts with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These new and important insights will serve to better understand the zzso process of zzso and to design or zzso zzso
