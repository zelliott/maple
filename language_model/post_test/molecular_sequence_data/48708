zzso is a widely distributed zzso pathogen that causes tens of millions of zzso cases globally every zzso While the zzso diversity of zzso is increasingly well zzso our knowledge of zzso zzso zzso diversity is still rather zzso despite the contributions of both zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso diversity and ecology zzso through horizontal gene transfer and zzso zzso To gain a better understanding of zzso diversity in a specific ecological zzso we zzso 22 zzso zzso isolated from a number of dairy farms from New York State zzso States) and analyzed them using a comparative zzso zzso 

zzso of the 22 zzso according to the zzso of zzso genes allowed for zzso into 8 well supported zzso In addition to two zzso clusters that represent novel virulent zzso zzso we also identified four zzso clusters that each contained previously characterized zzso from multiple zzso Our analyses also identified two clusters of zzso that carry putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance zzso and zzso genes as well as virulent and temperate zzso zzso zzso into zzso evolution from our analyses include zzso identification of DNA metabolism genes that may facilitate zzso synthesis in zzso with a zzso % distinct from zzso and zzso evidence of zzso zzso zzso and fiber diversity due to both single zzso zzso and major zzso which may affect the host specificity of zzso zzso 

zzso characterization of 22 zzso zzso isolated from dairy farms allowed for identification of a number of novel zzso zzso While the comparative zzso analyses of these zzso provide a number of new insights in the evolution and diversity of zzso zzso they only represent a first glimpse into the diversity of zzso zzso that is likely to be discovered when zzso from different environments are zzso
