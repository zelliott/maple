The zzso zzso small heat shock proteins zzso are present in all plant species from algae to zzso zzso analysis shows that the wheat zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso by heat stress in almost all the zzso and zzso zzso and is also expressed zzso in certain zzso growth zzso We characterize wheat zzso zzso 26 through transgenic approach using zzso and report cloning of the promoter and its zzso zzso zzso plants were substantially tolerant under continuous high temperature regimen than zzso plants, as measured by zzso II zzso activity, zzso of more zzso zzso higher biomass and seed zzso zzso plants produced bold seeds under high temperature, having higher zzso potential than the zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso plants showed negligible tolerance even for zzso heat zzso impaired in zzso zzso and accumulated less biomass and seed yield under normal growth zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of several heat and other zzso stress responsive zzso elements along with zzso stage and zzso zzso Analysis of promoter through zzso reporter system in both transgenic rice and zzso further confirms the role of zzso zzso in heat and other zzso stresses as well as during seed maturation and zzso zzso expression analysis of zzso zzso plants revealed that the zzso remained unchanged in the transgenic plants and the tolerance was due to the zzso of zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso
