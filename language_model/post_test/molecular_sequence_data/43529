With the advent of zzso zzso libraries, access to completely human zzso fragments is zzso either by direct selection from human zzso libraries, or by guided zzso After selection, zzso and zzso may need to be expressed as complete zzso in zzso cells for further zzso or if zzso functions are zzso 

To rebuild and express the human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso from zzso display libraries by guided zzso as a fully zzso functional human zzso zzso zzso in zzso myeloma cells, and to perform preliminary zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso A further objective was to investigate the zzso of human zzso production and the stability of zzso zzso in zzso cultured in various media zzso 

A zzso strategy was employed for cloning heavy chain gene zzso and light chain gene V zzso zzso into zzso cell expression zzso p alpha zzso and p alpha zzso zzso The cell line zzso was isolated after zzso of zzso mouse zzso with the zzso expanded and weaned into a protein free zzso zzso assembled zzso zzso was zzso by zzso A affinity zzso and zzso with respect to size of zzso zzso and affinity for human zzso zzso zzso of zzso was investigated by extended serial zzso and analysis of zzso zzso Strategies of media enrichment were tested for any effect on zzso productivity by selected zzso zzso 

The cell line zzso zzso an zzso human zzso zzso with heavy and light chains of molecular weight 55 and 28 zzso zzso zzso capture studies showed zzso to have a zzso constant of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean specific productivity of the cell line increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso by a combination of medium enrichment and serum zzso zzso serial zzso of zzso showed the cell line to be unstable with respect to zzso zzso 

We have outlined a method for expression of human V genes as assembled zzso in zzso myeloma zzso A cloning strategy for the stable expression of zzso or zzso genes isolated from zzso display libraries as assembled human zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso myeloma cells has been zzso For zzso specific productivity of zzso cell lines, supplementation of culture media with zzso zzso and zzso acids increases zzso yield significantly compared to that in conventional media, indicating the latter is zzso limiting for production zzso
