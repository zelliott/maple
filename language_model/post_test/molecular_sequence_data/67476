zzso zzso as a cause of zzso kidney disease is the most common genetic cause of progressive zzso failure in children and young zzso zzso is characterized by abnormal and/or loss of function of proteins associated with primary zzso Previously, we characterized an zzso zzso zzso of zzso kidney disease in the Lewis zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, quantitative trait locus analysis was used to define a zzso zzso region on rat zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso capture and next-generation sequencing of this region identified a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso related zzso 8 ( zzso zzso This is a novel zzso zzso that occurs within the regulator of zzso zzso 1 zzso region of the zzso Specifically, the zzso substitution is located within a zzso repeat motif of the predicted seven zzso zzso structure of the zzso zzso The rat zzso gene is located in a region zzso to portions of human zzso 17 and mouse zzso zzso electron zzso confirmed zzso long zzso on zzso kidney zzso cells, and zzso zzso for zzso protein revealed altered zzso zzso 

When assessed relative to other zzso zzso zzso our results indicate the whole zzso structure of the zzso domain is important, as the different zzso cause comparable zzso This study establishes the zzso rat as a novel model system for zzso and further zzso the link between zzso kidney disease and zzso zzso
