A recently reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso cells of mouse zzso was shown to have a zzso deduced zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso In order to compare the mouse and human zzso zzso we used the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify human zzso sequences from several zzso libraries zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sequence has an zzso sequence identity with mouse zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso This extremely high evolutionary conservation suggests an important function for the zzso gene zzso
