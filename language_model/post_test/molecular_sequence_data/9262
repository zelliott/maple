Viper snake zzso contain a great variety of toxic zzso These components mediate their toxicity by either stimulating or zzso the zzso system of human victims or experimental animals, resulting in common clinical complications of blood zzso or uncontrolled zzso Therefore it is deemed important to isolate the active zzso from snake zzso with zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso snake zzso designated zzso was zzso by zzso exchange zzso and affinity zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso was a 34 zzso zzso zzso the molecular weight of which decreased to 26 zzso after zzso with zzso zzso F zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso zzso region of the protein indicated that zzso shared a high degree of sequence zzso with other zzso zzso from snake zzso zzso showed high zzso activity and zzso activity on zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 

The results showed that zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso snake zzso and zzso by zzso exchange zzso and affinity zzso is in fact a zzso zzso
