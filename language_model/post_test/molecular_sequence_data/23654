The alternative zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is a membrane protein playing a prominent role in zzso by linking the reduction of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity reveals an evolutionary relation between alternative zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso We have created a structural model for zzso from zzso coli through comparative zzso onto a template from this zzso Combined analysis of our model and sequence conservation allowed us to include the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in atomic zzso Furthermore, we propose the most plausible orientation of zzso relative to the membrane and specify a region of the protein potentially involved in zzso zzso
