zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso is a zzso in all zzso and many zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a complex between zzso zzso and an equilibrium mixture of PGA and zzso The structure has been refined using 29 zzso reflections with an zzso of zzso to an R of zzso with average zzso of bond lengths and bond angles from ideal values of zzso A and zzso degrees , zzso In this structure, the zzso constitutes the zzso zzso zzso The two zzso are similar, and their zzso gives a zzso distance between zzso atoms of zzso zzso The exceptions to this are the zzso loop zzso where the atomic positions in the two zzso differ by up to 4 A and the loop zzso which follows the zzso loop zzso In the first zzso the zzso side chain of zzso is in contact with the zzso group of the zzso zzso in the other it is separated by water zzso A series of hydrogen bonds leading to a neighboring zzso zzso can be identified as being responsible for ordering and stabilization of the zzso different zzso in the crystal zzso The electron density present in the active site suggests that in the active site with the direct zzso hydrogen bond PGA is predominantly bound while in the active site where water molecules separate zzso from the zzso the binding of zzso zzso The structure indicates that the water zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso PGA reaction is activated by the zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso are unique because they have resolved two zzso on the opposite sides of the transition zzso
