zzso zzso receptors zzso have been isolated or cloned in zzso bird and zzso zzso but no information exists on the primary structure of human zzso zzso By screening a zzso library from the human zzso cell line zzso 32 with a zzso probe corresponding to the full length of rat alpha zzso zzso we have identified an open reading frame zzso a protein of 502 zzso zzso This protein shows all the features of members of the zzso zzso zzso and has two zzso zzso at positions zzso 193 which are typical of the zzso zzso Because of its high zzso to rat alpha 3 zzso zzso acid zzso we conclude that we have cloned the human alpha zzso zzso
