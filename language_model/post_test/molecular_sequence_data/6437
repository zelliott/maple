Gene therapy may provide an effective alternative to conventional approaches for treating zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene delivery to zzso has a distinct advantage with respect to clinical zzso To date, zzso zzso are the best studied zzso for gene delivery, and almost all approved gene therapy trials in humans rely on zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso is limited by requirement for cell division, and attempts to zzso normal zzso in zzso using zzso zzso are reported to zzso The present study was undertaken in order to investigate zzso of inflamed zzso to zzso infection in zzso Using an experimental model of bacterial cell wall zzso arthritis in rats, we attempted two approaches for delivery of zzso zzso to zzso In the first approach, zzso zzso zzso carrying reporter genes zzso and zzso were directly injected into inflamed rat ankle zzso zzso inflamed zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso packaging zzso We found that about zzso of cells in zzso from zzso zzso with packaging cells were zzso The zzso zzso cells in joint zzso proliferated in culture and were of rat origin as determined using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso in zzso from zzso directly injected with zzso zzso or from zzso control zzso These findings show that zzso zzso have a population of cells susceptible to zzso infection in zzso and demonstrate the possibility of using zzso zzso for direct gene delivery to inflamed zzso
