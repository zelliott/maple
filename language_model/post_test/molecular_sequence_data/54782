There has been a long-standing interest in the role played by zzso in zzso Of particular interest is how zzso signals are integrated into flowering genetic zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso regulates zzso flowering by modulating sugar transport and zzso We found that whereas zzso zzso zzso exhibit delayed flowering under long days, zzso plants zzso show early zzso In addition, the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso plants but zzso in zzso zzso in which zzso sugar levels were zzso zzso activates the zzso gene by binding directly to its promoter, resulting in promoted flowering in zzso zzso zzso expression also responds to zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene is suppressed by sugar zzso zzso we conclude that zzso regulation of sugar transport and metabolism is linked to zzso zzso
