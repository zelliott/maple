The zzso factor zzso from rat liver zzso is a 628 zzso acid protein that functions as a zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso consensus zzso We have zzso a 99 zzso protein containing the zzso portion of zzso and solved its structure using X-ray zzso data to zzso A zzso The zzso and orientation of the zzso is essentially the same as that found in the zzso zzso alpha 2 and zzso zzso even though the zzso zzso contains 21 more zzso The 21 zzso zzso is found in an extension of zzso 2 and zzso lengthening of the connecting loop between zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso complex indicates that the mode of interaction with DNA is similar in both zzso with a number of zzso contacts in the major zzso The extra 21 zzso of the zzso zzso are not involved in DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso consensus sequence requires either a zzso change of the DNA (presumably zzso or a zzso of the zzso relative to the zzso
