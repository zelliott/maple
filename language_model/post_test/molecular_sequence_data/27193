zzso zzso zzso activity in plants is a trait with potential economic, agricultural and environmental zzso In relation to the food industry, zzso zzso causes unacceptable zzso in fruit and zzso from an agriculture perspective, zzso can protect plants against pathogens and environmental stress, improve zzso growth by increasing nitrogen zzso and decreasing nitrogen loss to the environment through the zzso zzso The high zzso zzso red zzso has a significant economic and environmental role in sustaining zzso organic and conventional zzso zzso markers for a range of important agricultural traits are being developed for red zzso and improved knowledge of zzso genes and their structure will facilitate molecular zzso 

A bacterial artificial zzso zzso library zzso zzso zzso clones with an average 135 zzso insert size, was constructed from zzso zzso zzso (red zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso size of zzso zzso Library coverage of zzso zzso zzso ensured good representation of zzso the library was screened for zzso zzso zzso zzso single copy zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified to add to a family of three, previously reported, zzso genes zzso Multiple zzso copies were identified and zzso revealing a zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Six zzso genes clustered within the zzso four separate zzso clones could be assembled onto a predicted zzso zzso single zzso zzso 

A zzso gene family in red zzso resides as a cluster of at least 6 zzso Three of these genes have high zzso suggesting a more recent evolutionary zzso This zzso cluster covers a longer region of the zzso than clusters detected in rice or previously reported in zzso zzso coding sequences from zzso zzso zzso and zzso will facilitate functional studies and provide genetic markers for plant zzso
