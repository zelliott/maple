The zzso zzso gene provides protection against a lethal leaf blight and ear mold disease caused by zzso zzso race 1 zzso Although it was the first zzso zzso gene to be zzso it remains a novelty because, instead of participating in the plant recognition and response system as most DR genes do, zzso zzso the pathogen zzso It does so by zzso an zzso zzso whose function is to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso which the pathogen produces as a key zzso factor to colonize zzso Although zzso is strictly a pathogen of zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso activity are present in the grass family, suggesting an ancient and zzso zzso role of this DR trait in zzso Here, we provide proof for such a role by demonstrating its involvement in zzso resistance of barley to zzso zzso leaves in which expression of the zzso zzso was silenced became susceptible to infection by zzso but only if the pathogen was able to produce HC zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso evolved exclusively and early in the grass zzso Given the devastating ability of zzso to kill zzso these findings imply that the evolution and/or geographical distribution of grasses may have been constrained if zzso did not zzso
