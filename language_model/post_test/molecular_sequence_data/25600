To isolate zzso for forms of zzso zzso from rat zzso a zzso zzso zzso library from this tissue was screened with a mixture of zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso binding region of different zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso zzso a part of a novel form of zzso zzso was isolated and the deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a member of the same zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from zzso of zzso rats revealed that two zzso of approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso The level of zzso was induced fivefold above the level in intact animals by zzso treatment of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso levels in different zzso on Northern blots showed high zzso expression of zzso in the zzso but no signal was zzso with zzso from zzso a weak signal was detected in the zzso zzso screening of a rat kidney zzso library led to the isolation of the full-length clone zzso which differs from zzso only in three zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains a zzso open reading frame zzso a protein of 508 zzso zzso In zzso zzso of rat kidney sections with zzso showed that this zzso form is expressed in the outer stripe of the outer zzso indicating its zzso in the zzso zzso
