zzso zzso of zzso zzso is primed by a zzso zzso that zzso to an 18 zzso primer binding site (PBS) on the viral zzso zzso Additional base pair interactions between the zzso primer and the viral zzso have been zzso In particular, base pairing was proposed between the zzso loop of zzso and the zzso loop of a hairpin located immediately upstream of the PBS site in zzso zzso In order to judge the importance of this zzso zzso we performed an extensive zzso analysis of this zzso region in a variety of zzso and human zzso viruses zzso and zzso Both the zzso of natural zzso sequences and the zzso of zzso zzso viruses support the idea that this zzso structure is critical for virus zzso Although this hairpin may play a role in zzso zzso and/or initiation of reverse transcription, the proposed base pairing interaction between the zzso loop of the zzso hairpin and the zzso of the zzso zzso is not directly supported by this zzso
