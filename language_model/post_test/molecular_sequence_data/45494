zzso zzso 4 and zzso form a zzso for zzso zzso a major constituent of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that binds to zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso and is a critical part of the zzso zzso Here we have shown that the level of zzso expression regulates zzso zzso by zzso Using zzso zzso we have found that zzso has no effect on zzso function as a membrane zzso for zzso We used zzso zzso to identify regions of human zzso that are important for zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso in the zzso 46 zzso acids of zzso did not substantially diminish zzso zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were important for zzso zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are identified as important in zzso zzso but not surface expression of membrane zzso The function of soluble zzso is somewhat more sensitive to zzso than membrane zzso Our results suggest that the zzso and zzso regions of soluble zzso bind to zzso The region zzso is not involved in zzso binding but affects zzso of soluble zzso as well as zzso zzso We define the zzso binding region of zzso soluble zzso as a cluster of basic zzso zzso Studies on both membrane and soluble zzso suggest that zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso binding are separate as well as zzso By mapping these regions on a three-dimensional model, we show the likely binding regions of zzso to zzso and zzso
