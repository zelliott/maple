This study shows that the expression of zzso an in zzso expression zzso zzso and the stress response regulatory genes zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The deletion of zzso or zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso an zzso or zzso zzso After zzso or zzso treatment, the deletion of zzso reduced bacterial zzso These effects could be zzso by introducing the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein containing only the zzso domain exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has lower levels of zzso zzso The zzso deletion zzso also exhibited increased zzso oxygen species zzso formation, zzso damage, and zzso stress scavenging zzso In addition, the zzso deletion reduced zzso zzso production in the bacteria, but increased the zzso in mice, zzso formation, and type 3 zzso major zzso zzso zzso Finally, a comparative zzso analysis showed 34 zzso and 29 zzso genes with the increased production of zzso The activated gene products include zzso I, zzso heat shock zzso zzso and zzso and proteins for energy metabolism zzso cell surface structure, and zzso zzso In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that zzso positively regulates the zzso stress response and mouse zzso but zzso affects the zzso formation and type 3 zzso expression by altering the zzso levels after receiving zzso stress signaling zzso
