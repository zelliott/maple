zzso of the zzso zzso and transport genes in bacteria is rather diverse and involves two zzso regulatory systems and at least three zzso zzso In particular, the zzso metabolism in zzso bacteria was known to be controlled by the zzso and zzso mechanisms, both acting on the level of premature termination of zzso Using comparative analysis of zzso zzso and regulatory zzso we described the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in available zzso of zzso zzso A large number of zzso zzso elements were zzso zzso were shown to be widely distributed in zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso occurred mostly in zzso A candidate binding signal zzso for a hypothetical zzso regulator, possibly zzso was identified in zzso the only family in the zzso group of zzso bacteria having neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso regulatory sites zzso by zzso context analysis lead to identification of new members of the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso and reconstruction of the zzso metabolism in various bacterial zzso In particular, we found candidate zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as new zzso forming the zzso recycling zzso zzso zzso zzso in various bacterial species are quite zzso In particular, zzso zzso possibly uses a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso to substitute missing zzso zzso zzso
