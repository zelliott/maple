A zzso zzso strain resistant to zzso and zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso sampled from the coast of the zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso resistance were localized on an zzso zzso zzso zzso It was shown that the zzso resistance region of this zzso has a mosaic structure and contains closely linked zzso resistance zzso and zzso resistance zzso zzso followed by a novel IS element zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso genes of zzso were highly similar to those found in modern clinical bacterial zzso It was shown that the zzso element of zzso can direct zzso of the adjacent zzso resistance genes to different target zzso either by zzso zzso or by formation of a composite zzso resulting from the zzso of the zzso second copy at the other side of the zzso resistance zzso Thus, our data demonstrate that clinically important zzso resistance genes originated long before the introduction of antibiotics into clinical practice and confirm an important role of horizontal gene transfer in the distribution of these genes in natural bacterial zzso
