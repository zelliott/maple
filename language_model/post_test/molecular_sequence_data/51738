It is shown that the second zzso zzso zzso zzso product of zzso zzso zzso and zzso product of zzso zzso are a group of closely related proteins containing a modified version of the zzso zzso zzso with a drastic substitution of zzso for a zzso zzso They are zzso but reliably related to the product of gene I of zzso zzso which is a putative zzso containing the classical zzso motif and is involved in zzso assembly and exit from the bacterial zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso and gene I product may have a similar zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso may possess zzso activity and modify the membrane structure of its target cells in an zzso zzso Genes for zzso and the related protein of zzso are likely to have evolved from gene I of a zzso zzso
