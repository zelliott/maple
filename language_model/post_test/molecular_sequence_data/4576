zzso zzso A and related zzso and zzso peptides were tested for their ability to produce motor effects in zzso Central zzso administration of zzso A in mice produced marked motor effects characterized by wild running, zzso circling and/or barrel rolling with an zzso value of zzso zzso confidence limits, zzso zzso The order of potency of the various zzso zzso peptides and fragments in producing motor effects was zzso A approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso B approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) (or zzso and zzso zzso displayed no motor effect at doses up to 100 zzso The zzso of zzso A and zzso zzso were not affected by zzso of zzso (5 zzso zzso but the motor effects of zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso were significantly reduced by zzso of low doses zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A was also a potent inhibitor of the binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to rat brain zzso with a Ki value of zzso zzso However, the order of potency of the various zzso zzso peptides and fragments in zzso zzso binding did not correlate with their ability to produce motor zzso On the other hand, zzso A and related peptides produced a significant zzso of the binding of the competitive zzso zzso zzso to rat brain zzso an effect that correlated well zzso zzso zzso with their potency in producing motor zzso These results indicate that the zzso motor effects of zzso A and related peptides are structure dependent, with zzso zzso being the minimal core zzso for motor zzso In addition, these effects most likely involve the participation of the zzso zzso acid binding domain on the zzso zzso zzso
