We report on the zzso biological function, and a plausible mode of action of a new group of zzso with potent zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are derived from positively charged peptides containing zzso and zzso acids zzso that are zzso zzso at their N zzso The peptides investigated have the sequence zzso where X zzso zzso Ala, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The data revealed that zzso and zzso gained potent zzso and zzso activity despite the fact that both parental peptides were completely devoid of any activity toward zzso and model zzso zzso In contrast, zzso lost the potent zzso activity of the parental zzso but gained and preserved partial zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso and its zzso analog were inactive toward bacteria, and only the zzso zzso was highly potent toward zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were also endowed with zzso zzso zzso of action studies were performed by using zzso zzso and attenuated total zzso zzso transform infrared and circular zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso with bacteria and zzso The data suggest that the zzso act by increasing the zzso of the cell membrane and that differences in their potency and target specificity are the result of differences in their zzso state and ability to zzso and insert into the zzso zzso These results provide insight regarding a new approach of modulating zzso and the zzso of zzso interacting peptides in order to zzso them with both zzso and zzso activities urgently needed to combat bacterial and zzso zzso
