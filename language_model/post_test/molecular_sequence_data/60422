zzso of several zzso regions have been observed in human breast zzso One such region, zzso is amplified in zzso of tumor zzso Although the zzso gene is located close to this region, and is often included within the zzso the observation that tumors exhibiting zzso amplification do not always zzso zzso suggests that another gene located close to zzso is involved in the zzso zzso We now report the precise location of four expressed sequence tags zzso within this region and the cloning of a novel zzso designated zzso zzso zzso coiled zzso gene 1), which encodes an 8 zzso transcript and which is expressed at high levels during early zzso zzso expression of this gene under the control of the zzso zzso promoter in mouse zzso results in cellular transformation and zzso independent growth, suggesting that inappropriate expression can impart a zzso zzso This observation raises the possibility that amplification of zzso could promote zzso growth, thereby making zzso an attractive candidate for the gene promoting zzso as a result of the zzso amplification in human breast zzso
