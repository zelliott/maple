Two novel zzso zzso zzso gliding and zzso bacteria, designated strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from different marine environments and studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis placed the strains within the family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were most closely related to the type strains of recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The strains grew with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gelatin were zzso but zzso zzso DNA and zzso were zzso The zzso data taken together with the results of the zzso and zzso studies permit the zzso of strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso as members of a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
