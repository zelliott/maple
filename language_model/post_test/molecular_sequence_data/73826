zzso zzso is a zzso capable of expressing large amounts of some zzso When expression zzso are introduced into zzso zzso individual zzso typically express widely varying amounts of zzso Because clones expressing the highest level of protein occur infrequently during the transformation process, finding them can be very zzso We developed an zzso based filter screening method that rapidly detects zzso zzso large amounts of a zzso zzso We have applied this method to the expression of a soluble zzso form of zzso a zzso that regulates zzso zzso Using this method, we identified zzso with one to 13 copies of the zzso expression zzso zzso expression was obtained with clones containing eight or more copies of the expression zzso and a clone with eight copies was selected for further zzso High cell density zzso of this clone using a mixed zzso feed yielded 255 zzso zzso per liter of zzso
