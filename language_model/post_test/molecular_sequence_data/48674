In order to study the defense strategies activated by zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso doses of zzso we compared the induced transcripts to that of control zzso by suppression zzso zzso zzso We isolated five zzso zzso zzso and other genes related to detoxification, to signaling zzso zzso to zzso reductive and zzso zzso to zzso maturation and protein zzso zzso analysis revealed that two of the five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes appeared to be zzso expressed and zzso following cadmium treatment, whereas the other three genes zzso zzso zzso are specifically zzso in response to cadmium zzso Moreover, we found that this zzso induction is concentration dependent and that the cadmium concentration threshold for the gene zzso is distinct for every zzso zzso experiments showed in fact that, among induced zzso zzso gene is activated at a very low cadmium concentration zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are activated at intermediate doses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes increase significantly their expression only in zzso treated with the highest dose zzso zzso zzso We found also that, in response to a lethal dose of cadmium (1 zzso only zzso and zzso zzso levels increased zzso These data suggest a zzso and orchestrated response of the zzso zzso zzso to overcome differential environmental zzso that could interfere with a normal zzso
