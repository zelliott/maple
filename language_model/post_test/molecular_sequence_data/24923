The giant protein is a short-range zzso zzso that zzso the expression pattern of gap and zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and snail zzso the zzso zzso for repression, but it is not known whether a functional interaction with zzso is a general property of all short-range zzso We studied giant repression activity in a zzso zzso and find that this zzso is required for giant repression of some, but not all, zzso While targets of giant such as the zzso stripe 2 zzso and a synthetic zzso reporter show clear zzso in the zzso zzso another giant target, the zzso zzso is expressed zzso A more complex situation is seen with regulation of the zzso zzso in which one zzso is zzso by giant in a zzso manner, while another is zzso in a zzso zzso These results demonstrate that giant can repress both via zzso and zzso zzso and that promoter context is critical for determining zzso functional zzso To initiate zzso studies of the giant repression activity, we have identified a minimal repression domain within giant that encompasses zzso zzso including an zzso zzso region bearing a putative zzso binding zzso
