Currently used zzso drugs against zzso breast cancer, and zzso drugs used in treatment of zzso are associated with risk zzso zzso there is a strong need to develop selective zzso zzso zzso with better tissue zzso In a recent study zzso 2002, zzso 3, zzso we used a zzso zzso to zzso zzso to screen a zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognizes zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso but not zzso and displays zzso activity in zzso and in zzso In this study, we designed and prepared peptides based on zzso zzso which possess improved zzso activity, by evaluating their binding to zzso and to zzso Initially, we determined the minimal binding sequence of zzso zzso capable of binding zzso and zzso zzso systematic zzso replacements of the minimal zzso followed by zzso zzso yielded zzso and zzso with increased affinities to zzso and to zzso The most promising zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind zzso with high affinity zzso of 6 and 30 zzso respectively), recognize zzso with increased affinity zzso of 100 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and possess zzso activity in zzso The short peptides described in this study may be used as potential lead compounds for developing new zzso zzso
