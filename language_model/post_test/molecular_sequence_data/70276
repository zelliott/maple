zzso X-ray zzso studies were carried out for the title compounds at room zzso The crystal zzso are of the cage-type and zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso In both crystal structures, disorder and extensive zzso zzso of the zzso guest molecules are zzso In beta zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso zzso over two discrete zzso and three water molecules (four discrete zzso are included in the beta CD zzso Within the beta CD zzso all oxygen sites zzso and zzso are in positions occupied by water molecules in beta zzso this is only possible because the zzso zzso zzso adopts the low-energy zzso with the zzso zzso angle approximately 60 degrees and an zzso separation of zzso A, in which its zzso groups can directly substitute for two zzso water zzso In beta zzso one zzso zzso zzso over two discrete zzso and two water molecules zzso fully occupied zzso are included in the beta CD zzso The general situation in both compounds parallels that found earlier in beta zzso It is assumed that the disorder is zzso zzso associated with jumps between the partially occupied molecular zzso
