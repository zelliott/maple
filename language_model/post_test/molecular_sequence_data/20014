zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso in Japanese pear fruit has an important role in accumulating zzso during fruit enlargement and regulates the zzso ratio in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were cloned from Japanese pear fruit and their zzso acid sequences share zzso zzso zzso was confirmed to code zzso zzso zzso zzso The roles of zzso and zzso genes throughout fruit development and in sugar composition were investigated by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis using specific zzso of their zzso zzso transcript had a maximum level at 34 days after full bloom zzso and decreased rapidly during fruit zzso zzso transcript increased gradually during fruit growth from 34 zzso had its maximum level at 79 zzso and remained high until 107 zzso at active fruit zzso The activity of zzso was highest at 34 zzso decreased during fruit growth until 66 zzso remained almost the same during early fruit enlargement until 79 zzso and then decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso began accumulating predominantly during fruit enlargement from 66 zzso zzso began increasing rapidly during fruit maturation from 121 zzso High expression of zzso transcript and high zzso activity in the young fruit stage seems to have an important role in zzso a lot of zzso for energy needed for cell division and growth by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression during fruit enlargement may lead to rapid cell expansion through increased zzso pressure by zzso of a large amount of zzso in the zzso
