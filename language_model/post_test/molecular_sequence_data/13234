A role for zzso in zzso chain termination was indicated several years ago by isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli that suppressed zzso zzso In this paper, we describe another interesting zzso zzso selected as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The finding that it suppresses zzso at two positions in zzso and does not suppress the other two termination zzso zzso and zzso at the same zzso positions (or several zzso zzso including zzso available at one of the two zzso suggests a zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was mapped by zzso zzso exchanges and in zzso suppression to domain II of the zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a single base change of G to A at zzso zzso an almost universally zzso base in a highly zzso region known to have specific interactions with zzso zzso zzso factor G, zzso in the zzso and the zzso region of zzso zzso Several avenues of action of the zzso zzso are suggested, including altered interactions with release factors, zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso Regardless of the zzso the results indicate that a particular zzso in zzso zzso affects zzso chain zzso specifically in decoding of the zzso termination zzso
