The zzso zzso gene was identified in a zzso screen using the zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso as zzso zzso was shown to zzso an essential, highly zzso protein that associated principally with free zzso zzso zzso zzso of a truncated form of zzso lacking 100 zzso zzso acids and most of its zzso domain, had zzso effects on both cell growth and protein synthesis and promoted the formation of zzso zzso These effects were eliminated by zzso of an additional 100 zzso acids from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso also led to increased synthesis and zzso of some zzso protein zzso and increased synthesis and altered processing of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso has a role in the formation, function, or maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso and may provide a link for zzso to zzso zzso
