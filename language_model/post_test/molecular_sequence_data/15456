zzso family, also called the zzso family, is a newly discovered gene family involved in development and innate zzso However, no research was carried out for this gene family in the model zzso zzso Here we present the first characterization of seven zzso zzso zzso and the first systematic comparative analysis of zzso from various species in order to provide some clues to the function and evolution of this gene zzso We examined the expression patterns of zzso in various development zzso normal adults, and zzso zzso infected zzso zzso showed that zzso were highly expressed in one or several adult zzso zzso however, were expressed at quite low levels both in adults and various development zzso and some of them showed relaxation of functional zzso as revealed by zzso zzso Of the seven zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in the liver and highly zzso upon infection, suggesting its important roles in zzso Based on the characterization of zzso zzso we then conducted a systematic survey of zzso members in various species and made comparative zzso We found out that zzso family may be a zzso specific gene family; and their expression patterns, zzso structures and zzso vary considerably among various species, though their sequences are highly zzso Moreover, these varied features have evolved multiple times independently in different species, resulting in zzso protein structures and expression zzso
