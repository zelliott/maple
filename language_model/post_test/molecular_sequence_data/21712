zzso are the key molecules in innate immune system and possess high zzso zzso In the present study, a full-length zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and characterized by expressed sequence tag zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso techniques from kelp zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso pairs zzso with a zzso open reading frame zzso that encodes zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso signal sequence zzso The deduced zzso sequence zzso had a predicted molecular weight of zzso and theoretical zzso point of zzso The deduced zzso sequence have a long zzso domain which contains all zzso sites and other zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso alignments showed a higher identity zzso with zzso zzso zzso and low identity zzso with zzso of insect zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis revealed that the kelp grouper zzso was more closely related to other fish and zzso zzso zzso real-time reverse zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts are zzso expressed in zzso zzso such as heart, zzso and kidney after stimulation with zzso or infection with zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in the innate immunity of kelp zzso This study is a first step on the zzso and functions of the zzso zzso in kelp zzso and their role in zzso activity with reference to zzso properties which might have zzso zzso
