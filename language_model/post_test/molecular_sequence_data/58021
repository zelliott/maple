The location and description of zzso on proteins describe the basis of zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso This allows the first comparison of zzso predictions from extensive zzso zzso experiments, coupled with biological activity studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 88, zzso with those from zzso zzso There are 14 zzso acid zzso of zzso coli zzso that interact with the zzso zzso zzso Nine of these were correctly assigned by the zzso zzso Of the 5 remaining zzso zzso could not be zzso two others appear to have critical roles in determining protein zzso the other 2 zzso have a minimal effect on zzso binding since they are located on the periphery of the zzso with one face of their side chains in van der zzso contact with the zzso and the other face in contact with zzso Four zzso were incorrectly assigned to the zzso These zzso were located adjacent to zzso zzso that were likely zzso by these zzso This study demonstrates that zzso which caused greater than zzso changes in zzso binding affinity were correctly assigned to the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso are also presented in order to minimize incorrect zzso
