Two forms of chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified by reverse zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso The shorter form of chicken zzso zzso encodes a protein that does not contain an analogue of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or human zzso zzso zzso zzso The larger form encodes both zzso and a chicken analogue of zzso zzso in the same protein zzso Three zzso zzso isolated from a chicken zzso zzso library were derived from the shorter zzso zzso analysis of the longest clone identified an open reading frame that codes for a 165 zzso acid zzso protein and contains two zzso zzso In zzso zzso with an zzso probe from the zzso zzso sequence showed that zzso zzso occurs in cells in the zzso zzso an area of the brain known to contain zzso zzso zzso zzso of total zzso from liver, zzso gut, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso showed that the shorter form of zzso zzso is present in all of these zzso The sequence of the longer form of zzso zzso was obtained by sequencing a portion of the zzso gene from zzso zzso This revealed a potential zzso that was not represented in the zzso zzso clones zzso zzso with zzso from this sequence showed that it was expressed in the gut and zzso zzso protection zzso confirmed the presence of the two forms of zzso in gut and zzso The relative proportions of the two zzso forms were: zzso zzso only, zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso only, zzso zzso in the zzso In conclusion, chicken zzso zzso is alternatively zzso The shortest form, which encodes a zzso containing only the zzso zzso is the most zzso The longer form of chicken zzso zzso encodes a zzso containing sequences for both zzso and a chicken form of zzso
