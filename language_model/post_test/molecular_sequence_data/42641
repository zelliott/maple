To examine some of the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso of the zzso Northern zzso analyses with a series of zzso identified two regions where distinct zzso of the multiple zzso gene transcripts zzso suggesting the presence of two promoters in the zzso zzso activities for two gene fragments encompassing these regions, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated in transient zzso experiments using reporter zzso containing the gene fragments linked individually upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso containing two upstream zzso binding sites into primary cultures of rat zzso cells with a zzso expressing a zzso DNA binding zzso zzso region fusion protein resulted in a zzso increase in zzso activity relative to cells zzso with either reporter and a zzso expressing only the zzso DNA binding zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was assessed by zzso into zzso breast cancer cells, which contain high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso In primary rat zzso cells, which contain lower levels of zzso zzso required the addition of one upstream consensus zzso response element zzso to be zzso zzso whereas zzso required the addition of two zzso Point and deletion zzso of the zzso promoter region in the zzso reporter, screened in zzso cells, were used to identify a zzso pair zzso zzso that retained the promoter activity and 50% of the zzso zzso of zzso This zzso contained an zzso sequence zzso in 8 of 10 positions relative to the consensus zzso Two copies of this sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso when placed upstream of the zzso promoter in zzso To examine zzso stimulation of the two zzso gene promoters by zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso containing two upstream consensus zzso were zzso into zzso zzso cells with an zzso expression zzso zzso by zzso was greater than zzso for both zzso Treatment of the cells with agents that increase zzso zzso levels, namely zzso toxin plus zzso zzso resulted in zzso activity that was zzso and 51% of the zzso activity for the P and zzso zzso zzso
