The bay zzso zzso zzso zzso introduced from North America, has become one of the most important aquaculture species in zzso zzso effort to identify zzso genes involved in host defense, a high-quality zzso library was constructed from whole body zzso of the bay zzso A total of zzso successful sequencing reactions yielded zzso expressed sequence tags zzso longer than 100 zzso zzso and assembly analyses of the zzso identified zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso totaling zzso unique zzso Basic Local zzso Search zzso zzso analysis showed that the majority zzso of the unique sequences had no significant zzso zzso zzso zzso to sequences in zzso Among the zzso sequences with significant zzso matches, 160 zzso were for genes related to zzso 131 zzso for zzso defense, 124 zzso for zzso zzso 83 zzso for cell zzso 70 zzso for cell zzso 17 zzso for cell division, and zzso zzso matched to genes of unknown zzso The list of zzso genes included many genes with known and important roles in innate defense such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study provides a significant number of zzso for gene discovery and candidate genes for studying host defense in scallops and other zzso
