A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was disrupted with a zzso resistance cassette in zzso zzso zzso zzso which produces zzso The deduced zzso from zzso consisted of 354 zzso acid zzso sharing zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso isolated previously from zzso zzso zzso zzso The knockout zzso was unable to produce zzso but only zzso zzso that zzso encodes a zzso zzso which is responsible for transfer of the second sugar zzso acid in zzso zzso The zzso was affected in its zzso zzso content and growth rate, which were zzso and zzso respectively, of wild type, demonstrating that the second sugar zzso is still required for quantitative maintenance of zzso This supports the previous suggestion that zzso may contribute to high cellular concentration of zzso zzso
