In patients infected with the zzso C virus zzso a zzso population of zzso so-called zzso exists in zzso The zzso regions zzso within the second envelope gene zzso show particularly highly zzso zzso and are considered to be the target of zzso zzso The aims of the study were to zzso a zzso primer set for amplification of zzso and to establish a sensitive zzso analysis for rapid and zzso detection of zzso serum zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso technique, changes of zzso composition were investigated in five chronically infected patients with zzso before and during zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed by sequence and zzso zzso In addition, serial zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso The zzso analysis was performed at two time points before and during zzso therapy, zzso Four patients showed an zzso of the zzso pattern during the first three months of zzso therapy, whereas in one patient the zzso pattern changed before therapy and remained stable during treatment with zzso The present approach for zzso analysis of single strand zzso zzso provides a zzso zzso and sensitive technique for detection of the zzso population of zzso zzso of different zzso Using this test zzso investigations of large zzso of patients with chronic zzso C can be zzso
