zzso identification and partial characterization of zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso It has been shown to have activity against zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso consisting of gel exclusion followed by zzso exchange zzso produced a single band upon an zzso gel with a molecular weight corresponding to 56 zzso The isolated protein contained zzso zzso acids and the first 151 were zzso The zzso contained a high percentage of zzso zzso acids near the zzso zzso zzso acids in the central region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso This structure did not match with that of previously reported zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was determined against some pathogens and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso found in saliva and zzso zzso The zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso at the minimum zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso zzso but was found not to inhibit the other oral zzso The zzso was found from transmission electron zzso studies to cause pore formation in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the pole and induce zzso zzso zzso zzso of two to four times of zzso were shown to induce zzso The zzso was zzso surviving at 110 degrees C under pressure and possessed activity over a pH range of zzso Only a small reduction of activity was found to occur after incubation in biological zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A novel zzso has been identified that has selective activity against zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso 

The findings of this work gained the knowledge of specific zzso activity of zzso against zzso zzso
