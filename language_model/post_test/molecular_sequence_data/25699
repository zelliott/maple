A zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso isolated from zzso tissue of zzso rats was screened for rat zzso zzso The first screen, utilizing a human zzso zzso zzso provided rat zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso of zzso coding sequence and extended into the zzso zzso A subsequent screen using a zzso rat zzso zzso clone yielded clones extending into the zzso signal sequence coding zzso zzso analysis of these clones has provided the complete derived zzso acid sequence of rat zzso and allowed alignment and comparison with published bovine zzso zzso While the overall structure of rat zzso is similar to bovine zzso numerous zzso zzso and insertions demonstrated considerable zzso between zzso In particular, the zzso repeat zzso characteristic of all zzso analyzed to date, is replaced in rat zzso by a repeating zzso zzso The zzso repeat zzso the bovine zzso zzso binding zzso is not zzso by rat zzso zzso Variations in coding sequence between rat zzso zzso clones were also found which may represent zzso zzso produced by alternative zzso of the rat zzso zzso
