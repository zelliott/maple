Ran zzso plays essential roles in multiple cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso nuclear envelope zzso zzso The zzso Ran zzso zzso protein zzso is critical to establish a functional zzso zzso across the zzso and is associated with the outer surface of the zzso in zzso and higher plant zzso zzso zzso zzso association with the root tip zzso requires a family of likely zzso zzso combining zzso and zzso zzso zzso and WPP zzso proteins zzso We have now identified, by tandem affinity zzso coupled with mass zzso a second family of zzso zzso structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the zzso family, that is required for zzso zzso association in root tip zzso A combination of zzso zzso analysis and protein interaction data indicates that at least one member of each zzso zzso protein family is required for zzso targeting in root tip cells, while both families are zzso in other plant zzso This suggests an unanticipated complexity of zzso zzso targeting in higher plant cells, contrasting both the single zzso anchor in zzso and the lack of targeting in zzso and proposes an early evolutionary divergence of the underlying plant and animal zzso
