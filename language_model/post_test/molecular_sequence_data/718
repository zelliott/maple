Gene zzso in mouse embryonic stem zzso cells enables zzso zzso zzso zzso across the zzso of this model zzso About 135,000 trapped zzso cell lines are made available to the scientific community by the International Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso A search of one of its databases identified an zzso cell line zzso with a zzso gene trap zzso zzso zzso in zzso 5 of zzso a gene that encodes an zzso zzso zzso which is implicated in zzso movement and zzso asymmetry in zzso zzso We have determined the exact zzso zzso point in the zzso zzso cell clone zzso and confirmed the production of a zzso transcript consisting of the upstream zzso zzso and the gene trap zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso This zzso cell line was used to generate zzso zzso zzso mice, which were further crossed to obtain zzso zzso In contrast to zzso documented essential role during zzso and zzso controlled zzso early zzso zzso mice were born with a normal zzso zzso However, subsequent analysis of these zzso mice has revealed a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that was already present in the zzso cell zzso Based on our detailed analysis presented here, we suggest an extensive procedure for the characterization of gene trap zzso cell lines prior to generating gene trap mice with zzso
