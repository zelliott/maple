The zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso is composed of two zzso alpha and zzso Both chains belong to the zzso of zzso receptors characterized by a common structural feature, zzso the presence of at least two zzso folds in the zzso domain, which was first identified in the growth hormone zzso The zzso zzso zzso chain zzso low affinity binding only zzso zzso whereas the other chain, zzso does not bind zzso by itself but zzso high affinity binding when associated with zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to define the assembly of the zzso complex at the molecular level through zzso zzso guided by zzso modeling with the growth hormone zzso zzso In our three-dimensional model, zzso of zzso located in the zzso loop and close to the zzso zzso is in the vicinity of the zzso zzso suggesting the possibility of zzso interaction between these two zzso Through site directed zzso we provide several lines of evidence indicating the importance of zzso interaction in zzso zzso First, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding in the absence of beta common zzso zzso binding was restored in the presence of zzso with, nonetheless, a significant shift from high zzso zzso toward low affinity (from 2 to 13 zzso The rank order of the zzso constant for the different zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso Met zzso zzso suggesting the importance of the charge at this zzso Second, a zzso zzso with charge reversal zzso at position zzso exhibited a zzso decrease in affinity in zzso zzso whereas charge zzso or conservative zzso were the least affected zzso Third, removal of the charge at position zzso of zzso introduced a zzso decrease in the association rate constant and only a zzso change in the zzso rate constant, suggesting that zzso is implicated in zzso recognition, possibly through interaction with zzso of zzso For all zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso required for membrane zzso zzso to nuclear events zzso promoter zzso and cell proliferation zzso zzso were in the same range, indicating that the threshold for zzso activity is governed mainly by the affinity of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of other zzso in the immediate vicinity of zzso was less zzso zzso alignment and modeling of zzso zzso and zzso identified an zzso zzso at the tip of a beta turn in a highly divergent context at the zzso loop, close to a zzso structural element, the zzso zzso suggesting the possibility of a zzso association mechanism similar to the one described zzso for zzso
