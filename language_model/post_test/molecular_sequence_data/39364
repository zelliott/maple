zzso proteins are assumed to contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso due to their degrading capacity that is required for tissue zzso In this study, a zzso zzso gene was demonstrated in a highly virulent zzso zzso causing strain with zzso zzso This gene was detected in both, the zzso DNA and the zzso by zzso and subsequent zzso The gene zzso comprises about 500 zzso and exhibits high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso strains with zzso T4 and zzso The detection of a zzso zzso in this zzso zzso strain is zzso because while T4 is the most common zzso among zzso zzso strains and also zzso is known to be associated with disease, this is the only virulent zzso zzso strain known to zzso Obviously, this zzso zzso represents a common tool in zzso processes during zzso zzso
