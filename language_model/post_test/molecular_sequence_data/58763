A large zzso efficacy trial of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccines was conducted in zzso at 24 sites across the United zzso Protection was zzso and zzso against all zzso but zzso and zzso against very severe zzso for the two vaccines, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso strain, whose zzso protein is nearly identical to that of the D strain of zzso contained in both vaccines, did not correlate with protection against subsequent illness with zzso zzso This result raised the possibility that in infants who developed zzso zzso zzso to zzso breakthrough zzso vaccine zzso occurrence of zzso zzso after zzso may have been due to infection by zzso strains that were sufficiently zzso distinct from the vaccine strain to evade the zzso zzso zzso by zzso To test this hypothesis, we initially compared zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso against zzso and zzso breakthrough strains using zzso from subjects who experienced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso by vaccination were significantly zzso zzso zzso greater than to the breakthrough strains subsequently obtained from these zzso This difference did not, however, correlate with lack of protection since similar differences in zzso to zzso and breakthrough strains were found using zzso zzso from zzso who either experienced zzso zzso infections or no zzso To determine the genetic basis for these differences, we compared the zzso gene sequences of zzso with vaccine strain D, 12 zzso breakthrough zzso and 3 zzso control strains isolated during the same trial from zzso zzso All breakthrough strains were distinct from zzso and D in zzso important regions throughout the zzso zzso but these differences were zzso between breakthrough and zzso zzso Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the deduced zzso sequences form zzso genes of zzso zzso from 12 countries indicated that four distinct lineages have zzso All breakthrough and control strains from the zzso vaccine trial were in a lineage different from strain D, the zzso zzso vaccine zzso Although the overall results do not support our original hypothesis that immune selection of zzso distinct escape zzso led to vaccine breakthrough in subjects with a zzso response to zzso it cannot be excluded that breakthrough could be partially due to zzso differences in the zzso proteins of currently circulating zzso zzso
