The zzso levels of zzso zzso by three zzso genes of zzso virus, zzso zzso and zzso were compared with those zzso by zzso zzso and late-stage zzso After zzso infection of zzso cells, the early zzso was detected within 20 zzso and peaked at about 100 zzso all three intermediate zzso were detected at 100 zzso and peaked at about 120 zzso and the late zzso was detected at 140 zzso and increased zzso Upon reaching maximum levels, the early and intermediate zzso declined at rates consistent with zzso of about 30 zzso providing the basis for rapid changes in gene zzso Intermediate zzso was not detected when viral DNA synthesis was zzso whereas its zzso was enhanced by blocking translation after removal of the replication zzso The zzso ends of the zzso initiated within a zzso or zzso sequence in the coding DNA strand but contained a zzso leader of up to 30 additional zzso zzso bands of zzso and zzso zzso equal to and longer than the coding region, were resolved by zzso gel zzso suggesting preferred sites of zzso formation that did not correlate with early gene termination zzso The zzso sequences were investigated by constructing zzso viruses containing zzso intermediate promoters preceding the zzso reporter zzso The effects of zzso on expression were similar to those previously obtained by zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moss, zzso zzso zzso zzso providing further evidence for functional core, zzso and zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso zzso promoter was created by making four zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
