The zzso zzso are unusual zzso in that they can zzso protein zzso containing zzso as well as zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso share the active site motif zzso but display little zzso acid sequence identity outside of the active zzso Although the zzso zzso and the zzso appear to bring about zzso zzso zzso through a similar zzso it is not clear what causes the difference in the zzso specificity between the two groups of zzso In this paper, we show that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso is rather zzso toward small zzso zzso (including both zzso and zzso zzso of primary zzso with effectively identical zzso and zzso values while the zzso values of the leaving groups zzso or zzso varied from 7 to zzso Linear zzso relationship analysis of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso reaction suggests that a uniform mechanism is zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso The very small dependency of zzso on the leaving group zzso can be accounted for by the zzso of the leaving zzso zzso burst kinetic analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso provides direct kinetic evidence for the involvement of a zzso intermediate in the dual specificity zzso zzso The zzso step for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the decomposition of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
