A sensitive method of screening for dominant T cell clones in small samples of DNA has been developed using the zzso chain reaction to amplify and identify T cell gamma zzso gene zzso It can detect such zzso in zzso quantities of DNA from cultured T cell zzso even in the presence of zzso parts of zzso zzso zzso DNA, and works with DNA extracted from zzso sections of cloned T cells which have been fixed in zzso zzso zzso reactions have been obtained in preliminary tests on 8 of 10 zzso T cell zzso but in 0 of 10 zzso zzso zzso
