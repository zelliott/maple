Recent studies have begun to reveal that numerous fundamental zzso pathways in bacteria are regulated by zzso residing within certain zzso zzso These zzso selectively bind zzso and zzso gene expression in response to changing zzso zzso Previously, we provided evidence that the zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso each carry a zzso zzso zzso that causes zzso translation of the zzso zzso protein at elevated zzso zzso zzso we use a zzso analysis to define a consensus sequence and secondary structure model for the zzso binding domain of this zzso zzso zzso structures that conform to this model are widespread in both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we find that the zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso carries an zzso motif that matches this consensus zzso zzso and genetic characterization of this motif confirms that the zzso directly binds zzso zzso and that it likely serves as a genetic control element for regulating expression of the zzso zzso for zzso production in this zzso
