zzso zzso of crop plants by non-native strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso is promoted without clear evidence for symbiotic effectiveness and zzso zzso To address such gaps, the forage zzso zzso zzso was zzso in an zzso field trial with two zzso of zzso zzso differing in their nuclear zzso sequences from native zzso zzso The zzso were traced by zzso with a novel combination of the universal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which target the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso were classified by restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso The two applied zzso zzso were successfully traced and zzso from native strains in roots sampled from the field up to 2 zzso post zzso Moreover, field zzso with zzso of non-native zzso of zzso zzso appeared to have zzso root colonization and yield of zzso zzso zzso Proof of zzso success and sustained positive effects on biomass production and quality of zzso zzso crop plants hold promise for the role that AM zzso zzso could play in zzso
