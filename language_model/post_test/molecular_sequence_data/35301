zzso dynamics simulations have been used to characterize the effects of transfer from zzso solution to a vacuum to inform our understanding of mass zzso of zzso zzso We compared two membrane protein zzso (an zzso bundle versus a zzso and two different zzso types zzso versus an zzso zzso with respect to protein stability and zzso zzso The zzso membrane protein remained stable as a zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso formed zzso zzso interactions with an zzso membrane protein after zzso zzso inversion driven by zzso in zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso sugar zzso resisted zzso zzso maintaining the zzso zzso of the zzso This helps to explain the relative stability of membrane proteins in the presence of zzso sugar zzso such as zzso zzso
