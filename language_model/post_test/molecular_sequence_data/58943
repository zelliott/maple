zzso programmed zzso breakage occurs during formation of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso signal directing breakage has been most rigorously defined in zzso zzso where it consists of a zzso DNA sequence known as zzso for zzso breakage zzso We have identified sequences identical or nearly identical to the zzso zzso zzso at sites of breakage zzso the zzso zzso zzso locus of six additional species of zzso as well as members of two related zzso Other general features of the breakage site are also zzso but surprisingly, the orientation and number of copies of zzso are not always zzso suggesting the occurrence of zzso zzso events over evolutionary zzso At one end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a pair of short zzso repeats adjacent to zzso directs the formation of a giant zzso zzso We have examined the corresponding sequences from two other zzso zzso We find the sequence to be partially zzso as previously implied from analysis of zzso zzso but of variable length and zzso
