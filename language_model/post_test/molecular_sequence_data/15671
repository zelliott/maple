zzso of zzso oxygen species and zzso free calcium zzso is central to plant zzso zzso are small proteins capable of zzso membrane binding or membrane zzso They possess structural motifs that could support both zzso activity and calcium zzso Here, a zzso zzso zzso preparation caused increases in zzso when added to zzso of zzso zzso roots expressing zzso The pharmacological profile was consistent with zzso zzso (at the zzso plasma membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could therefore zzso zzso zzso As zzso zzso occur in the zzso and plasma zzso they were incorporated at the zzso face of zzso zzso designed to mimic the plasma zzso Here, they generated an zzso zzso zzso zzso at mildly zzso pH that was sensitive to zzso and zzso and had a zzso zzso ratio of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso create a zzso influx zzso directly, particularly during stress responses involving zzso A zzso zzso preparation also demonstrated in zzso zzso activity that appeared independent of zzso zzso In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that plant zzso create zzso transport zzso regulate zzso and may function as zzso in zzso
