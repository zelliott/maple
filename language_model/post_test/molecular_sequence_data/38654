We demonstrate the presence of a new member of the orphan nuclear zzso zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso zzso in mouse which is genetically distinct from the previously characterized mouse zzso zzso The new member of the zzso zzso shows highest zzso acid identity, similar tissue distribution and zzso zzso zzso to the recently described human zzso zzso we therefore zzso it as mouse zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso analysis showed expression of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso zzso zzso kidney and zzso By zzso experiments, we show that zzso is able to activate transcription, acting through binding sites that have been previously characterized as zzso binding zzso The presence of zzso in human and mouse implies that a complex zzso network exists in higher zzso involving a number of zzso members with overlapping yet distinct function and tissue zzso
