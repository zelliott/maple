To identify and colonize an zzso zzso zzso isolated from the healthy zzso 

zzso zzso was identified based on the analysis of its zzso zzso gene sequence zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso gene sequence zzso A spontaneous zzso zzso tolerant to zzso and zzso were isolated by gradually increasing the concentration of the two zzso The zzso were used to assess the ability of zzso to colonize mulberry by different zzso approaches, including stem and leaf zzso seed zzso root soaking and leaf zzso 

zzso belonged to zzso In the zzso tree, zzso was the closest relative to zzso zzso zzso with more than zzso sequences zzso The zzso zzso sequences of zzso have been registered at zzso database under the zzso number zzso Moreover, our results also indicated that the population of strain zzso living in the mulberry zzso decreased as a whole after the treatment of seed zzso The bacterial density inside the mulberry zzso zzso decreased to a steady level 20 days after zzso The population of strain zzso in mulberry leaves and stems after the treatment of root soaking increased first and then zzso 

The strain zzso fell into zzso zzso zzso I as a single zzso Furthermore, the strain zzso could colonize and transmit in zzso while its resistance to plant pathogen was not changed during the process of colonization compared to the original zzso Taken together, we suggest that zzso zzso zzso will play an important role in the biological control of mulberry zzso
