A method is described to obtain zzso zzso threshold zzso zzso These values provide relative reaction thresholds for zzso in the three major zzso fragmentation reactions of zzso zzso to zzso metal zzso The zzso zzso are produced using zzso laser zzso zzso transform mass zzso The zzso for zzso metal zzso zzso and zzso bond and zzso zzso were resolved from the kinetic energy dependence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative strengths of zzso metal zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to evaluate zzso values and the method for obtaining them were performed by studying zzso metal zzso coordinated crown zzso zzso dynamic simulations were also performed to provide insight into the zzso metal zzso binding of zzso zzso The relative zzso thresholds of zzso bond zzso and zzso zzso were determined for various zzso metal zzso coordinated zzso The zzso barriers of zzso bond zzso were found to depend on the size of the zzso metal zzso zzso zzso were found to be independent of the zzso metal zzso but dependent on linkage zzso The results suggest that zzso bond zzso are zzso while zzso zzso are zzso zzso
