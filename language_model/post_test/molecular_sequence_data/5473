Several inherited diseases have been mapped to the zzso tip of human zzso zzso In our recent efforts to clone candidate genes for some of these disorders, we have assembled a zzso and zzso zzso spanning 770 zzso We have identified expressed sequences from this zzso by means of a zzso hybrid selection zzso We present here the isolation, zzso zzso zzso organization, and zzso analysis of one such expressed zzso zzso which had been identified independently and designated zzso zzso is split into 23 zzso and spans an estimated 95 zzso of zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso gene has been identified, and maps within the third zzso We have identified an zzso potentially zzso a protein zzso zzso acids in zzso longer than that described in the zzso zzso The zzso gene was screened for single base pair changes using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and we have identified seven sequence variations within this zzso These zzso can be used as markers in the genetic mapping of other diseases localized to this zzso
