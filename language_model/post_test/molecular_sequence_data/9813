To determine the optimum zzso zzso and zzso of synthetic peptides and zzso to induce protective zzso responses against the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mice were zzso with linear and multiple zzso peptides zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso recognized by protective zzso zzso was included in the following zzso a zzso linear zzso zzso zzso a zzso linear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso containing four branches of zzso zzso and a linear zzso and a zzso in which zzso was zzso zzso with two universal zzso zzso from zzso toxin zzso A zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was included in some zzso The highest specific zzso activity against zzso target cells was obtained with zzso from mice zzso with three doses at zzso intervals of zzso in zzso or zzso Forty percent of the mice zzso with zzso and zzso were protected against zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso induced significantly better zzso than did zzso with the same sequence as a linear zzso or zzso with a mixture of two individual zzso one with the zzso zzso and the second with the zzso zzso
