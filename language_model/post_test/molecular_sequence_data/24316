Mouse abdominal zzso zzso genes are expressed and functionally required in the developing zzso zzso Mice lacking either zzso or zzso two of the zzso zzso zzso exhibit abnormal zzso development similar to that induced by in zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso and zzso expression is zzso zzso by zzso zzso exposure, providing a potential molecular mechanism for zzso zzso tract zzso We have shown previously that zzso can permanently alter zzso zzso gene expression through zzso of the zzso promoter zzso zzso Here we ask whether a similar mechanism also functions to zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression during zzso zzso zzso We mapped the zzso promoter by cloning a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso experiment revealed a zzso start site for the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso sequences demonstrated significant promoter activity, confirming the location of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso performed on eight zzso in zzso and 19 zzso in zzso zzso promoters demonstrated that all these zzso were highly zzso in both control and zzso mice from zzso day 5 to day zzso zzso zzso around zzso and zzso promoters was only observed in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso or zzso gene expression are not associated with zzso changes in their zzso promoters and that gene zzso by zzso zzso exposure may be a zzso zzso
