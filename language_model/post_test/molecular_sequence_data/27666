zzso and support cells of each sensory organ in zzso zzso are most likely derived from a single precursor zzso This cell lineage is affected in zzso zzso zzso zzso of sensory structures, as well as changes in the number of cells expressing cell zzso zzso indicate that sensory zzso in zzso zzso zzso are transformed into zzso zzso support zzso Thus the zzso gene controls the fate of progeny derived from sensory organ zzso The zzso gene has been isolated by the zzso rescue zzso The structure of its predicted product is zzso
