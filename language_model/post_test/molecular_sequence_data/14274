zzso regulate gene expression by zzso translation or directing zzso degradation of their complementary zzso We recently reported that zzso is zzso and its zzso expression zzso cell growth in canine oral zzso melanoma tissue specimens as well as in canine and human zzso melanoma zzso A zzso target database predicted zzso and zzso as putative targets of zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were markedly zzso in human zzso melanoma zzso cells compared with those in human zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso activity of reporter plasmids containing the zzso sequence of either zzso or zzso complementary to zzso The zzso expression of zzso in melanoma cells reduced the levels of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso At the same time, zzso induced cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso such as elevated expression of zzso zzso and other markers for zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest and zzso These results demonstrate a novel role for zzso as a tumor zzso acting by inducing zzso in melanoma zzso
