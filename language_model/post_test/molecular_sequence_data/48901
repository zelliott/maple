Previous studies suggested a role for the death decoy zzso 3 zzso in the zzso of adult systemic lupus zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso to identify zzso that might alter the function of this zzso 

zzso was measured in the serum of 61 patients with juvenile zzso The coding region of the zzso gene was zzso in 100 juvenile and 103 adult patients with zzso together with 500 healthy zzso 

zzso was elevated in the serum of juvenile patients with active zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to patients with inactive disease zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso DNA sequencing identified 2 novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in an adult zzso patient and zzso zzso in a juvenile zzso zzso proteins containing these zzso exhibited altered binding zzso to zzso and they significantly increased zzso zzso compared to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The adult patient with zzso carrying the zzso zzso had significantly increased zzso proliferation compared to 3 zzso controls matched for age, sex, and disease zzso 

zzso may play an zzso role in zzso through either elevated serum levels of zzso zzso or normal levels of zzso zzso proteins that increase zzso zzso
