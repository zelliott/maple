zzso rat zzso zzso expresses a zzso activity that, on the basis of kinetic zzso zzso to the so-called zzso type I zzso In the present study we amplified and zzso several D1 complementary DNA zzso fragments from rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be identical to the previously reported rat liver zzso in the coding region, but 465 zzso shorter on its zzso region, suggesting that the D1 is the same in both zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso was also detected by reverse zzso in zzso zzso from zzso and late pregnant rats, but not in virgin zzso zzso analysis showed a close and direct correlation between zzso content and zzso specific activity in zzso zzso Our results also show that rat liver contains both D1 zzso forms and that the large form may respond to the zzso zzso These data suggest a differential and zzso expression of these zzso forms, which could play a role in the functional regulation of D1 zzso
