Several transmission studies, as well as recent molecular data, have indicated that the two classes zzso and zzso represent different life cycle stages of zzso To evaluate the life cycles of zzso in zzso aquaculture systems, the small zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso a zzso from channel zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso from the aquatic zzso zzso zzso were zzso The sequences were zzso indicating that zzso zzso and the zzso are alternate life stages of a single zzso This is the first report identifying the zzso stage of the zzso zzso
