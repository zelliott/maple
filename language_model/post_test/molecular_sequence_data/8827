zzso analysis of rat and human zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso gene promoter regions revealed a single zzso zzso element, located upstream of the major zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence demonstrated that it significantly contributes to zzso promoter zzso This E box has a dual zzso it mediates either zzso or repression of the zzso promoter activity, depending on the interacting zzso zzso We showed that the two zzso of the class A basic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso factor, specifically repress zzso promoter zzso This repression can be released by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso forms a stable complex with the zzso E box and likely competes with zzso zzso zzso By using zzso zzso cells, we showed that the zzso zzso gene is a target of zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that the zzso E box and the interacting zzso zzso factors are involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso These results also show that class A zzso zzso factors can repress and zzso negative regulators can stimulate gene zzso
