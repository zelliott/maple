zzso acid zzso is an important regulator of plant resistance to zzso and zzso zzso The enhanced zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso to both virulent and zzso strains of the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso Through zzso zzso the zzso gene was isolated and found to zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and expression of zzso zzso genes were compromised in the zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso gene expression and restore disease resistance in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso functions upstream of zzso and may be involved directly in synthesis of a precursor or a regulatory zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso or other genes important for zzso zzso or signaling zzso enhanced resistance to the zzso zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso background but had little effect in the zzso zzso These results suggest that there is natural variation among zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso between defense signaling pathways against various types of microbial zzso
