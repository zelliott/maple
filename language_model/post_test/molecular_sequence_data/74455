The bacteria involved in the zzso of zzso aromatic zzso zzso in deep sea subsurface environments are largely zzso In order to reveal their zzso sediments from zzso m under the bottom surface at a water depth of zzso m were sampled on the Middle Atlantic Ridge with a gravity column zzso The sediments were promptly enriched with either crude oil or a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the sole carbon source, and further enriched with the zzso mixture mentioned above in the zzso The resulting zzso were named zzso and zzso zzso Their bacterial composition was zzso with plate zzso zzso and zzso zzso library zzso On plates, zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dominated the zzso zzso With zzso five major bands closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in consortium zzso while only one major band of zzso was detected in consortium zzso In addition, the dynamics of community structure in response to aromatic zzso zzso were zzso As a result, three zzso of zzso were detected by zzso zzso library analysis, one which played a key role in zzso degradation; two zzso bacteria dominated the zzso zzso zzso Although bacteria of the two zzso grew as the main members of the communities, none of them were isolated, probably zzso to their poor zzso These results confirm that bacteria of zzso are important zzso zzso zzso in marine zzso and coexist with other degrading bacteria that inhabit the deep subsurface zzso of the zzso This supports the view that zzso zzso and zzso occur in remote areas consistently and zzso
