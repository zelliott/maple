Using synthetic zzso we previously identified portions of the zzso zzso that are in contact with the zzso In order to zzso zzso differences of the zzso hormones, a similar study was conducted for zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso were zzso using standard zzso zzso zzso peptides were incubated in the presence of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was monitored using gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso alpha zzso corresponding to a highly zzso portion of zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso for 24 zzso and allowed only partial zzso zzso after 48 zzso zzso alpha zzso or alpha zzso inhibited zzso zzso partially at 24 zzso but almost full zzso than zzso zzso was observed by 48 zzso zzso corresponding to the rest of the zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso did not inhibit zzso of the zzso and zzso The data suggest that zzso have similar zzso in contact with regions of the zzso of both zzso and zzso specifically involving zzso from continuous regions of the zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that this region contains multiple sites of contact with the zzso
