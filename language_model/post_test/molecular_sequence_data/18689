The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces two zzso zzso soldiers and zzso during development within its zzso zzso zzso structures were determined for 6 zzso protein zzso gene family members in zzso and then analyzed alongside two formerly zzso zzso genes from this zzso The genes were examined for zzso in expression patterns using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and in zzso expression zzso Six of the 8 genes show a clear bias in gene expression towards one or the other zzso zzso Of the 3 distinct in zzso probe zzso patterns observed in this study, none lie in zzso with clear zzso zzso Two of the patterns suggest the majority of the zzso zzso gene family members discovered thus far come into contact with host zzso Most of these zzso are expressed exclusively in the zzso membrane encompassing each of the zzso zzso The absence of expression in the membrane surrounding soldier larvae strongly suggests these zzso are performing zzso functions in the zzso
