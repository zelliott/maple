zzso zzso is considered a characteristic zzso infecting zzso deer zzso zzso Host and geographic distribution for this zzso however, remain poorly defined in the region of western North zzso zzso samples collected from Columbia zzso deer zzso zzso zzso in a restricted range endemic to Oregon and Washington, USA, were examined for zzso larvae characteristic of many zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence data zzso transcribed zzso 2 and zzso c zzso zzso 1) established the identity and a new record for zzso zzso in a subspecies of zzso deer previously zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso are now recognized along the basin of the lower Columbia River in Oregon and Washington and from south-central Oregon on the North zzso zzso Current data indicate a potentially broad zone of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the western region of North America, although these zzso seem to be zzso respectively, in zzso deer or in zzso and mule deer zzso zzso at temperate zzso The geographic range for zzso zzso in zzso deer is extended substantially to the west of the currently defined limit in North America, and we confirm an apparently extensive range for this zzso These observations are explored in the broader context of host and geographic associations for zzso zzso and related zzso in North American zzso
