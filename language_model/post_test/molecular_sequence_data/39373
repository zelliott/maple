By using zzso and structural zzso we have investigated the zzso mechanism of the recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have identified several zzso implicated in either zzso zzso or zzso activity of zzso zzso Chemical modification by zzso zzso and mass zzso analyses identified a zzso zzso zzso crucial for zzso zzso and located in the vicinity of the zzso active zzso atom of the zzso ring zzso Moreover, we observed that the zzso of active site key zzso of zzso zzso differs from earlier reported zzso structures, suggesting structural changes during zzso zzso kinetic analyses support a reaction mechanism where zzso zzso proceeds via formation of distinct zzso complexes without formation of a zzso zzso zzso
