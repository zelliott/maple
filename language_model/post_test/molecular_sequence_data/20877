zzso of the human zzso BK zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells causes zzso and zzso in kidney transplant zzso Following prolonged high-level zzso zzso zzso of the archetype zzso control region zzso leads to a mixture of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to compare potential functional differences of 12 rearranged zzso zzso with the archetype zzso zzso found in zzso zzso or urine from three kidney transplant recipients including two with zzso Twelve different zzso and one archetype zzso were inserted between the early and late protein coding region of zzso to make zzso zzso zzso for zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso demonstrated that viral protein expression and zzso zzso loads of 10 zzso zzso were similar or higher than observed for the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The functional zzso produced infectious progeny successfully infecting primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of infected cells and zzso zzso loads corresponded to the activity seen in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only gave rise to a few infected cells similar to zzso whereas seven zzso had intermediate activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or high replication activity zzso and zzso with several hundred infected cells per zzso The results indicate that both functional and zzso zzso zzso zzso arise during zzso replication in kidney transplant recipients and that most functional zzso zzso zzso a higher replication capacity than archetype zzso
