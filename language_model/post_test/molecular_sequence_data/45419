zzso diversity among extant blood zzso and the patterns of relationships among them, has been hindered by the difficulty of determining if specimens described from different life cycle zzso zzso geographic zzso and times represent the same or different zzso zzso collection of all available life cycle stages and provision of exact collection zzso host zzso reference DNA sequences for the zzso and voucher specimens eventually will provide the framework needed to piece together individual life cycles and facilitate reconciliation with classical zzso descriptions, including those based on single life cycle zzso It also provides a means to document unique or rare species that might only ever be recovered from a single life cycle zzso With an emphasis on the value of new information from field collections of any available life cycle zzso here we provide data for several blood fluke zzso from freshwater snails from Kenya, Uganda, and zzso Similar data are provided for adult worms of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Some zzso and zzso zzso that we recovered have peculiar zzso features, and our zzso analyses zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest that 2 of the new zzso specimens likely represent previously unknown zzso Our results also provide new insights into 2 of the 4 remaining zzso zzso yet to be extensively characterized with respect to their position in molecular zzso zzso and zzso The accessibility of each life cycle stage is likely to vary dramatically from one zzso species to the next, and our examples validate the potential usefulness of information gleaned from even one such stage, whatever it might zzso
