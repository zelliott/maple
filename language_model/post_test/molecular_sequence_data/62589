Among the many zzso zzso virus zzso zzso only live attenuated viral vaccines have afforded strong protection to a natural zzso zzso Since the promoter is crucial to the tempo of viral replication in general, it was reasoned that promoter exchange might zzso a novel means of attenuating zzso The core zzso and promoter sequences of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso zzso have been exchanged for those of the human zzso zzso promoter zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso During culture of the resulting virus, referred to as zzso on zzso or zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, deletions arose in zzso regions of the zzso sequences that stabilized after 1 or 2 months of zzso However, when the zzso form of zzso was zzso into zzso zzso animals showed highly controlled zzso during primary and persistent zzso Compared to parental virus infection in zzso primary zzso was reduced by zzso to zzso levels, with little sign of an increase of cycling cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso or altered zzso zzso markers in peripheral zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso infection in most infected animals, the zzso stop zzso did not zzso to the zzso zzso indicating yet again that replication was dramatically zzso Despite such drastic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso although slower to appear, were comparable to those seen in a parental virus zzso When animals were challenged zzso at 4 or 6 months with the zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso was curtailed by approximately zzso at peak height without any sign of zzso in zzso or zzso compartment or increase in zzso zzso cell zzso To date, there has been a general inverse correlation between zzso and zzso however, these findings show that promoter exchange constitutes a novel means to highly zzso zzso while retaining the capacity to protect against challenge zzso
