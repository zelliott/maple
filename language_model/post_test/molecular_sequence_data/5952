We have used a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso chicken zzso or a deletion zzso of chicken zzso zzso delta 7) lacking the DNA binding region to investigate the possible role of zzso in lens zzso cell proliferation and zzso Both zzso were efficiently expressed in primary cultures of embryonic chicken lens zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the rate of cell proliferation and greatly delayed the appearance of zzso zzso structures which contain differentiated cells expressing fiber cell zzso Excess zzso expression also significantly decreased the level of beta zzso zzso without affecting alpha zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso delta 7, had no effect on proliferation or differentiation but markedly increased the level of alpha zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso or zzso proteins may be negative regulators of alpha A- and beta zzso genes in zzso lens zzso
