Some zzso proteins have been found to be capable of zzso DNA, zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and natural zzso such as zzso zzso Patients who zzso zzso protein with the zzso activity have shown moderately severe zzso When incubated with zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso cells, some zzso Jones proteins penetrated the zzso and entered the nucleus with little or no degradation of zzso zzso zzso Jones proteins ultimately induced DNA fragmentation in zzso and cell zzso This zzso activity was not directly associated with the zzso activity, since zzso Jones proteins with no zzso zzso activity also produced cell zzso These results, however, suggest that the biological activities of zzso Jones proteins described here makes a significant contribution to the development and/or deterioration of multiple zzso
