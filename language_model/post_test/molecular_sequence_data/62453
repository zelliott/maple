zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso of zzso to give a zzso zzso group, which is transferred to a second zzso of zzso to give zzso zzso is found in plants, zzso and bacteria, is involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and contains zzso zzso ALS is found only in some bacteria, is a zzso zzso required for the zzso zzso and does not contain zzso Here we report the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso The overall structure is similar to zzso except for a groove that zzso zzso in zzso which is filled with zzso acid side chains in zzso The zzso zzso has an unusual zzso that is unprecedented among the 26 known three-dimensional structures of nine zzso zzso including zzso This zzso suggests a novel mechanism for zzso A second structure, at zzso A, is described in which the zzso is trapped halfway through the zzso cycle so that it contains the zzso intermediate bound to zzso The zzso has a zzso structure that has not been observed previously in any zzso zzso although similar structures are well known for free zzso This structure is consistent with our proposed mechanism and probably results from an zzso zzso transfer within a zzso zzso that is the true reaction zzso Modeling of the second zzso of zzso into the active site of the zzso with the bound intermediate is consistent with the zzso and specificity of zzso
