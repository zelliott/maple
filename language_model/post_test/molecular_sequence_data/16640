zzso zzso zzso is a zzso iron zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso acid, the first committed step in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso each coding for zzso protein were cloned from kidney zzso libraries of zzso zzso and zzso The individual clones were expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso proteins were zzso to zzso zzso A zzso interaction zzso step yielded multiple zzso with mouse and human zzso showing three zzso and rat zzso revealing two zzso Individual zzso zzso exhibited distinct zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, upon storage, the zzso protein was zzso to a approximately zzso truncated protein in each species, and formed small amounts of zzso of identical zzso While zzso is a highly zzso zzso in all zzso species, the zzso nature and tendency to degrade in solution may be the source of significant differences in size previously reported in the zzso Regardless of the source, our results strongly dispel previous conflicting literature reports on the size of the protein and confirm that zzso is a zzso zzso
