zzso zzso is emerging as a powerful zzso tool for diagnosis and monitoring of variety of human zzso We tested whether signatures of urinary zzso can contribute to the existing zzso for coronary artery disease zzso We examined a total of zzso urine samples from 88 patients with severe zzso and 282 zzso Spot urine was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso enabling characterization of more than 1000 zzso per zzso In a first step a zzso zzso for zzso definition was zzso Multiple zzso patterns clearly distinguished healthy controls from zzso patients, and we extracted 15 peptides that define a characteristic zzso signature zzso In a second step, the ability of the zzso panel to predict the presence of zzso was evaluated in a blinded study using a zzso zzso The signature panel showed sensitivity of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso specificity zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso the zzso pattern significantly changed toward the healthy signature zzso with the level of physical activity after therapeutic zzso Our results show that urinary zzso can identify zzso patients with high confidence and might also play a role in monitoring the effects of therapeutic zzso The zzso is amenable to clinical routine testing suggesting that zzso zzso analysis can become a valuable addition to other zzso used in cardiovascular risk zzso
