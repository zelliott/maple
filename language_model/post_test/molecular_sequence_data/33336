zzso zzso zzso is widespread in regions where the common bean zzso zzso the most important zzso for human consumption, is produced, and it is perhaps the factor that most limits nitrogen zzso Global gene expression and zzso approaches were used to investigate the responses of zzso from common bean plants zzso with zzso zzso zzso grown under zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plants showed drastic reduction in zzso and zzso activity as determined by zzso reduction zzso zzso transcript profiling was performed through zzso of nylon filter zzso spotted with zzso approximately 4,000 zzso set, from the zzso and zzso root zzso A total of zzso zzso representing different biological processes according to updated zzso using the zzso zzso database, showed significant differential expression in response to zzso 59% of these were induced in zzso zzso The expression platform for zzso factor genes based in quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction revealed that 37 zzso factor genes were zzso expressed in zzso zzso and only one gene was zzso Data from zzso zzso profiles indicated that zzso acids and other nitrogen zzso were zzso while organic and zzso acids were zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso and zzso software tools, customized to common zzso were zzso for the analysis of global changes in gene expression that affected overall zzso zzso and zzso zzso and starch and zzso zzso were identified among the pathways significantly induced or zzso in zzso zzso zzso
