zzso and zzso channels are the two key proteins that shape the action zzso in zzso However, little is known about how the expression of these two channels is zzso To address this issue, we cloned a zzso zzso channel gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso In this animal, a zzso of zzso lineage isolated from the zzso zzso expresses single zzso channel and zzso channel genes after neural zzso zzso of a dominant negative form of zzso eliminated the native delayed zzso zzso zzso indicating that the entire delayed zzso zzso current of the zzso zzso is exclusively zzso by zzso zzso transcripts are expressed more broadly than zzso channel zzso which are restricted to the zzso zzso There is also a zzso mismatch in the expression of zzso transcript and the zzso zzso zzso transcripts are present throughout development, whereas delayed zzso zzso currents only appear after the zzso stage, suggesting that the functional expression of the zzso transcript is suppressed during the early embryonic zzso To test if this suppression occurs by a mechanism specific to the zzso channel zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in neural zzso A zzso current was expressed earlier than the zzso zzso Furthermore, the introduction of the zzso zzso into zzso cells did not lead to the current zzso These results raise the possibility that the expression of zzso is zzso controlled through a mechanism that is dependent on neural zzso
