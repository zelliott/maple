The zzso of an eight base pair DNA zzso duplex bound to the human zzso determining factor zzso and the orientation of the protein domain within the complex have been analyzed by a variety of zzso methods which permit the selective observation of zzso attached to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso enriched zzso zzso zzso analysis of nuclear and rotating frame zzso enhancement zzso at multiple mixing times indicates that the zzso of the zzso DNA is distinct from that of A- and zzso in agreement with the recent three-dimensional structure determination of the complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 81, zzso Selective observation of zzso zzso between protein and DNA indicates that partial zzso of a protein side chain occurs between two zzso bases in the DNA zzso The analysis of structural features by zzso for this unusual DNA zzso and the orientation of the protein domain on the DNA is zzso The structural features of the DNA zzso to zzso are remarkably similar, but not zzso to those of DNA zzso to the zzso protein zzso
