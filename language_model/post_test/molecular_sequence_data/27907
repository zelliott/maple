The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso the rat zzso has been zzso This zzso isolated from a rat zzso zzso library, encodes a zzso of 50 zzso acids of which 29 are zzso 9 are zzso and 2 are zzso The insert contains the complete zzso region of 170 bases and 18 bases of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso prepared from zzso of zzso and sexually mature rats revealed that zzso zzso is first zzso as a 600 zzso long zzso in the zzso old zzso containing around zzso of round zzso but not in zzso of younger zzso The zzso of zzso old and sexually mature rats was found to contain a second zzso zzso which is around 500 zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso of isolated zzso of the mature zzso resulted in 2 prominent zzso signals zzso and 500 zzso while the faint signal obtained with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be due to contamination of the cell preparation by zzso After zzso of the zzso with zzso H a single zzso band even smaller than 500 zzso was zzso As demonstrated on zzso sections the transcripts are confined to the central layers of the zzso zzso corresponding to the spatial arrangement of corresponding to the spatial arrangement of zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso gene in the rat is zzso expressed and that the zzso zzso zzso processing that includes a reduction in molecular size with respect to the zzso zzso
