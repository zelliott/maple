zzso can have profound effects on the properties of nuclear zzso For instance, zzso of specific sites on zzso zzso drastically alters their propensity to zzso Relatively little is known about the effects of zzso during zzso and about zzso of zzso nuclear zzso Here, using zzso zzso tandem mass zzso we determined the zzso sites of both zzso and zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso at three sites: two of these sites zzso and a site located between zzso 430 and zzso flank the zzso rod domain, whereas the third site zzso is located close to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso predominantly at zzso a zzso contained within a sequence matching the consensus site for zzso by zzso zzso Our study confirms the important role in zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso of nuclear zzso and provides the basis for understanding zzso zzso zzso during zzso
