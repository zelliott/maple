Because of the intimate role of zzso in zzso signaling pathways from zzso zzso and other death zzso the zzso is a potentially important therapeutic zzso We have generated an zzso coli expression construct for zzso in which a zzso sequence is inserted ahead of zzso 217 of zzso The strain produced a significant amount of soluble zzso zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso This zzso protein could be zzso to zzso zzso zzso resolved the zzso into two species, one with the appropriate zzso relative mass and the other with 178 units additional zzso The latter proved to result from zzso zzso modification of the zzso with one equivalent of zzso The zzso proteins could be activated by zzso to the appropriate zzso plus zzso zzso by the addition of zzso in appropriate buffer zzso This yielded an zzso with specific activity of 4-5 zzso against 200 zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso The fully active protein was used in a zzso screen for zzso of zzso A preliminary zzso screen demonstrated that zzso is susceptible to zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso but not in the presence of zzso Investigation into the mechanism of this zzso showed that zzso compounds were reduced by zzso establishing a zzso oxygen generating zzso cycle the products of which zzso zzso zzso the zzso A new class of zzso zzso zzso zzso with affinity in the low zzso range were discovered in the refined zzso zzso investigation of the zzso showed that both the steroid template and the acid zzso were required for zzso
