zzso proteins from 22 strains of 15 different species belong to the zzso zzso were analyzed by an improved two-dimensional gel zzso zzso of zzso proteins from 15 type strains had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins with zzso zzso of greater than about zzso among strains of the same species zzso zzso values of more than zzso were greater than zzso but the zzso values among strains of different species were less than zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso which migrated into similar positions in this method, from 5 type strains were shown to be highly zzso Our results indicated that zzso proteins have been zzso within species during evolution and that the members of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso Thus, zzso protein profiles by this method are a potential tool for strain zzso
