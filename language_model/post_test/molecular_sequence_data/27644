The complete zzso acid sequences of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a human zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso This zzso zzso produced by a human zzso human zzso prepared from zzso of a patient with systemic lupus zzso and zzso is zzso with zzso DNA, synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso The heavy chain is of the zzso zzso and the light chain is of the zzso zzso The heavy chain is the expression product of the zzso zzso zzso The light chain bears significant zzso to other zzso of known primary structure, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an zzso derived with little or no modification from zzso zzso A model of the zzso combining site suggests that zzso 24 and zzso 30 in the light chain zzso interact with a surface defined by zzso or zzso groups of the zzso
