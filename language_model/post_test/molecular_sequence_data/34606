Two zzso zzso zzso zzso Groups I and II, cause gray leaf spot of zzso During the sequencing of a zzso library from zzso zzso Group I, we discovered a sequence with high similarity to zzso a zzso element from zzso zzso The element from zzso zzso named zzso contained zzso terminal repeats and sequences with high similarity to reverse zzso and zzso components of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso with similarity to other zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso were not detected in zzso A single copy of the element was detected by zzso and Southern analyses in all six North American zzso of zzso zzso Group I but was not detected in the four zzso of zzso zzso Group II from three zzso or in zzso related zzso zzso of the core zzso of reverse zzso and zzso contained a high frequency of stop zzso that were zzso in all six zzso of Group zzso Additional zzso to zzso transitions in occasional zzso usually were silent zzso while two resulted in zzso stop zzso The absence of zzso from related species suggests that it was acquired after the divergence of zzso zzso Groups I and zzso The high frequency of stop zzso and the presence of a single copy of the element suggest that it was zzso soon after it was zzso Because the element is inactive and because reading frames for other genes were not found in sequences zzso the element, zzso does not appear to be the cause of differences leading to zzso or genetic diversity between zzso zzso Groups I and zzso
