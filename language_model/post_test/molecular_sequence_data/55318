Control of zzso zzso regulation is required to drive zzso flux toward desired zzso Although the three-dimensional zzso structures of many zzso complexes are available, it is still difficult to rationally engineer an zzso zzso zzso without decreasing its zzso zzso Here, we describe an effective strategy to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso based on the molecular evolution and zzso characteristics of zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso sites are zzso variable and comprised of more zzso zzso than zzso zzso We applied our findings to design zzso in selected target zzso that zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso Specifically, charged zzso acids at less zzso positions were zzso with zzso or neutral zzso acids with similar zzso The engineered proteins successfully diminished the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso without affecting its zzso zzso We expect that our method will aid the rational design of zzso zzso regulation strategies and facilitate the control of zzso zzso
