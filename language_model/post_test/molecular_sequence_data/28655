In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso formation from the zzso zzso or zzso pole body zzso The human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is specifically zzso in zzso zzso Here we establish an evolutionary and functional link between zzso and zzso through identification and analysis of similar zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pole target of zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso fungus zzso zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein contain predicted zzso secondary structure and a zzso zzso zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso as analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso fragments, and multiple abnormal zzso structures, a zzso remarkably similar to that of many human zzso lines, which exhibit zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
