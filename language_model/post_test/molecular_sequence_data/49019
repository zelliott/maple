To better understand the mechanism of zzso binding and zzso zzso change, the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso The zzso structure zzso provides a snapshot of the zzso in the first step of the zzso cycle, and in this zzso form the zzso C zzso adopts an open zzso A zzso junction is formed by zzso from the small and large zzso that come into close zzso This zzso patch may lubricate the zzso motion associated with domain zzso and the opening and closing of the zzso zzso Although zzso appears to be quite zzso many important zzso for zzso binding and zzso transfer in the active site are zzso zzso around the zzso ring of zzso and zzso involved in zzso transfer from the large lobe are mostly zzso whereas zzso involved in zzso binding and in the zzso loop are zzso Prior to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso tail, two important zzso elements are also zzso The surface created in the active site is contoured to bind zzso but not zzso and appears to be held in place by a stable zzso core, which includes zzso C, zzso and zzso and beta strand zzso This core seems to provide a network for zzso from the active site, where zzso zzso to the peripheral zzso zzso zzso loop, exemplified by zzso Two potential lines of communication are the D zzso and the F zzso The zzso zzso network, which lies adjacent to the zzso zzso loop, suggests that this network would exist in other protein zzso and may be a zzso means of zzso zzso binding from the active site to the zzso zzso zzso
