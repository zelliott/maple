zzso are the primary locus for the generation of zzso nitrogen species including zzso and subsequent protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may have important functional and biological consequences such as zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, mouse liver zzso were incubated with zzso and the zzso proteins were separated by zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso proteins were detected with an zzso zzso One of the major proteins zzso by zzso was zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as identified by zzso protein analysis and Western zzso The band intensity of zzso zzso to zzso was increased in a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity was decreased by treatment with zzso in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso The decreased zzso activity was not recovered by treatment with reduced zzso suggesting that the decrease of the zzso activity is due to zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso samples, and a zzso modification search located 5 out of 36 zzso zzso in zzso that were zzso Taken together with previous findings regarding zzso structure and function, zzso modeling of mouse zzso suggested that zzso at zzso in an zzso of zzso domain prevents zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrated the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and its functional zzso Since zzso is responsible for zzso removal in the zzso cycle, zzso of zzso with attenuated function might be involved in some diseases and drug-induced zzso associated with zzso zzso
