zzso containing zzso zzso channels are expressed in excitable cells and trigger neurotransmitter and zzso zzso Their expression remote from the fast release sites leads to the zzso of zzso zzso which can both, facilitate and inhibit the influx of zzso zzso through zzso The facilitated zzso influx was recently related to zzso zzso zzso and long term zzso To analyze zzso zzso zzso of cellular processes more in detail, protein partners of the zzso terminal tail of zzso were identified by zzso zzso leading in two human cell lines to the detection of a novel, extended and rarely occurring zzso zzso of zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso interacts zzso with the zzso of zzso similar to the classical zzso as shown by zzso zzso only zzso reduces whole cell inward currents zzso The zzso of the novel 46 zzso long zzso and the consecutive expression of zzso must be dependent on a new upstream translation initiation site which is only rarely used in the tested human cell zzso The structure of the zzso extension is predicted to be more zzso than the remaining zzso zzso suggesting that it may help to dock it to the zzso membrane zzso
