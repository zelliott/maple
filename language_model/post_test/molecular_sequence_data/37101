The zzso group genes are required for positive regulation of zzso gene zzso The zzso group gene zzso encodes a zzso family zzso that is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso gene in zzso by genetic interactions with zzso zzso zzso suppress zzso zzso and zzso is required for the proper expressions of the zzso zzso and Sex combs reduced zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes at least two zzso a large zzso zzso and a short zzso zzso The zzso protein has an zzso zzso finger, zzso in proteins from organisms ranging from zzso to human and thought to be involved in the zzso of protein zzso Besides the zzso finger, the zzso protein also has extended zzso with other zzso zzso including human zzso We show that zzso zzso also interact with zzso in additional zzso of the zzso complex, with zzso in zzso of the zzso complex, and with zzso of the zzso family zzso gene zzso We propose that zzso is involved in zzso modification of zzso zzso
