The in zzso zzso of zzso the intermediate filament protein of zzso cells, by zzso A and C is zzso and involves only the zzso head zzso In zzso zzso units each zzso recognizes five sites, which have been identified by sequence zzso zzso C introduces zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso A treatment results in 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso do not zzso in standard zzso whereas zzso C treatment has no zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso A remain stable and incorporate only zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are essentially restricted to two of the five zzso A sites found in zzso zzso Thus the head domain, previously related to in zzso assembly competence and filament stability, changes in accessibility between the zzso and zzso zzso We discuss the possibility that in zzso zzso of zzso filaments by zzso A may not necessarily be accompanied by an extensive zzso It could instead involve a dynamic change of the filament surfaces, which could alter the interaction of the filaments with other cellular zzso
