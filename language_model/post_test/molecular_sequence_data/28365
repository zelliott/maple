The zzso sequence of a zzso region of zzso zzso at the right end of the genetic map between genes 19 and 3 was zzso A new gene that is partially required for zzso growth, named gene 15, was zzso zzso zzso were constructed which lack gene 15 function, and the gene 15 product was found to be required for zzso in the presence of some zzso zzso It has extensive zzso acid sequence similarity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a similar function, and weak similarity to the zzso zzso zzso gene which previously had no known zzso A hybrid zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso gene replaces the zzso gene 15, exhibits the zzso properties of zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the two genes have similar zzso In addition, deletions were constructed which show that zzso zzso has no additional genes required for zzso growth of zzso between genes 19 and zzso
