Up to now for zzso Workshop zzso 2 zzso the zzso human CD zzso was zzso By use of the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso expression library derived from zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells we could identify zzso as zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso isolated from blood and zzso zzso revealed that mature T cells in zzso and T cells in the periphery with a zzso zzso were zzso However, within zzso T helper and zzso zzso T cells also zzso cells were present, indicating a zzso after zzso contact in zzso B cells lacked zzso zzso whereas zzso cells expressed intermediate zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso capacity on zzso T cells for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our data indicate an important role of zzso zzso for zzso differentiation and zzso as described for humans and zzso
