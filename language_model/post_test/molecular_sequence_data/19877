The temporally regulated zzso program of zzso T4 relies upon the sequential zzso of three classes of zzso early, middle and zzso Here we show that middle promoters constitute perhaps the largest and the most diverse class of T4 zzso In addition to 45 T4 middle promoters known to date, we mapped 13 new zzso 10 of which zzso from the consensus zzso box, with some of them having no obvious match to zzso So, 30 promoters of 58 identified now zzso from the consensus sequence deduced zzso In spite of the differences in their zzso the in zzso activities of these T4 middle promoters were demonstrated to be dependent on both zzso zzso and zzso Traditionally, the zzso box was restricted to a 9 zzso sequence with the highly zzso motif zzso New logo based on the sequences of currently known middle promoters supports the conclusion that the consensus zzso box is comprised of 10 zzso with the highly zzso central motif zzso However, some apparently good matches to the consensus of middle promoters do not produce transcripts either in zzso or in zzso indicating that the consensus sequence alone does not fully define a middle zzso
