Diversity of the nitrous oxide zzso zzso gene was examined in sediments obtained from the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean zzso zzso zzso 1,100 zzso of the zzso gene were amplified via zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso unique copies of the zzso gene from these marine environments were zzso increasing the zzso sequence database zzso The average DNA similarity for comparisons between all 49 zzso of the zzso gene was zzso zzso zzso zzso of the derived zzso acid sequences confirmed the conservation of important structural zzso A highly zzso region is proposed as the copper zzso zzso site zzso of the mature zzso zzso analysis demonstrated three major clusters of zzso zzso with little overlap between environmental and zzso zzso Finally, the two zzso gene clusters generally corresponded to sampling location, zzso that zzso communities may be restricted zzso
