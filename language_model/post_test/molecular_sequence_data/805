zzso zzso synthesis has been refined to a stage where efficient preparation of long and complex peptides is now zzso However, the zzso handling of poorly soluble peptides often remains a significant hindrance to their zzso and further zzso Several synthetic schemes have been developed for the preparation of such peptides containing modifications to aid their zzso However, these require the use of complex chemistry or yield non-native zzso We describe a simple approach based on the use of zzso zzso that are linked to the zzso of the zzso of interest via a zzso zzso After ready zzso of the now freely zzso zzso the zzso is removed by simple, brief base treatment giving the native sequence in much higher overall zzso The zzso of the method was demonstrated by the novel preparation of insulin zzso via zzso synthesis of each of the two zzso the notoriously poorly soluble zzso by their combination in solution via zzso zzso bond zzso At the conclusion of the chain zzso the zzso zzso tag was removed from the zzso to provide synthetic human zzso in nearly zzso overall zzso This approach should facilitate the development of new insulin zzso as well as be widely zzso to the improved zzso and acquisition of otherwise poorly soluble synthetic zzso
