The zzso zzso zzso in T4 zzso was previously isolated as a zzso zzso that specifically compensated for the loss of function associated with the zzso substitution zzso zzso Surprisingly, the two sites are 11 A apart, with zzso in the core and zzso on the surface of the zzso In order to better understand this result we have carried out a detailed zzso zzso and structural analysis of these zzso zzso as well as a related zzso with the substitution zzso It was found that zzso does increase the stability of zzso but it also increases the stability of both the zzso protein and zzso by essentially equal zzso The effects of zzso on zzso activity are more zzso The zzso slightly reduces the zzso rate of cell wall zzso of zzso zzso and zzso At the same time, zzso is an unstable protein and rapidly loses activity during the course of the zzso especially at temperatures above 20 degrees zzso Thus, even though the double zzso zzso has a slightly lower zzso rate than zzso over a period of zzso minutes it zzso more zzso This decrease in the rate of zzso zzso appears to be the basis of the action of zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso creates a cavity of volume 149 zzso Instead of enlarging this zzso zzso zzso results in a 4-5 A displacement of part of zzso F zzso zzso creating a zzso zzso In the double zzso zzso this zzso returns to a position akin to zzso resulting in a cavity of volume zzso zzso Whether the zzso zzso is incorporated into either zzso zzso or zzso or zzso it results in a decrease in zzso zzso factors, especially in the zzso that include zzso 99 and zzso This increase in zzso which appears to be due to a combination of increased zzso stabilization plus a restriction of zzso zzso provides a structural basis for the increase in zzso
