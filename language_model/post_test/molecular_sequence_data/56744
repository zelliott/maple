To zzso the role of zzso zzso and zzso genes in patients with zzso arthritis zzso who developed gold induced zzso 

Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso genes was performed on DNA from 27 patients with zzso with gold induced zzso 37 patients with zzso who were treated with gold but did not develop zzso and 122 ethnically matched normal zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso I band associated with zzso and zzso and zzso was found in 16 zzso patients with gold induced zzso compared with five zzso patients without gold induced zzso 

It is concluded that zzso region genes may be an important zzso factor for the development of gold induced zzso in patients with zzso
