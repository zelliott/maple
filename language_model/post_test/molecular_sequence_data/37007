Selective zzso of the zzso unit in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in the almost quantitative formation of zzso zzso zzso The reaction zzso involves a zzso zzso zzso zzso and is subject to zzso zzso The relative amounts of zzso zzso zzso obtained within a series was shown to depend on the reaction conditions, especially on the hydrogen zzso zzso Using suitable zzso of hydrogen zzso in zzso the reaction was easily directed to the formation of the kinetic zzso or zzso zzso zzso More rigorous conditions resulted in the specific zzso of one zzso bond in the zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso to yield zzso zzso
