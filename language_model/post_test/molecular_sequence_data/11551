zzso disease and zzso disease are two forms of progressive zzso zzso zzso Recently the gene for zzso disease zzso was mapped to zzso zzso Using three highly zzso DNA markers zzso zzso and zzso which flank the zzso zzso we performed linkage analysis to investigate whether or not the zzso gene is also implicated in zzso zzso zzso was excluded in three zzso zzso each zzso at least two affected zzso This result suggests that differential diagnosis of zzso disease and zzso disease may be facilitated by molecular genetic zzso
