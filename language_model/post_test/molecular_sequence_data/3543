zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso which is zzso in most zzso zzso expression of zzso and loss of zzso zzso in many tumors prompted us to investigate a possible link between these two zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the expression of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was associated with strong repression of the zzso promoter in various cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso cells from zzso zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting that loss of zzso zzso at least, in part the zzso zzso zzso In spite of the presence of two putative zzso sites in the zzso promoter, deletion and zzso analyses suggested that neither site is required for zzso repression of zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Further analyses suggested that the modification of zzso within the zzso promoter could be a molecular explanation for zzso of zzso gene zzso by zzso
