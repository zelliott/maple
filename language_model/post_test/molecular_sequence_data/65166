The zzso unfolded protein response zzso includes two major zzso zzso specific to zzso stress zzso and zzso and zzso shared by other cellular stresses zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso represents a second target, in addition to zzso that is zzso regulated by both the shared and the zzso zzso branches during zzso zzso For the first time, we are able to assess the contribution of each branch of the zzso in the induction of these zzso We demonstrate that zzso of the shared branch of the zzso alone was sufficient to induce zzso and zzso zzso was not required during zzso stress when both branches were used but did contribute significantly to their zzso zzso stresses that activated only the shared branch of the zzso were completely dependent on zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the shared and the zzso zzso branches of the zzso diverge to regulate two groups of targets, one that is zzso and zzso which includes zzso and zzso and another that is zzso zzso which includes zzso and zzso The two branches also zzso to zzso zzso targets like zzso and zzso Finally, our studies reveal that a zzso target other than zzso is contributing to the zzso between the two branches of the zzso that has previously been zzso
