In order to understand the activity specificity of the zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso we have studied its zzso using three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso reduced 17 zzso of zzso and zzso to 24 and zzso of wild type zzso respectively, followed by reduced zzso to 71 and zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso decreased specifically zzso activity to zzso of zzso when incubated with zzso while the zzso zzso only decreased 17 zzso to zzso when incubated with zzso comprehend the altered activity profiles of these zzso zzso zzso we have elaborated a zzso model of the zzso zzso and compared it to our preceding model of the human zzso Analysis of the zzso with this model showed that, without direct contact to the zzso these zzso transmit structural changes to the active zzso By zzso these results support the concept that any cellular changes zzso the external structure of zzso such as zzso could have influence on its active site and zzso zzso
