In the classical human zzso zzso zzso class I zzso processing and presentation pathway, the zzso peptides are generated from viral proteins by multiple zzso zzso of the zzso (and in some cases other zzso zzso and transported to the zzso zzso zzso zzso where they are exposed to zzso zzso In human cells, two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso can trim the zzso extended zzso of zzso zzso In this study, the possible cooperative effect of generating five naturally processed zzso zzso by both zzso was zzso We identified differences in the products obtained with increased detection of natural zzso zzso by comparing double versus single zzso zzso by mass zzso zzso These in zzso data suggest that each zzso can use the degradation products of the other as a zzso for new zzso zzso indicating concerted zzso activity of zzso 1 and zzso
