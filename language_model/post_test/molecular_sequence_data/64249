Recently, zzso of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso that possess zzso sequences similar to European zzso have been reported in United States zzso The origin, diversity and prevalence of zzso North American zzso zzso in the zzso remain zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso of a North American zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso identity with zzso virus zzso the zzso European zzso but only zzso identity with zzso the zzso North American zzso Comparisons between zzso and zzso at the zzso sequence level of the predicted zzso proteins zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was the most zzso and the least zzso was zzso at zzso zzso For the purpose of comparison, zzso the principal envelope structural zzso showed a zzso identity between zzso and zzso The most dramatic differences between the zzso proteins of zzso and zzso were a single 17 zzso acid deletion between zzso zzso and zzso as well as several zzso acid zzso The same deletion was identified in the zzso in five of seven other zzso zzso submitted to the South Dakota Animal Disease Research and zzso zzso The remaining two zzso contained small zzso but in other regions of zzso zzso sequence diversity in the form of zzso and deletions in zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso in the USA represent a zzso zzso Furthermore, areas in zzso with deletions and zzso acid zzso zzso to regions that are predicted to be zzso zzso
