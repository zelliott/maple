Previous studies on different zzso zzso virus zzso zzso including zzso respiratory coronavirus zzso have identified regions within the zzso that are zzso as regards insertions and zzso For example the zzso base deletion within the S gene and multiple deletions zzso within and 3' of the zzso gene were detected in strains of zzso The presence of deletions may be associated with a change in the zzso zzso or tissue zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso vaccine strain was attenuated by passage of a cell culture adapted virulent isolate zzso 188 times through zzso zzso cells after treatment with gastric zzso zzso amplification with zzso corresponding to known zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso and zzso for genetic zzso zzso with several pairs of zzso within the first zzso zzso of the S gene did not identify a deletion within this region of the zzso from either zzso However, zzso directed against the zzso region detected a deletion of about 250 zzso within the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso Since all the attenuated zzso strains so far zzso zzso Miller SP and zzso contained deletions within the zzso it would suggest that this region of the zzso zzso is involved in regulating viral zzso
