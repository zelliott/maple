A series of chemically zzso zzso containing one or two zzso zzso mixed zzso at and/or adjacent to the zzso site of the zzso can be zzso by the zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso the predominantly zzso zzso have zzso lower optimal temperatures of zzso zzso approximately zzso higher zzso and zzso lower zzso at 30 degrees C, and zzso zzso higher zzso and zzso lower zzso at 37 degrees zzso The extent to which the zzso zzso zzso is inhibited in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso and an zzso zzso analogue with a zzso at the zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso supports the contention that the formation of the zzso complex with the predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The weaker binding of D zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso and determination of the zzso of the zzso Analysis of the kinetic data also suggests that the zzso of the zzso core of the zzso complex differs from that of the zzso complex, a change that results from the presence of a zzso zzso in the zzso
