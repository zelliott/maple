zzso molecules specific for human zzso zzso necrosis zzso were selected by zzso technology from a library based on the zzso zzso zzso Z zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in several inflammatory diseases and, to this day, four zzso protein pharmaceuticals have been approved for clinical zzso The zzso selection generated 18 unique zzso zzso sequences of which 12 were zzso after sequence cluster analysis, for characterization as zzso zzso binding studies of the 12 zzso zzso and zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso molecules revealed three zzso that demonstrated the strongest binding to human zzso These three zzso molecules were subjected to kinetic binding analysis and also tested for their binding to zzso rat and pig zzso For zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso for human zzso was demonstrated, as well as significant binding to zzso from the other zzso Furthermore, the binding site was found to overlap with the binding site for the zzso zzso since this interaction could be efficiently blocked by the zzso zzso When investigating six zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso and one zzso zzso it was found that the zzso of the zzso binding to its zzso could be further improved by using zzso with extended zzso and/or a zzso zzso zzso The potential implication of the results for the future design of zzso zzso for the diagnosis of inflammation is zzso
