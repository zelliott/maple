zzso we report that zzso fused with zzso protein zzso is localized in the cortical zzso patch besides zzso in zzso and the cortical zzso changed its position together with the patch depending on the zzso phase, while nuclear zzso accumulated predominantly in the budding zzso Whereas zzso does not directly bind to zzso it associated mainly with the zzso protein zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the number of cells containing either a fragmented zzso or an enlarged single central zzso increased and the zzso of the zzso dye zzso yellow zzso in the zzso zzso Further, zzso transformed with a zzso zzso having two zzso zzso in a zinc finger resembling that of zzso proteins of zzso factors zzso neither recovered the zzso zzso unlike zzso transformed with the zzso zzso nor reduced the average size of central zzso as much as the latter zzso These results suggested that zzso in the zzso patch is involved in the zzso zzso and membrane trafficking for zzso formation and that the putative zzso domain in zzso plays an important role in these zzso
