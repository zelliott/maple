The zzso protein zzso is an essential zzso for the degradation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso It mediates the interaction between the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso defects in the gene zzso this zzso result in a fatal neurological storage disorder, the AB zzso of zzso To zzso the mode of action of this zzso zzso we zzso the two zzso labels zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with these zzso zzso and subsequent zzso led to zzso zzso of the zzso After separation of zzso peptides by zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso mass zzso Both labels were found to be specifically zzso into a part of the surface loop zzso zzso zzso a stretch of zzso acids that was previously identified as the most flexible region in the crystal structure of the zzso Our results provide strong evidence that this loop constitutes the part of the zzso protein that directly interacts with the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and the great structural mobility of this element are crucial for the extraction of the zzso zzso its stabilization inside the spacious cavity and its guidance to the zzso active zzso This study demonstrates that the approach of zzso zzso in conjunction with accurate mass zzso can provide insight into zzso binding interactions that zzso structural zzso
