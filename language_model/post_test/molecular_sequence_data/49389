We have zzso a new toxin zzso zzso from Asian scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso that possesses a distinctive structural motif in its zzso zzso zzso that is similarly found in two other previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso action zzso zzso in zzso nerve and was zzso using gel zzso zzso exchange, fast protein liquid zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly prolonged zzso zzso but it did not alter zzso from an insect zzso nerve zzso at similar zzso When applied to zzso zzso muscle single zzso zzso zzso prolonged fast zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso when both zzso and zzso channels were zzso zzso zzso acts to selectively alter zzso channel zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso The zzso mass of zzso zzso was determined by zzso to be zzso zzso The zzso terminal motif zzso which introduces a reverse turn in zzso zzso does not appear in previously characterized zzso zzso and may be characteristic of zzso zzso zzso similarity database searches were used to test whether the zzso sequences of zzso zzso toxins from zzso zzso zzso possess a distinctive structural motif in its zzso reverse turn zzso that is zzso zzso similarities with putative zzso zzso by zzso obtained from a zzso library zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nine novel precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 38, zzso from zzso zzso zzso showed that an active zzso toxin zzso from the putative zzso toxin zzso zzso is likely identical to zzso zzso zzso comparisons with toxins and putative toxins from zzso zzso zzso and other species revealed that a group of these toxins possess a common structural motif in their zzso A zzso zzso analysis suggests that there are two zzso sister groups of related zzso zzso one possesses the zzso motif and the other possesses a zzso version zzso of zzso
