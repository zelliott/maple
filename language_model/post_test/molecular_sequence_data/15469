Four unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria isolated from one sheep and three pigs were characterized using zzso and molecular genetic zzso On the basis of cellular zzso and zzso criteria, the zzso were tentatively assigned to the zzso zzso although the organisms did not appear to zzso to any recognized zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the zzso represent a novel zzso within the zzso zzso The most closely related species in zzso terms was zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso % to the type strain zzso zzso although the zzso zzso value was only 29 zzso The novel zzso were readily distinguished from all recognized zzso species by means of zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of molecular genetic and zzso evidence, therefore, the four zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
