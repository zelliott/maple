In this study, we investigated protein and genetic profiles of zzso zzso zzso zzso in seeds of 16 different soybean zzso that included four groups consisting of wild soybean zzso zzso the cultivated soybean zzso zzso ancestors of modern zzso American soybean zzso zzso modern zzso American soybean zzso and Asian cultivated soybean zzso that were the immediate results of zzso from the wild zzso zzso were well separated by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso and stained protein cut from a zzso indicated that zzso exists as multiple zzso zzso in zzso zzso spots of zzso were identified and characterized using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso Although overall distribution patterns of the zzso protein spots appeared similar, the number and intensity of the protein spots between wild and cultivated zzso zzso Three zzso peptides were identified in three of the wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which zzso zzso showed highest zzso The remaining wild zzso zzso zzso showed four protein zzso In contrast, the ancestors, modern and Asian zzso zzso showed only two protein spots corresponding to zzso On the basis of DNA zzso analysis, there is one copy of the zzso gene in all 16 zzso zzso was detected in one of the wild zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that the major variation of protein profiles were between wild and cultivated soybean zzso rather than among zzso in the same zzso zzso variation of zzso zzso and zzso genes were detected within and between zzso
