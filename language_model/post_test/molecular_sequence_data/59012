After zzso of muscle, motor zzso zzso original synaptic zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso specific zzso beta 2 chain zzso was reported to inhibit motor zzso zzso zzso a specific sequence zzso zzso of the zzso beta 2 chain was proposed to act as a stop signal and to mediate specific zzso at the zzso junction zzso zzso zzso Weis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that native chick zzso which contains the beta 2 chain and is present in the synaptic basement zzso does not inhibit but rather promotes motor zzso zzso In native zzso zzso the zzso sequence of the beta 2 chain is found in a triple zzso region that is formed by all three zzso We show here that the effect of zzso depends on the structural zzso Whereas a zzso randomly coiled zzso zzso indeed inhibited outgrowth by chick zzso a small zzso triple zzso protein containing this sequence did zzso
