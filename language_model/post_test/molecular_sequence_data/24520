Fast and reliable zzso zzso is rapidly gaining importance as more and more zzso sequence information is becoming available, and the study of the evolution of genes and zzso zzso our understanding in biology and medicine zzso Branch attraction phenomena due to unequal amounts of evolutionary change in different parts of the zzso are one major problem for current methods, placing the species that evolved fast in one part of the zzso tree, and the species that evolved slowly in the zzso 

We describe a way to avoid the zzso attraction of species that evolved slowly, by detecting shared old character states using a zzso comparison with an zzso The corresponding focus on shared novel character states yields a fast and transparent zzso zzso algorithm, by application of the zzso principle, and zzso search: shared zzso give evidence of the exclusive common heritage zzso of a subset of the zzso They indicate conflict in a split of all species considered, if the split tears them zzso Only the split at the root of the zzso tree cannot have such zzso zzso we can work top-down, from the root to the leaves, by zzso searching for a zzso split, and tackling the resulting two zzso in the same zzso The algorithm, called zzso conflict zzso zzso zzso has been validated successfully using both natural and artificial zzso In particular, we zzso published trees, yielding more plausible zzso and we analyze small zzso trees on the basis of alignments considering structural zzso
