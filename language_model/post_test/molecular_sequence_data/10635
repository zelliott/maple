A zzso zzso study was performed to characterize zzso zzso strains mostly isolated from Antarctic sea zzso The strains were isolated from samples of zzso zzso sea ice, grease ice, and ice zzso biomass collected from the coastal areas of the zzso Hills in eastern zzso zzso degrees S 78 degrees zzso The strains were zzso zzso zzso and rod zzso were capable of zzso growth either by zzso of carbohydrates or by zzso zzso and zzso a variety of electron zzso including zzso zzso compounds, and zzso zzso A zzso analysis performed with zzso zzso sequences showed that the zzso formed two groups representing novel lineages in the zzso zzso The first novel group included zzso zzso zzso strains which had DNA G + C contents of 48 zzso The members of the second strain group were zzso and did not require seawater but could tolerate up to zzso zzso The strains of this group were also unable to degrade zzso but could zzso a number of zzso and zzso and had G + C contents of 40 to 43 zzso The zzso fatty acid profiles of the sea ice zzso were found to be similar to the profiles obtained for other zzso zzso The omega-3 zzso fatty acid zzso acid zzso zzso omega 3) was detected in all of the sea ice zzso at levels ranging from 2 to zzso of the total fatty zzso zzso was also found at high levels in zzso zzso (19 to zzso and zzso zzso (16 to zzso but was absent in zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso data, the Antarctic zzso strains are placed in two new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso
