In zzso the zzso protein interacts with zzso zzso zzso protein and protects zzso from zzso zzso This effect is zzso and is not observed with zzso zzso or zzso Using truncated zzso proteins in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we localized the zzso region to the zzso region of zzso We have confirmed a zzso interaction of the zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso using zzso resonance experiments on a zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the equilibrium affinity of the zzso for the zzso region of zzso immobilized on the sensor chip was 24 zzso 10 zzso To narrow down the region within zzso involved in zzso zzso two synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso covering the zzso region of zzso were compared for their interaction with zzso zzso Only zzso zzso interacts with zzso with high zzso The zzso motif is a critical zzso for the zzso of zzso and also zzso to a domain responsible for zzso zzso of zzso Our results may explain the rescue of nuclear wild type zzso activities by zzso in zzso cell lines expressing the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso
