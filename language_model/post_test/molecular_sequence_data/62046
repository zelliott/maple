Using the differential screening technique, a zzso related to the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins was cloned from the Atlantic cod zzso zzso zzso The gene is an zzso of a recently identified gene of rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso zzso are modern descendants of the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso and a gene of the zzso zzso zzso is related to this gene zzso zzso modeling suggests that the structure of cod zzso is similar to zzso zzso and zzso while its highly basic character is similar to zzso Cod zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso After zzso injection of zzso high levels of cod zzso zzso were detected also in peripheral blood cells and zzso while moderate to low levels of transcript were found in heart, liver, zzso skin, brain, and zzso We conclude that the patterns of charge and expression of cod zzso are more similar to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso
