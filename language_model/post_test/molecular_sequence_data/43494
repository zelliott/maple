zzso DNA zzso are essential zzso in both DNA replication and DNA repair zzso Here we report a functional characterization of the T4 DNA zzso One zzso and two zzso deletion zzso were expressed in zzso coli as zzso zzso zzso An additional zzso bore a substitution of zzso in the active site that abolished zzso zzso All the proteins were tested in zzso zzso for zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso joining, zzso zzso and zzso dependent DNA zzso From this analysis we conclude that binding to DNA is zzso by sequences at both protein ends and plays a key role in the zzso The zzso establishes two different complexes with zzso zzso a transient complex zzso involving the zzso zzso zzso a stable complex zzso requiring the zzso T4 DNA zzso The formation of an zzso complex seems to be relevant during both zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso the inactive zzso substitution zzso although unable to zzso still possesses zzso DNA zzso zzso
