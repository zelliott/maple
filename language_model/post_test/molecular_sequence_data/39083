The zzso zzso was first identified in zzso zzso cells and codes for a zzso protein with two zinc finger zzso In this study, we characterized the nuclear zzso signal of zzso tested if zzso regulates transcription, and examined its expression during embryonic development and zzso differentiation of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso By examining the cellular zzso of deletion zzso of zzso fused to green zzso zzso zzso was revealed to have a zzso nuclear zzso signal sequence upstream of the zinc finger zzso The zzso region of zzso when fused to the zzso zzso domain, strongly activated zzso The expression of zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso showing the highest expression in zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso showed a high expression of the transcripts in zzso zzso such as brain and neural zzso The expression of zzso was zzso increased at both the zzso and the protein levels when zzso cells were treated with zzso acid to induce zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso nuclear zzso signal and may play a role in zzso zzso
