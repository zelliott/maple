The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a wide-ranging zzso zzso that occurs throughout eastern North zzso A previous zzso study recognized four subspecies zzso zzso zzso and zzso several zzso races, and three zones of zzso zzso We generated complete zzso b zzso sequence data for 51 individuals from across the range of the zzso zzso inclusive of all of the currently recognized zzso to assess genetic variation and zzso zzso Both maximum zzso and mixed model zzso analyses resulted in two strongly supported deeply divergent zzso including zzso a Tennessee River drainage zzso and zzso an Ohio River and Great Lakes zzso Interior Highlands, and Atlantic slope zzso zzso zzso a closely related zzso zzso within the Tennessee River zzso of zzso zzso rendering the complex zzso Test of alternative zzso failed to support the current zzso zzso The inclusion of nuclear sequence data from zzso 1 of the zzso zzso protein zzso from a subset of the populations was included to independently test whether the currently recognized zzso conform to distinct evolutionary lineages and also to clarify potential issues associated with ancestral zzso Although the nuclear data was less variable than the zzso data, the zzso of several of the subspecies could not be zzso
