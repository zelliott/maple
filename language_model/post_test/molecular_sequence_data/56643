The zzso phenomenon is a clinically recognized adverse effect of long-term zzso therapy in Parkinson's zzso Several causes of this phenomenon have been proposed, but no direct evidence has yet been zzso The present study was therefore conducted to investigate the effects of long-term zzso administration on the zzso zzso We examined in rats the time course of the levels of zzso and its zzso in the serum and zzso the activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso until 12 h after the final dose on the 28th day of repeated oral zzso administration, and compared the results with those after a single zzso zzso The results revealed that long-term zzso administration induced zzso acceleration of zzso zzso at the gut and the zzso barrier, zzso reduction of zzso retention in the zzso and zzso loss of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by single zzso administration was preceded by the increase of D1 zzso zzso We suggest that these changes after long-term zzso administration are causes of the zzso phenomenon in Parkinson's zzso
