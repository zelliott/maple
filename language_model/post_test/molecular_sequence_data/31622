The zzso zzso zzso domain is a zzso interaction domain that is found in both animal and plant immune zzso The zzso zzso domain from the zzso zzso repeat zzso class of plant zzso zzso proteins has been shown to play an important role in zzso zzso Recently, the crystal structure of the zzso domain from zzso R protein zzso was determined and this structure, combined with functional studies, demonstrated that zzso zzso is a requirement for function of the R protein zzso To advance the molecular understanding of the function of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the protein zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso analyses of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso R proteins zzso zzso to zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso to zzso zzso 1) and the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1) are reported zzso zzso and zzso function zzso as a dual zzso system that prevents infection by three distinct zzso zzso is implicated in resistance pathways in zzso and is believed to be involved in zzso regulation through its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all three proteins have successfully been expressed and zzso as soluble proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain were obtained using zzso zzso as a zzso they zzso zzso to zzso resolution, had the symmetry of space group zzso and analysis of the Matthews zzso suggested that there were four molecules per zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain were obtained using ammonium zzso as a zzso they zzso zzso to zzso resolution, had the symmetry of space group zzso or zzso and were most likely to contain one zzso per zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain were obtained using zzso zzso as a zzso they zzso zzso to zzso resolution and had the symmetry of space group zzso or zzso with two molecules predicted per zzso zzso These results provide a good foundation to advance the molecular and structural understanding of the function of the zzso domain in plant innate zzso
