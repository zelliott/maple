zzso zzso C zzso is a crucial zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso the putative zzso C was cloned from human zzso that were transformed by infection with zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso accounted for zzso zzso of the molecular mass of the complete zzso and showed zzso sequence similarity to bovine brain zzso This zzso contained regions, the sequences of which were similar to those of some zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso demonstrated that the zzso for this zzso is expressed in human zzso leukemia cells zzso Since the other cloned zzso for zzso could not zzso with the zzso from this cell, it is strongly suggested that the gene obtained here encodes an additional zzso of zzso in blood zzso
