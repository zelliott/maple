zzso zzso is one of the zzso proteins of the zzso innate immune system in the zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso for a protein with 345 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso consists of two putative zzso zzso zzso as found in most zzso zzso The first zzso consists of an zzso acid motif zzso for the binding of zzso and the other zzso consist of zzso acid motifs zzso for the binding of zzso Except for some zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso of zzso shared an overall low zzso acid sequence identity with zzso of other zzso Unlike other shrimp zzso zzso is expressed only in the zzso but not in the zzso as revealed by zzso When juvenile shrimp were challenged with shrimp extracts containing white spot syndrome virus zzso the expression levels of zzso decreased initially in the first 2 h and then increased to a much higher level after 4 zzso The results suggest that the initial reduction in zzso transcript level may be related to the zzso infection in zzso
