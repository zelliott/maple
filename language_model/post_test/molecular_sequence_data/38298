Type zzso zzso a zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso is primarily zzso by zzso in cartilage and is also present in some other zzso Type zzso collagen plays a critical role in collagen zzso formation and skeletal zzso We investigated a zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso of the zzso collagen gene zzso zzso zzso zzso using reporter gene zzso revealed that a zzso pair zzso segment within zzso 1 increased promoter activity of zzso in rat zzso cells but not in either zzso cells or zzso zzso cells, suggesting that it contained cell zzso zzso zzso In transgenic mice, this zzso zzso was also able to target zzso expression to cartilage including the limbs and zzso zzso with similar zzso specificity as the full-length zzso 1 zzso Competition experiments in gel shift zzso using zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso bound to a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the complex of the zzso segment with zzso zzso or with rat zzso cell zzso confirming the binding of zzso to the zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso within the zzso segment resulted in essentially complete loss of the zzso activity in zzso cells and transgenic zzso These results suggest that the zzso sequence within zzso 1 plays a critical role in the zzso zzso activity of zzso through zzso zzso zzso
