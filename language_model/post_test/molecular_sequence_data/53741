An zzso sequence of zzso zzso has been isolated using a trap zzso following zzso in and zzso of the zzso reporter zzso The trap zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso the zzso gene as a selection marker and a zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso present in zzso functions in zzso and enables screening for zzso elements from the zzso zzso that disrupt the zzso gene by screening for white colonies on zzso plates in both zzso as well as zzso coli zzso The zzso was used to isolate a novel zzso zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso named zzso zzso duplicated host DNA at the target site, had zzso repeats at its ends and contained two zzso on one zzso One of the predicted proteins showed zzso to a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso was present in two copies in the zzso of zzso zzso The trap zzso appears to be useful in zzso zzso sequences from different zzso by screening for the disrupted zzso zzso
