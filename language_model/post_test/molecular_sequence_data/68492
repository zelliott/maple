The zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso selected for reduced zzso resistance was analyzed by zzso high pressure liquid zzso and mass zzso zzso is a member of a cluster of zzso zzso located on zzso A of zzso zzso but is distinct from the zzso and zzso class of zzso The zzso of zzso contained normal parental zzso but in diminished amounts zzso The major zzso of zzso were new components zzso with somewhat longer retention times from the zzso zzso acid analysis of these new zzso showed identical compositions to the corresponding zzso in the parental strain, but mass zzso revealed increased molecular weights by the following mass zzso 1 (in zzso 1 or 2 (in zzso and 2 or 3 (in zzso These observations suggest that in zzso the zzso block may be in the zzso of the stem zzso zzso zzso resulting in the replacement of zzso with free zzso acid in one or more of the cell wall stem zzso
