zzso zzso is the first discovered zzso zzso having an zzso zzso and an zzso with a zzso zzso An artificial gene library for zzso zzso zzso production in zzso coli was designed and constructed on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressing zzso protein were enriched with a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso for zzso coli was successfully zzso and then zzso into the zzso A zzso After the zzso zzso protein had been zzso and zzso with zzso the binding properties of the zzso protein as to zzso zzso zzso were studied by monitoring of total zzso intensity and zzso polarization with a zzso 2000 system and zzso zzso zzso A zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained for zzso zzso in the zzso polarization zzso This suggests that zzso polarization monitoring with zzso as a zzso mimic may be a simplified method for the characterization of zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso When zzso on zzso was zzso with zzso by zzso zzso using a two stage zzso zzso chain reaction, the association of the zzso zzso and zzso observed on zzso polarization analysis was of the same degree as in the case of the wild type, although the calculated maximum change zzso in total zzso intensity decreased from zzso to zzso It was suggested that an environmental change of the bound zzso zzso on zzso might have dramatically occurred as compared with in the case of wild type zzso This combination of monitoring of zzso polarization and total zzso intensity will be zzso for determination and prediction of the zzso state bound or associated with the target zzso The zzso zzso activity was also zzso using this zzso zzso preparation, and calf zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso does not act as a zzso zzso because a noticeable difference was not observed between the incubation zzso with and without zzso under our experimental zzso
