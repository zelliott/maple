zzso zzso is an zzso that is thought to act by blocking zzso zzso of the neurotransmitter zzso Despite widespread clinical use of zzso direct evidence for this mechanism has been difficult to obtain in zzso We have determined that zzso has an additional zzso effect on zzso zzso that is distinct from zzso of zzso zzso By screening for zzso resistant to this effect, we have identified seven zzso We report that two of these genes are zzso to each other and define a novel gene family that encodes over a dozen zzso zzso zzso Our findings may have clinical implications for the mechanism of action of zzso
