The shape of a plant is largely determined by regulation of lateral zzso zzso architecture can vary widely in response to both zzso and environment, suggesting regulation by a complex interaction of autonomous genetic factors and external zzso zzso branches initiated at the base of grass plants, are suppressed in response to shade zzso This suppression of zzso and lateral branch growth is an important trait selected by early zzso during zzso zzso and crop zzso To understand how plants integrate external environmental cues with zzso signals to control their architecture, we have begun a functional characterization of the zzso zzso grassy zzso zzso We isolated the zzso gene using zzso cloning and found that it encodes a class I zzso zzso zzso gene that promotes lateral bud dormancy and suppresses zzso of lateral ear zzso The zzso expression is induced by zzso and is dependent on the activity of zzso zzso zzso a major zzso locus controlling zzso and lateral zzso Interestingly, like zzso zzso maps to a quantitative trait locus that regulates zzso and lateral branching in zzso and shows evidence of selection during zzso zzso zzso and shade avoidance are both of critical zzso importance, but little is known about how these processes are zzso Our results indicate that zzso mediates the reduced branching associated with the shade avoidance response in the zzso Furthermore, selection at the zzso locus suggests that it was involved in improving plant architecture during the zzso of zzso
