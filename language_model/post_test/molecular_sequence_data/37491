The peripheral zzso site on zzso zzso located at the active center zzso entry, encompasses overlapping binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso yet, the molecular mechanisms zzso this site to the active center at the zzso base to zzso zzso remain zzso The peripheral site has also been proposed to be involved in zzso protein associations occurring during zzso or upon zzso A novel crystal form of mouse zzso combined with zzso analyses of the zzso enabled us to solve unique structures of zzso with a free peripheral site, and as three complexes with peripheral site zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso with structures of zzso complexes with the zzso zzso or with organic zzso zzso unveils new structural zzso contributing to zzso interactions at the peripheral site, and permits a detailed zzso zzso of this zzso zzso these structures provide templates for designing compounds directed to the zzso surface that zzso specific surface interactions controlling zzso activity and zzso zzso protein zzso
