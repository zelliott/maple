zzso is a zzso protein which binds to the highly zzso DNA element I zzso of zzso zzso We have zzso zzso to near zzso it is comprised of a single zzso of molecular weight zzso When bound to zzso zzso DNA, zzso protects a zzso pair region centered over zzso zzso interference experiments show that zzso of zzso located outside of the zzso pair zzso sequence have no zzso effect on zzso zzso suggesting that the DNA sequences important for zzso recognition are confined to the zzso zzso The equilibrium constant for zzso binding to zzso DNA is relatively low, 3 zzso zzso zzso Using a novel method to determine relative DNA binding constants, we analyzed the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso A C to T point zzso at position 5 zzso reduces the equilibrium constant about zzso while the zzso of an additional T at this position zzso reduces the equilibrium constant zzso The effect of these zzso on zzso zzso function in zzso was assessed using a zzso stability zzso While the zzso zzso had a slight effect, the zzso zzso significantly impaired function, zzso that zzso binding is required for the optimal zzso function of zzso zzso
