A specific zzso DNA zzso was amplified from zzso zzso zzso zzso using a unique zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso as the primer pair in the zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso sequence is part of the zzso terminal zzso repeat zzso which forms the left potential zzso zzso structure of the previously identified zzso zzso zzso genetic element zzso et zzso Gene 93 zzso zzso The amplified DNA was cloned and zzso A pair of zzso zzso containing the zzso synthetic zzso was identified at both zzso Between the zzso there are four potential open reading frames zzso which are arranged adjacent to each other in the order, zzso zzso zzso and zzso with parts of zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso are 34 to zzso identical to the translation initiation factor zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso In bacteria, the zzso genes are organized to function as an zzso There are multiple sites with zzso sequences identified upstream from the putative zzso gene in the mycoplasma closely resembling the gene arrangement in the bacterial zzso All three genes of zzso zzso and zzso are preceded individually by a strong appropriately spaced (7 and 10 zzso putative zzso sequence zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
