zzso breaks zzso have been produced in zzso DNA by various restriction zzso and the survival and the deletion zzso zzso have been measured in zzso zzso The deletion formation is known to depend upon the occurrence of short direct repeats within the DNA zzso In order to study the role of these repeats we constructed zzso molecules with repeats of various lengths or with a zzso pair repeat at different distances from each zzso zzso the influence of the location and the structure of the zzso was zzso zzso and deletion zzso of the zzso plasmids were measured after transformation of zzso zzso The yield of the specific deletion zzso (the one which occurs between the introduced zzso increases nearly zzso with the square of the length of the zzso while the yield of the correctly repaired DNA and the yield of all other deletion zzso remained zzso The slope of the linear increase of the yield of the specific deletion depends on the location and the structure of the zzso The yield of the specific deletion zzso decreases with increasing distance between the zzso A proposal for the zzso step of the deletion formation is zzso
