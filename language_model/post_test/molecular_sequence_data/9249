We report the zzso and rational design of new generations of potential zzso zzso of the complement protein zzso from the zzso zzso The binding efficacy of the peptides is tested by extensive molecular zzso structural and zzso analysis, using 32 atomic detail zzso in explicit water for 22 peptides bound to human, rat or mouse target protein zzso with a total of zzso zzso The criteria for the new design are: zzso zzso for zzso affinity and for the balance between zzso and polarity to improve zzso compared to known zzso zzso and zzso development of dual zzso zzso zzso zzso which could be used in animal disease zzso Three of the new zzso are analyzed in more detail as they possess strong and novel binding characteristics and are promising candidates for further zzso This work zzso the way for the development of an improved therapeutic for age-related zzso zzso and other complement zzso diseases, compared to known zzso zzso
