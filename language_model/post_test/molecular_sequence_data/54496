Recent identification of the modular CLS motifs responsible for zzso A and E zzso on zzso has revealed a tight linkage between the nuclear and zzso zzso These zzso zzso must zzso on the zzso in order for DNA replication to occur in the nucleus, whereas essential DNA replication factors also function on the zzso to prevent zzso zzso Both events are dependent on the presence of an intact CLS within each zzso Here we compare the zzso A and E zzso at the structural and functional levels and identify a new zzso A CLS zzso that zzso all CLS functions and reduces the affinity of zzso A for zzso Analysis of interactions of the CLS motif within the zzso molecules highlights the importance of the zzso zzso region for zzso zzso
