zzso expression is of considerable importance in normal and zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels are correlated with good prognosis in liver failure, and cellular zzso plays a crucial role in zzso In this study, we observed that the zzso rat zzso cell line does not express zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso containing the promoter elements of the zzso gene showed no promoter function when zzso into this cell zzso However, zzso was actively expressed in zzso and rat skin zzso cell types that express large amounts of zzso zzso To study the mechanisms regulating zzso zzso we evaluated the zzso regulatory elements of the rat zzso gene by zzso analysis and zzso binding zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the sequences between positions zzso and zzso are essential for promoter zzso This region contains the consensus binding sites for zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that although the binding activity to the zzso site at zzso was essentially the same as that in extracts from zzso zzso cells and rat zzso substantially greater amounts and different patterns of binding to the adjacent zzso zzso element were observed in the extracts from the expressing zzso and rat zzso compared with those in the zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso element site dramatically reduced promoter activity in transient zzso zzso The zzso zzso element at position zzso appears to play an important role in the zzso expression of the rat zzso zzso
