zzso zzso zzso is involved in base zzso repair of zzso zzso zzso in nuclear and zzso zzso zzso knockout mice generated by gene targeting are viable, zzso and zzso normal and have regular zzso zzso However, when exposed to a zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso show an increase in the zzso ratio in the zzso and zzso cell zzso After combined zzso zzso zzso primary cortical zzso have increased vulnerability to cell death, which is associated with early zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression and activity are low in brains of zzso zzso mice but increase significantly after zzso middle cerebral artery zzso and zzso Moreover, major increases in zzso size are observed in zzso mice compared with zzso control zzso In conclusion, our results provide compelling evidence that zzso is of major importance for tissue repair after brain zzso
