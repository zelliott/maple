The zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso zzso as one of its terminal zzso The zzso I zzso acid sequence shows the presence of all the essential zzso of the zzso and zzso channels, defined in most zzso zzso with the exception of the key zzso zzso located in the middle of the membrane zzso zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of zzso modeling studies, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to act as a functional substitute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Soares, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and shown to operate as a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso side of the bacterial inner membrane to the zzso space with a zzso of zzso as in the case in zzso zzso that contain the zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso transfer in the zzso with the participation of the zzso zzso are zzso The observation that the zzso zzso is zzso in several other members of the zzso zzso zzso suggests a common alternative mode of action for the zzso
