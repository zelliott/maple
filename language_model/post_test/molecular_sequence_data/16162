The zzso origin for DNA replication comprises at least two essential, but functionally zzso zzso zzso One of these, the origin core, is required only for DNA zzso It includes binding sites for large T zzso and the origin of zzso DNA zzso The other component is required for both zzso and DNA replication and is represented by two functionally redundant regions, alpha and zzso which are elements of the zzso zzso Whereas either zzso element will activate DNA zzso both zzso elements are required to constitute a functional zzso of zzso To identify the sequences that make up each zzso element, we have subjected them separately to in zzso zzso and measured their capacity to activate replication in zzso of the origin core in zzso cells, which provide all zzso zzso functions including large T zzso The results reveal that the beta zzso element is composed of three zzso two auxiliary zzso and a core zzso The core zzso independently activated DNA zzso albeit zzso The auxiliary zzso which were inactive on their own, acted zzso with the core zzso to increase its zzso Interestingly, zzso of the beta core zzso functioned as well as the combination of a beta auxiliary zzso and a core zzso suggesting that the zzso are functionally zzso The alpha zzso element is organized zzso it too comprises an auxiliary zzso and a core zzso These results lead us to suggest that the zzso zzso comprises two levels of zzso two or more zzso elements form an zzso and two or more zzso make up an zzso zzso The zzso share few sequences and serve as binding sites for distinct cellular zzso It appears, therefore, that a number of different cellular proteins function zzso to activate zzso DNA replication by a common zzso
