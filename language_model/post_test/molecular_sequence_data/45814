We isolated a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso from the pine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined its zzso zzso The zzso gene has a predicted 460 zzso acid zzso protein product with zzso identity to zzso from zzso zzso and high identity zzso with other insect zzso zzso applied juvenile hormone zzso III induced zzso zzso levels up to zzso in both zzso mostly in the anterior zzso though there were differences between males and females in the timing, sensitivity to zzso III dose and tissue distribution of zzso zzso These data further validate the coordinate regulation of zzso zzso genes for de zzso zzso zzso production in bark zzso
