In this study, we analyzed the expression and regulation of zzso zzso zzso expression during human B zzso zzso We show that upon zzso stimulation with zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso for zzso becomes zzso in B cells after 24 h of zzso and is followed by an increase in zzso protein expression on days 2 and zzso This zzso is specific for zzso since expression of other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or yes was not zzso Furthermore, immune complex zzso zzso show that zzso protein expressed on day 2 is associated with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso transition does not require zzso whereas DNA synthesis is dependent upon its zzso Thus, our data demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso during human B cell stimulation and this zzso plays an important role during the control of late steps of B zzso zzso such as S phase zzso
