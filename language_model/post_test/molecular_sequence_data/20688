In the present study, we zzso and zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso disc growth factor zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso were produced and subsequently used in zzso zzso The zzso analyses demonstrated an extremely high level of zzso in the zzso throughout the period of rapid growth of the zzso of zzso zzso The results of zzso showed that zzso was predominantly expressed in fat zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso transcripts in fat bodies were highly expressed during the feeding stage but significantly suppressed during the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso brought about a significant decline of zzso zzso in the fat bodies and zzso proteins in the zzso After zzso the zzso transcripts in fat bodies and zzso proteins in the zzso increased zzso In addition, an zzso study revealed zzso proteins on the surface of wing zzso The present findings suggest that the level of zzso in the zzso was modulated by the fat body in response to nutritional conditions and that zzso was transported to target zzso through the zzso
