The high number of zzso structures observed for zzso highlights the important role of these zzso zzso during zzso recognition zzso Although a large diversity in the mode of association of zzso zzso is frequently observed, the zzso zzso of plant zzso display small variations within a single zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso zzso exhibits the same zzso fold as identified previously for other members of the family, but the shape and the zzso character of its zzso site is unlike that of other members, consistent with surface zzso resonance analysis showing a preference for zzso zzso zzso reveals a novel zzso assembly markedly dissimilar to those described earlier for zzso and zzso but mimics the zzso zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso The present structure exemplifies the zzso of the zzso building block in the evolution of plant zzso and highlights the biological role of these zzso structures for zzso zzso
