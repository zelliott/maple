The bovine C alpha type zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso was zzso A partial zzso was isolated from a bovine heart zzso zzso This clone contained 120 zzso of the coding sequence and the entire 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso The complete coding region was cloned by zzso amplification from total bovine heart and skeletal muscle zzso The sequence of the 3' zzso was taken from the partial zzso clone whereas the zzso zzso was chosen by comparison of sequences of published C alpha zzso from other zzso In the deduced zzso acid sequence there is one zzso from the published bovine C alpha protein zzso zzso acid zzso is exchanged by an zzso The C alpha zzso was found to be expressed zzso in various bovine zzso
