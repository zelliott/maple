Whole zzso zzso zzso is a major factor in the evolution of zzso zzso yet by doubling the number of zzso zzso severely challenges reliable zzso zzso a process zzso across zzso Despite this, numerous zzso zzso species persist in nature, indicating early problems can be zzso Little is known about which genes are zzso one has been zzso zzso To gain new insights into the molecular basis of adaptation to zzso we investigated zzso patterns of differentiation between natural zzso and zzso of zzso zzso an zzso relative of zzso zzso We first show that zzso are not zzso to zzso zzso We then use a zzso scanning approach to show that although zzso is extensively shared across zzso levels, there is strong zzso differentiation in 39 regions spanning 44 zzso These are zzso mostly zzso zzso of sharply elevated zzso Among these zzso are eight zzso genes whose zzso proteins coordinate a specific subset of early zzso functions, suggesting these genes comprise a zzso solution to zzso zzso segregation zzso Our findings indicate that even zzso zzso processes can be capable of nimble evolutionary shifts when zzso
