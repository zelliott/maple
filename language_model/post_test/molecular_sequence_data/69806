The zzso of two fragments of rabbit zzso is zzso The peptides are zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso I and IV in the crystal zzso CD shows that both peptides interact with sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso and change their zzso to an zzso The zzso content estimated from the CD band at 222 zzso is about zzso in each zzso Surface tension zzso show that both peptides lower the critical zzso concentration zzso of zzso with a more dramatic effect in the case of zzso zzso This zzso by itself acts as a zzso and is able to interact with zzso even below the observed zzso forming beta zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso suggests that flexible zzso are zzso The longest zzso stretches compatible with zzso data extend from zzso to zzso for zzso I and from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso
