zzso oxygen species were previously shown to trigger zzso protein degradation through a zzso pathway, however the detailed mechanism of degradation remains to be zzso In this report, we showed that zzso was zzso at an early phase after low dose zzso treatment of a variety of cell types and that zzso of cells with the zzso zzso prolonged zzso zzso A zzso zzso in which all six zzso were changed to zzso was protected against zzso zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso was elevated in the zzso zzso zzso of the two nuclear export signal zzso sequences in zzso or treatment with zzso B blocked zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these results demonstrate that zzso oxygen species induce zzso degradation through an zzso zzso and zzso zzso
