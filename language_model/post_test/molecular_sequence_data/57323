zzso zzso disease zzso can be induced in zzso mice by injection of parental zzso zzso zzso zzso of donor T cells by host zzso zzso leads to the stimulation of host B zzso Little is known of the zzso produced during such a zzso This study was designed to directly measure the levels of zzso for zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as several other zzso using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso was zzso and signals generated were dependent on the amount of specific zzso or zzso in each zzso Early during the progression of zzso (2 days after the first injection of parental zzso there was little increase in zzso zzso a slight increase in zzso zzso and a dramatic increase in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso from zzso zzso cultured in zzso for 24 zzso Later in the response (1 week after the second and final injection of parental zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated as they were earlier while zzso zzso levels were dramatically zzso zzso zzso levels were no different in mice undergoing zzso than in normal mice at this zzso zzso zzso was zzso both early and late, although at similar levels in normal mice and mice undergoing zzso At both times zzso zzso was below the limits of detection by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were below the limits of detection by zzso Further studies showed that a majority of the zzso and zzso zzso found elevated in zzso mice were produced by zzso T cells, with small amounts from zzso B zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso found in zzso mice at this later time also was produced by zzso T cells, with small amounts from zzso B zzso
