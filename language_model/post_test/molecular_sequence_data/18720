The rate of DNA zzso and divergence is highly variable across the tree of zzso However, the reasons underlying this variation are not well zzso Comparing the rates of genetic changes between hosts and zzso lineages that zzso at the same time is one way to begin to understand differences in genetic zzso and substitution zzso Such studies have indicated that the rate of genetic divergence in zzso is often faster than that of their hosts when comparing single zzso However, the variation in this relative rate of molecular evolution across different genes in the zzso is zzso We compared the rate of DNA sequence divergence between humans, chimpanzees and their zzso zzso for zzso zzso genes across their zzso The rate of DNA substitution in these zzso genes was on average 14 times faster for zzso than for humans and zzso In addition, these rates were positively correlated across zzso Because this correlation only occurred for zzso that changed the zzso acid, this pattern is probably produced by similar functional constraints across the same genes in humans, chimpanzees and their zzso
