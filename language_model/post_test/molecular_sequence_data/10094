We have studied the zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso carrier domain of the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso protein spontaneously formed zzso zzso and was modified readily by zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein remained zzso and was zzso toward zzso zzso unless a protein zzso was zzso These data indicated that the single zzso zzso of the domain zzso was much more zzso in the zzso form of the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso for different times, followed by reaction with zzso clearly showed that the loss of zzso zzso was the result of modification with zzso In addition, reaction of zzso with zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso at lower zzso zzso than zzso We also found that zzso was at least zzso more sensitive than the zzso form to zzso by a range of zzso Identification of the zzso sites indicated that the differences in zzso sensitivity could not be attributed to shielding of susceptible bonds by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These data indicate that a zzso change accompanies zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, modification of a zzso protruding from the protein surface results in zzso of the overall structure of this protein zzso
