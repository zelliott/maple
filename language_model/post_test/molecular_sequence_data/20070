Rice blast disease, caused by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso is an excellent model system to study zzso interactions and host defense zzso In this study, comprehensive analysis of the rice zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso infection was conducted using zzso serial analysis of gene zzso A total of zzso distinct zzso zzso serial analysis of gene expression tags were identified from zzso individual tags isolated from the resistant zzso susceptible zzso and control zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the tags in the R and S libraries had a significant reduced matching rate to the rice zzso and expressed sequences in comparison to the C zzso The high level of zzso zzso of the R and S library tags was due to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the most zzso types, which were induced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes was highly induced after zzso In addition, many zzso transcripts were induced in infected plants and expression of four zzso transcripts was confirmed by zzso reverse zzso chain zzso These results demonstrate that there is a series of dynamic and complex transcript modifications and changes in the rice zzso at the zzso zzso early infection zzso
