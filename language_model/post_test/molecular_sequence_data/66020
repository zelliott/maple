zzso is a zzso disease in zzso sheep in much of western North zzso Previous investigators have isolated diverse bacteria from the lungs of affected zzso but no single bacterial species is consistently present, even within single zzso We obtained high-quality diagnostic specimens from nine zzso zzso sheep in three populations and analyzed the bacterial populations present in zzso zzso specimens of seven by using a zzso method zzso zzso gene amplification and clone library zzso zzso zzso was detected as a zzso member of the zzso lung zzso in zzso with early zzso of zzso zzso zzso tests then revealed the consistent presence of zzso zzso in the lungs of zzso zzso sheep in this study, and zzso zzso was isolated from lung specimens of five of the zzso zzso application of zzso zzso zzso to DNA extracted from zzso zzso zzso lung zzso of historical adult zzso sheep zzso specimens supported the association of this agent with zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso sheep were zzso positive zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a very strong association was observed between the presence of one or more zzso zzso zzso animals and the occurrence of current or recent historical zzso problems zzso animals detected in zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly associated with zzso in zzso zzso sheep and is a candidate primary zzso agent for this zzso
