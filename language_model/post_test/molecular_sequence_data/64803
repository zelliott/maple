zzso zzso of zzso were designed by mixing zzso with partially fluorinated zzso zzso chains and zzso lipids with zzso zzso Fluorescence images of the mixed zzso zzso at the zzso interface demonstrated that it is possible to control both size and distribution of the zzso by means of the strong zzso of zzso and zzso membrane zzso while the zzso head groups seemed to play a rather minor zzso These zzso in zzso could be transferred onto zzso zzso and subjected to experiments in a dynamic flow zzso The results obtained here clearly indicated that the dynamic zzso of Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso containing zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be both enhanced and reduced by controlled zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, the same clusters of zzso could also be formed in giant zzso zzso which can be used as a model cell that locally expresses zzso zzso
