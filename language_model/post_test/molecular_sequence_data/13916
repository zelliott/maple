The replication region of the zzso zzso zzso was localized to a zzso zzso zzso This DNA zzso was zzso zzso a zzso open reading frame, zzso zzso a putative protein zzso of 385 zzso acids was zzso An zzso zzso region, zzso was found upstream of zzso This segment included several direct and zzso zzso A downstream zzso open reading frame, zzso X, which was not necessary for zzso was zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso supplied in trans could support replication of a zzso containing zzso and a truncated zzso This observation suggests that zzso is a zzso replication zzso and zzso the zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso and the beginning of zzso X showed high zzso to similar regions in a family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA sequences and the zzso zzso acid sequences of the plasmids were aligned and the consensus sequences zzso The comparison revealed highly zzso areas among this family of zzso In addition, variable zzso emerged, presumably having a zzso specific function, zzso and zzso were plasmids with replication proteins showing high zzso to zzso Despite this zzso replication from zzso could not be supported by the zzso or zzso replication protein supplied in zzso zzso the zzso protein could not support replication from the zzso zzso zzso was found to be compatible with the zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso belongs to the widespread family of zzso zzso zzso Despite the high zzso between their zzso the interaction between the replication origin and the protein is highly specific in many cases rendering the plasmids zzso
