zzso zzso strains zzso a complex set of zzso zzso under conditions related to zzso Several proteins with zzso activity were detected in culture zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso grown in zzso cell walls or zzso and the protein responsible for the main activity zzso was zzso to zzso The zzso was zzso its estimated molecular mass was 28 zzso zzso and its zzso point zzso The zzso specificity and zzso profile of the zzso zzso to a zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso and internal sequences of the protein were designed to clone a full zzso corresponding to zzso The protein sequence showed zzso identity to zzso zzso and zzso to other zzso zzso proteins described thus zzso Northern analysis indicated that zzso is induced by conditions simulating zzso is subject to nitrogen and carbon zzso and is affected by pH in the culture zzso The number of hatched eggs of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced after incubation with pure zzso zzso This zzso effect was improved using zzso culture zzso suggesting that zzso has additive or synergistic effects with other proteins produced during the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso A role for zzso in the protection of plants against zzso and pathogens provided by zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
