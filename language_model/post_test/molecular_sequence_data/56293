We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in zzso cells and their zzso The zzso protein contains an zzso domain zzso three zzso type III repeats fused to two zzso zzso that are in turn separated by three zzso growth zzso zzso The association of these different structural motifs and their characteristic arrangement in the zzso zzso domain has been reported for only one other zzso zzso an zzso zzso of human zzso We show here that zzso and zzso are zzso by distinct genes and that, together, these receptors define a new zzso of zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso when introduced into zzso cells, encodes a product of 140 zzso and that this protein and/or zzso transcripts are zzso in highly zzso embryonic zzso and in some, but not all, cell lines of zzso zzso
