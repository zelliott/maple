We transformed zzso zzso of zzso zzso via zzso zzso and zzso the procedure to develop a new tool for zzso zzso in this zzso Southern zzso analysis of 83 randomly selected zzso showed that they all contained zzso zzso Each of them showed a unique zzso pattern, suggesting that integration was random in the zzso zzso Sixty percent of zzso obtained in the presence of bacteria zzso with zzso integrated a single transferred DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction allowed us to recover the left border and the right border junctions in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso transformation may be a powerful tool for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
