We have isolated and expressed a zzso zzso human zzso cell zzso gamma zzso The zzso cell zzso differs from the zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso by a number of point zzso and encodes an additional 21 zzso acids at its zzso When zzso expressed zzso and zzso cell zzso gamma zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso had a more rapid zzso mobility than zzso cell zzso gamma zzso as is observed for the human zzso gamma zzso zzso on normal zzso The zzso and zzso cell zzso gamma zzso zzso apparently result from zzso specific expression of different forms of zzso gamma zzso zzso A zzso zzso was also found for human zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso which have been used to distinguish the zzso and zzso cell zzso gamma zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso zzso gamma zzso were employed to study the expression of two zzso gamma zzso zzso clones derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso expresses the zzso zzso which carries an zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso of hybrid zzso gamma zzso constructed by interchange of restriction fragments between the zzso and zzso cell zzso allowed zzso of zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso
