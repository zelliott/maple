We recently reported that zzso zzso zzso becomes associated with the activated zzso zzso zzso most likely through the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and one or more zzso zzso within the zzso We have now investigated this interaction in more detail and have found, based on both zzso studies with zzso zzso fusion proteins and binding of these fusion proteins to zzso zzso that this binding is zzso Moreover, both in zzso competition studies, involving zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso acid sequences zzso the eight zzso within the zzso domain of the zzso and in zzso studies with zzso zzso bearing zzso to zzso zzso indicate that zzso of zzso within the zzso is essential for the binding of zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso from zzso cells infected with zzso but not zzso zzso confirms this zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso can zzso in addition to their well established zzso consensus binding zzso a zzso motif that is present in the zzso A comparison of zzso zzso zzso and proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells revealed no zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited the zzso proliferation of both cell types, suggesting that zzso zzso is activated in zzso zzso expressing zzso This was confirmed by carrying out zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and suggested that zzso zzso has a role in regulating zzso zzso but at a site distinct from the zzso
