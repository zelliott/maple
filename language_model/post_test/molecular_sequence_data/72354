The zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso generated in zzso zzso by fusion of the zzso domain of zzso to the basic zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso functions as an zzso zzso factor in zzso cell zzso When introduced into zzso 3 zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso induced by growth factor zzso suggesting that zzso mediates cell survival through zzso of a zzso factor whose activity can be zzso replaced by the zzso zzso We considered four zzso zzso factors as candidates for this putative zzso factor, each of which binds avidly to the DNA consensus sequence recognized by zzso and is related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso death zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso The expression and binding activity of the zzso protein (also called zzso but not of zzso zzso or zzso was found to be regulated by zzso in mouse zzso cell lines zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso is regulated as a zzso zzso zzso requiring de zzso protein zzso In the absence of zzso enforced expression of the human zzso zzso promoted the survival but not the growth of zzso zzso zzso Our results zzso zzso zzso factor regulated by zzso zzso promoter binding zzso in a distinct growth zzso signaling zzso that is responsible for the survival of early zzso zzso and whose zzso by zzso leads to childhood B lineage zzso
