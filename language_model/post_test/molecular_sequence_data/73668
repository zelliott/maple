The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso aberration observed in several types of human acute zzso leukemia zzso whereas the zzso and zzso zzso at zzso are frequently found in solid zzso A novel cell line zzso was established from peripheral blood cells of a 46-year-old male with zzso zzso carrying zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been maintained with a doubling time of 82 h for more than 20 months as a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso cells were free-floating immature zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso They were positive for zzso but negative for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In surface marker analysis zzso cells were positive for zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed 46, zzso zzso zzso zzso der zzso zzso These zzso were confirmed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies with the zzso clone and zzso DNA zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were identified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Thus, zzso could be a useful tool for zzso the zzso and molecular mechanism in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
