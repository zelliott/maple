A novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected in zzso province, Northwest China and characterized using a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities to sequences of other type strains of the zzso zzso were lower than zzso Both zzso zzso used also supported the position that strain zzso formed a distinct zzso with its most closely related zzso zzso and zzso characteristics confirmed that the strain belongs to the zzso zzso and distinguished it from its most closely related zzso zzso zzso further differentiated strain zzso from its nearest zzso zzso These results suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
