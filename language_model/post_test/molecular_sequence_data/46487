Reduction in size of zzso zzso occurred multiple times during evolution, providing the opportunity to study the consequences of cell reduction on zzso zzso Recent investigations on the zzso zzso of the tiny zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso highlighted their extreme zzso and reduced gene zzso Genome zzso is also exemplified by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso although they have retained almost all of the about 65 genes presumably present in the zzso of ancestral zzso In this study, the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and compared to those of previously examined zzso Our results document the first case where cellular reduction of a zzso zzso was accompanied by marked reduction in gene content of both the zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso falls within the lower size range displayed by green zzso zzso The 36 zzso zzso specifying two zzso with conventional structures, 16 zzso and 18 zzso are all zzso on the same DNA strand and represent zzso of the zzso Besides a pronounced zzso bias, the zzso genes feature a zzso genetic code characterized by the use of zzso zzso a stop zzso to code for zzso and the unprecedented use of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as stop zzso We conclude that substantial reduction of the zzso zzso occurred in at least three independent zzso lineages and that this process entailed a number of zzso changes in these zzso
