The B cell zzso mapping of zzso was performed using zzso synthetic peptides overlapping by eight zzso acids covering the whole sequence of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso of five patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso and four zzso from patients with primary zzso syndrome zzso were tested against the overlapping synthetic zzso zzso highly zzso with zzso zzso were those spanning the regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the La zzso zzso of the minimum required length of the zzso zzso disclosed the following zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso features and molecular similarities of the defined zzso were investigated using protein zzso The La zzso zzso presented zzso similarity with the zzso region of human zzso basic protein zzso and zzso similarity with the zzso zzso of human DNA zzso zzso zzso corresponding to these sequences zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso from patients with zzso or zzso 35 zzso without zzso zzso from patients with SS or zzso and 41 zzso from zzso healthy blood donors were tested against zzso synthetic zzso zzso in order to determine their sensitivity and specificity for the detection of zzso zzso zzso were detected with various zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso to zzso to zzso zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity using all zzso with the synthetic peptides were found to be zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso to zzso constitute a zzso population, directed against different linear B cell zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso presents molecular similarity with fragments of two other zzso zzso human zzso and DNA zzso zzso Finally, synthetic zzso zzso exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of zzso zzso
