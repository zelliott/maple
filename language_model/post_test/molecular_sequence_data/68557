Using zzso zzso which have previously been shown to be specific for the zzso gene found in the zzso disease zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and group zzso we detected an zzso zzso in other zzso species including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso disease zzso which carry the zzso gene on a zzso circular zzso we mapped the gene in other zzso species to linear plasmids which varied in size among the zzso zzso Some zzso carry multiple copies of the gene residing on linear plasmids of different zzso The analyses conducted here also demonstrate that these zzso species contain a linear zzso Northern zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the gene is zzso expressed in all species zzso High levels of zzso expression were observed in some zzso zzso zzso zzso start site analyses revealed that the length of the untranslated leader sequence was identical to that observed in the zzso disease zzso zzso By Western zzso zzso with zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein of zzso zzso we detected an zzso protein of the same molecular weight as the zzso found in zzso disease zzso zzso The results presented here demonstrate the presence of a protein that is genetically and zzso related to zzso which is expressed in all species of the zzso zzso zzso
