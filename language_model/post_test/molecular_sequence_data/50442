The human multiple drug resistance zzso gene has been used as a zzso marker to increase the proportion of bone zzso cells that contain and express this gene by drug zzso By constructing zzso zzso containing and expressing the zzso gene and a zzso gene such as the zzso zzso enrichment for cells containing both of these genes can be zzso A zzso construct containing zzso zzso in a Harvey zzso zzso has been used to zzso our zzso zzso zzso packaging line zzso zzso have been isolated by exposure of the zzso zzso cells zzso producer zzso to zzso zzso zzso a selective agent that kills zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso cell zzso with an zzso to zzso demonstrates expression of human zzso protein on the surface of these zzso producer zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso zzso clones were zzso using clone zzso and the highest zzso clone (4 zzso zzso viral particles per zzso was zzso with zzso donor mouse bone zzso cells for zzso zzso The donor cells were then injected into zzso zzso mice, and the presence of the zzso gene was zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso analysis using zzso zzso In one experiment eight of nine zzso mice were positive for zzso by zzso of peripheral blood 14 and 50 days zzso after 240 days three of nine zzso mice were zzso Bone zzso obtained from one of these positive animals was stained with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso population was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso pool contain increased levels of zzso zzso In addition, the bone zzso cells of several mice initially positive for zzso gene by zzso and subsequently negative, were exposed to zzso a drug whose zzso depends on zzso gene zzso a positive signal was obtained in all of these mice, indicating drug selection of zzso zzso zzso Cell sorting studies of these mice also show an increased number of zzso zzso cells, selected after exposure to zzso Thus, in this live animal model zzso zzso is effective in selecting a human zzso population of zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso This strategy may, thus, be useful in humans to prevent the zzso toxicity induced by zzso agents such as zzso and as a zzso marker to enrich for cells simultaneously zzso with a zzso zzso
