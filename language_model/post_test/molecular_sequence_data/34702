One of the most important roles that mass zzso zzso has played in the late zzso and early zzso centuries has been to assist in the growth of knowledge of dynamic zzso zzso Not only has zzso allowed researches to pinpoint the site of zzso but it has also enabled them to identify the zzso pairs responsible for regulation of a specific modification as well as to follow the functional consequences of the observed zzso events on the biology of the zzso For zzso analysis, the important contribution of zzso has been critical but not zzso There are numerous methods that have been applied with success, yet none are generally zzso to all zzso So, for the time being, researchers in the field must select from a panel of methods to find zzso zzso In the work described in this chapter, a collection of integrated methods are zzso A detailed account is provided for zzso capture via zzso and zzso immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso This is followed by a suite of useful strategies for discovery of zzso positioning through sequence determination by zzso diagnostic zzso scans, including precursor and product zzso scans, neutral loss scans, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
