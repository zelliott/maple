The zzso portion of the zzso zzso is anchored in the inner zzso membrane by two zzso zzso We investigated the role of the first zzso segment, which is absent in zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of the first zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a strong decrease in the amount of zzso g was zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not zzso or zzso and zzso cells displayed anomalous zzso zzso with zzso zzso This zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso in the zzso gene that encodes zzso zzso a component involved in the zzso of zzso zzso Our data indicate that the first zzso segment of the zzso zzso is not essential for the function of the zzso since its removal did not directly alter the zzso zzso It is proposed that the unique zzso segment of zzso g and the first zzso segment of zzso 4 zzso as shown by zzso zzso We zzso that in zzso cells the zzso has evolved to accommodate the interaction with the zzso an associated zzso zzso component only present in the zzso zzso
