zzso zzso functions both as a precursor of zzso zzso and as a zzso inhibitor of zzso Following the stimulation of cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso the zzso zzso zzso complex rapidly zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso is essential for zzso to trigger zzso degradation, which releases the associated zzso zzso to zzso into the nucleus and regulate target gene zzso zzso zzso resides in a zzso motif zzso zzso to the zzso target sequence in zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso was revealed to additionally require the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso double knockout embryonic zzso demonstrate that the zzso complex is essential for zzso to stimulate zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso can each zzso a zzso zzso fusion protein on both regulatory zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso generates a binding site for zzso the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso and depletion of zzso by zzso interference blocks zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso competition experiments indicate that zzso binds zzso more effectively when both zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Interestingly, however, zzso affinity for the zzso sequence on zzso is substantially lower than that on zzso Thus, it appears that reduced zzso recruitment of zzso and subsequent zzso may contribute to delayed zzso zzso after zzso stimulation relative to that for zzso
