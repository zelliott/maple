We have cloned and characterized a zzso region of DNA surrounding zzso It contains a cluster of two, and possibly three, genes associated with zzso islands within the 32 zzso immediately upstream of zzso We have zzso zzso representing one of these zzso zzso designated zzso The zzso which is located 29 zzso upstream of zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso probe recognizes fragments on Southern blots of DNA from other zzso zzso In human DNA, multiple zzso fragments are detected in addition to the predicted ones containing zzso zzso this locus may represent a member of an zzso zzso gene zzso zzso expression is zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, suggesting the possibility of coordinate zzso The deduced zzso product of the longest open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts a protein with regions rich in zzso and zzso and a region similar to the zzso motif adjacent to a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif with four zzso zzso zzso zzso of terminal zzso occurs, resulting in the zzso of one zzso domain and preservation of the zzso zzso Thus, a biologically important region of zzso zzso consists of a gene zzso At least one of these zzso in addition to zzso may be involved in regulation of cell growth or zzso
