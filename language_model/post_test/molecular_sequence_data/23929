Class I release factors 1 and 2 zzso and zzso terminate protein synthesis by recognizing stop zzso on the zzso via their zzso zzso acid motifs zzso in zzso and SPF in zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso interactions with the zzso zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso and zzso do not fit their zzso binding pocket zzso 73 zzso zzso zzso indicates large zzso changes in the zzso zzso Here, we investigate the zzso dynamics of the zzso and zzso using molecular dynamics zzso structural zzso and zzso analysis of domain zzso We show that relaxed zzso has a shape remarkably similar to the zzso zzso observed by zzso zzso The similarity between the two release factors is as good as between zzso factor G and zzso factor zzso Further, the zzso transitions and dynamics of zzso and zzso between the free and zzso states are most likely controlled by zzso of zzso zzso For zzso the distance between the zzso and zzso motifs shrinks from zzso zzso in the crystal to zzso zzso For zzso the separation between SPF and zzso zzso from 32 zzso in the crystal to 50 zzso zzso interaction strongly favors the open zzso of zzso however, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the domain zzso making the closed zzso of zzso more zzso Thus, zzso and zzso function like molecular machines, most likely fueled by zzso zzso The unified zzso control and the shapes of zzso and zzso support the proposition that the termination of protein synthesis involves similar mechanisms across zzso
