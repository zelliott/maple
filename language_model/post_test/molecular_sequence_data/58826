zzso a novel zzso element, was discovered as a length zzso in the white gene of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso zzso element was flanked by 8 zzso target site zzso and 8 zzso perfect terminal zzso repeats similar to those found in many members of the zzso zzso Its small size and lack of long open reading frames zzso protein coding zzso Southern analysis and in zzso zzso to zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso occurs in approximately 30 copies in the zzso of zzso zzso and its sibling species and is zzso in structure but zzso in zzso zzso zzso of five additional elements by sequencing revealed zzso identities of zzso to zzso Of 30 zzso zzso clones examined by zzso only one contained an element exceeding zzso zzso in zzso due to the zzso of another zzso zzso zzso Thus, the majority, if not all, extant zzso elements may be defective copies of a complete element whose contemporary existence in zzso zzso is zzso No zzso sequences were detected in nine other zzso and three zzso zzso suggesting a very limited zzso zzso
