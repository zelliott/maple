To determine the functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we have constructed zzso proteins by inserting 4-12 zzso acid zzso from the zzso region of human zzso between zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using baby zzso kidney cells, zzso zzso and zzso were shown to possess high cell zzso activity nearly equal to zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited somewhat lower cell zzso zzso The activities of these zzso proteins were inhibited by the addition of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso against zzso zzso as was the case for the zzso zzso The results suggest that the cell zzso signals are zzso to cells through the interaction with the zzso zzso The three-dimensional structures of zzso and zzso were determined at zzso resolution by zzso zzso A model of the inserted region in zzso could be built in the electron density map, but the positions of the preceding zzso zzso were zzso The inserted region in zzso did not demonstrate continuous electron zzso The results suggest that these zzso zzso regions are highly flexible and that such flexibility could allow the zzso of the zzso regions to be induced to fit into the binding pocket of the zzso zzso
