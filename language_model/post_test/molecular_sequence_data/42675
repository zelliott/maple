A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was specifically amplified from zzso constructed from the total zzso of zzso employing the DNA zzso chain zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso clone thus obtained was zzso zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The length of the zzso zzso zzso was estimated to be about zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso The partial zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence showed the following zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso of other zzso zzso with man, zzso with chicken, zzso with sea turtle, zzso with zzso and 38% with zzso Using the zzso as a probe, zzso and seasonal changes in zzso zzso levels in the zzso of toads were zzso zzso zzso in the zzso rose as metamorphosis progressed and declined at the end of zzso During the breeding season the zzso content of zzso zzso was relatively zzso This finding suggests that the increases in plasma and zzso zzso levels in larvae at zzso climax and in adults that remain in or migrate into water, as reported zzso accompany the increase in zzso zzso
