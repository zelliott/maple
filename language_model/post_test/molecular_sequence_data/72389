A simple method for the detection of a number of human zzso zzso zzso associated with cervical cancer has been zzso The zzso exploits the zzso zzso activity of zzso DNA zzso to increase the signal from fluorescent zzso by releasing them from zzso zzso during zzso The zzso are zzso with a zzso reporter dye zzso a zzso dye zzso and a zzso 3' zzso In the intact probe, the proximity of the reporter and the zzso results in suppression of reporter zzso by zzso energy transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso If the probe is bound downstream of either primer during zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso degrades it, allowing the reporter to diffuse away from the zzso which results in an increase in reporter zzso The increased zzso is directly related to the amount of target DNA and can be detected with an automated zzso zzso for the zzso region of the zzso zzso types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 were zzso and the zzso were zzso The most sensitive zzso can detect as few as two copies of zzso DNA in human cervical zzso
