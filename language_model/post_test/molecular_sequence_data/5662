To identify components of the zzso export machinery in zzso zzso a screen was developed to identify zzso that were zzso lethal with the conditional zzso export zzso zzso zzso defining three zzso groups were isolated, and here we report the characterization of zzso (for nuclear pore protein of 106 zzso This gene encodes a predicted protein that has significant similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso being a zzso a functional green fluorescent protein zzso zzso localized to the nuclear zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso gene is not zzso Moreover, a delta zzso zzso did not show zzso zzso of a zzso virus 40 nuclear zzso zzso reporter zzso and a fraction of cells had zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso A consequence of the synthetic zzso between zzso and zzso was the zzso of zzso zzso in the nucleus when cells were grown under synthetic lethal zzso In addition to zzso which is a nonsense zzso that zzso the protein at zzso acid zzso the delta zzso zzso was zzso lethal with zzso suggesting that the synthetic zzso is a consequence of the loss of a function of zzso We further demonstrate that a region between zzso acids 74 and 348 of zzso is required for zzso of the synthetic zzso These results uncover a potential direct or indirect involvement of zzso in zzso zzso
