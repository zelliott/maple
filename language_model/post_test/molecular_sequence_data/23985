zzso zzso are small zzso zzso peptides predominantly found in zzso and zzso cells engaged in host zzso These peptides act as zzso molecules in innate immunity as well as regulators in zzso zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso are effective zzso of zzso While the level of zzso in zzso infected individuals has not been determined, zzso and zzso dysfunction associated with zzso disease progression may result in altered zzso zzso This review provides an overview of the structure and function of zzso and focuses on the zzso activity of zzso and the mechanism of this zzso Although many questions remain, studying the complex function of zzso in innate immunity against zzso has implications for our further understanding of disease progression and for the development of novel approaches to prevention and zzso
