The current tuberculosis vaccine is a live vaccine derived from zzso zzso and attenuated by serial in zzso zzso All vaccine zzso in use stem from one source, strain zzso zzso However, they differ in regions of zzso zzso zzso expression levels, zzso and protective zzso 

As a zzso zzso increases genetic stability and may contribute restricting the ongoing evolution of the various zzso zzso while maintaining their protective zzso we aimed to zzso zzso by zzso replacement in zzso vaccine strains representing different zzso lineages zzso zzso Denmark, zzso zzso gene replacement was achieved successfully in three out of four zzso However, only illegitimate zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed that a single zzso zzso in the zzso part of zzso led to a zzso zzso with an early stop zzso making zzso Russia a natural zzso zzso At the protein level zzso Russia failed to express zzso 

According to zzso analyses zzso Russia is an ancient vaccine strain most closely related to the parental zzso zzso We zzso that zzso zzso in zzso Russia occurred early and is in part responsible for its high degree of zzso stability, resulting in a zzso that has less genetic zzso than other vaccine zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso
