zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from several zzso zzso and zzso zzso the blue crab zzso zzso green shore crab zzso zzso European lobster zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frames of 143 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Apart from the predicted signal peptides zzso zzso zzso the zzso translated precursor codes for a single copy of zzso and four other peptides that are extremely similar in terms of zzso acid sequence within these species, but which clearly show divergence into zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso were determined during embryonic development in zzso using quantitative zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and showed that significant zzso expression (at 50% embryonic zzso preceded zzso levels of zzso in the developing central nervous system zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression dramatically increased during the late stages of zzso zzso zzso with developing zzso zzso In adult zzso zzso gene expression was detected exclusively in the zzso brain and in particular the zzso zzso in zzso with the predominance of zzso cells in this zzso zzso of expression patterns of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso throughout the zzso cycle revealed only modest changes, indicating that previously observed increases in zzso zzso levels during zzso were not zzso zzso Severe hypoxic conditions resulted in rapid zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso but not the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso challenge did not change zzso zzso zzso These results offer the first zzso glimpses of involvement of zzso in environmental adaptation to extreme, yet biologically relevant zzso and perhaps suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso might be involved in adaptation to environmental zzso
