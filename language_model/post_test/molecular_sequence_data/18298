A gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso to zzso gene D zzso previously cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso the hypersensitive response zzso was not zzso when the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was reintroduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso race 4 on a broad host range zzso and the bacteria were zzso into soybean zzso DNA sequence data disclosed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a protein containing zzso identical zzso acids to zzso with zzso distributed throughout the zzso Two zzso immediately downstream from the zzso zzso were more similar in zzso zzso zzso tomato and zzso zzso zzso zzso with 98 and zzso identical zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso genes constructed between the zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso gene and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene product was formed less efficiently or was less stable than was the zzso zzso zzso tomato protein zzso by zzso The data indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso gene which has been modified by zzso such that it does not lead to an zzso zzso on the normal host plant, zzso
