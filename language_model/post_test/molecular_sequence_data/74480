zzso zzso from zzso flowers include three zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso Using a functional zzso approach, we have isolated and zzso characterized two nearly identical zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso responsible for the zzso profile of zzso scent remaining to be zzso The zzso protein has an additional 30 zzso acids in the zzso and shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso with only 23 zzso acid zzso distributed across the zzso regions of the zzso Although these two zzso zzso have very similar zzso properties, and zzso zzso and zzso as specific products from zzso and zzso respectively, they are zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and analysis of zzso activities in zzso zzso together with our previous feeding experiments, revealed that zzso is localized in zzso and is responsible for zzso zzso whereas zzso is located in zzso and accounts for zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in addition to the availability of zzso controls the type of product zzso By directing nearly identical zzso zzso to more than one cellular zzso plants extend the range of available zzso for zzso zzso thus increasing the diversity of the zzso zzso
