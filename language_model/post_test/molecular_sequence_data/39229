zzso diversity between French European brown zzso syndrome zzso viruses since the disease appeared has been zzso zzso sequencing of the partial zzso protein genes of 169 zzso viruses collected from various parts of France between 1989 and 2003, three reference zzso and a Greek zzso collected in 2002 revealed a maximum zzso divergence of zzso indicating a high level of conservation between zzso Two major groups were zzso The first group contained zzso viruses collected since 1989 from different parts of France, the reference zzso and all of the viruses located in the far north of zzso In this group, three zzso were clearly identified as mainly related to their geographic zzso The distribution of the viruses suggests that the early viruses have not disappeared and have slowly evolved in their area of zzso The second group, supported by a significant zzso value, contained the Greek zzso with the French zzso viruses collected between 1999 and 2003 from regions of southern zzso It constitutes a newly identified zzso Our results demonstrate strong differences in genetic evolution between zzso and rabbit zzso disease virus, with persistence of the earlier zzso viruses and interaction between the geographical and zzso zzso
