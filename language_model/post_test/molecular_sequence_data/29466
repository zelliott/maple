This study identifies a complement component zzso protein in the solitary zzso zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso raised against zzso molecules from two species zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were used to identify the zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is a zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso that have molecular weights comparable to those of zzso and zzso from other zzso zzso acid sequencing and zzso acid composition analysis confirmed that the zzso protein from zzso zzso is closely related to zzso from zzso zzso
