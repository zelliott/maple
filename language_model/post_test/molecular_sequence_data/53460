In this paper, we describe the structure of zzso B from zzso zzso which consists of a zzso domain with a zzso fold and a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is the first structure of a bacterial zzso and it represents one of only a few examples of a zzso zzso structure having interacting zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain has exposed aromatic zzso that contribute to a zzso long continuous aromatic stretch extending into the active zzso zzso of zzso zzso is blocked beyond the zzso zzso which explains why the zzso has zzso activity and degrades the zzso chain from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso B structure with that of zzso A explains why these zzso act zzso in the degradation of zzso
