The zzso from zzso zzso presented three open reading frames zzso to the genes coding for human zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso with zzso activities implicated in zzso zzso To investigate the role of these zzso namely within the zzso respiratory chain, we studied their cellular zzso and characterized the respective zzso zzso zzso Efficiency of the respiratory chain was analyzed by oxygen consumption studies and zzso organization of the zzso system was assessed through zzso analysis in the respective zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that, unlike in zzso systems, disruption of zzso in zzso does not affect either complex I assembly or zzso Furthermore, the zzso respiratory chain complexes of the zzso strains display a similar zzso organization to that observed in the wild type zzso Further characterization revealed that zzso zzso zzso appears localized to both the zzso and the zzso whereas zzso was found exclusively in the zzso zzso was detected in both zzso and zzso of the amid zzso strain, but was barely discernible in wild type zzso suggesting overlapping functions for the two zzso
