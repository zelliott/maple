The gene zzso zzso the zzso DNA binding zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso was detected on a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso by this gene consists of 165 zzso and has a zzso of zzso The zzso sequence was confirmed by zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso of zzso protein isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso to the respective protein of zzso zzso The zzso sequence upstream of the zzso zzso zzso gene shows little zzso to the regulatory region upstream of the zzso gene of zzso zzso The zzso gene was located at a distance of zzso zzso from the origin of replication on a physical map of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso could replace the zzso protein of zzso coli zzso if its production was controlled by the zzso promoter on a zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso Both the zzso protein and zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso are zzso modified by zzso of the first zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is a stable zzso The copy number of zzso in zzso zzso is 1200 zzso 250 zzso per zzso zzso characterization of the DNA binding properties shows zzso to have a lower affinity for zzso DNA than zzso
