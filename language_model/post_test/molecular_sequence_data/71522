A zzso zzso zzso is mainly expressed in zzso cells and zzso It is assumed to play a role in the early stage of differentiation of these zzso To understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the zzso gene expression in zzso we cloned and characterized the mouse zzso zzso The gene consists of four zzso and three zzso and spans about zzso zzso All the zzso boundaries are consistent with the zzso zzso A single zzso start site was identified by primer extension and zzso mapping zzso Although the zzso region is zzso rich zzso it contains probable zzso and zzso zzso Potential binding sequences for zzso regulatory proteins including zzso and zzso are also present in this zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter was performed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with zzso promoter zzso zzso We found three possible positive regulatory regions, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, required for zzso gene expression in zzso cells by analyses of a series of zzso zzso of the fusion zzso The activities of these zzso were extremely low in zzso zzso and zzso cells suggesting that they possess zzso zzso Further analysis revealed two zzso boxes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, necessary for zzso gene zzso Thus, multiple regulatory elements contribute to the zzso gene expression in zzso
