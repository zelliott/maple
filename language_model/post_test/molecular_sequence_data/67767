zzso is a very rare zzso zzso zzso It is an zzso zzso zzso caused by a variety of zzso within the zzso zzso We describe in this report two new cases of zzso in zzso 

The 14 coding zzso of the human serum zzso zzso gene and their zzso junctions were zzso zzso The products were screened for zzso by zzso High Performance zzso zzso zzso zzso with altered zzso profiles were zzso 

DNA sequencing revealed the presence of a zzso zzso zzso transition in the first base of zzso 11 zzso in both zzso This zzso destroys the zzso consensus donor sequence found at the zzso end of most intervening sequences and would cause the defective zzso zzso 

zzso diagnosis based on zzso and DNA sequencing represents a powerful tool to study molecular defects causing zzso
