zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso has been determined in this study by X-ray zzso at high zzso The zzso is almost entirely composed of zzso and consists of three zzso The arrangement of 28 zzso in the second domain is of particular interest, having seven zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The copper site has zzso coordination with two zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso at the equatorial sites and another zzso at the zzso zzso The most intriguing structural feature is a zzso bond between C zzso 1 of zzso which is one of the equatorial zzso and S gamma of zzso This unexpected zzso bond, and zzso stacked above it, strongly supports the presence of a zzso free radical in the zzso as a zzso secondary zzso zzso of the molecular surface shows a small pocket at the copper site and suggests a zzso model, which can explain the zzso zzso A model for the zzso zzso involving a zzso free radical and basic zzso is also zzso
