zzso is important in the regulation of many cellular zzso yet the precise role of protein zzso for many zzso protein zzso remains zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso of a zzso human zzso virus zzso Rev protein promotes rapid formation of an efficient zzso zzso The apparent zzso constant for zzso binding is enhanced zzso for the protein following zzso however, zzso addition leads to a zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso binding stimulates slow formation of an equally competent binding state for the zzso zzso indicating that the addition of zzso or zzso binding promotes a similar zzso change in zzso zzso directly alters the zzso of zzso as revealed by modification experiments that monitor the zzso accessibility of zzso in the zzso These zzso properties are attributed to the addition of zzso at one of two zzso zzso zzso or zzso that lie within the zzso domain adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso of Rev does not affect Rev zzso zzso The Rev protein from the less zzso zzso isolate lacks this zzso site in the zzso acid zzso thus, the described zzso properties of the zzso protein may contribute to Rev activity and possibly to zzso zzso during natural zzso
