As perennial plants, zzso species are constantly exposed to environmental zzso such as wounding and pathogen attack, which lead to production of compounds including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In this study, a zzso clone zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The full-length zzso named zzso was zzso with a zzso open reading frame that corresponded to a deduced protein of 391 zzso acid zzso Multiple sequence alignments showed that zzso shared high zzso with zzso proteins from other zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was most closely related to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified that the zzso gene was abundantly expressed in the leaves and zzso while its expression was drastically reduced in the zzso zzso abundance of zzso was zzso by zzso within zzso of wounding zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the zzso promoter was capable of directing expression of the zzso reporter in both wounded and zzso leaves of transgenic Chinese white zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso promoter is zzso responsive to wounding zzso Furthermore, promoter deletion analysis showed that the zzso zzso from the zzso start site were required for promoter zzso by zzso acid and the zzso to zzso region was proved to be necessary for establishing zzso pattern of zzso
