The zzso zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess multiple functions in the maturation of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso We are interested in developing an zzso model system to study the role of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso Cloning of the zzso for chick zzso and zzso reveals that the two gene products are more than zzso identical to their human and mouse zzso and are similarly derived from the same genetic zzso zzso zzso have been developed, and detect two proteins of 80 and zzso Chick zzso and zzso message and proteins are found in a variety of embryonic and juvenile zzso including zzso and zzso zzso message and protein are generally less abundant than zzso zzso this zzso is greatest in growth plate zzso zzso protein is more tightly bound than zzso to the zzso zzso produced by cultured zzso The zzso gene is also expressed in zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso influence zzso signaling as well as zzso maturation during zzso
