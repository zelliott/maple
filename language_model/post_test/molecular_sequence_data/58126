zzso inflammatory protein 1 alpha zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein that may be important in acute and chronic zzso The present study determined the sequential production, source, and in zzso contribution of zzso zzso alpha in synchronized zzso zzso egg pulmonary zzso zzso zzso were examined under conditions of primary, secondary vigorous, and secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha was measured in zzso zzso from intact zzso zzso cultured with or without soluble egg zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice over a zzso period showed low spontaneous zzso alpha production zzso 1 zzso However, when primary zzso were challenged with SEA, significant zzso alpha production was observed beginning at day 4 and zzso at day zzso zzso vigorous zzso from zzso zzso and modulated zzso from zzso zzso secondary pulmonary zzso demonstrated comparable spontaneous zzso alpha zzso zzso of SEA to vigorous stage zzso zzso expression of zzso alpha at all time points, whereas zzso modulated stage zzso did not increase zzso The latter observation is likely related to zzso zzso mechanisms reported for modulated stage zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha in zzso sections and zzso preparations from vigorous zzso localized zzso alpha production to zzso within zzso Treatment of mice with rabbit zzso zzso alpha zzso significantly decreased zzso primary zzso formation zzso zzso when compared with control zzso zzso alpha zzso also decreased vigorous zzso zzso but not modulated zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso alpha contributes to cellular recruitment during zzso egg zzso zzso
