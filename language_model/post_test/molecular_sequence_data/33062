zzso is a common childhood onset zzso disorder, zzso by severe and sustained impairment of social interaction and social communication, as well as a notably restricted repertoire of activities and zzso Its zzso is zzso with a strong genetic zzso zzso is the rate limiting component of zzso translation zzso and plays a key role in learning and memory through its control of translation within the zzso zzso zzso translation is the final common process modulated by the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso and fragile X mental zzso protein zzso zzso which are implicated in zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso region on zzso zzso has been found in zzso wide linkage zzso 

The authors present evidence that directly implicates zzso in zzso In a boy with classic zzso the authors observed a de zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and mapped the zzso site to within a proposed alternative transcript of zzso They then screened 120 zzso families for zzso and found two unrelated families where in each case both zzso siblings and one of the parents zzso the same single zzso zzso at position zzso in the zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and reporter gene studies show that this zzso enhances binding of a nuclear factor and zzso promoter zzso 

These observations zzso zzso and more specifically control of zzso activity, directly in zzso The findings raise the exciting possibility that pharmacological manipulation of zzso may provide therapeutic benefit for those with zzso caused by zzso of the zzso pathways controlling zzso zzso
