Important aspects of zzso electron transport efficiency in zzso are controlled by protein zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have distinct roles in zzso and long-term zzso zzso to changes in light quality and zzso Although some zzso of zzso and zzso are known, the complexity of this regulatory zzso system implies that currently unknown zzso connect zzso performance with the regulation of zzso and regulatory zzso We performed an unbiased zzso screen with zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants to identify unique zzso zzso The zzso status of zzso was not affected in zzso indicating that zzso other than zzso zzso zzso under standard growth zzso Among several putative zzso zzso zzso is of particular importance because of its possible role in the zzso of zzso electron zzso The zzso zzso site on zzso is absent in both zzso plants and zzso In zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants indicate a zzso slowing down of the transition from zzso to linear electron flow at the onset of zzso This finding suggests a possible link between protein zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso electron flow during this critical step of photosynthesis, when the carbon zzso is not commensurate to the electron flow capacity of the zzso
