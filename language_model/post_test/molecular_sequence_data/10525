The zzso zzso zzso of the rat brain sodium channel is critical for fast zzso possibly forming a fast zzso zzso zzso can be disrupted by zzso of a zzso zzso at position zzso in the zzso loop of domain zzso Combination of a charged zzso at zzso with a zzso zzso charge zzso at position zzso in zzso partially restores zzso of the zzso The zzso charge zzso channel has a single-channel mean open time that is similar to that of the zzso channel and is approximately 50 times shorter than that of the zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso cycle analysis indicate that the zzso in domain III zzso and zzso have a zzso energy of zzso zzso indicating that the two zzso act zzso These data suggest that zzso interacts directly with zzso which may form part of the zzso site if zzso is a fast zzso zzso
