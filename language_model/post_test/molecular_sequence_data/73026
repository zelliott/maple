In this work the authors tested the hypothesis that differential zzso may be one of the mechanisms by which B cells could be able to produce zzso or zzso zzso zzso The same genetic information will be used in both zzso To prove this hypothesis the authors used mice transgenic for the zzso zzso + zzso zzso cell line producing zzso zzso zzso with specificity for the zzso zzso zzso In these animals most cells in the periphery express exclusively the zzso zzso To obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from transgenic animals were zzso in zzso with zzso zzso The authors used zzso derived B cell blasts to produce a zzso cell zzso A high proportion of the zzso zzso were found to bind to zzso and to zzso with unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso were not responsible for zzso since the zzso clones only expressed the zzso zzso This was demonstrated by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso and by sequencing analysis of the zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the expressed zzso and zzso genes were identical to the sequences of the rearranged zzso and zzso zzso which undoubtedly demonstrates that zzso zzso are derived from the same zzso and also that no zzso in the zzso or zzso or in the zzso could account for the observed zzso It is also shown here that the zzso zzso bear the zzso Id zzso characteristic of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be slightly more zzso than the zzso zzso Furthermore, binding to zzso was not influenced by treatment with zzso an inhibitor of zzso while, in the same zzso other types of binding were considerably zzso This supports the hypothesis of the importance of zzso in zzso
