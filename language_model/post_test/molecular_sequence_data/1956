zzso is a small zzso acid protein from zzso zzso that binds to the large zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso its zzso During DNA damage, S phase, or both, zzso activity must be tightly zzso since failure to control the cellular level of zzso pools may lead to genetic zzso such as zzso zzso or even cell zzso zzso characterization of zzso is an important step in understanding the regulation of zzso Until now the zzso state of zzso was zzso Mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed an zzso zzso bond involving the zzso zzso at position 14 of the primary zzso To determine whether zzso bonding is essential for zzso zzso we zzso the zzso to zzso zzso equilibrium zzso in the zzso zzso show that both zzso and zzso zzso exist as zzso in solution, indicating that the zzso is not a result of a zzso zzso Further studies of several truncated zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso zzso reveal that both proteins zzso zzso and have almost identical zzso zzso It appears that zzso is a zzso protein where the zzso is responsible for zzso and the zzso for binding and zzso zzso zzso
