zzso zzso zzso protein pairs can act as zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso Although zzso has a zzso zzso domain, zzso has a divergent zzso zzso Here, we establish that the zzso mini zzso domain is functional and, in combination with a portion of zzso domain, is sufficient for nuclear envelope zzso zzso and zzso are hypothesized to be outer and inner nuclear membrane zzso respectively, and to zzso but neither their zzso nor their physical interaction has been directly zzso We show that zzso is a type II outer nuclear membrane zzso protein and that zzso is a type II inner nuclear membrane zzso The proteins interact in the zzso space of the nuclear envelope via the zzso mini zzso domain and a region of zzso that does not include the zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to restrict zzso to the zzso preventing diffusion through the zzso zzso We establish that zzso is indeed immobile at the zzso by using zzso recovery after zzso and show that zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso in zzso This work supports current models of zzso pairs and highlights the diversity in sequence elements defining zzso zzso
