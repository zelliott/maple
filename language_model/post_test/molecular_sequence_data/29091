Two distinct forms of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from Atlantic cod zzso zzso liver zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso From the zzso zzso both forms were deduced to zzso an open reading frame of 301 zzso zzso with an identical zzso zzso region and different zzso regions of 34 zzso zzso By comparison with the human zzso zzso the two forms were identified as possible zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso Several zzso of zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli in order to zzso the zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to apparent zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and stability experiments showed that zzso was similar to zzso previously zzso from Atlantic cod liver, and was more zzso and temperature zzso than a zzso human zzso zzso Under optimal zzso conditions for both zzso and zzso the turnover number zzso was three times higher for zzso compared with zzso with an identical zzso resulting in a zzso higher zzso efficiency zzso for zzso These activity and stability experiments reveal zzso features in zzso zzso models of the zzso zzso of Atlantic cod zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso were built using the human zzso zzso crystal structure as a zzso The unique zzso acid zzso observed in cod zzso were mainly located in the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso The analysis indicated a more stable zzso a more flexible zzso and a less stabilized core in zzso as compared with the zzso zzso zzso of several zzso acids in or near the zzso site in zzso could give rise to a more positively charged surface and a higher zzso potential near the active site compared with the zzso zzso The higher potential may increase the zzso interactions between the zzso and DNA, and may explain the increased zzso affinity and, in combination with the higher flexibility, the higher zzso efficiency observed for zzso
