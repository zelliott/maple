zzso constituted by the zzso acid zzso contain all the genetic information of a zzso DNA is a double zzso consisting of two zzso zzso chains where each zzso is composed of the association between a base, a sugar and a zzso zzso The chains are associated by hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso bonds specifically with zzso while zzso bonds specifically with zzso The sequence of DNA is related to the sequence of protein by the genetic zzso Each zzso is represented by a zzso that consists of a zzso zzso Information is expressed by a zzso zzso The first step, zzso generates a zzso zzso acid called zzso zzso zzso (where a zzso base is present instead of a zzso which acts as an intermediate zzso In this step, zzso zzso is one of the maturation processes consisting of joining the zzso by removing the zzso of the precursor zzso zzso The second step, translation, converts the zzso sequence into the sequence of zzso Since the 1970s, the progress in DNA technology consisting of the development of molecular zzso DNA library construction and sequencing methods, has made it possible to isolate and analyze specific genes directly from the zzso A sequence of zzso or complementary DNA zzso is cloned by inserting it into a zzso zzso or zzso that can replicate independently in zzso Before zzso zzso DNA is zzso into fragments by restriction zzso zzso zzso specific sequences within zzso zzso whereas zzso sequences are copied into zzso by reverse zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
