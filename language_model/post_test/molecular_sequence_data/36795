The zzso and zzso potency of zzso growth factor zzso has linked this zzso to the zzso of several disease states including zzso and zzso We have reviewed the recent literature on aspects relating to the structure, distribution and biology of zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to zzso several normal and tumor cells zzso the zzso in one or more of three possible zzso zzso Alternative zzso of zzso 6 in zzso zzso zzso results in the formation of two protein species with different zzso Initially, it was thought that the longer zzso zzso was processed only by transformed zzso However, recent evidence indicates that alternative zzso occurs in several cells which express the zzso including early zzso zzso The functional significance of the zzso 6 product, a highly basic region spanned by 18 zzso acid zzso zzso is not precisely zzso We have summarized recent findings which zzso roles for zzso in the processing, zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear transport zzso and zzso zzso Thus, alternative zzso could play an important role in the zzso of the functional properties of the zzso zzso zzso per zzso and in the complex interactive network of zzso growth factors and zzso
