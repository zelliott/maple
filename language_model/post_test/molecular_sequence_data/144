The zzso zzso proteins constitute a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso they are zzso by 19 zzso most of which are themselves alternatively zzso In the case of zzso the use of alternative 3' zzso sites 21 zzso apart generates two alternatively spliced zzso zzso 1 zzso has an zzso relative to zzso 2 zzso that replaces a single zzso with eight zzso acids zzso The biological implications of zzso alternative zzso have been zzso A previously described zzso zzso affecting both zzso zzso shows several zzso zzso including defects in zzso development and root zzso We found that the zzso promoter is highly active in regions with actively growing and dividing zzso We also tested the ability of each zzso zzso to complement the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso green fluorescent protein zzso fusion zzso As expected, transgenic plants zzso either zzso displayed both nuclear zzso and zzso zzso throughout the zzso We found that zzso zzso the flower zzso zzso but not the root growth zzso zzso zzso zzso root growth but not floral zzso zzso of a predicted zzso site within the alternatively spliced segment, zzso does not affect zzso However, a double zzso affecting both zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso + zzso behaves like zzso 2, zzso the root but not the floral zzso In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the two alternatively spliced zzso of zzso have distinct biological zzso
