The zzso zzso zzso gene complement consists of at least seven zzso protein zzso These include five zzso zzso protein zzso and two more zzso related zzso which are expressed upon terminal differentiation zzso or during the zzso stage of zzso zzso In the past, three zzso zzso zzso genes plus the zzso and zzso genes have been isolated and zzso In this report, we describe the sequences of two more zzso zzso and we show that all five zzso zzso zzso genes and the zzso gene map to the region zzso on zzso zzso zzso This is in agreement with our previous finding that the human zzso zzso gene complement maps to zzso which zzso to the zzso region on the zzso zzso zzso Previous reports have shown that the zzso zzso genes map to zzso regions on zzso 22 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso
