In our previous study, zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso deduced from pigeon zzso zzso zzso zzso and it's zzso in the T cell responses restricted to I-A molecules were zzso It has been shown that zzso acid zzso position 50 of the zzso works as an zzso which contacts with T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso at positions 46 and 54 function as zzso which contact with I-A zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso sites were analyzed in T cell zzso responses that were restricted to the other class II, zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which had been prepared by substitution of zzso acids at positions 46, 50 and 54 of zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively was shown to induce class II restricted T cell responses in zzso A zzso zzso zzso but not in B10 zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso which had been prepared by substitution of zzso acids at positions 50 and 54 with V and zzso respectively induced T cell proliferation in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso but not in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso and zzso generate zzso restricted zzso responses of T zzso in zzso and zzso mice, zzso Furthermore, it was shown that zzso 50 functions an an zzso and zzso 46 and 54 as zzso in the zzso restricted zzso Almost identical results were obtained when zzso restricted responses of T zzso were analyzed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, sine no zzso negative counterpart strain for these two latter strains is available, complete analysis concerning the zzso and zzso functions has not been performed with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present findings demonstrate that the functional sites of the zzso zzso are preserved is the T cell responses restricted to each zzso zzso zzso However, when most potent zzso motif was determined in various mouse zzso the specific zzso acid motifs on the zzso positions were different among various zzso zzso Furthermore, substitution of the zzso zzso showed no influence on the binding affinity between zzso zzso and class II zzso Thus, these zzso and zzso appear to function zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
