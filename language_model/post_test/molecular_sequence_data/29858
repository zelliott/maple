zzso characteristics of human zzso soluble zzso protein zzso were studied using simple zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso containing up to 6 terminal zzso zzso bovine serum zzso derivatives containing 7 to 40 zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso derived zzso as zzso in a newly developed binding zzso In this zzso zzso zzso was attached to zzso zzso zzso which was then used to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso served as a zzso The zzso is sensitive, maintains zzso in the concentration range of zzso tested, and has very low zzso zzso The following new findings were zzso 1) All the zzso with zzso zzso were better zzso than the corresponding zzso 2) The zzso were better zzso than the corresponding zzso regardless of the zzso zzso 3) Many Gal beta zzso and Gal beta zzso zzso were zzso Although the zzso did not appear to recognize zzso as a zzso the presence of this sugar penultimate to zzso increased the binding affinity by as much as zzso as was the case for zzso Of a particular importance is the presence of an equatorial zzso group on this zzso We zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and found that it had zzso lower binding affinity compared to zzso 4) The binding sites of this zzso do not seem to be operating in a cooperative fashion, since synthetic zzso zzso zzso with various zzso distances did not increase the binding affinity zzso
