zzso are often used to study tissue damage following shock after traumatic injury and in the course of other zzso The processes involved are thought to be caused at least in part by zzso released from zzso zzso zzso Since little is known about zzso and its role as a zzso of tissue damage in zzso we studied the zzso properties and release characteristics to sheep zzso zzso zzso in comparison of those of human zzso zzso zzso Both zzso showed similar molecular masses, zzso compositions, zzso zzso zzso and abilities to digest zzso zzso zzso however, were found in kinetic parameters measured with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso was nearly 10 times higher zzso zzso than the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso calculated for zzso were zzso and for zzso zzso of corresponding values determined for zzso In addition, significant differences between sheep and human zzso were found in in zzso stimulation zzso In contrast to human zzso sheep zzso released no active zzso and only 50 to zzso of the zzso produced by human zzso This failure to release active zzso could not be explained by a lower zzso content of sheep zzso as there were no significant differences found between the zzso contents of sheep and human zzso We conclude that zzso liberated by zzso sheep zzso is zzso by a zzso released zzso inhibitor also located within the sheep zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
