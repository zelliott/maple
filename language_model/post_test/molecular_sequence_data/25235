The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and joining zzso portions of zzso have been zzso from extracts of bovine zzso zzso zzso were zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso batch extraction procedures followed by zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso was found to consist of four major components while joining zzso was found to consist of two major zzso Fast atom zzso zzso analysis of the zzso fragments of both peptides revealed that the observed zzso could be explained in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso at zzso zzso 28 to an extent of about zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso is situated within an zzso acid sequence with a preponderance of zzso zzso zzso of this zzso acid zzso is entirely compatible with the known primary structure requirements of the zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and joining zzso were found to have zzso at their zzso zzso to an extent of about zzso The zzso sequence for bovine zzso predicts the presence of zzso acid at position 1 of both zzso zzso is normally formed through the zzso of zzso This reaction is thought to be zzso by a zzso forming zzso located within the zzso zzso zzso Under certain circumstances peptides with zzso at their zzso zzso may act as zzso for this zzso
