The structure of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso features several zzso that are predicted to exhibit limited zzso zzso An elevated frequency of zzso zzso within these zzso suggests a link between structural instability and the functional effects of zzso zzso A series of zzso featuring zzso within the D and zzso stems were prepared and investigated using zzso zzso zzso mapping studies indicated that these zzso were partially zzso for the wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso and were significantly stabilized by zzso introducing additional or stronger base pairs into the stem zzso In addition, trends in the zzso activities of the D stem zzso suggested that the loose structure is required for function, with zzso displaying the most ordered structures exhibiting the lowest levels of zzso zzso A pronounced zzso of the structures of the zzso and D stems was observed, with zzso strengthening the D stem stabilizing the zzso stem and vice zzso The existence of strong zzso communication was further zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing a stabilized D stem and a zzso zzso that disrupted the zzso zzso zzso the structure of the D stem completely restored the function of the zzso zzso to zzso levels, indicating that zzso structural weaknesses contribute to the functional zzso of this zzso by zzso
