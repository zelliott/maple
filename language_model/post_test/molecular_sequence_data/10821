zzso zzso are zzso DNA viruses with segmented zzso that replicate only in the zzso of some species of zzso zzso and are required for the successful zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA segments are integrated in the zzso of their associated zzso zzso and some are zzso zzso smaller segments are produced from and largely zzso with larger zzso To determine the internal structure of zzso viral zzso the first complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso segment and its integration locus was zzso By restriction zzso Southern zzso and sequence zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso segment W is integrated into zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that zzso segment W zzso in two zzso direct long terminal repeats zzso in the zzso zzso while only one zzso copy is present in the zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that terminal direct repeats are a general feature of zzso DNA segment integration but that the zzso and size of the repeats can vary zzso zzso W contains 12 imperfect direct repeats of six different types between 89 zzso and zzso zzso with 65 to zzso zzso The orientation and structure of the repeats suggest that W itself may have arisen through sequence zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso and sequence analyses of cloned R and M demonstrated that these segments are zzso within segment W and that internal imperfect direct repeats of one type are implicated in the zzso zzso zzso events that generate segments R and zzso Interestingly, segment zzso zzso increases the copy number of genes zzso by segment W, suggesting that the unusual zzso organization of zzso may be directly linked to the unique functions of this virus in its zzso zzso association with zzso zzso
