The zzso T4 zzso gene encodes a zzso DNA repair zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso We have discovered the first zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso which are common in fresh zzso This gene functions in zzso and also when cloned in zzso zzso zzso virus DNA can also be zzso by the host zzso Since the zzso viruses are continually exposed to solar radiation in their native zzso two separate DNA repair systems, one that functions in the dark and one that functions in the light, significantly enhance their zzso
