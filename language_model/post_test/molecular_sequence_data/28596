Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso and zzso are zzso with similar biological zzso Whereas zzso is the zzso agent of an aggressive zzso zzso zzso has been associated with only a few cases of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso transformed a zzso zzso cell line to form colonies in soft zzso but the size and number of the colonies were lower than those of zzso Use of a zzso Tax protein showed that the zzso zzso acids 300 to 353 were responsible for the high transforming activity of zzso zzso of cellular genes by zzso through zzso factor zzso B is reportedly essential for the transformation of zzso zzso zzso also activated the zzso through zzso B in zzso cells, and such activity was equivalent to that induced by zzso Thus, the high transforming activity of zzso is zzso by mechanisms other than zzso B zzso Our results showed that zzso has a lower transforming activity than zzso and suggest that the high transforming activity of zzso is involved in the zzso property of zzso
