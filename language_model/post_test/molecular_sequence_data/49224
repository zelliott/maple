zzso zzso of zzso zzso affect many different processes in zzso zzso In addition to reducing the size of both roots and lateral zzso of the shoot, zzso zzso affect the size of the shoot zzso zzso accelerate zzso phase change, delay floral induction under short days, zzso leaves and zzso disrupt the zzso of the zzso and reduce zzso Double zzso analysis suggests that zzso acts in parallel to zzso in the regulation of phase change and in parallel to zzso in the regulation of leaf zzso zzso cloning demonstrated that zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transport receptors zzso 5 in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with a potential role in zzso zzso we found that zzso interacts with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and that a zzso fusion protein is located at the periphery of the zzso zzso is one of at least 17 members of the zzso family in zzso and is the first member of this family shown to have an essential function in zzso The zzso zzso zzso suggests that this protein regulates the zzso transport of molecules involved in several different zzso zzso as well as molecules generally required for root and shoot zzso
