zzso escape mechanisms of human zzso virus type 1 zzso from zzso T zzso zzso is essential for understanding the zzso of zzso infection and developing effective zzso To study the processing and presentation of known zzso zzso we prepared zzso zzso B cells that zzso express the gag gene of six field zzso by adopting an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso virus G protein and then tested them for the recognition by zzso zzso zzso lines or zzso We observed that two field zzso zzso and zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three field zzso zzso zzso and zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso escaped from being killed by the zzso lines, despite the fact that they were recognized when the synthetic peptides corresponding to these zzso sequences were zzso loaded onto the target zzso Thus, their escape is likely due to the changes that occur during the processing and presentation of zzso in the infected zzso zzso responsible for this mode of escape were located within the zzso regions rather than the zzso regions, and such zzso did not influence the virus zzso The results suggest that the impaired zzso processing and presentation often occur in zzso field zzso and thus are one of the major mechanisms that enable zzso to escape from zzso zzso We emphasize the importance of testing zzso zzso in an zzso expression zzso
