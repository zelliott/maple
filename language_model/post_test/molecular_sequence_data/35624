A total of zzso sand flies were collected using zzso miniature light traps and identified zzso zzso species were characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso of samples from 123 females of zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso zzso 

The sand flies collected consisted of 9 species, 7 of which belonged to the zzso zzso and two to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in three zzso zzso females and four patients zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in the same three zzso zzso females and all the 7 zzso The sequencing of the zzso zzso products recognized 7 zzso of which 6 have never been zzso 

This is the first molecular detection and identification of zzso zzso in human skin samples and zzso zzso in support of its zzso status in El zzso The finding of seven zzso zzso zzso underscores zzso of this species at a high level in zzso
