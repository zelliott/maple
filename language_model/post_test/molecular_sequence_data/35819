Many attempts have been made to solve the problem of predicting protein secondary structure from the primary sequence but the best performance results are still zzso In this paper, the use of a machine learning zzso which allows zzso descriptions is shown to lead to improved zzso The zzso zzso zzso computer program, zzso was applied to learning secondary structure prediction rules for zzso domain type zzso The input to the program consisted of 12 zzso proteins zzso zzso of known structure, together with a background knowledge describing the chemical and physical properties of the zzso zzso learned a small set of rules that predict which zzso are part of the zzso on their zzso relationships and chemical and physical zzso The rules were tested on four independent zzso proteins (416 zzso giving an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso This is an improvement, on identical data, over the previously reported result of zzso by King and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the machine learning program zzso and of zzso using the standard zzso zzso The best previously reported result in the literature for the zzso domain type is zzso achieved using a neural net zzso zzso learning also has the advantage over neural network and statistical methods in producing more understandable zzso
