Acid zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were newly zzso Their zzso and zzso properties of molecular weight, pH stability, zzso points, specific activity, and zzso zzso acid sequences were determined and compared with those of a zzso zzso acid zzso The two acid zzso zzso by zzso zzso were found to be new zzso in their molecular zzso The acid zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed lower activity at neutral zzso less resistance to neutral and alkaline pH than that from zzso zzso and a half or a third of the specific activity of the zzso zzso zzso These differences seemed to be associated with the difference of zzso between zzso zzso Of the 31 zzso zzso zzso the zzso of these three zzso species revealed 12 zzso zzso zzso
