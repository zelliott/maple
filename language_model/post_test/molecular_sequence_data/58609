We have developed a methodology for identification and fine mapping of zzso zzso Combining zzso of DNA with different restriction zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso amplification from zzso and zzso zzso we have zzso human zzso zzso sequences from DNA of a zzso cell hybrid, zzso After zzso to human fetal brain zzso we could efficiently capture zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and used as zzso in zzso to zzso filters containing the arrayed zzso zzso library and to the arrayed zzso library from infant brain made by zzso Soares, which has been extensively zzso By this approach we have been able to select zzso zzso zzso to map them to zzso 1 zzso zzso and to identify and map corresponding longer zzso and zzso
