zzso zzso zzso a zzso class zzso factor has been shown to activate the zzso of a series of genes expressed in the maturation phase of zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of one or more zzso binding sites, which zzso the propensity for zzso by zzso on zzso promoters and in zzso plant cell types, such as tobacco zzso zzso The region of zzso required for zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to a stretch of zzso zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso which is zzso between zzso zzso factor zzso Previously we identified the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are implicated in zzso modification and zzso In the present study we have shown that zzso zzso by zzso involves the zzso interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso based techniques have enabled us to estimate the zzso site of these zzso zzso As a functional zzso of these zzso zzso we used the zzso responsive zzso zzso promoter to drive the zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the likely recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso promoter by zzso and that there may be a competition between zzso and zzso for binding to the zzso of zzso The results may be taken as a paradigm for other processes of zzso zzso in zzso involving zzso zzso zzso
