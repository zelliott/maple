zzso in the zzso zzso family zzso have a zzso zzso three segments (called zzso M, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies have classified the zzso named virus zzso into 18 zzso with a few additional as yet zzso zzso Until now, molecular studies and full-length zzso zzso sequences were available for representatives of eight zzso in all cases, the S segment encodes two zzso N zzso and zzso zzso in overlapping open reading frames zzso that are translated from the same zzso The zzso proteins of zzso virus zzso and California zzso viruses have been shown to play a role in zzso host cell zzso and protein zzso thereby preventing induction of zzso zzso We have determined full-length sequences of the S segments of representative viruses in the zzso A, zzso B, and zzso zzso and we report here that these viruses do not show evidence of having an zzso zzso In addition, these viruses have rather longer N proteins than those in the other zzso Most of the naturally occurring viruses that lack the zzso protein behaved like a zzso zzso with the zzso gene deleted in that they failed to prevent induction of zzso zzso However, zzso virus zzso in the zzso A zzso inhibited zzso induction in a manner similar to that of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has evolved an alternative zzso not involving a typical zzso zzso to antagonize the host innate immune zzso
