We have shown the zzso zzso produces an zzso factor zzso by the zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso which is zzso to a family of zzso expressed by several zzso zzso We now report that the capacity for zzso to induce zzso arrest in zzso cells is greater in the presence of the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso each zzso contained a modified zzso gene that expressed a zzso zzso containing a zzso His zzso All three zzso peptides zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Each of the peptides associated with the complex was zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso and zzso indicated that the zzso zzso to zzso of a previously described signal zzso zzso was present in two forms in crude zzso 25 and 18 zzso only the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso complexes were also zzso from zzso zzso extracts using zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to 40 zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso on the cell surface after zzso exposure to the zzso zzso was not detected by zzso but all three peptides were associated with zzso cells when analyzed by Western zzso These studies suggest that the active zzso zzso is a zzso composed of truncated zzso zzso and zzso and all three peptides appear to associate with zzso
