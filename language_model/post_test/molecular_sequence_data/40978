The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has become an attractive target for the treatment of many diseases such as zzso arthritis, inflammatory zzso disease and Crohn's zzso In this paper, zzso and molecular zzso studies were performed on 59 zzso zzso zzso Comparative molecular field analysis zzso and comparative molecular similarity zzso analysis zzso were applied to determine the structural requirements for potency in zzso zzso zzso The resulting model of zzso and zzso exhibited good zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to explore the binding mode between the zzso and zzso zzso We have accordingly designed a series of novel zzso zzso zzso by utilizing the zzso relationship zzso results revealed in the present study, which were predicted with excellent zzso in the developed zzso The results provided a useful guide to design new compounds for zzso zzso zzso
