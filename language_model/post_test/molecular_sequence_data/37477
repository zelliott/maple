zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is not completely zzso We have proposed that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso involves zzso of zzso zzso in the membrane of zzso zzso zzso Here we have identified a zzso zzso zzso in rat pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not for zzso as determined by the rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso suspended in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or 25 zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso are reminiscent of a family of zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso expression was confirmed by zzso with rat pancreatic zzso and mouse zzso zzso A zzso product zzso exhibited zzso zzso and 57% zzso acid similarity to the three mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso against bovine zzso zzso showed zzso expression in zzso by zzso zzso light zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that a zzso protein could account for the zzso zzso zzso of rat pancreatic zzso and contribute to zzso zzso zzso
