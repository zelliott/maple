We have analyzed the function of an zzso protein (now called zzso factor S zzso that shows sequence similarity to zzso zzso factor zzso zzso as well as to small zzso of zzso zzso zzso I zzso II zzso and III zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso against zzso zzso demonstrated that this protein is not a zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments with paused zzso complexes at position zzso showed that zzso is able to induce zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso in a similar manner to zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso back to position zzso by releasing mainly zzso from the zzso of the nascent zzso Furthermore, zzso reduces the amount of zzso zzso complexes at position zzso as well as position zzso These findings clearly demonstrate that this protein has a similar function to zzso zzso
