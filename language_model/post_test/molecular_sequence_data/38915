zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso requires zzso a light regulatory promoter unit including the zzso recognition element zzso and the zzso element zzso zzso is bound by the parsley basic zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso containing the zzso domain exist in animals, plants and zzso and recognize DNA zzso after formation of zzso or zzso To determine the potential role of zzso in the regulation of zzso promoter activity, we investigated the functions of distinct zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activate transcription, indicating that zzso and zzso have zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain caused a reduction of zzso light zzso and point zzso throughout zzso affected both responsiveness to zzso white light and zzso by zzso The data suggest that a zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in zzso We discuss regulatory steps in zzso zzso zzso that may be influenced by zzso and/or related zzso zzso
