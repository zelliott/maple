An zzso modified zzso with zzso zzso was prepared by zzso synthesis from a comparably modified zzso and then used as a DNA template in primer extension reactions zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso I containing zzso or lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and all four zzso zzso zzso primer extension is blocked one base before and opposite zzso A small fraction of the reaction product represents zzso zzso in which zzso is incorporated opposite the zzso zzso studies of base zzso and chain extension indicate that the frequency of zzso zzso opposite zzso is higher than that of other zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso however, the rate of extension of zzso from the 3' zzso was much lower than that of zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso and capable of generating zzso zzso zzso in zzso
