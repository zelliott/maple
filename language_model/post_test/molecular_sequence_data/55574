zzso strains originally identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were screened for their zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso After zzso comparison of the resulting protein zzso zzso two zzso clusters were zzso The majority of the strains grouped in one zzso zzso which contained the type strain of zzso zzso and zzso to DNA group A1 of Johnson, zzso zzso Phelps, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso London, zzso & zzso zzso zzso International Journal of zzso zzso 30, zzso Another cluster corresponded to DNA group zzso It contained two zzso which agreed perfectly with DNA zzso B1 zzso zzso and B2 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes were partially zzso and zzso zzso zzso were designed for identification of DNA groups zzso B1 and zzso zzso zzso reacted with all strains of zzso cluster B1 zzso zzso probe zzso zzso with strains of cluster B2 zzso zzso and probe zzso with strains of cluster A1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso were successfully used for the identification of strains belonging to the respective zzso The zzso relationship of a representative of zzso zzso was determined by comparative sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso It is very closely related to zzso zzso
