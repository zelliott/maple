zzso balance, and ultimately blood pressure and zzso fluid volume, is maintained by precise regulation of the activity of the zzso sodium channel zzso In a zzso kidney zzso cell line zzso exposure of the zzso membrane to the zzso inhibitor zzso reduces zzso sodium zzso zzso activity can be restored by subsequent exposure to the zzso zzso zzso Using A6 cells and a functional zzso zzso to detect increases in zzso activity, we have cloned a zzso protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso of this protein with zzso in zzso zzso increases the activity of the sodium channel by two- to zzso This zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso gut, zzso skin and zzso zzso analysis predicts that zzso is a zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso activity would thus be regulated by the activity of a zzso expressed at the surface of the same zzso This previously undiscovered mechanism for zzso regulation may apply to other zzso channels, in particular to members of the zzso family that are present in zzso and zzso zzso
