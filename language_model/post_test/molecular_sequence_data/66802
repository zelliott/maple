The zzso zzso is a unique zzso zzso While zzso similar to the bacterial zzso several similarities have been reported between the zzso zzso and the bacterial type IV zzso zzso These include the zzso nature of the zzso filament, zzso sequence similarities between zzso zzso and bacterial type IV zzso as well as the presence of zzso proteins in the two zzso Recent advances in zzso zzso research add to the growing list of zzso First, the zzso zzso that is responsible for processing the zzso signal zzso in zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso similar to its counterpart in the type IV zzso system zzso zzso the two zzso are demonstrated to zzso the same zzso zzso Second, it has been suggested that the zzso zzso and the bacterial type IV zzso share a similar mode of zzso While bacterial zzso and type IV zzso can be modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently been reported on zzso zzso This mode of zzso as well as the observation that the zzso zzso lacks a central channel, are both consistent with the proposed assembly zzso On the other hand, the failure to identify other genes involved in zzso zzso by zzso searches likely implies a novel aspect of the zzso zzso zzso These interesting features remain to be zzso through continued zzso Such knowledge would be invaluable to zzso and protein export studies in the zzso
