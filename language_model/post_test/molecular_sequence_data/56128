Previous findings indicate that the zzso region of zzso zzso type A zzso is required for its ability to induce zzso zzso To better zzso internal peptides of SEA that are important for induction of zzso zzso zzso SEA zzso that had internal deletions in their zzso third were zzso A series of unique restriction zzso sites were first engineered into zzso only one of these changes resulted in an zzso acid substitution (the zzso acid zzso at position 60 of mature SEA was changed to a zzso zzso Because the zzso substitution had no discernible effect on zzso or biological activity, the sea zzso zzso this zzso SEA was used to construct a panel of zzso zzso lacking zzso 3 to 17, 19 to 23, 24 to 28, 29 to 49, 50 to 55, 56 to 59, 61 to 73, 68 to 74, or 74 to zzso zzso plasmids with the desired zzso were constructed in zzso coli and transferred to zzso zzso zzso culture zzso containing the zzso zzso were zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso revealed that each of the zzso zzso zzso strains produced a zzso SEA of the predicted zzso All the zzso zzso exhibited increased sensitivity to monkey stomach zzso fluid in zzso which is consistent with these zzso having zzso unlike that of zzso SEA or the SEA zzso zzso In general, deletion of internal peptides had a deleterious effect on the ability to induce zzso zzso only SEA zzso lacking either zzso 3 to 17 or 56 to 59 consistently produced a statistically significant increase in the incorporation of zzso In the course of this work, two zzso zzso that had different requirements for binding to SEA in Western blots were zzso The zzso for one zzso zzso was contained within zzso 108 to 230 of mature zzso zzso of the other zzso zzso to SEA appeared to be dependent on the zzso of zzso
