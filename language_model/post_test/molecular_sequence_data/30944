zzso virus strain T zzso is a highly zzso zzso that zzso a lethal zzso in young zzso birds and also zzso and zzso avian zzso cells in zzso zzso presumably arose when a zzso virus zzso incorporated a portion of the turkey zzso gene into its zzso forming the zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein zzso has 14 zzso acid zzso and 3 zzso acid deletions relative to the predicted turkey zzso zzso The zzso Rev zzso zzso of zzso also has zzso acid zzso in zzso 3, 6, and 9 relative to zzso zzso zzso To distinguish the critical zzso from the neutral ones, we made a zzso that resulted in a substitution of the zzso Rev zzso zzso by a single zzso as well as several zzso in the context of an otherwise zzso zzso and tested the zzso zzso and zzso properties of the resulting zzso All proteins tested retained the zzso zzso and zzso functions of zzso zzso of the zzso Rev zzso zzso as well as zzso of six of the zzso acid changes present in the zzso zzso and central regions of zzso reduced transformation zzso The zzso present in zzso 3, 6, and 9 of zzso showed complicated interactions in their zzso effects on transformation zzso We also showed that loss of the zzso function did not abolish zzso by zzso We further showed that the primary zzso event involving the turkey zzso gene could have occurred with a zzso Rev having zzso zzso in zzso 3, 6, and 9 of the zzso zzso
