zzso of zzso transcripts has a zzso role in gene zzso The extent and function of zzso in zzso and zzso systems, however, are less well zzso Recent reports of zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and in vascular plant zzso prompted us to look for zzso in plant zzso Here, we report the use of reverse zzso chain reaction to map multiple zzso addition sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso The lack of sequence conservation surrounding these sites suggests that zzso may occur at many 3' zzso created by zzso and/or zzso activities, including those activities involved in 3' end zzso zzso transcripts could be efficiently zzso in zzso by using zzso zzso zzso with an activity that added zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso zzso were tested for stability in zzso zzso zzso zzso and we found that, compared with zzso zzso the zzso zzso were less zzso Taken together with the low abundance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso our results are consistent with a zzso zzso The fact that zzso does not dramatically destabilize plant zzso zzso at least in zzso is in agreement with results obtained for animal zzso but differs from those obtained for zzso and zzso zzso Because fully zzso partially zzso and zzso transcripts were found among the cloned zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso editing and zzso are independent processes in zzso zzso
