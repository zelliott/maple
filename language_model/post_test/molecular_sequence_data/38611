The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family represents a unique group of zzso identified mainly in zzso In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of the zzso and the gene zzso the zzso hormone zzso of the shrimp zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso shows zzso identity to that of zzso (formerly zzso zzso Two separate but identical zzso genes were identified in the zzso of shrimp by library screening and they are located on different zzso gene zzso The organization of the zzso gene is identical to other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at a constant level in the zzso of juveniles and mature zzso Unlike the zzso zzso a low level of zzso transcripts can also be detected in the central nervous zzso Interestingly, the expression pattern of zzso in the zzso of zzso females is reversed to that of the zzso zzso At the middle stage of zzso zzso a minimum level of zzso transcript was recorded and a maximum level of zzso transcript was zzso zzso proteins for zzso and zzso were produced by a bacterial expression zzso The zzso zzso level of zzso zzso shrimp increased zzso 1 h after the zzso injection and then returned to normal after 2 zzso The zzso effect of these fusion proteins is comparable to that of zzso shrimp injected with crude extract from a single zzso zzso
