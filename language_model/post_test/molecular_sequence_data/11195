zzso zzso studies of fly and mouse zzso have shown that the identity of individual body segments is controlled by a suite of zzso genes called the zzso zzso To examine the conservation of this patterning mechanism in other segmented zzso we here describe four zzso gene zzso isolated from zzso leeches of the zzso zzso Based on sequence similarity and zzso analysis, the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are deemed to be zzso of the zzso genes lab, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso similarities between zzso and zzso outside the zzso and zzso reconstructions suggest that the zzso family of zzso genes (as defined by zzso 1994) had already expanded to include at least two discrete zzso and zzso precursors prior to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso reveals that the four zzso genes described in this study are all expressed at high levels within the segmented portion of the central nervous system zzso with variable levels of expression in the zzso zzso Little or no expression was seen in peripheral zzso or zzso or in the zzso head region zzso Each zzso gene has a distinct anterior expression boundary within one of the four zzso zzso and the zzso (AP) order of these expression boundaries is identical to that reported for the zzso zzso gene products in fly and zzso This finding supports the idea that the process of zzso axis differentiation is zzso among the higher zzso zzso with respect to the regional expression of individual zzso genes along that zzso One unusual feature of zzso zzso genes is the observation that some genes are only expressed during later development -- beginning at the time of terminal cell differentiation -- whereas others begin expression at a much earlier stage, and their zzso zzso to be zzso shortly after the onset of expression of the zzso zzso zzso The functional significance of this zzso disparity is unknown, but it is noteworthy that only the two zzso zzso genes display high levels of zzso zzso
