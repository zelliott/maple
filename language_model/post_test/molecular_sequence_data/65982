The plant zzso protein family encompasses a group of related zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso of natural chemicals encompassing widely divergent zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family that zzso zzso zzso in plant zzso through zzso of zzso free zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined and refined to zzso A zzso The overall zzso and zzso structures closely resemble the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso arrangement, respectively, previously observed for the related salicylic acid zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso To further our understanding of the biological function and evolution of zzso especially of zzso we analyzed the zzso gene family in the rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso analysis showed that more than one-half of the zzso genes were transcribed in one or multiple zzso The zzso gene most similar to zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso protein displayed the highest level of zzso activity toward zzso and was therefore named zzso zzso exhibited kinetic properties similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso and zzso using the zzso determined structure of zzso reported here as a template revealed zzso structural features of zzso within the zzso cavity that are divergent from functionally distinct members of the zzso family, such as zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso from zzso rice, and zzso zzso zzso form a zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso evidence supports the hypothesis that zzso is an zzso ancient member of the zzso family likely to play a critical role in zzso zzso across a wide range of zzso
