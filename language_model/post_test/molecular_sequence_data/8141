An zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso was cloned on a zzso DNA fragment, which was completely zzso The zzso zzso sequence obtained contains three putative coding regions in the same zzso The one corresponding to the structural region of the zzso gene has a deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso showing up to zzso identity to other zzso An incomplete zzso was identified upstream the zzso zzso and the deduced product presents some zzso to proteins involved in zzso zzso
