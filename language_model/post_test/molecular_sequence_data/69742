The zzso unfolding reaction of the alpha zzso of zzso zzso was monitored by examining the chemical shifts and peak areas of the C zzso zzso of the four zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In a native zzso region defined by zzso zzso and zzso circular zzso zzso zzso appears to undergo a zzso local unfolding reaction at increasing zzso zzso As the native form is converted to a previously detected stable intermediate between 2 and 3 M zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1981) zzso 20, zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso folding unit zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in the zzso folding unit zzso zzso all experience a change in their environments which is slow on the zzso time zzso The subsequent conversion of this intermediate to a newly zzso stable, partially folded form populated at 5 M zzso appears to have no effect on any of the zzso at 25 degrees C when an zzso association process involving zzso is taken into zzso zzso a slow exchange process involving only zzso is observed to begin at 5 M zzso where the unfolding transitions monitored by zzso or zzso circular zzso zzso are essentially zzso This residual zzso structure unfolds in a cooperative fashion as the zzso concentration is increased to 8 zzso
