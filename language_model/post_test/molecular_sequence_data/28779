In this report we characterize two zzso zzso zzso named zzso and zzso that are zzso of human zzso of a nuclear zzso protein complex zzso zzso has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso identity and zzso similarity to human zzso Like its human zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso binding domain zzso with single zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the zzso part, which is similar to the human zzso zzso has a long zzso rich in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The second zzso of the zzso zzso complex, zzso shows zzso identity and 50% similarity to its zzso from zzso zzso The protein contains a zzso domain at its zzso the feature characteristic to all analyzed zzso This domain, described also in zzso and zzso zzso is thought to be involved in zzso and also in zzso zzso Both proteins zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on zzso zzso and the zzso gene is zzso by zzso zzso Among zzso identified in the zzso zzso we discovered an zzso type intervening sequence (an zzso zzso This zzso is spliced out very efficiently in plants, but when isolated and tested for zzso in tobacco zzso the efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso is improved by the addition of zzso and zzso sequences upstream or downstream of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in all examined zzso of zzso zzso including roots, zzso leaves and zzso Interestingly, the zzso level of both transcripts seem to be very similar in all zzso zzso
