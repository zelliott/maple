The zzso together with the zzso are members of the zzso family and constitute the adhesive proteins of the zzso type of zzso zzso Here we describe a study of the promoter of the human form of the zzso gene which is the equivalent of the first zzso expressed in the developing mouse zzso and that has the most widespread tissue distribution in zzso and also in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso upstream region by DNA sequencing and Southern zzso suggested that it contained a zzso island, and a major site of zzso initiation 201 zzso upstream of the translation start site was found by zzso protection and primer zzso There were no obvious zzso or zzso boxes zzso Analysis of zzso zzso upstream of the translation start site revealed consensus binding sites for zzso factors including zzso and zzso and motifs common to the promoters of other zzso expressed genes such as zzso 14 and the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso derivatives defined a promoter of 525 zzso which was active in zzso cells and in mouse zzso with an intact zzso This promoter showed reduced expression in zzso zzso
