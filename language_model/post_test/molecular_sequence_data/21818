zzso zzso III recognizes and pauses at its zzso an zzso tract in zzso DNA, zzso 3' zzso synthesis within this zzso and releases the zzso The pol III zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso in the zzso center of pol III during zzso The zzso and zzso regions of zzso are zzso to zzso of the pol II zzso zzso and the pol II zzso and zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso from zzso zzso that cause pol III to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso site, zzso resides in the zzso zzso zzso Another zzso approach confirmed the zzso zzso and also isolated zzso and zzso zzso Modeling zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in available zzso pol III structures predicts a zzso patch that may interface with zzso Another termination zzso zzso appears to reside internally, near the zzso zzso We show that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso reflect distinct activities, that zzso affect zzso recognition and zzso 3' zzso We propose that these zzso zzso integrate action at the upper jaw and center of pol III during zzso
