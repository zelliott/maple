The gene causing zzso disease, an zzso zzso zzso neurodegenerative disorder, has been identified zzso The corresponding zzso is involving an expansion in the number of zzso repeats in the coding region of the zzso disease gene on zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate the length variation of the repeat in zzso zzso zzso from normal individuals and HD patients showing 23 zzso with 11 to 33 zzso zzso the inheritance of the zzso stretch we found zzso instability for HD zzso zzso to zzso with a zzso frequency of approximately zzso while in 431 zzso of normal zzso only two expansions were zzso The risk of expansion during zzso is enhanced compared to zzso explaining juvenile onset by transmission from affected zzso Further, the number of zzso copies in an affected individual in relation to the sex of the zzso parent was evaluated and no significant differences were zzso No zzso or differences in the repeat lengths were observed in the DNA from different zzso including brain and zzso of two HD patients indicating zzso stability of the zzso zzso the determination of the repeat number in the DNA of blood zzso is probably representative of all zzso in a zzso
