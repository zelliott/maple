Thirteen zzso zzso markers were developed to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of zzso zzso zzso 

Using the Fast Isolation by zzso of zzso zzso repeats zzso method with three specific zzso zzso for screening the positive zzso 13 zzso were found to be zzso in 78 individuals of zzso zzso Across all of the zzso zzso samples, the number of zzso per locus ranged from two to zzso zzso 

These zzso markers will be useful for conservation zzso studies of this species and to inform the development of effective zzso zzso conservation zzso
