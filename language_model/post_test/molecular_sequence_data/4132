We have investigated the zzso gene of zzso zzso that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso coli, which, as a component of the zzso sugar zzso system zzso plays a key role in carbon regulation by triggering zzso zzso carbon zzso repression, and zzso zzso As in zzso coli, the zzso gene of zzso zzso is genetically associated with the zzso gene that encodes the general zzso zzso zzso The gene product zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso The functionality of zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso via zzso I and the zzso zzso carrier protein zzso zzso was abolished when zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso was zzso The capacity of zzso to operate in sugar transport was shown by zzso of the zzso coli zzso The striking functional resemblance between zzso and zzso was further demonstrated by its ability to zzso zzso exclusion of zzso to zzso zzso A specific interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was uncovered by surface zzso zzso These data suggest that this zzso protein may be involved in carbon metabolism in zzso zzso
