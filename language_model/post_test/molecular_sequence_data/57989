A zzso zzso was cloned from rabbit fast skeletal muscle, and zzso zzso was applied to replace all the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso by Ala and zzso by zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso No significant functional differences were observed between the zzso and the authentic zzso in terms of the interactions with zzso and zzso and the ability of the zzso zzso complex to regulate the zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso These findings suggest that none of the zzso zzso in zzso are essential for the function of this protein and can be replaced to obtain a zzso zzso zzso which is much easier to handle and suitable as an alternative to the authentic zzso for various purposes, such as zzso of zzso and the whole zzso and zzso zzso zzso
