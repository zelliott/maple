In the zzso zzso zzso 17 genes zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso were identified, representing by far the largest number of zzso genes encountered in any zzso investigated so zzso They group into nine zzso eight pairs with zzso zzso acid identity and one single zzso Green fluorescent zzso of representatives of the nine clusters revealed highly specific targeting to at least seven different zzso among them dense core zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex, and zzso zzso interference for two pairs confirmed their functional specialization in their target zzso zzso of the zzso form affected this zzso pathway, whereas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso form altered zzso structure and zzso The construction of zzso between selected zzso surprisingly revealed the targeting signal to be located in the C zzso of the zzso in contrast with the zzso targeting signal of the zzso in zzso Interestingly, some zzso provoked deleterious effects, locally in their target zzso or zzso in the compartment whose specific zzso N zzso was used in the zzso
