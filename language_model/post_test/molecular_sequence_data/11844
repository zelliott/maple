Several zzso with zzso zzso zzso activity are able to convert zzso into zzso acid, a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the zzso one of the described zzso zzso has been found to zzso to zzso zzso zzso In addition, rat kidney zzso zzso zzso also shows zzso zzso In this report, we describe the isolation of a zzso clone zzso the soluble form of this zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso were designed from the zzso acid sequences of rat kidney zzso zzso peptides for use as zzso for reverse zzso chain reaction of rat kidney zzso The resulting zzso chain reaction zzso was used to screen a rat kidney zzso library and to isolate a zzso clone zzso zzso Analysis of the combined DNA sequences indicated the presence of a single zzso pair open reading frame coding for a soluble protein of 425 zzso acid zzso zzso appears to be structurally zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso analysis of rat zzso including brain, revealed a single species of zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso exhibited both zzso and zzso activities with zzso properties similar to those reported for the rat native zzso
