zzso by zzso zzso involves differentiation of typical short zzso rods into zzso zzso swarm cells that undergo cycles of rapid and zzso population migration across surfaces and exhibit high levels of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of secondary zzso and zzso its zzso in zzso coli, control many zzso traits, such as zzso and zzso in zzso species, zzso zzso cell size and zzso formation in zzso coli and swarming zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso was zzso zzso showed high sequence similarity to zzso coli zzso and zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and could complement an zzso coli zzso zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso carrying zzso expressed from its native promoter caused suppression of swarming zzso and expression of zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso stability zzso suggested that zzso inhibited zzso factor expression through promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could also inhibit swarming and zzso factor expression in zzso zzso
