zzso of zzso with immobilized zzso at zzso degrees C results in a zzso release of several fragments of the core domain in yields approaching zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso with a zzso Q zzso zzso column and analyzed after zzso reduction by zzso gel zzso in sodium zzso Three fragments with approximate molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The fraction from zzso zzso yielding the zzso zzso fraction after zzso reduction was further characterized because it was most homogeneous and gave the highest zzso The zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso core zzso appeared to be zzso or zzso as determined by zzso zzso acid zzso The exact masses, after reduction with zzso are zzso and zzso as determined by laser zzso mass zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso Prior to reduction, zzso zzso zzso zzso are connected to these core domain fragments as shown by zzso analysis and mass zzso zzso studies indicate that these zzso and zzso zzso core domain fragments released by immobilized zzso retain much of their native zzso CD zzso indicate the presence of zzso zzso structure similar to the native protein but the zzso is zzso zzso in the aromatic region indicate the existence of zzso zzso Moreover, structural transitions in zzso are completely zzso as measured by CD zzso although the zzso delta zzso and the zzso concentration at the transition zzso are lower than for the native zzso The core domain fragments also display a zzso binding to immobilized zzso as does intact zzso A single zzso is obtained for both core domain fragments and native protein upon differential scanning zzso but again, the domain is less stable as indicated by a transition peak zzso of zzso degrees C as compared with zzso degrees C for native zzso
