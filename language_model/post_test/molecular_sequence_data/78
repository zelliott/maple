The zzso zzso has been folded into zzso adaptable for the zzso recognition motif zzso protein zzso The number of zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso for mature m zzso The spatial arrangements are, in average, 16 zzso per zzso which includes 7 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the loop and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso system of zzso is characterized by preferred order of zzso removal of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sites zzso branch point sequences zzso and 3' zzso sites zzso were identified and free energies involved have been estimated in 7 zzso zzso zzso barriers for zzso sites from the least zzso lowest | zzso were zzso zzso zzso and 3; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These are parallel to the kinetic data of zzso order reported in the zzso As a result, the preferred order of zzso zzso can be described by a consideration of free energy changes involved in the zzso assembly zzso This finding is consistent with the zzso of zzso formation mechanisms in previous zzso
