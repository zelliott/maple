The present study describes two novel compound zzso zzso zzso zzso on the maternal and zzso on the paternal zzso of zzso in a previously reported male with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso kidney stones zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso Baron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For functional analysis in zzso we generated expression plasmids zzso enhanced green zzso protein zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso human type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso showed complete loss of expression and function when zzso for zzso patch expression in zzso kidney zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inserted into zzso patches of zzso cells and into zzso zzso However, when zzso by zzso zzso surface zzso was reduced to zzso compared with zzso After correction for surface zzso the rate of zzso zzso by zzso zzso by zzso was decreased by an additional zzso The resulting overall reduction of function of this zzso zzso to zzso taken together with complete loss of expression and function of zzso thus appears to be sufficient to explain the zzso in our zzso Furthermore, the zzso ratio of zzso and zzso zzso was increased to zzso zzso zzso for zzso compared with zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is zzso but displayed a significant zzso zzso sodium zzso which appears to be insensitive to zzso zzso zzso thus may zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso acid zzso has an important functional role in human zzso
