The zzso zzso zzso is with an optimal growth temperature of 100 degrees C one of the most zzso organisms known to possess an zzso respiratory zzso The analysis of DNA sequences from the zzso zzso project lead to the identification of an open reading frame potentially coding for a zzso zzso zzso The complete gene (named zzso was cloned and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence displays unusual zzso acid exchanges and a so far unknown sequence zzso The zzso shows similarities to bacterial signal zzso Several forms of the gene were expressed in zzso coli in order to verify the zzso as a zzso protein and to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins with correctly inserted zzso clusters were expressed from two versions of the zzso The zzso truncated zzso is zzso zzso It displays the typical zzso properties of a zzso zzso The zzso potential was determined to be zzso zzso at pH zzso and is pH dependent above pH zzso revealing the influence of two zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso protein clusters together with the two other available zzso zzso sequences from zzso on a separate branch of the zzso tree apart from the proteins from zzso bacteria like zzso and zzso
