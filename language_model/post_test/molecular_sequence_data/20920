The core proteins of zzso zzso disease virus zzso have important roles to perform in maintaining the structure and function of the zzso A complete genetic and zzso analysis was therefore performed on these proteins (and the genes that code for them) to allow comparison of the selective pressures acting on zzso zzso numbers, gene and protein sizes, zzso positions, zzso zzso terminal zzso start and stop zzso and zzso relationships are all zzso The inner core proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by high levels of sequence zzso and the ability to zzso zzso very strongly into eastern or western zzso This is particularly evident in zzso segment 9 zzso which exists as two different sized zzso zzso did not zzso but rather exhibited a more random, zzso zzso suggestive of genetic zzso With the exception of zzso all of the core proteins also showed high numbers of synonymous zzso in the third base position, suggesting they have been evolving for a long period of zzso Interestingly, zzso did not show this, and possible reasons for this are zzso
