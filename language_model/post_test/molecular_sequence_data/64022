The zzso construct zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has proven to be very useful for zzso the expression of targeted genes in zzso and in zzso It consists of a combination of zzso zzso flanked by zzso zzso sequences that are in turn flanked by the zzso and promoter of zzso zzso To construct zzso zzso sequences are first designed corresponding to zzso consensus zzso sequences that are present in the targeted zzso zzso sequences are then inserted between the zzso zzso zzso and the conceptual secondary structure of the zzso regulatory zzso is analyzed to ensure proper zzso zzso zzso are then zzso as zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso promoter and zzso to yield the zzso expression zzso zzso can then be zzso or zzso expressed in zzso and in zzso to inhibit the expression of target zzso zzso can also be expressed in viral zzso for more efficient zzso or zzso to zzso for systemic zzso
