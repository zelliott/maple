We have produced a line of transgenic mice in which expression of human zzso has been detected only in the cerebral zzso Both male and female transgenic mice are growth inhibited with respect to their zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso levels in the zzso and liver, respectively, are reduced, and circulating zzso growth zzso levels are lower in these zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso levels are increased and zzso factor zzso levels are reduced compared to those in zzso zzso We suggest that the growth zzso in these mice is a consequence of the zzso human zzso disturbing the normal controls that regulate mouse zzso synthesis and release from the zzso These mice provide a resource for analysis of the regulation of zzso production and demonstrate that a dominant zzso can be made by producing transgenic mice that have local production of an zzso zzso
