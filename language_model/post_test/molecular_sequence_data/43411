zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso gene is controlled by zzso sequences in its zzso zzso zzso these enhancers include the zzso zzso and zzso response element zzso zzso We show that a novel zzso promoter element zzso zzso zzso positioned between the zzso box and zzso works in conjunction with the upstream zzso and zzso enhancers but cannot support zzso by zzso A zzso of this element, termed partial zzso reduces zzso expression of a reporter gene in zzso cell lines and zzso lines but has no effect on zzso or zzso zzso A double zzso at positions zzso and zzso of the partial zzso reduces zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of this element into a zzso promoter restores zzso expression to levels zzso by the native zzso zzso The partial zzso is a novel zzso element that is required for full expression of the zzso gene and may assist in the function of the zzso zzso and zzso motifs and also other enhancers further zzso zzso the rat zzso gene is unusual in that its enhancers will not function with a zzso promoter but require a specific zzso promoter sequence for full zzso
