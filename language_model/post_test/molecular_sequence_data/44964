In this report, we have characterized the interaction of zzso with the zzso and zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso Analysis of the circular zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso binding of zzso to zzso caused a large decrease in the zzso content of zzso from approximately 44 to zzso a small decrease in the zzso content from approximately 27 to zzso and an increase in the zzso structure from 20 to zzso The binding of zzso also decreased the zzso concentration required for a zzso zzso change in zzso from 360 to 84 zzso zzso bound to zzso with an apparent zzso of 32 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and a zzso of 11 zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was specific as other zzso zzso did not elicit a zzso change in zzso A region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to contain a zzso consensus sequence for zzso zzso A zzso to this region underwent a zzso change upon zzso zzso Other zzso contained the zzso consensus zzso but did not undergo a substantial zzso change upon zzso zzso
