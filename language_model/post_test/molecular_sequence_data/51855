The presence of highly zzso regions within previously determined zzso gene sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso permitted the construction of zzso zzso for zzso amplification of other zzso zzso zzso Although two separate zzso genes zzso and zzso are present in zzso zzso only a single fragment, corresponding to zzso could be amplified from this zzso The amplified zzso genes from four different zzso zzso which express the class 3 outer membrane zzso were zzso zzso fragments corresponding to zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso In common with the known zzso zzso models of the zzso of the predicted proteins indicated zzso structures with eight surface exposed zzso In the zzso class 3 proteins the main regions of sequence variation, which must be responsible for zzso zzso were located on zzso 5 and zzso A zzso analysis of the family of zzso from the zzso confirmed the close relationship of the zzso class 3 protein with the zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso protein was shown to be closely related to the zzso zzso zzso The close relationship seen between zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso identified no obvious zzso regions in the zzso but did suggest that the current nomenclature for zzso zzso genes may need zzso
