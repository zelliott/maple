Acid extracts of the brain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the marine zzso zzso zzso were each zzso by gel zzso zzso and zzso of column zzso were screened with zzso zzso specific for zzso end products and for zzso end zzso Only zzso zzso forms were zzso The zzso zzso material, isolated for each species, was separately zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso of column zzso were screened with zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso brain, zzso forms with the same retention times as synthetic zzso and zzso were detected in a ratio of approximately zzso In addition, an zzso form was detected with the zzso zzso This form had the same zzso properties as synthetic zzso zzso with the zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso material revealed the presence of authentic zzso and zzso in a zzso ratio of zzso zzso extended forms of zzso were not detected in the zzso zzso zzso these observations indicate that zzso zzso peptides are present in the brain of zzso
