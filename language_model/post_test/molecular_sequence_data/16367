The interaction between virus and zzso is a process that mimics zzso zzso binding receptors and zzso signal zzso In the investigation of the interaction between zzso zzso zzso virus 1) and human zzso via virus binding to its zzso complex on cellular zzso the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso a protein zzso by an zzso gene of cellular response against the specific stimulation of zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library established from early gene response zzso The zzso of zzso expressed as a fusion zzso with a fluorescent protein in zzso cells was confirmed to be the zzso The results of a zzso zzso experiment indicated that zzso is indeed involved in the interaction with the zzso zzso zzso complex via zzso A pull-down test and Western zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso also provided evidence in support of this zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso in its zzso domain implies that this protein family, as the products of zzso zzso comprise functional molecules involved in the zzso regulation of cells, which might be related to the zzso of some cell survival zzso
