zzso lupus zzso zzso a complex zzso disease, is a typical zzso zzso disease characterized by production of zzso against a variety of zzso and immune zzso tissue zzso most prominently in the zzso Evidence suggests that genetic factors zzso to zzso zzso of zzso B cells initiate and zzso the zzso In zzso New Zealand Black zzso mice and their F1 cross with New Zealand White zzso mice, B cell abnormalities can be ascribed mainly to zzso zzso B1 zzso Our zzso scans to search for zzso genes for zzso zzso of B1 cells in these mice showed evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a possible zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso belonging to the insulin zzso zzso and is mainly expressed in B zzso precursors and zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses of the gene revealed that zzso has a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain near zzso a binding motif of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso patients also had this type of zzso zzso with a significantly higher frequency compared with the healthy zzso Our findings suggest that these zzso zzso cause zzso of the zzso zzso and possibly form one genetic component of zzso to abnormal proliferation of zzso B cells in zzso
