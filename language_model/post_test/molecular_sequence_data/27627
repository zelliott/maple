Two zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso and alpha zzso of bovine zzso zzso collagen have been isolated and zzso These added to those characterized in our previous work account for zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the alpha zzso The zzso zzso content of each zzso was determined and in this way the general distribution of zzso over the entire zzso was deduced accounting for all the zzso and most of the zzso of this heavily zzso type I zzso The characterization of fragments alpha zzso and alpha zzso has enabled us to resolve the controversy over the relative zzso of these fragments on zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso of bovine zzso collagen was zzso by zzso and by zzso zzso zzso The zzso peptides were isolated by gel and zzso zzso and identified in relation to the known zzso acid sequence of type I zzso The zzso zzso were determined in the relevant peptides providing a complete account of their distribution along this part of the collagen zzso Most of the zzso was found in the gap region of collagen especially near the edges of the zzso holes where it could act as a peg to facilitate zzso zzso In addition, some zzso was found in the overlap region where, being unable to fit into zzso zzso it might impede the growth of the zzso and, with other zzso of the overlap region, might be responsible for the narrow zzso of zzso collagen that are essential for zzso zzso This zzso with that previously found in the zzso alpha zzso is the only zzso zzso identified in the overlap region of a type I zzso
