During zzso zzso zzso are replaced by transition zzso which are in turn replaced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains a short zzso zzso domain that is highly zzso before being deposited into zzso zzso and almost completely zzso during zzso zzso We now demonstrate that, in zzso zzso this zzso is required for the zzso association of zzso zzso with zzso B zzso zzso an inner nuclear membrane protein that also possesses a stretch of zzso zzso at its zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that the cellular protein zzso also binds tightly to the unmodified zzso domain of zzso zzso those findings, we now present evidence that zzso prevents zzso of zzso and zzso that zzso of this protein precedes zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso 1 to the nuclear envelope is an important intermediate step in zzso and reveal a novel role for zzso protein zzso and zzso
