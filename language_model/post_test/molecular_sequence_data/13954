Several zzso of barley yellow mosaic virus zzso from different sites in the zzso including some that were virulent on European resistant winter barley zzso zzso zzso zzso and some that were not, were examined by zzso restriction mapping and sequencing of selected parts of the virus zzso zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences were determined for the zzso region, part of the zzso coding region and the coat protein coding region on zzso 1 and an area at the zzso of the zzso protein coding region on zzso zzso The sequences differed from those previously reported for a zzso isolate from Japan and for two German zzso one of which was of the zzso zzso There were no zzso zzso acid differences and the few, zzso zzso differences detected were probably not significant and were insufficient to develop a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish zzso from other zzso zzso mapping of zzso 2 zzso again showed no consistent zzso zzso The differences previously reported between the two German zzso are probably not zzso
