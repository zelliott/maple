We investigated the mechanisms responsible for zzso resistance in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cells immortalized with zzso These cells were exposed to zzso (10 zzso for 7 zzso and 20 cellular surviving populations zzso were zzso zzso demonstrated high levels of resistance to zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was observed in 2 zzso zzso expression analysis using a zzso targeted zzso showed that 13 zzso were negative for zzso expression after zzso radiation (6 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 3 zzso of the zzso gene revealed that 13 zzso contained a point zzso in zzso zzso This zzso consisted in a T zzso at zzso 104 leading to a premature STOP zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the presence of the zzso in 16 zzso Western zzso using an zzso targeted zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was indeed expressed in the 13 zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso may zzso a strong resistance to zzso in zzso breast zzso cells harboring a zzso zzso
