zzso receptors are classified into D1 and zzso zzso on the basis of their pharmacological and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso and treatment of movement disorders, schizophrenia and drug zzso The zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso proteins to induce second zzso zzso Other members of the family of receptors that are coupled to G proteins share a significant similarity in primary zzso sequence and exhibit an zzso zzso predicted to consist of seven putative zzso zzso We have taken advantage of the expected zzso sequence similarities among members of this gene family to isolate genes coding for new zzso Using the zzso beta zzso zzso gene as a zzso probe we have isolated related genes including a zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso This zzso has been characterized on the basis of three criteria: the deduced zzso sequence which reveals that it is a member of the family of zzso zzso the tissue distribution of the zzso which parallels that of the zzso zzso zzso and the pharmacological profile of mouse zzso cells zzso with the zzso
