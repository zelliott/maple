zzso is a scaffold for the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade components in a zzso zzso response zzso zzso also associates with zzso the beta zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso potentially linking zzso zzso to stimulation of the zzso zzso A zzso motif at the zzso zzso zzso is apparently essential for function because zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not rescue the mating zzso of a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso bound each component of the zzso zzso but not zzso Unlike zzso zzso the zzso did not appear to zzso however, when fused to a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso the zzso protein restored mating in an zzso cell and an zzso zzso double zzso Thus, the zzso domain mediates zzso interaction, which is a prerequisite for zzso zzso and zzso
