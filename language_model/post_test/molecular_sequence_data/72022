A library of zzso coli zzso zzso has been screened to identify zzso zzso of zzso and nitrate zzso zzso that are defective zzso but competent zzso All but one of zzso zzso had zzso close to or within the face of zzso that contains zzso region 1 zzso zzso region 1 is known to contact the alpha zzso of zzso zzso to facilitate zzso zzso It is now evident that this face also has a role in zzso zzso Single zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and double zzso at zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso impaired zzso repression of zzso without greatly affecting zzso from model Class I zzso site at zzso and Class II zzso site at zzso zzso zzso Although repression was impaired in a second group of zzso zzso with zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso from the simple zzso promoters was severely zzso However, expression from zzso zzso sites at zzso and zzso and a zzso lacking the site at zzso zzso remained relatively high indicating that this second group have a zzso zzso zzso as well as a repression zzso The prediction that the zzso affecting repression were likely to be in zzso exposed regions of zzso was supported by analysis of peptides produced by partial zzso of zzso Thus, zzso repression at promoters with multiple zzso sites requires regions of zzso that are different from, but zzso zzso
