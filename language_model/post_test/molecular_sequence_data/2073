The human zzso virus zzso type 1 zzso is regulated at the zzso level by both cellular and viral zzso Using zzso cell zzso multiple regions of the zzso zzso were found to serve as binding sites for cellular zzso An untranslated region binding protein zzso has been zzso and zzso containing this protein bind to both the zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the role of cellular proteins binding to both the zzso and zzso regions and their potential interaction with other zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso of both these regions was performed followed by zzso I zzso and transient expression zzso In the zzso region, two direct repeats zzso surround the zzso zzso zzso of both of these direct repeats or of the zzso sequence interrupted binding over the zzso region on the coding zzso but only a zzso of the zzso sequence affected in zzso zzso for zzso In addition to zzso serving as the site of binding of cellular zzso zzso transcribed from zzso is capable of forming a stable zzso zzso To determine the relative importance of DNA binding proteins as compared to secondary structure, zzso zzso in the zzso region were zzso Local zzso that disrupted either the stem or loop structure were defective in gene zzso However, zzso zzso which restored base pairing in the stem resulted in complete zzso This indicated a significant role for the zzso structure in zzso gene zzso To determine the role of zzso binding zzso zzso were constructed which extensively changed the primary structure of the zzso region, yet left stem base zzso stem energy and the loop sequence zzso These zzso resulted in decreased protein binding to zzso DNA and defects in zzso and revealed factor binding specifically to the loop DNA zzso Further zzso which zzso this stem and loop zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso start site resulted in even larger decreases in zzso This suggests that multiple zzso including protein zzso the loop zzso and zzso or DNA secondary structure, are important in zzso and suggests that zzso may interact with cellular proteins binding to DNA to increase zzso gene zzso
