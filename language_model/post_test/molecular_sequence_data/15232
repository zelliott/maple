The zzso gene zzso of a newly isolated strain, zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso DNA library by detecting formation of transparent halo around the colony on zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso was highly similar to the members of the zzso zzso family involved in the zzso zzso zzso it showed the highest similarity zzso with that of zzso zzso To compare zzso with other zzso zzso the relatively well-known zzso gene of zzso coli was cloned with zzso After we achieved high-level expression of soluble zzso and zzso through the exploration of different culture conditions, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were characterized in terms of zzso activity, and zzso zzso was generally more robust to a change in temperature and pH and an addition of organic zzso than zzso The two zzso exhibited a strong preference for zzso rather than for zzso and were optimal at relatively low temperatures zzso degrees ) and alkaline zzso zzso The results in this study strongly suggested that both the zzso and zzso zzso would be potential candidates for use as a zzso in many industrial zzso
