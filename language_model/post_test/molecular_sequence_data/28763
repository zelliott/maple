The DEAD box zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso is present mainly in the zzso and is enriched at the zzso side of nuclear pore complexes zzso suggesting that it acts in the late part of zzso zzso Here, we zzso the assembly and transport of a specific zzso zzso the zzso ring zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and show that a zzso zzso in zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and accompanies the zzso to and through the nuclear pores and into the zzso We also demonstrate that zzso accumulates in the nucleus and partly disappears from the zzso when nuclear export of zzso is zzso The fact that zzso is present along the zzso zzso zzso extending from the nuclear pore into the zzso supports the view that zzso is involved in restructuring the zzso prior to zzso Finally, the addition of the export factor zzso to the growing transcript highlights the importance of the zzso loading process in determining the fate of zzso
