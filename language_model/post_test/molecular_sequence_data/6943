A factor produced by zzso cell line zzso zzso showed a profound zzso effect on the in zzso proliferation of B lineage zzso It was zzso to zzso from zzso media of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso for 48 h by a three-step zzso The zzso factor gave a single band of protein with a molecular mass of 16 zzso on zzso gel zzso We show here that exposure of B lineage cells to this factor results in the induction of a zzso effect and a significant increase in the proportion of fragmented zzso DNA fragmentation was detected in B lineage cells after 3 h culture with the factor in the quantitative zzso zzso The mechanism of cell death was characterized by a zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso DNA, indicating that the factor zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of this factor was identical with that of zzso A over the 26 zzso acid zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso could be modulated by two kinds of inhibitor of protein zzso zzso and zzso in zzso that are below their toxicity zzso zzso induced by the factor was suppressed by zzso but was relatively unaffected by zzso These findings suggest that the signals by protein zzso may regulate zzso B cell death by the factor zzso A, derived from zzso
