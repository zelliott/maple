zzso chain zzso is a zzso protein that associates with zzso class II molecules in the zzso zzso The zzso tail of zzso contains two zzso zzso able to direct zzso to the zzso zzso We obtained the pig zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso was prepared via site directed zzso by the zzso zzso method to study the effect of the two zzso on the zzso of pig zzso These zzso fragments were zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso plasmids were zzso zzso into zzso cells with zzso zzso Fluorescence of fusion proteins zzso was observed with a fluorescent zzso zzso acid sequence alignment showed that pig zzso has zzso similar to those seen in other zzso zzso including the zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on observations with the fluorescent zzso we found that two zzso motifs are required for pig zzso zzso zzso and that both motifs independently mediate this function in zzso
