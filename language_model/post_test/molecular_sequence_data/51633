The zzso zzso binding protein zzso is the only known zzso protein on zzso that is zzso during zzso Since a large fraction of zzso accumulates in the zzso in zzso cells, we investigated the molecular mechanism controlling membrane association of zzso We first show that human zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Next, the actual site of zzso and its functional significance were determined using zzso zzso zzso cell lines producing high levels of wild type zzso or zzso zzso bearing zzso at zzso which occurs within a consensus site for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso acid completely prevented zzso zzso in zzso cells and also blocked its appearance in the zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso of zzso was affected by the zzso or by zzso Finally, zzso and zzso of soluble zzso with zzso occurred upon exit of cells from zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is directly responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso
