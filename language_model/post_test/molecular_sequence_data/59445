The flexibility of the polar side chains in the zzso Type I zzso protein zzso near the solution freezing temperature was investigated by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso These experiments were conducted to define the zzso zzso of the proposed zzso groups, zzso and zzso in order to probe the molecular mechanism for ice zzso On the basis of the zzso alpha beta 2 zzso zzso constant values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, it can be calculated that the regularly spaced zzso zzso sample many possible zzso states prior to ice zzso The lack of a dominant side chain zzso is further zzso by nuclear zzso distance zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso both with zzso alpha beta 2 and zzso alpha beta 3 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, show a slight preference for the side chain zzso with a zzso 1 of zzso zzso These data suggest that prior to ice binding the zzso and zzso side chains are free to rotate and that a unique zzso zzso structure in solution is not zzso These observations do not support the rigid side chain model proposed recently by an X-ray study zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso
