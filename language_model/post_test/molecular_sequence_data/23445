zzso of the zzso immune response is dependent on the zzso of zzso T cells by zzso zzso analysis of zzso and activated human zzso cell zzso zzso demonstrated that activated zzso cells can efficiently stimulate T cells, since they zzso zzso class II molecules and multiple zzso for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, by manipulating zzso administration, we show that zzso cells possess multiple independent unique pathways for zzso zzso These results highlight zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso recognition by cell zzso receptors on zzso cells as unique mechanisms for zzso capturing and zzso In addition, we analyzed the T zzso potential of human zzso cells derived from different clinical conditions, such as inflamed zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples, and from zzso processing zzso zzso zzso This in zzso analysis revealed that zzso but not zzso zzso requirements can selectively dictate zzso of T zzso molecules on zzso zzso Taken together, these observations offer new and unexpected insights into the direct interactions between zzso and T cells and suggest novel zzso zzso functions for human zzso zzso
