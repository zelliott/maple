The aim of this study is to investigate the culture conditions of chicken feather degradation and zzso zzso production by the recently isolated zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the potential of the zzso strain to zzso feather waste discarded by the poultry zzso The zzso strain was isolated from the zzso waste of a poultry farm in Brazil and was confirmed to belong to zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso There was high zzso production when the medium was at pH 8 zzso U zzso zzso was higher using the zzso zzso for 72 h on zzso whole feathers supplemented with zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso were active in the pH range from zzso to zzso with a maximum activity at pH zzso and temperature zzso For zzso the best pH was zzso and the best temperature was zzso All zzso are zzso zzso The crude zzso extract zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso electron zzso showed zzso cells zzso onto feather surfaces after 98 h of culture and zzso feather filaments were zzso zzso mass zzso analysis showed multiple zzso from 522 to zzso zzso indicating feather zzso The presence of zzso was detected on zzso medium probably participating in the breakdown of zzso bridges of the feather zzso External addition of zzso increased feather zzso
