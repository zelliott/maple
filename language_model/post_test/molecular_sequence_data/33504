zzso zzso microbial peptides show remarkable structural diversity and constitute a widespread class of the most potent antibiotics and other important pharmaceuticals that range from zzso to the zzso zzso They are assembled independent of the zzso in a zzso zzso way by a group of zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso rely not only on the 20 zzso zzso zzso but also use several different building blocks, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso elements and even fatty acid building zzso This structural diversity leads to a high density of functional groups, which are often essential for the zzso Recent zzso and structural studies on several zzso zzso zzso assembly lines have substantially contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms and dynamics of individual zzso zzso underlying zzso recognition and zzso zzso among the different active sites as well as zzso bond formation and the zzso and zzso product zzso
