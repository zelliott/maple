zzso structure contains evolutionary information and it is more highly zzso than zzso The evolution of structure in zzso zzso zzso zzso and its structurally related proteins zzso were zzso To obtain a reliable analysis, we defined a subset that contains all zzso and organisms as the zzso set using zzso zzso based on the multiple structural alignment of the known zzso structures of zzso with zzso as the structural zzso zzso Then, we applied zzso pair group method with zzso averages zzso to reconstruct structural zzso We found that zzso most likely arose through zzso zzso the domain of zzso underwent a process of zzso content from zzso end to zzso end of the left-handed zzso zzso the capacity of zzso to bind zzso occurred early in evolution and only later included the ability to catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso efficiently for the occurrence of two zzso involving zzso 62 and zzso 84, respectively, and a long zzso at the zzso end of the zzso In addition, the main zzso regions in these structures are in the structurally constrained zzso of zzso domain, and the zzso of the structural zzso can be rather easily understood in terms of functional zzso
