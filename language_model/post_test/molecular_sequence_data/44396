In genetic language a peculiar arrangement of biological information is provided by overlapping genes in which the same region of DNA can code for functionally unrelated zzso In this work, the informational content of overlapping genes belonging to zzso and zzso viruses was zzso Using information theory zzso we identified in the regions of overlap a first pattern, exhibiting a more uniform base composition and more severe constraints in base ordering with respect to the zzso zzso This pattern was found to be peculiar to zzso avian zzso B virus, human zzso and plant zzso zzso A second pattern, characterized by the occurrence of similar compositional constraints in both types of coding regions, was found to be limited to plant zzso At the level of zzso zzso a low degree of correlation between overlapping and zzso coding regions characterized the first pattern, whereas a close link was found in zzso indicating a fine adaptation of the overlapping frame to the original zzso choice of the zzso As a result of zzso usage correlation analysis, zzso concerning the origin and evolution of several overlapping frames were also zzso zzso of zzso acid composition revealed an increased frequency of zzso acid zzso with a high level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the proteins zzso by overlapping zzso this peculiar feature of overlapping genes can be viewed as a way with which they may expand their coding ability and gain new, specialized zzso
