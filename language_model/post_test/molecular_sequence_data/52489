Human zzso zzso exhibits a zzso first investigated at the protein level, that is caused by a single zzso acid substitution of zzso to zzso at zzso zzso zzso of this zzso requires zzso chain reaction zzso and direct sequencing of the amplified products, zzso zzso zzso zzso technique, or restriction zzso analysis of the amplified zzso However, these techniques involve the use of zzso and/or are not well suited to the rapid processing of a large number of zzso In this paper, we propose a new technique, a zzso primer amplification, in which a simple zzso of zzso products is used for typing the variation at zzso zzso The 3' primer of zzso zzso with one or other zzso sequence in the zzso zzso depending on the presence or the absence of the zzso This differential zzso of the primer is used for typing the zzso In order to demonstrate the zzso of this system, 120 individuals zzso by two-dimensional zzso and zzso by zzso were analyzed by this new zzso The results obtained by the latter method are in agreement with those found by the other zzso However, this method is simple, more reliable, and will facilitate population studies without using radioactive zzso
