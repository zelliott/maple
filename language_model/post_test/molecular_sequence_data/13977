We have studied the effect of the nature of the zzso sugar zzso or zzso on the geometry and stability of triple zzso with a zzso motif targeting the zzso tract of the zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso containing a third strand formed by a zzso zzso zzso the same zzso but with zzso zzso zzso and an analogous modified zzso zzso zzso shows that the sugar zzso of the different triple zzso determined by zzso zzso differ depending on nature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation with the zzso zzso and the duplex as DNA appears to be associated with a conversion of the duplex part from a zzso secondary structure with zzso zzso to a geometry in which the zzso strand zzso adopt an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso The most stable triple zzso is obtained when the third strand contains zzso zzso zzso
