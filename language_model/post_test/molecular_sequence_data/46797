We obtained the nearly complete structural zzso of zzso zzso including zzso linkage, and even zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso approach is used for zzso the structures of minor components in a mixture of zzso zzso released from a family of zzso are often composed of a small finite set of zzso In this regard, the numerous zzso species are analogous to the products found in zzso involving zzso zzso The great structural diversity in the library is the result of the nearly infinite combinations in which even a small number of zzso can be zzso Fortunately, structural similarities exist between different zzso as specific zzso motifs are preserved among different zzso We propose that a catalog of zzso motifs can be identified and characterized by zzso zzso mass zzso The catalog is constructed from a set of known compounds that have been fully structurally zzso by, for example, nuclear magnetic zzso The catalog consists of the characteristic fragmentation patterns belonging to a set of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to determine the presence of these motifs and reconstruct the structures of less abundant zzso
