To address the question of whether the human T cell leukemia virus type I zzso gene is associated with the zzso of zzso syndrome zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and tax genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso from SS patients who were zzso for zzso to zzso was examined using zzso zzso The zzso tax zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was detected in zzso samples from 4 of 14 patients zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso region in these 4 patients' zzso showed zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene from the zzso cell zzso In conclusion, these findings suggest that products zzso sequences zzso to the zzso zzso gene in SS patients' zzso might be candidates for zzso and/or lead to zzso of zzso T zzso through zzso zzso zzso
