Despite increasing interest in zzso zzso zzso little information is available about their zzso We isolated and zzso three novel temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso sizes are around 40 zzso and open reading frames zzso are arranged in functional zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso analysis allowed us to assign a potential function to half of the predicted zzso zzso elements were further identified by zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms were zzso Interestingly, the three zzso show identical integration sites within their host zzso In addition to this experimental zzso we propose a novel zzso based on the analysis of 85 zzso and zzso zzso including 15 originating from zzso Our analysis established 9 distinct clusters and revealed close relationships between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Genes involved in DNA metabolism and zzso and potentially in zzso interaction appear to be zzso while structural genes tend to be cluster zzso Our findings support the notion of a possible zzso exchange of genes between zzso originating from zzso zzso and zzso which may be of crucial importance for zzso in zzso
