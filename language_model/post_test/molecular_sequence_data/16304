A barley zzso library, obtained by cloning in the zzso zzso zzso was screened with a zzso probe zzso the zzso zzso A positive zzso designated zzso zzso was selected for further zzso The coding and zzso regions of the zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso has two zzso of zzso and 91 zzso zzso zzso The promoter region has the following main features: one zzso zzso three zzso zzso an zzso zzso starting at zzso position zzso from the first zzso zzso which is zzso to sequences appearing at similar positions in other zzso zzso two versions of an zzso sequence that is more highly repeated in structural zzso of several zzso zzso two extensive regions close to the first zzso zzso that are zzso to a sequence located much further upstream in the zzso zzso The zzso start point was determined at zzso positions zzso to zzso both by the zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso A maximum of 2-4 copies of the zzso gene per zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected during the cell proliferation stage of zzso development zzso at zzso days after zzso and was not detected in either zzso or green zzso
