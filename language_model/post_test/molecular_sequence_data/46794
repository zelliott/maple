Despite of the increased availability of genetically modified mouse zzso the experimental models in the rat have provided the most widely employed and versatile models for the study of zzso zzso and functional zzso The identification of the human gene zzso in the zzso zzso syndrome of the Finnish type zzso has recently been reported, and its protein product has been termed zzso Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso shows zzso sequence identity with human zzso zzso and shows characteristic zzso zzso zzso The translated zzso sequence has zzso sequence identity at the zzso acid zzso The signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns are nearly identical to those of human zzso As in the human, the rat zzso transcript is expressed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso raised to the zzso zzso domain identified zzso exclusively within the rat kidney zzso by indirect zzso zzso results with zzso reverse zzso chain reaction analysis showed a remarkable zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso
