We have analyzed the zzso activity of a zzso form of zzso zzso A zzso zzso from of zzso was engineered that contained a zzso to zzso substitution which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso and zzso and by Western zzso zzso However, zzso zzso did not result in an active zzso as both zzso zzso and the zzso either free or incorporated into zzso zzso were zzso inactive against a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess whether the large number of zzso IV repeats present in zzso zzso zzso activity, we generated truncated forms of the zzso zzso activity, we generated truncated forms of the zzso zzso containing one or 10 zzso IV zzso These truncated versions of zzso were susceptible to zzso by zzso but were inactive against the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso did not result in modification of the zzso zzso domain by zzso Finally, we incubated zzso or zzso particles formed in zzso with zzso human zzso no degradation of LDL was observed after 16 h at 37 degrees zzso The results of this study suggest that one or more of the zzso present in the zzso domain of zzso in addition to the zzso zzso render zzso zzso zzso
