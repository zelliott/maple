The evolutionary fate of an zzso zzso depends on its contribution to host zzso Occasionally, however, genetic elements arise that are able to gain a transmission advantage while simultaneously imposing a fitness cost on their zzso We previously discovered one such element in zzso zzso that gains a transmission advantage through a combination of zzso killing and zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that this element is composed of a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso antidote, zzso zzso and zzso are located adjacent to one another in the zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso protein that is expressed in zzso and delivered to the zzso via zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso causes lethal defects in muscle and zzso tissue at the zzso stage of zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the zzso and encodes a novel zzso zzso domain fused to a domain with sequence similarity to zzso a zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to have arisen recently, during an expansion of the zzso family, and the zzso domain of zzso is required and partially sufficient for antidote zzso Although zzso and zzso normally function in zzso these proteins can act at other stages as zzso When expressed zzso in adults, zzso kills a variety of cell types, and zzso expression of zzso zzso these zzso Our results demonstrate that the tight physical linkage between two novel zzso proteins has facilitated their zzso into an element capable of promoting its own transmission to the detriment of organisms carrying zzso
