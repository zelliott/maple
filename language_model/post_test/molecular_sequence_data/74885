zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the earliest zzso zzso plants zzso primary zzso sites such as zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were sampled at the zzso zzso forefront zzso Valley, zzso three times a year during the growing season and once a year during winter when plants were covered with snow in 2005 and zzso zzso were investigated using zzso methods and by sequencing the zzso ITS zzso The degree of zzso zzso was high throughout both years zzso We distinguished 21 zzso zzso and identified 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dominated the zzso community of zzso zzso The observed species richness in this about zzso soil was at least 59% of the estimated species zzso zzso communities differed significantly between consecutive years, and spatial zzso was zzso These differences made it difficult to detect seasonal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased throughout the zzso sampling zzso zzso zzso zzso were very abundant in 2005, but nearly disappeared in 2006, whilst its zzso were still frequent in the sampling zzso This suggests that the zzso were displaced from the roots by an zzso species, whereas the zzso was still present in the zzso
