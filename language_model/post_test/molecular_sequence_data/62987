The zzso zzso of zzso plays critical roles in its cellular trafficking and delivery to zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso including those in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso families, bind specifically to the absolutely zzso zzso motif in the zzso zzso to regulate its trafficking and zzso zzso that zzso zzso protein interactions may inhibit zzso generation by specifically targeting the zzso zzso instead of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in (or zzso zzso proteins may influence risk of sporadic zzso by interacting with zzso in zzso to zzso its trafficking and processing to zzso
