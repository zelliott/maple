A technique called zzso sequencing that permits DNA of 4-6 zzso in length to be zzso without zzso is zzso The method exploits the specific cuts introduced by partial zzso with restriction zzso that have zzso recognition sites to produce ordered ladders of zzso zzso The staggered ends contain zzso zzso and can thus be individually zzso using conventional methods to yield overlapping sequences covering the entire zzso This method should have significant impact on both large and small DNA sequencing projects and find many applications in general zzso in which ordered sets of deletions need to be zzso
