We report zzso tissue expression and zzso data for zzso zzso myostatin and zzso in three zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso blue zzso zzso zzso and white zzso zzso zzso These genes are involved in muscle growth and development in zzso and may play similar roles in zzso zzso acid sequences were highly zzso among the three zzso species zzso zzso moderately zzso among zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and less zzso among zzso and humans zzso zzso zzso for all four zzso Gene structure zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was zzso between zzso and other species for all zzso zzso and zzso expression was limited to skeletal muscle in juvenile channel zzso similar to expression patterns for these genes in other fish and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in a variety of zzso in juvenile channel zzso a pattern common in other fish species but contrasting with data from zzso where myostatin is primarily expressed in skeletal zzso zzso was expressed in juvenile zzso heart, zzso and zzso All four genes contained zzso zzso repeats in zzso regions and linkage analysis based on inheritance of these zzso zzso was used to place the genes on the channel zzso linkage zzso Information provided in this study will be useful in further studies to determine the role these genes play in muscle growth and development in zzso
