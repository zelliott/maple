A zzso zzso protein zzso has been isolated from human zzso zzso zzso by a combination of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso affinity zzso five zzso peptides were subjected to protein zzso The full-length zzso of the protein was cloned and zzso from a zzso zzso human liver zzso The zzso showed a remarkable similarity to a rat protein zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is 137 zzso acids long and similar to members of a new hypothetical family of small proteins with presently unknown function, named zzso Human zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein synthesis in a rabbit zzso zzso zzso Unlike other zzso of protein zzso zzso is not zzso despite the presence of putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso expressed in freshly isolated zzso but is significantly zzso when these zzso are subjected to zzso This is also reflected by a zzso increase in the protein concentration as demonstrated by zzso from zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso is further suggested by the observation of a low expression in a variety of liver and kidney tumor cells and a high expression in fully differentiated cells as assessed by zzso and northern zzso The highest zzso expression was found in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and only weak expression was found in other human zzso as evaluated by northern zzso zzso The preferential zzso of the zzso product seemed to be zzso but, in less differentiated cells, nuclear labeling was occasionally zzso zzso of zzso zzso confirmed these zzso The high degree of evolutionary conservation of zzso the considerable zzso during cellular differentiation and its potential role as a zzso inhibitor may reflect an involvement in basic cellular mechanisms, zzso a zzso regulation of protein synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, smooth muscle cells and zzso
