The role of the zzso sensor positive charges in the zzso and zzso gating of the rat brain zzso sodium channel was investigated by mutating the second and fourth zzso positive charges in the zzso segments of all four zzso zzso Both zzso (by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed in a zzso zzso the sodium channel alpha zzso that had fast zzso removed by the incorporation of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patton, zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 16 single and 2 double zzso were constructed and analyzed with respect to zzso dependence and zzso of zzso and zzso The most significant effects were observed with zzso of the fourth positive charge in each zzso zzso of the fourth positive charge in domain I or II produced the largest shifts in the zzso dependence of zzso both in the positive zzso This change was accompanied by positive shifts in the zzso dependence of zzso and zzso zzso Combining the two zzso resulted in an even larger positive shift in zzso zzso and a significantly reduced gating zzso together with larger positive shifts in the zzso dependence of zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the fourth positive charge in domain III caused a negative shift in the zzso of zzso zzso while the zzso zzso resulted in a positive zzso zzso of the fourth charge in domain IV did not shift the zzso zzso of zzso but the conservative substitution produced a positive zzso These data support the idea that both charge and structure are zzso of function in zzso zzso zzso Overall, the data supports a working model in which all four zzso segments contribute to zzso zzso of the sodium zzso
