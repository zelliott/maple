A recent study demonstrated that zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso is required for the development of zzso zzso drug zzso gastric zzso However, the role of zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso of these zzso remains zzso 

To examine the gastric zzso properties of selective zzso and zzso zzso in rats and to investigate further the relationship of zzso zzso to various events involved in the process of zzso gastric zzso 

Animals were given various zzso zzso zzso either alone or in zzso and killed 8 h zzso Under the treatment, gastric damage, zzso zzso zzso content, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as well as gastric zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso production, enhanced gastric zzso and provoked severe zzso in the stomach, with an increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the selective zzso inhibitor zzso did not induce any damage in the stomach and had no effect on zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the selective zzso inhibitor zzso also caused no gastric damage, despite zzso zzso zzso The combined administration of zzso and zzso however, provoked gross damage in the gastric zzso in a zzso manner for each zzso zzso but not zzso caused marked gastric zzso and an increase in zzso zzso although an increase in zzso activity was observed only when zzso was zzso The normal gastric zzso expressed zzso zzso and not zzso zzso but zzso zzso was expressed in the stomach after administration of zzso as well as zzso but not zzso 

These results suggest that the gastric zzso properties of zzso are not accounted for solely by zzso zzso but require the zzso of both zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso may, in turn, counteract the deleterious affects of gastric zzso due to zzso zzso
