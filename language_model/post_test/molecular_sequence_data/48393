The loss of flight ability has occurred thousands of times independently during insect zzso Flight loss may be linked to higher molecular evolutionary rates because of reductions in effective population sizes zzso and relaxed selective zzso zzso zzso ability increases population zzso may decrease geographical range size and increases zzso extinction risk, thus leading to an expected reduction in zzso Additionally, flight loss in birds has been linked to higher molecular rates of zzso zzso probably zzso to relaxed selective constraints on energy zzso We tested for an association between insect flight loss and molecular rates through comparative analysis in 49 zzso independent transitions spanning multiple zzso including zzso flies, zzso zzso stick insects, zzso zzso and zzso using available nuclear and zzso zzso DNA zzso We estimated the rate of molecular evolution of zzso zzso and related zzso lineages by ratios of zzso zzso zzso and overall substitution rates zzso Across multiple instances of flight loss, we show a significant pattern of higher zzso ratios and zzso in FL lineages in zzso but not nuclear zzso These patterns may be explained by relaxed selective constraints in FL zzso relating to energy zzso possibly in combination with reduced zzso
