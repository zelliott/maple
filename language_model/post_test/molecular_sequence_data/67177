The ability of the zzso to perform its diverse functions stems from its zzso gene and protein expression zzso The differences in the gene expression patterns of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso monkey zzso were compared using the technique of differential display reverse zzso zzso chain zzso A transcript showing zzso to human zzso zzso protein 10 zzso was highly expressed in the monkey zzso zzso A zzso zzso was designed spanning a region of the monkey zzso zzso which could inhibit the growth of zzso bacterial strains of zzso zzso zzso could zzso the bacterial cell membrane but was unable to zzso zzso cells as evidenced by the lack of zzso upon incubation with the zzso zzso of genes such as zzso may be essential in providing the first line of defense against microbial infections to the zzso tract and thus rendering protection to the male zzso sheltered within the zzso
