The mouse alcohol zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso zzso We examined the promoter activity of a series of zzso deletions extending from zzso zzso to zzso and demonstrated that there are positive regulatory elements between zzso zzso and zzso and a negative regulatory element between zzso zzso and zzso To identify the sequence of the negative regulatory element, gel zzso and zzso I footprint zzso were performed using nuclear proteins from mouse liver and from a zzso cell line, zzso A specific zzso site covered zzso zzso and zzso Within this region, we identified sites of close zzso contact by zzso interference zzso located in the sequence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of four zzso contact sites within this sequence eliminated the specific zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso and restored expression of zzso in transient zzso zzso to the levels seen when the entire region containing the negative element was zzso Thus, we have identified a negative regulatory element within the zzso zzso No zzso was found between this negative element and other regulatory zzso suggesting that this is a novel negative zzso
