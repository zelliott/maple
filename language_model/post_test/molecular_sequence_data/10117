Members of the zzso protein gene family, which includes zzso and zzso have important functions in zzso membrane zzso These proteins may act as zzso molecules at zzso junctions and zzso at the plasma zzso in addition, they may have pivotal roles in signal zzso pathways and significant effects on cell zzso during zzso Here, we describe the first human zzso in one of these dual function zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso The affected individual has a complete absence of zzso for zzso 1 in the skin and is a compound zzso for zzso inherited premature termination zzso of translation on both zzso of the zzso 1 gene zzso zzso there are features of both zzso fragility and zzso zzso zzso affecting skin, hair and zzso There is no evidence of significant abnormalities in other zzso or zzso zzso in the skin are small and poorly formed with widening of zzso zzso spaces and zzso zzso intermediate filament zzso The molecular findings and clinical observations in this patient attest to the dual importance of zzso 1 in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
