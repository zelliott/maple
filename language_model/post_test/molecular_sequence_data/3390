zzso zzso acids zzso were extracted from a zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from a gypsum crust on the bottom of a zzso zzso pond in zzso zzso When grown at high light zzso this isolate contained high zzso of two zzso one showing maximum optical density at 331 zzso and one at 362 zzso The compound absorbing at 331 zzso was zzso by zzso high performance liquid zzso and its structure was zzso by one-dimensional zzso and zzso and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic zzso mass zzso and zzso acid analysis, and identified as zzso This is the first report of zzso in zzso
