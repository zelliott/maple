The cut zzso of zzso genes has been divided into three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Given the various completed zzso we have now made a comprehensive zzso We find that there are only two cut domain containing genes in zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso has undergone an expansion of the zzso zzso genes and has a gene cluster with three zzso class zzso one of which has lost the cut zzso Two of these genes contain a zzso sequence zzso termed zzso which also occurs in another gene in zzso zzso this motif seems to be zzso zzso A recently uncovered zzso zzso zzso gene has sequence conservation in its zzso with zzso zzso zzso Further, the zzso end of this gene containing the zzso region can undergo alternative zzso to give rise to a protein with a different zzso lacking the zzso and zzso This protein is zzso in its entirety with zzso genes termed zzso are also alternative zzso products of the zzso zzso with plant and zzso zzso The highly divergent zzso genes share a zzso zzso terminal domain, zzso with the zzso defective zzso gene and a zzso zzso zzso These two zzso family genes zzso two highly divergent zzso may be zzso of the zzso genes and thus probably belong to the cut zzso zzso
