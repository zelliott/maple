The zzso of the putative zzso protein zzso zzso is related to the zzso locus zzso genes of zzso We have isolated and characterized a zzso DNA clone of zzso and three additional genes from zzso that are highly related to zzso These three zzso related genes do not appear to have the protein zzso zzso domain that is found in zzso One or more of these genes are expressed specifically in the zzso This initial description of zzso related genes in zzso plants suggests that the zzso domain may be involved in several different cellular functions in a wide variety of zzso
