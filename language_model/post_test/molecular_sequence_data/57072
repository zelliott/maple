To understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling the zzso zzso zzso in animal liver, zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to examine the zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The results demonstrated that, while zzso is the key zzso which supplies large quantities of zzso for zzso synthesis in fetal rat liver, zzso functions to supply zzso for the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso and adult rat zzso zzso was also suggested to work as a zzso gene to supply zzso for respiratory zzso and other zzso in various zzso The structure and organization of the rat zzso gene were next analyzed to study the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso gene zzso The zzso gene was found to span more than 14 zzso in the rat zzso encompassing zzso zzso The promoter region of the gene was found to contain several potential zzso regulatory zzso including motifs matching the zzso box sequence and the nuclear respiratory factor 1 binding zzso The organization of the rat zzso gene was determined to be quite similar to that of the zzso gene in zzso the mouse zzso gene consists of zzso zzso This observation suggested that the ancestral gene for zzso zzso in animals was probably composed of zzso zzso and both the zzso and zzso genes were derived from this ancestral zzso
