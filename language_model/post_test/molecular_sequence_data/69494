Five zzso zzso zzso were raised that bound to the surface of zzso stage zzso zzso with high intensity in zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso using 3 of these zzso revealed a diffuse zzso band of zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not react with zzso Blue or silver zzso but did stain blue with zzso indicating zzso For the one zzso tested, the zzso was zzso and therefore probably zzso Although this zzso shares properties with zzso which forms a surface coat on zzso zzso zzso a search in zzso zzso for zzso of a zzso gene revealed only zzso sequence of partial zzso Using a differential screen, a zzso stage zzso zzso zzso clone was isolated that zzso a putative zzso acid protein containing 2 peptides chemically zzso independently by zzso et zzso zzso The zzso termed zzso and zzso protein zzso has potential zzso leader and tail sequences (the latter with potential for replacement by a zzso zzso zzso and no potential zzso zzso zzso It has no significant sequence zzso with known zzso zzso against a zzso fusion of zzso bound specifically in Western blots to a band very similar to that detected by the zzso and also to the zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed a dense packing of the zzso on the cell zzso It appears that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have major surface proteins with structural zzso but with no sequence zzso
