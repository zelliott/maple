zzso zzso in human serum consists predominantly of zzso zzso zzso however, expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine the origin of the zzso species we added the zzso zzso zzso tag, zzso acid sequence zzso to the zzso of the zzso and expressed zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso active zzso had lost their zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso were made by zzso of zzso or zzso at the zzso To estimate the number of zzso acids that could be deleted from the zzso without losing zzso activity, we expressed deletion zzso We found that deletion of up to 50 zzso acids from the zzso yielded active zzso but that deletion of 51 zzso acids destroyed zzso activity and caused the inactive protein to remain within the zzso zzso of eight or more zzso acids from the zzso also resulted in inactive protein that remained inside the zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso and zzso values (8 zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and showed zzso zzso The zzso zzso though incapable of forming the zzso zzso bond, had nearly the same amount of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso These results support the conclusion that the zzso domain of zzso is at the zzso within the terminal 50 zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso bond is not essential for zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso domain was a zzso zzso stabilized by interactions of seven zzso aromatic zzso zzso
