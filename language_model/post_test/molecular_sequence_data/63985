We report the zzso cloning and characterization of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso initially identified by its zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell line with respect to their zzso counterpart, complete zzso mole and normal zzso zzso Using the differential display zzso as a probe we screened zzso and zzso zzso libraries and isolated a clone carrying a zzso zzso insert zzso number zzso This zzso encodes a protein of 295 zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of approximately zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso search revealed that the deduced zzso acid sequence had similarity to zzso transfer protein zzso with a zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso domain extending between the zzso acids 66 to zzso The zzso gene contains at least 9 zzso spread nearly 30 zzso on zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso of total zzso derived from normal early zzso zzso complete zzso mole zzso and zzso cell line revealed a zzso zzso zzso expressed exclusively in the zzso cell zzso However, zzso zzso analysis performed with the same zzso samples demonstrated zzso expression throughout all of them with the highest level in zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso in a series of zzso cell lines indicated zzso zzso expression with predominance in both zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the highly zzso expression profile in zzso and zzso cell lines and its zzso binding domain suggest that zzso may play an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso cellular zzso
