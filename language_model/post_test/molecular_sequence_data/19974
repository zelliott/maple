zzso angle of rice zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso trait that contributes to grain production, and has long attracted attentions of breeders for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain zzso Although enormous efforts have been made over the past decades to study zzso with extremely spreading or compact zzso the molecular mechanism underlying the control of zzso angle of cereal crops remains zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso zzso gene that regulates shoot zzso by which the rice zzso angle is zzso We show that zzso a novel zzso zzso is temporally and zzso zzso and plays a negative role in polar zzso transport zzso zzso of zzso enhances zzso greatly and thus alters the zzso zzso distribution in zzso leading to the reduced zzso and therefore the zzso zzso of rice zzso
