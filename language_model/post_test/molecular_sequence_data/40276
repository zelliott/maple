zzso shrimp aquaculture has been consistently affected worldwide by devastating diseases that cause a severe loss in zzso To fight a variety of harmful microbes in the surrounding environment, particularly at high zzso (of which intensive farming represents an extreme example), zzso have evolved and use a diverse array of zzso peptides zzso as part of an important zzso response of the host defense zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso factors are comprised of multiple classes or zzso and possess zzso and zzso activities against different strains of bacteria and zzso Shrimp zzso are primarily expressed in circulating zzso which is the main site of the immune response, and zzso expressing zzso probably migrate to infection sites to fight against pathogen zzso Indeed, most zzso are produced as early as the zzso zzso stage to protect shrimp larvae from zzso In this review, we discuss the sequence diversity, zzso gene structure, and zzso activities of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The information available on zzso activities indicates that these shrimp zzso have potential therapeutic applications in the control of disease problems in zzso
