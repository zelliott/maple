To determine the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain sequence of AS zzso 4, the zzso strain from the first case of zzso zzso in China, and study the feasibility of applying DNA sequencing in rapid identification of zzso zzso 

The strain of zzso zzso zzso was collected from the skin zzso of a case of zzso zzso Nuclear DNA was extracted from the cells of AS zzso by a simplified protocol and the zzso zzso zzso domain was amplified by zzso The zzso product was then directly zzso with the zzso zzso zzso cycle sequencing zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso domain of strain AS zzso was determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso sequence of AS zzso is identical with that of the type strain of zzso zzso and differs from those zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 3, 5 and 8 zzso zzso The latter three species are zzso indistinguishable from zzso zzso 

The strain AS zzso was confirmed to belong to zzso zzso This species is the first record in China clinically and zzso DNA sequencing shows an advantage in fast and accurate identification of clinically relevant zzso zzso
