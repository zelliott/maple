Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso mice zzso zzso zzso were studied by surface zzso resonance zzso analysis using three different synthetic zzso zzso zzso of 25, 30, and 25 base pairs zzso These zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso rate zzso zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso ranging from 2 zzso zzso to 2 zzso zzso zzso The screening of a constrained random zzso library displayed on zzso zzso on these zzso allowed the determination of the specific consensus motifs zzso for zzso zzso and zzso but not for zzso zzso No zzso was observed between zzso and zzso peptides (and vice zzso zzso of all zzso selected on zzso was inhibited with 700 zzso soluble zzso The binding of one group of peptides selected on zzso was inhibited by 400 zzso soluble DNA, of a second group by zzso zzso while binding of a third group could not be zzso The determined consensus sequences do not match with known zzso zzso specific for zzso share negative charges and aromatic rings that may mimic a DNA zzso while peptides selected with zzso do not bear any negative charge, zzso a different kind of molecular recognition, for example hydrogen or salt zzso The peptides selected on zzso also bind serum zzso from human patients with systemic lupus zzso In addition, zzso mice zzso with some of the selected zzso exhibit high serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso further supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso may mimic an zzso zzso
