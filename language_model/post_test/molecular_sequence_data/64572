The production of circulating blood cells from bone zzso stem cells during zzso is accompanied by overall changes in gene expression which cause production of required functional zzso such as zzso in zzso cells, as well as control of cell growth, preventing zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene regulation is controlled by several specific zzso factors, including the factor zzso which is required for zzso zzso Based on contacts observed in the zzso structure of the zzso binding domain in complex with DNA, the zzso key DNA interface is interesting in being quite zzso in nature, due to the presence of three zzso side chains protruding toward the zzso Given the zzso composition of the zzso DNA binding site, it is possible that zzso unique zzso group may mediate some of these zzso contacts to increase the stability of zzso The hypothesis that zzso zzso groups are important to the free energy of binding between zzso and DNA is tested by measuring binding of an zzso zzso in which individual zzso bases are zzso with zzso To test for any important zzso specific interactions which may be zzso in character, we have also zzso zzso binding to zzso with base zzso which cannot make hydrogen zzso We report that out of the binding site's five zzso zzso groups, only one appeared to make a notable contribution to binding zzso with removal causing a loss of less than zzso of binding free zzso On the other hand, zzso the potential zzso surface of the zzso major groove was found to cause a larger decrease in binding affinity than removal of any of the zzso zzso groups, with a loss of zzso of binding free zzso
