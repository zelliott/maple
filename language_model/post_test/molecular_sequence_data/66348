Recently, the overproduction of zzso tuberculosis zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli using a novel zzso zzso cloning strategy and the characterization of the zzso zzso was zzso In the present study, the effect of zzso zzso agents on the in zzso activity of zzso tuberculosis zzso was zzso The complete zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso suggested that these zzso zzso agents modify functionally significant zzso zzso at or near the active site of the zzso zzso the authors extended the characterization of zzso by studying the role of the two strictly zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were replaced individually with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was detected for both the zzso replacement zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso analyses revealed that, despite a decrease in the zzso value of the zzso zzso for zzso that presumably indicates an increase in zzso zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of both zzso substitution zzso was severely zzso When either zzso or zzso were zzso with zzso zzso activity was not detected emphasizing the importance of both of these zzso zzso in zzso
