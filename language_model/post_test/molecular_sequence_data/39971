The roles of three membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso transport in zzso were zzso The zzso concentration in zzso cells lacking zzso was elevated upon exposure to 90 zzso zzso acid, whereas cells lacking zzso or zzso showed lower zzso zzso Compared with control cells, cells zzso zzso or zzso had a lower zzso zzso and cells zzso zzso had a higher zzso zzso These results suggest that, in addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play important roles in regulating the cellular zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso for tolerance to a high zzso acid concentration revealed an apparent negative correlation between the zzso zzso concentration and the degree of tolerance to a high external zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso appear to be involved in tolerance to zzso acid and the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso
