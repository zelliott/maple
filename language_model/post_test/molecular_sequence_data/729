zzso zzso is a member of the zzso and is being recognized increasingly as an important cause of serious disease in zzso Recent work has demonstrated that zzso zzso expresses type IV zzso that mediate adherence to respiratory zzso and zzso cells and are selected against during invasive zzso In the current study, we examined the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso and identified zzso of the zzso and the zzso and zzso genes that are essential for zzso expression in zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso The disruption of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso resulted in a marked reduction in the level of transcript for the major zzso zzso zzso and eliminated zzso In contrast, the disruption of zzso resulted in only partial reduction in the level of zzso transcript and a partial decrease in zzso Furthermore, the disruption of zzso in colony zzso with zzso zzso resulted in zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region of zzso and gel shift analysis demonstrated that both zzso and zzso act directly at the zzso promoter, with zzso binding to two repetitive zzso These data suggest that the regulation of zzso zzso type IV zzso expression is complex and zzso influenced by both the genetic state and environmental zzso
