zzso of the length of the zzso zzso chain attached to zzso in zzso zzso is important for zzso and is dependent on the zzso protein zzso A lack of high-resolution structural data for zzso has hampered efforts so far to correlate zzso affecting function of zzso with structure and describe a mechanism for chain length zzso Here we have used secondary structure prediction to show that the zzso domain of the zzso protein has three regions of significant zzso zzso potential, two of which lie within an extended zzso zzso We describe here the first zzso zzso study to investigate the role of individual predicted zzso regions zzso in zzso function and zzso We found that zzso 2 and 3 are necessary for zzso zzso chain length regulation by zzso The in zzso zzso profile of zzso affected in the three zzso was not altered, indicating that individually each zzso is not required for zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso and an zzso effect on zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso did not affect the function of zzso zzso but its presence influenced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was suppressed by a zzso zzso near the putative zzso zzso of zzso
