The human zzso response to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso type b is predominated by zzso expressing a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso is expressed by zzso light chains zzso by either the zzso or A18 variable region zzso In this report we use zzso zzso and molecular modeling to show that zzso expression is determined by zzso in the first and second zzso determining regions that are widely separated in the primary zzso but closely juxtaposed by the zzso folding of the mature light chain zzso Of the known human light zzso only zzso of zzso and A18 zzso these zzso at these positions in their zzso zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso of unknown specificity that expresses zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso that lacks zzso provide examples of the zzso zzso both arising and being lost by zzso zzso In addition, we show that the zzso responsible for zzso expression can be zzso from those required for zzso zzso
