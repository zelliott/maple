zzso is a gene which encodes for a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso protein compares very zzso with other diagnostic zzso and in order to study the zzso nature and structure of this zzso the zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso zzso The diagnostic potential of the zzso zzso proteins was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso using a collection of serum and zzso fluid zzso samples from patients with clinically defined zzso zzso and also zzso from zzso zzso infected zzso Despite the predicted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso there was very little difference in zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was expressed in either zzso or zzso systems, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso and human zzso zzso production of zzso zzso in zzso coli is economical and zzso making it a feasible and practical choice as a diagnostic zzso for use in endemic zzso The zzso zzso is particularly useful for the diagnosis of active as opposed to inactive cases of zzso and conduct of the zzso is also facilitated by the fact that zzso sensitivity is significantly greater when serum as opposed to zzso samples are zzso
