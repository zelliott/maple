The utility of zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso is discussed and compared to information which may be obtained by fast atom zzso mass zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso times more sensitive than zzso zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso providing qualitative zzso information regarding the zzso zzso without the extensive isolation and zzso procedures required to obtain similar information by zzso zzso Analysis of a digest mixture in the positive and negative zzso mode of zzso indicated that, in zzso zzso zzso are zzso detected in the negative zzso zzso The determination of the molecular masses of a zzso with zzso prior to and after treatment with a variety of specific zzso often without removal of the zzso coupled to a comparison of molecular mass information available from a zzso database zzso the assignment of a zzso zzso The vast majority of the molecular zzso signal observed in the linear mode for zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso mass zzso reveal a shift to lower mass consistent with the loss of most of the zzso acid zzso The loss of zzso and zzso zzso is also zzso zzso lowering of the zzso potential reveals structurally significant zzso zzso representing the zzso and zzso portions of the zzso
