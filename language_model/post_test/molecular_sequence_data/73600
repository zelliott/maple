The zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso zzso for the zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso In the present study responses to intravenous administration of zzso were investigated in the systemic vascular bed of the zzso zzso induced zzso decreases in systemic zzso pressure when injected in doses of zzso zzso zzso In terms of relative zzso activity, zzso was approximately zzso more potent than the zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso less potent than zzso The duration of the zzso response to zzso was shorter than zzso but longer than zzso These results show that zzso has significant zzso activity in the zzso
