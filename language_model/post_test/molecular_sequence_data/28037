We have isolated three overlapping zzso clones zzso the pro alpha zzso collagen chain from a human zzso zzso zzso Together, the zzso code for zzso uninterrupted zzso triplets zzso zzso of the triple zzso zzso and about 200 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The identification of the clones as pro alpha zzso zzso was based on the complete identity between the zzso acid sequences of three zzso peptides derived from human alpha zzso collagen and the zzso zzso We have also zzso six zzso within a human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso This sequence shows that although type zzso collagen belongs to the zzso class of zzso there are substantial differences in zzso sizes at the 3' end of the gene when comparing the alpha zzso gene with those of human types I, II, and III zzso Finally, pro alpha zzso zzso has been used as a probe to determine the location of the gene by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the gene is located close to the region zzso on zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that the gene is expressed in cartilage but not in adult liver, skin, and zzso
