The third zzso zzso gene of the zzso deletion from zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein with a putative signal zzso zzso retention zzso and a zzso zzso active site like zzso The zzso acid sequence around the active site like sequence is similar to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso related zzso although the similarity is comparatively zzso A zzso strain zzso zzso showed slow growth and was sensitive to 1 zzso zzso zzso can be detected in wild type cells and is a zzso Although the zzso gene was not essential for growth, zzso of the gene partially restored the maturation zzso of zzso Y caused by the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso can compensate for the loss of zzso with its zzso zzso
