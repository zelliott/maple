A novel, zzso zzso zzso strain was isolated from zzso lake water in Zealand, zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of the zzso designated strain zzso indicated that the strain belonged to the zzso zzso and formed a zzso group with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was less related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA from strain zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The fatty acid profile of the strain differed from those of the other strains representing the zzso zzso by a high content of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and a lower content of zzso zzso zzso was capable of degrading zzso and had zzso and zzso activities, possibly associated with the degradation of zzso and had capacity for degradation of several other zzso zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species, for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
