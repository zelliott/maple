zzso and zzso play an essential role in zzso zzso by regulating zzso zzso They are generated from the same zzso zzso by alternative zzso but no functional differences between these proteins have been zzso We report here the detection of new alternative transcripts of the zzso gene in peripheral blood zzso resulting from a 76 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that these transcripts were also produced in various normal human cells and zzso and in immortalized cell lines, but at levels lower (by a factor of zzso than those for the zzso and zzso zzso These new transcripts are predicted to zzso zzso identical to zzso at the zzso end but entirely lacking the acid domain and the zzso part of the zzso domain of zzso These zzso fused at their zzso ends to enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso were found to be located at zzso and to induce zzso in cell lines with short zzso thereby displaying similar activity to zzso However, these putative proteins lack regions important for interactions with other proteins and for zzso Unlike zzso they were unable to interact with zzso 1, suggesting that these proteins may play a role in zzso zzso different from those of zzso The production of these alternative transcripts was zzso in peripheral blood zzso following zzso zzso suggesting a possible role in resting zzso
