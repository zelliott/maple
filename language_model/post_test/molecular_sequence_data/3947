We demonstrated previously zzso gene zzso in zzso cells and primary zzso zzso treated with zzso Although several zzso elements have been identified in the zzso zzso the precise mechanism for zzso zzso gene regulation remains to be zzso In this report we demonstrate zzso of zzso zzso abrogate zzso gamma gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso binding studies established zzso interaction in the zzso zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments with zzso beta demonstrate gamma promoter zzso in a zzso manner, which was significantly reversed when the zzso zzso site in the zzso region was zzso These studies establish a novel mechanism for gamma gene zzso through the zzso signal zzso zzso
