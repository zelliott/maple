During development, the activity of zzso cell zzso molecules is assumed to be regulated to allow for cell zzso or zzso Previous studies suggest that the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso tail, which contains the site for binding to zzso has a regulatory function in this zzso zzso To study the possible role of zzso zzso zzso regulation in embryonic cell zzso we zzso expressed a series of zzso zzso in developing zzso of chicken zzso When a zzso zzso zzso was zzso the zzso expansion of the zzso was strongly zzso However, a triple zzso substitution in the zzso domain, which specifically inhibited the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, a dominant negative zzso which had a deletion at the zzso domain but maintained the normal zzso tail, did not affect zzso zzso although it disrupted zzso zzso zzso of zzso also did not affect zzso expansion, but it did zzso zzso zzso These and other observations suggest that the zzso domain of zzso has a regulatory role in zzso cell zzso in which molecules other than zzso are zzso The zzso zzso itself seems to play a critical role in the arrangement of zzso
