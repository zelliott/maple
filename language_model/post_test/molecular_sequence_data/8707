zzso strains and zzso of bacteria have been isolated for their ability to zzso under zzso conditions, zzso zzso compounds, such as zzso compounds, zzso and zzso As opposed to zzso conditions where these compounds are zzso via zzso zzso introduced by zzso most of aromatic compounds under zzso conditions are zzso via aromatic acid zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso These aromatic acids are then transformed to zzso before the reduction and the zzso of the zzso ring to zzso acid zzso One step of these zzso pathways is the addition of a zzso A zzso zzso to the zzso group of the aromatic acids by zzso zzso This addition would facilitate the zzso transformation of the aromatic acids to zzso and the subsequent degradation steps of this latter zzso zzso zzso zzso have been characterized or detected from several bacterial strains that were grown under zzso conditions and from an zzso zzso zzso They are also involved in the degradation of some aromatic compounds under zzso zzso They have molecular masses varying between 48 and 61 zzso require zzso zzso and zzso as zzso and have an optimum pH of zzso zzso acid sequence analyses of four aromatic zzso zzso have revealed that they are related to an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso grown bacterial cells are strictly regulated by the zzso conditions and the presence of aromatic zzso
