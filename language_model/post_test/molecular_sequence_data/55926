We have developed a rapid and convenient procedure for the characterization of the zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso A mixture of zzso zzso is incubated with the zzso in the presence of excess of a specific zzso zzso The decrease in each zzso concentration is monitored by zzso liquid zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Relative kinetic parameters for each zzso in the mixture are then calculated using a new statistical zzso that relates all pairs of zzso As a first application, we investigated the zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso and a recently described zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso with zzso primary specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1992) Science zzso zzso For this purpose 21 zzso zzso of the general structure zzso were prepared by multiple zzso zzso where zzso represents zzso zzso and all natural zzso acids except zzso Relative zzso rate zzso for the zzso zzso transfer to these zzso were determined over a range of zzso zzso and zzso have markedly different zzso zzso The order of preference in zzso zzso transfer reactions is positively charged zzso zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso charged, zzso Pro zzso side zzso zzso prefers zzso zzso but like zzso zzso zzso are better than aromatic zzso in zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso + zzso + zzso is similar to the specificity of zzso however, zzso aromatic zzso have low zzso characteristic of zzso
