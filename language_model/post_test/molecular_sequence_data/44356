On a zzso zzso clone of zzso strain zzso DNA, zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, we identified a cluster of four potential open reading frames corresponding to genes zzso and zzso an unidentified open reading frame named zzso and gene zzso The zzso initiation site was mapped at about 115 zzso upstream of the zzso translation start zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter also functions in zzso expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso In zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso gene expression is zzso three- to fourfold by zzso and increased twofold by zzso Based on the occurrence of several zzso signals in the zzso zzso promoter region and strong zzso acid sequence identities (about zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso proteins of two zzso zzso we propose a regulatory mechanism involving zzso zzso to control zzso gene expression in zzso In contrast to zzso zzso in zzso zzso however, control of the zzso zzso gene cluster would not involve an zzso structure but would involve a translating zzso for preventing formation of the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso exhibits the highest similarities (about 50% identical zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso For zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the highest similarity scores (about zzso zzso were obtained with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso expressed from truncated versions of the zzso zzso gene cluster in zzso coli suggest that zzso zzso is stabilized by zzso and that the translation product of zzso plays a role in feedback zzso of the zzso zzso
