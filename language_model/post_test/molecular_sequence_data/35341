zzso are among the most prevalent zzso agents for zzso zzso The low infectious dose, its stability in the environment, and its genetic zzso enable the virus to cause outbreaks, especially in health care facilities and other similar zzso zzso zzso has been most prevalent over the last zzso 

To characterize an extended zzso outbreak at a university hospital in zzso Germany, zzso and zzso 

The outbreak affecting more than 100 persons within 3 days was monitored by real time zzso The rapid onset indicated a food-borne zzso zzso hygienic measures, including zzso procedures and closure of zzso helped contain the outbreak within 6 zzso A zzso zzso sequence covering zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso was characterized from 4 specimens derived from different zzso and the catering zzso 

Our zzso sequences were classified zzso whereas the zzso belonged to zzso zzso analysis revealed a putative zzso at a typical zzso Our zzso region clustered with zzso sequences first detected in Hungary, Belgium, and the US in zzso zzso on zzso acid level were zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data establish a novel strain classified as zzso as the zzso agent for an extended zzso
