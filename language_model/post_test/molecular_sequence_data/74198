A composting product of marine animal resources has been used as a fertilizer and a soil zzso in zzso This zzso was produced by a repeated zzso zzso system with three successive zzso zzso zzso temperature reached about 75 degrees C without zzso The bacterial diversity in this zzso was investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and sequence determination of the zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis showed that a majority of retrieved sequences corresponded to those of zzso and we frequently found sequences similar to the zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso to a zzso strain was isolated from the zzso The isolate zzso zzso zzso produced an zzso compound, zzso zzso These results suggest that this zzso serves as a valuable source of plant zzso zzso including the zzso zzso
