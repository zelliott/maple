The zzso acid sequences of zzso growth factors 1 and 2 from zzso plasma have been determined by mass analysis of peptides obtained from zzso and zzso zzso for the former protein and from zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso Complete zzso to the human Type 1 protein was indicated by the overlapping zzso map obtained by mass zzso For the Type 2 zzso a zzso of a zzso in the human protein to an zzso in the zzso was confirmed by the combination of mass analysis and automated protein zzso The studies were performed on 3 zzso zzso zzso of each zzso indicating the sensitive potential of this method in primary zzso zzso
