Alternative zzso of the zzso zzso has long served as a model example of a regulated zzso event, yet the mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso protein prevents inclusion of the zzso male zzso is not zzso Thus far, the only general zzso factor for which there is in zzso evidence for a regulatory role in the zzso leading to zzso skipping is zzso zzso a protein component of the zzso zzso and U2 zzso Its role, however, has remained enigmatic because of questions about whether zzso acts as part of an intact zzso or a free zzso We provide evidence that zzso interacts with zzso in the context of the zzso zzso through the characterization of a point zzso that interferes with both assembly into the zzso zzso and complex formation with zzso Moreover, we find that zzso associates with other integral zzso zzso zzso and we provide genetic evidence to support the biological relevance of these physical zzso Similar genetic and zzso approaches also link zzso with the zzso zzso factor, zzso These studies point specifically to a mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso by interacting with these key zzso factors at both ends of the regulated male zzso Moreover, because zzso and the zzso zzso are only associated zzso with the zzso during the course of zzso zzso our studies are difficult to reconcile with the current model that proposes that the zzso blocks zzso at the second zzso step, and instead argue that the zzso protein acts after zzso site recognition, but before zzso zzso
