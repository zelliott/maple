The zzso progression of zzso zzso is remarkably sensitive to zzso zzso We have investigated the effects of zzso concentration on the zzso development cycle as reflected by changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso zzso affects zzso control of the zzso genes by sharply zzso zzso from those zzso involved with asexual development of the zzso while zzso zzso at those zzso involved with sexual development of the zzso zzso change also effects regulation of zzso We found that the effects of temperature and zzso were zzso We identified and compared the upstream region of the zzso start sites of each zzso These putative promoter structures are considerably different from one another and contain structures remarkably similar to zzso control elements in other zzso
