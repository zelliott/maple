Two proteins that bind zzso were observed in zzso coli infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 651 from the zzso zzso zzso These zzso carry zzso DNA fragments that do not contain any known zzso binding protein zzso zzso indicating that zzso gene products were exhibiting zzso binding zzso The genes zzso these proteins were zzso zzso and zzso One gene was zzso which encodes a zzso class C zzso The second gene was located at about zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso map and is a previously zzso open reading frame, here named zzso that encodes a protein closely related to the class C zzso The predicted zzso protein is similar in length to zzso but there are extensive zzso in the zzso acid sequence between the zzso and zzso motifs of the two zzso zzso bound strongly to zzso G, zzso and zzso zzso was temperature zzso and disappeared from cells after overnight incubation in stationary zzso Although closely related to zzso and other class C zzso zzso showed no zzso activity toward the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and/or zzso genes in zzso coli lacking zzso zzso and 5 produced zzso zzso cells, particularly in cell filaments induced by zzso Thus, these two members of the zzso family exhibit characteristics similar to those of the classical zzso and their absence affects cell zzso These traits suggest that zzso and zzso may play roles in the normal course of zzso zzso zzso or zzso
