A new zzso zzso zzso has been discovered in the zzso zzso The cell bodies and terminals containing this zzso were localized in the zzso nucleus and median zzso zzso This zzso was further revealed to have a considerable growth hormone zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and hence designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning of zzso zzso the zzso precursor zzso revealed that it encodes zzso and its putative zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso zzso we identified these putative zzso as mature peptides and analyzed their zzso zzso Only zzso zzso the release of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Thus, in addition to zzso zzso acts as a zzso factor on the zzso zzso to stimulate the release of zzso and zzso
