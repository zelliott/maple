zzso disease zzso is characterized by the presence of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso These zzso bind to the zzso and stimulate zzso cells, thus causing zzso To understand the regulation of zzso immune responses in zzso disease, it is important to evaluate the zzso response in patients with zzso against zzso In this study we used 11 different peptides that were derived from two regions zzso zzso acid, AA zzso and zzso unique to the zzso when compared to other zzso hormone zzso and which also have the highest predicted zzso We evaluated both zzso proliferation as a measure of zzso response and zzso binding to each of these peptides in nine patients with zzso and eight healthy zzso Patients with zzso showed considerable zzso zzso and zzso responses against several of these zzso There was considerable zzso in immune responses amongst the zzso Moreover, our data suggested that several peptides contained both T cell and zzso zzso zzso and might represent some of the highly zzso regions of the zzso
