In May and August 2009, 14 highly zzso H5N1 zzso were obtained from migratory birds in central zzso To trace the genetic lineage of the zzso zzso sequences of all eight genes were determined and zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were clustered in zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was related to the zzso of South Korea and Japan obtained in 2003 and 2004 outbreaks, and a migratory duck isolate from zzso zzso The zzso and other internal genes were closely related to those of zzso zzso zzso The results indicate evolving genetic diversity of the zzso gene and acquisition of different zzso zzso gene in the 2009 Mongolian zzso likely via bird zzso Prevention of potentially wider outbreak in domestic poultry and accurate monitoring of H5N1 genetic zzso will require continuous monitoring for H5N1 in both domestic and wild birds, and will zzso international cooperation with neighboring countries sharing migratory zzso
