The infusion of zzso along with zzso into the zzso patient with zzso melanoma resulted in the objective zzso of zzso A gene zzso a tumor zzso recognized by zzso was previously isolated and shown to zzso zzso or zzso Here we report that zzso was identified as a second tumor zzso recognized by a zzso zzso clone derived from the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso was subsequently identified from the coding region of zzso based on studies of the recognition of truncated zzso zzso and the zzso binding zzso This zzso zzso was capable of zzso target cells for zzso by a zzso clone at 1 zzso zzso zzso Although some modified peptides could be recognized by the zzso zzso none were found to be better recognized by T cells than the parental zzso Like other zzso differentiation zzso zzso was only expressed in melanoma, zzso and zzso but not in other human zzso zzso
