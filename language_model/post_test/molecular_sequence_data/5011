The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows that zzso has the motifs zzso among small zzso proteins in plants and that it shares sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To analyze the zzso properties of this zzso an zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli and the protein zzso by zzso acid zzso and zzso column zzso The molecular mass of the protein bearing a zzso is approximately zzso zzso The zzso binding and zzso activity of zzso increased with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso zzso of zzso of protein with a zzso value of zzso zzso The ratios zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso for the control, zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso with zzso indicating that zzso has a higher affinity for zzso than zzso The rate zzso of zzso release against zzso bound zzso in a steady state and the rate of zzso of zzso zzso were calculated to be 432 zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the presence of zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso
