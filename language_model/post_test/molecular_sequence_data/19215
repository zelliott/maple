The dynamic nature of protein interaction networks requires fast and transient molecular zzso The underlying recognition motifs zzso zzso zzso are usually short and zzso variable zzso which in several cases, such as zzso sites or zzso regions, fall into locally zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of this phenomenon by predicting the intrinsic disorder of all zzso proteins enlisted in the zzso Linear zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso in average are embedded in locally zzso regions, while their zzso acid composition and zzso properties exhibit a mixture characteristic of folded and zzso zzso Overall, zzso are constructed by zzso a few zzso zzso favoring structural order on a highly flexible carrier zzso These results establish a connection between zzso and molecular recognition elements of zzso zzso proteins zzso which realize a zzso mode of partner binding mostly in regulatory zzso
