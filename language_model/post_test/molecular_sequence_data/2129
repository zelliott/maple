The zzso coli zzso zzso which encodes zzso acid zzso and was cloned into zzso a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso insert was zzso with restriction zzso and zzso back into zzso and zzso to allow for sequencing in two zzso In a second zzso used to fill in gaps and to confirm the sequence derived from the first zzso the whole insert was cloned into zzso zzso A zzso set of deletions was constructed and zzso into zzso Both the zzso fragments cloned into plasmids zzso and zzso and the overlapping fragments contained in zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso procedure with zzso Computer software was used to identify coding regions and the correct reading zzso Two promoter regions, two zzso sequences and two possible start sites were zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso human liver zzso and rat liver zzso zzso zzso sequences were observed, especially in the zzso zzso region zzso and the 4 zzso surrounding the essential zzso at the active site zzso for rat and human zzso Computer analysis of promoter strength and two independent analyses of zzso usage indicated that the zzso gene is moderately zzso
