The zzso channel from bovine zzso smooth muscle consists of a zzso alpha zzso and a regulatory zzso zzso that zzso the zzso and pharmacological properties of the alpha zzso In the present study, we examine zzso blocking zzso of single zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso from smooth muscle or from zzso cells zzso zzso with either alpha or zzso 1 zzso Under low external zzso strength conditions, zzso channels from smooth muscle showed zzso block times, 48 zzso 12 zzso that were similar to those expressing zzso 1 zzso 51 zzso 16 zzso In contrast, with the alpha zzso alone, zzso block times were much zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso and were zzso similar to previously reported values for the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso the external zzso strength caused a decrease in zzso block times for zzso channel complexes of zzso 1 zzso but not of alpha zzso zzso These findings indicate that it may be possible to predict the association of beta 1 zzso with native zzso channels by monitoring the zzso of zzso blockade of single channels, and they suggest that zzso channels in skeletal muscle do not contain a beta 1 zzso like the one present in smooth zzso To further test this hypothesis, we examined the binding and zzso properties of zzso to both bovine smooth muscle and rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso binds to rabbit skeletal muscle zzso with the same affinity as it does to smooth muscle zzso However, specific zzso of zzso was observed into the beta 1 zzso of smooth muscle but not in skeletal zzso Taken together, these data suggest that studies of zzso block of single zzso channels provide an approach for characterizing structural and functional features of the zzso 1 zzso
