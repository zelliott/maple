zzso zzso is an zzso protein that plays an important regulatory role in the zzso cell layer and during the early zzso development zzso It is the first specific protein of maternal origin discovered in a zzso zzso In this study, the zzso regions of the zzso gene were characterized by sequencing in 20 unrelated cattle zzso zzso zzso and 20 unrelated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in cattle and 10 zzso in zzso Some of the zzso were identified in zzso regions and caused zzso acid zzso The zzso of a zzso was detected in the zzso region of zzso 3 of the buffalo sequence when compared to the cattle zzso This zzso causes a change in the zzso zzso from this point zzso zzso the 19 terminal zzso acids of the buffalo protein and creating a premature stop zzso This finding may explain zzso differences between cattle and zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso development and zzso of twin zzso
