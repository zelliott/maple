zzso zzso across the zzso inner membrane is driven by cycles of binding and release of zzso heat shock protein 70 zzso in the zzso The peripheral inner membrane zzso zzso recruits zzso in an zzso manner to the import zzso We show that zzso the closely related zzso of zzso coli, when targeted to the zzso of zzso zzso interacts in a specific manner with zzso The interaction is, however, not regulated by zzso and zzso cannot support protein zzso We used truncated zzso and zzso proteins consisting of segments of zzso and zzso to analyze which portions of zzso bind and functionally interact with zzso We show that zzso interacts with the zzso core of the zzso binding domain of zzso and of zzso The zzso A and B of the zzso binding domain of zzso are required to transmit the zzso state of the zzso domain to the zzso binding zzso zzso by interacting in this way with the zzso binding domain, is proposed to coordinate the binding of zzso to the incoming zzso and the subsequent release of the zzso complex from the zzso complex, the zzso of the inner zzso
