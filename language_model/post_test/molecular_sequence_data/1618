The zzso activity against zzso coli and zzso zzso has been studied for a number of modified zzso based on zzso of different zzso The peptides were classified by zzso methods and quantitative zzso relationships zzso were developed using theoretically derived variables for the zzso zzso For the modified peptides based on bovine zzso zzso a model was calculated and used for prediction of new peptides that were then tested for zzso activity in order to improve zzso activity and to check the zzso of the zzso Models were also calculated including zzso of different zzso zzso of the mechanism of action of the peptides are briefly zzso
