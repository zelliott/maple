Classical protein folding zzso a cooperative transition between distinct zzso states that are individually populated at equilibrium and separated by an energy zzso It has been proposed, however, that the small zzso zzso zzso zzso downhill folding zzso it folds zzso to its native state without encountering an appreciable energy zzso Only a single zzso ensemble is populated under given conditions, and so the zzso state ensemble progressively changes into the native zzso A wide zzso of zzso zzso zzso that was observed for an zzso zzso zzso of zzso is proposed to be evidence for its zzso downhill zzso a phenomenon that is also suggested to be functionally important for zzso and its zzso We found, however, that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso with very similar transition zzso for the melting of secondary and zzso zzso as well as for individual zzso when monitored by zzso Similar results were also observed for two other zzso zzso and zzso Further, the zzso zzso zzso the unfolding zzso of zzso zzso and complicated its equilibrium zzso zzso downhill folding may well occur for some proteins that do not have distinct folded states but not for zzso and its zzso zzso
