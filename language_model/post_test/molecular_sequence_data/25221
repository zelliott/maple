The zzso gene of zzso coli encodes an outer membrane zzso zzso which constitutes the zzso for zzso K and zzso zzso and functions as a zzso channel for zzso and zzso The zzso element zzso was used to prepare a gene bank in zzso and this bank was used to identify zzso strains carrying the cloned zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene into the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a strong overproduction of zzso The sequence of a zzso DNA segment containing zzso and its zzso regions was zzso An open reading frame zzso was found which was followed by a pair of repetitive zzso zzso zzso This zzso translated into a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso the first 22 zzso of which showed the characteristic features of a bacterial signal sequence zzso The putative mature form of zzso is composed of 272 zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso The zzso sequence of zzso shows an even distribution of charged zzso zzso zzso and lacks extensive zzso zzso No significant zzso of zzso to the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso coli outer membrane were zzso Using zzso S1, we identified two zzso start points for the zzso zzso which were separated by zzso 150 zzso zzso data suggest that the synthesis of the larger zzso species is directed by a weak promoter zzso that is controlled by the zzso zzso whereas the smaller zzso species is directed by the main promoter zzso which is zzso controlled by the zzso zzso and positively affected by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso
