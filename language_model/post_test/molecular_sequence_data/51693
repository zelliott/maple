The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect zzso B virus DNA zzso in serum samples of 104 chronic zzso zzso Of 22 patients positive for both zzso surface zzso and zzso zzso zzso seven were positive for zzso on dot zzso zzso and all 22 positive in the zzso Of 41 zzso positive patients who had zzso against zzso zzso only three were positive for zzso on dot zzso zzso however DNA was detected in 30 of them with the zzso Similarly, of 41 individuals with zzso against zzso zzso 23 yielded positive results in the zzso technique, although dot zzso zzso detected zzso in only one zzso These results indicate that while zzso and conventional DNA zzso zzso are not sensitive enough to determine the zzso of zzso chronic carriers, zzso is an accurate method for establishing the status and progression of disease in these zzso
