A heat shock zzso gene zzso from the human respiratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso expressed and zzso in zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso sequences are zzso The zzso start point and zzso zzso addition site were zzso The zzso gene contains two zzso and a zzso zzso which translates a zzso acid zzso protein of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The translated protein revealed two potential zzso zzso The deduced zzso showed zzso zzso sequence similarity to reported zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso III of zzso and was shown to be a single copy gene by Southern and Northern zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli resulted in production of a zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso protein confirmed that it was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised in mice against the isolated zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso and wall of zzso cells of zzso The zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso mice and was shown to induce proliferation of T cells isolated from zzso zzso of these zzso The zzso gene of zzso is the first reported zzso protein gene of this human zzso
