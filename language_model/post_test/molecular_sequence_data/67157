zzso is known to serve as a secondary zzso to mediate salt stress signaling zzso We found a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso as a salt zzso gene by using the suppression zzso zzso The zzso was targeted into nucleus and bound to zzso suggesting that zzso is a nuclear zzso zzso In addition, zzso bound specifically to the zzso sequence zzso which is found in the promoter regions of many salt stress-related zzso zzso analyses with an zzso knockout zzso revealed that the zzso plants show enhanced sensitivity to salt zzso Further analyses indicated that the zzso plants have reduced survival rate, fresh weight, zzso content, and protein content upon salt stress, suggesting that the zzso plays a critical role in plant salt stress zzso zzso this study represents that zzso is the first known zzso zzso factor involved in plant salt stress zzso
