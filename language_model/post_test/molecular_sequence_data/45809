Cell division and cell wall synthesis are tightly linked cellular processes for bacterial zzso A zzso zzso zzso coli, strain zzso indicated that bacteria can divide without assembling a cell zzso However, the molecular basis of its zzso remained zzso To establish a first zzso zzso we analyzed its zzso zzso and other genes involved in division of zzso zzso The analysis revealed defective zzso and zzso zzso truncated by a nonsense and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined in the zzso and zzso products yielding zzso replacements at zzso zzso zzso and zzso obviously zzso in the zzso are essential for cell division and cell wall zzso respectively, in all bacteria with a zzso cell zzso zzso is able to survive their zzso This points to zzso mechanisms for cell division in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso represents an interesting model to investigate the plasticity of cell division in zzso coli, and to demonstrate how concepts fundamental for bacterial life can be zzso
