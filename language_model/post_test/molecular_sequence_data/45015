The zzso zzso II is an ubiquitous nuclear zzso involved in vital cellular zzso It is also the target for some of the most active zzso zzso In the various crystal structures of zzso zzso II, the zzso segment zzso to the human zzso II alpha zzso segment folds into a compact zzso zzso zzso termed zzso module zzso turn zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso A has suggested a model wherein zzso is involved in both the zzso zzso and the binding to zzso These two properties were investigated in solution, using the zzso zzso module of human zzso II alpha and its synthetic components zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso structure model of human zzso zzso that of zzso in the crystal structure with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso content of human zzso in solution is similar to that of its counterpart within zzso zzso II in the solid zzso The chemical zzso data indicated that zzso zzso into zzso while gel mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso bind efficiently to DNA zzso zzso of zzso M for zzso and zzso of zzso M for zzso and of only zzso M for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were able to inhibit zzso II in DNA relaxation zzso zzso that zzso is the DNA recognition zzso All suggests that the zzso module once separated from the whole protein zzso a compact zzso integral to specific zzso and DNA zzso The module may thus be used for the search of drugs efficient in hindering zzso II zzso or binding to zzso
