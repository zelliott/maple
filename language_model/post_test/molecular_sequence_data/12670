We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose function is required for formation of the zzso branches that penetrate the zzso In zzso zzso zzso the zzso repeated zzso branches stall and fail to penetrate the zzso and the zzso cerebral branch and associated cerebral zzso fail to zzso zzso of zzso in the founder cells for the cerebral branch within the first zzso zzso is zzso in zzso segments by zzso and other zzso complex zzso This pattern of expression and zzso gene regulation is reproduced by an unusual zzso zzso zzso sequence located downstream of the zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso protein is localized to the nucleus of zzso precursor cells as they migrate and zzso zzso protein appears to play a regulatory role in neural branching of the zzso and the zzso aspects of these neural branching patterns appear to be generated by zzso regulation of zzso zzso
