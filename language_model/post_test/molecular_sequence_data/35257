Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, first isolated in 1957, are the preferred production host for many therapeutic zzso Although genetic zzso among zzso cell lines has been well zzso a zzso zzso characterization of their zzso differences has been stymied by the lack of a unifying zzso resource for zzso zzso Here we report a zzso draft zzso sequence of a female Chinese zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso We also zzso and analyzed the zzso of six zzso cell lines from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This analysis identified zzso genes missing in different zzso cell lines, and detected zzso million zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso copy number zzso Many zzso are located in genes with functions relevant to zzso such as zzso The details of this genetic diversity highlight the value of the zzso zzso as the reference upon which zzso cells can be studied and engineered for protein zzso
