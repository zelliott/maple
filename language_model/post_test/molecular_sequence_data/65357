zzso is critical to tumor zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in vascular zzso cells zzso We have identified a zzso zzso that regulates zzso expression and hypothesized that it plays a major role in modulating zzso activity in zzso A zzso zzso from the zzso zzso region zzso containing 2 zzso targeting sites was observed to be required for the rapid zzso of zzso expression by serum and zzso factors, whereas the activity of the zzso promoter did not vary with exposure to serum or zzso zzso This same zzso sequence in the zzso zzso cloned into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the reporter gene when placed 3' of zzso Finally, forced expression of zzso zzso zzso expression through this specific zzso zzso zzso A zzso search for other possible zzso binding sites revealed an zzso targeting site in the zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso the expression and zzso activity of which are also inhibited by zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso is a regulator of the zzso zzso of vascular zzso largely through its ability to zzso the expression of zzso and zzso
