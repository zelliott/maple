The increased severity of disease associated with the zzso strain of zzso zzso has been attributed to zzso to the zzso gene which codes for a negative regulator of toxin zzso To assess the role of zzso of zzso A and B in clinical zzso of zzso zzso two zzso and five zzso zzso strains were zzso 

zzso was performed on zzso zzso and zzso to determine if there were differences that might account for zzso of zzso A and zzso B in zzso zzso Biological activity of zzso B was evaluated using the zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso A biological activity was assessed using the zzso zzso resistance zzso 

Our results confirm that zzso A and zzso B production in zzso strains and zzso zzso occurs earlier in the exponential growth phase compared to most zzso clinical zzso Despite the zzso observed in zzso zzso it had no zzso in zzso zzso or zzso Analysis of the other clinical zzso indicated that the zzso and ultimate final concentration of zzso A and B did not correlate with the presence or lack of zzso in zzso zzso or zzso 

Our data do not support a direct role for zzso in the zzso gene as a predictor of zzso of zzso A and B in zzso zzso
