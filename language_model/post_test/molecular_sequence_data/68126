The zzso acid sequence of human zzso II was deduced from the sequence of zzso clones isolated from a skeletal muscle zzso An open reading frame of 2751 bases encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has zzso identity with rat zzso II but only zzso identity with human zzso type zzso In addition to zzso II zzso the human skeletal muscle zzso library contained at least an equal number of clones of zzso I, the zzso reported to be typically found in kidney and zzso zzso variation in zzso II could zzso insulin resistance in peripheral zzso and cause zzso diabetes zzso The availability of this sequence would facilitate investigating the role of zzso in the zzso gene in the zzso of this zzso
