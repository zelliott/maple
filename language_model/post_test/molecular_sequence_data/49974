The zzso cells that initiate and maintain zzso class zzso zzso zzso diseases are poorly zzso We now describe a new T cell zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso model of inflammatory skin disease in which zzso activate and are the primary target of zzso zzso T zzso We previously generated zzso 14 zzso mice expressing zzso class II only on zzso cortical zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice fail to undergo negative selection and thus have significant zzso The zzso genes from an zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned to produce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso selected in zzso zzso mice but not in zzso zzso Interestingly, a significant number of mice that express both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso spontaneously develop inflammatory skin disease with zzso zzso induction of zzso class II expression on zzso and T helper 1 zzso Disease can be induced by skin inflammation but not solely by zzso of T zzso Thus, zzso zzso can be directed through zzso presentation by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
