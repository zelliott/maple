zzso between zzso zzso zzso females and zzso males result in a significant excess of offspring inheriting maternal zzso zzso in the central region of mouse zzso 11 due to zzso drive at the second zzso zzso We have shown previously that the locus subject to selection is in the vicinity of zzso a marker closely linked to the zzso locus that controls the zzso zzso zzso known as the zzso zzso We have also shown that observation of zzso drive in this system depends upon the zzso of the zzso Here we show that females that are zzso at zzso retain the zzso drive zzso and define a zzso candidate zzso for the zzso locus in this drive zzso In addition, analysis of the inheritance of zzso at zzso among the offspring of zzso zzso indicates that the effect of the zzso is determined by the zzso zzso at zzso or a locus linked to zzso
