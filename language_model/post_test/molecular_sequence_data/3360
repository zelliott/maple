Based on zzso zzso an alkaline pH zzso sensitivity to selected zzso zzso and molecular analysis, we provide evidence for the presence of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso complex zzso of the tarnished plant zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity in extracts of the zzso against zzso zzso was at pH 10, but a minor peak of activity also occurred at pH zzso The major zzso activity focused at zzso during zzso zzso focusing and was zzso with an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 from a zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso fraction gave a single major band when analyzed on a zzso zzso The activity was completely suppressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bean zzso zzso A zzso coding for a zzso protein in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso contained an zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso protein included zzso acid sequence motifs that are zzso with four zzso zzso zzso from other zzso Typical features of the putative zzso protein from zzso zzso included the zzso zzso active site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso bridges, the zzso zzso zzso zzso that determine zzso zzso and both zzso signal and zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of a zzso precursor zzso provided additional direct evidence for zzso like zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
