zzso of the zzso group are highly potent zzso compounds found in zzso zzso and marine zzso zzso is used by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso as a chemical zzso We have recently identified a group of putative zzso zzso genes and localized them to the zzso of an as yet zzso zzso zzso zzso the likely true zzso zzso However, this zzso zzso cluster lacks several genes expected for zzso zzso Here we report an additional zzso zzso zzso on a separate region of the zzso zzso It contains at least three novel zzso zzso that are predicted to be involved in zzso chain initiation and the formation of an unusual zzso zzso The region is bordered by mobility zzso this suggests that gene zzso led to the zzso cluster zzso With this work, all putative zzso genes have been zzso Their zzso expression in a zzso zzso will provide important insights into how sustainable sources of zzso drug candidates can be zzso
