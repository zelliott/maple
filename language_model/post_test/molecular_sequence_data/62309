The following studies are the first to demonstrate the association of zzso zzso with a zzso that contains significant zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso We performed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex from zzso 96 zzso of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso which binds to zzso on the surface of zzso zzso cells and zzso Previous results indicate that the zzso alpha zzso of the zzso complex is associated with the gamma zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso and with several other unique proteins that surface zzso and migrate at approximately 15, 20, and 25 zzso when analyzed by reducing zzso Through characterization of the zzso zzso complex, we identified the zzso zzso as a unique zzso protein that has not been described in other zzso We now report an association between zzso and a zzso zzso that shares zzso to zzso a protein of zzso function initially identified in zzso zzso A domain with a high degree of zzso to zzso is found in the zzso of a family of zzso proteins referred to as zzso The results of our studies indicate the presence of a novel zzso complex in the zzso system, and may provide new insights into the function of this zzso protein zzso in relation to the variety of responses zzso through zzso
