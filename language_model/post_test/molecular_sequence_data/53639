We have cloned and expressed a human zzso zzso that encodes a zzso of zzso calcium zzso The predicted protein is zzso zzso to its rat counterpart but has a distinct zzso zzso Its zzso is detected almost exclusively in the human brain, as well as in adrenal and zzso zzso zzso currents generated by the functional expression of human zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells were zzso The zzso current activated and zzso approximately 10 zzso more zzso zzso and zzso zzso were up to six times zzso while zzso zzso was faster and showed little zzso zzso A slower recovery from zzso a lower sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso approximately 180 zzso and a larger channel zzso zzso 11 zzso were the other zzso features of the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso channels functionally distinct from those generated by the human zzso or zzso zzso and point out that human and rat zzso zzso have zzso properties not only in their primary zzso but also in their expression profile and zzso zzso
