A zzso was fused to the C zzso of the zzso zzso major coat protein zzso and libraries of zzso zzso were screened to select for zzso that displayed the zzso with high zzso Over 600 zzso were zzso to compile a comprehensive database of zzso sequence diversity compatible with assembly into the zzso zzso zzso The database reveals that, while the zzso zzso zzso was highly tolerant to zzso certain functional zzso were required for efficient zzso Three zzso zzso were located approximately zzso along the length of the zzso In addition, a positively charged zzso was required directly opposite the most zzso zzso zzso and on the same side as the other two zzso Both ends of the protein were highly tolerant to zzso consistent with the use of zzso as a scaffold for both N and zzso zzso zzso Further rounds of selection were used to enrich for zzso zzso that supported higher levels of zzso zzso zzso The largest improvements in display resulted from zzso around the junction between zzso and the zzso zzso and additional zzso in the zzso region were selected for further improvements in zzso The best zzso zzso improved zzso display more than zzso relative to the zzso and these zzso could support the simultaneous display of N and zzso zzso These finding provide information on the requirements for zzso zzso coat zzso and provide improved scaffolds for zzso display zzso
