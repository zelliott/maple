Three species of the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to possess insertions in the first half of the nuclear zzso zzso Both the number and the type of these insertions varied between and within zzso At position 516 the insertions belonged to zzso zzso with a characteristic secondary structure and zzso zzso At three positions, zzso 330 and zzso the insertions were short and lacked the characteristic features of zzso zzso The zzso junctions of these short zzso resembled those of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequence zzso the zzso A of zzso zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso and sequencing of zzso confirmed that the insertions from positions zzso 330 and 516 had been spliced from the zzso during zzso At position zzso the zzso had been spliced from zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso the zzso was still present in the zzso
