We have zzso zzso and zzso a series of zzso de zzso zzso zzso each differing in the zzso length between the template and the zzso The zzso is based on an earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was designed to link the zzso interface of the zzso zzso or decreasing the zzso length by one zzso zzso had a significant effect on the structure and properties of the zzso synthetic proteins zzso Here, the effect of the zzso length is further zzso by linking the peptides closer to the zzso face by using the second-generation zzso zzso in an effort to improve the packing between the zzso and to better understand the zzso zzso The peptides were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and linked onto a zzso zzso The proteins were found to be zzso stable to zzso zzso zzso and to unfold zzso However, their zzso toward zzso propensity to zzso and structural specificity zzso The zzso zzso of the second-generation series demonstrated the highest stability and most zzso character of all the zzso zzso in both the zzso and second-generation zzso The structural specificity of this two zzso zzso is comparable to that of other known zzso de zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations showed that the zzso zzso contains zzso that are zzso with respect to the zzso template and may account for its unique zzso
