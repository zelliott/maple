We recently cloned a zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human red blood cell regulator zzso a potent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pratt, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso contains 28 zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso (a zzso zzso Similar regions are present in a number of zzso zzso and using standard filter zzso the zzso protein is shown to bind zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also bound to a zzso extension protein containing the zzso zzso region from the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and its zzso region is able to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the enhanced zzso activity of complexes between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This raises the possibility that zzso zzso activity is regulated by calcium in zzso
