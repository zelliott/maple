Variation in human zzso pigmentation is due to varied amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced by the zzso The zzso 1 zzso zzso is a regulator of zzso and zzso production in the zzso and zzso zzso causing coat color changes are known in many zzso We have zzso the zzso gene in 121 individuals sampled from world populations with an emphasis on Asian zzso We found variation at five zzso sites zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but at only one synonymous site zzso Interestingly, the human consensus protein sequence is observed in all 25 African individuals zzso but at lower zzso in the other populations zzso especially in East and Southeast zzso The zzso zzso is absent in the Africans zzso almost absent in Europeans, and at a low frequency zzso in Indians, but is at an exceptionally high frequency zzso in East and Southeast zzso The zzso gene in common and pygmy zzso gorilla, orangutan, and zzso was zzso to study the evolution of zzso The ancestral human zzso sequence is identical to the human consensus protein zzso while zzso varies considerably among higher zzso A comparison of the rates of substitution in genes in the zzso zzso family indicates that zzso has evolved the zzso In addition, the zzso diversity at the zzso locus is shown to be several times higher than the average zzso diversity in human zzso possibly due to diversifying zzso
