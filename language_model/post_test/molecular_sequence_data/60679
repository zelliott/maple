zzso virus encodes a potent zzso the middle zzso zzso that zzso cell transformation by copying the actions of zzso zzso associated growth factor zzso A crucial component of zzso transformation is its ability to bind and stimulate the activity of zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which this is achieved remains zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso then provides binding sites for zzso and zzso domain containing molecules in a paradigm of zzso zzso We present evidence here that the zzso complex contains zzso amounts of zzso and that zzso activity may be required for the interaction of zzso with both zzso and the zzso zzso then, is a necessary component of the zzso zzso We also show that two motifs in the 185 to 210 region of zzso each consisting of a basic area followed by a zzso or zzso are essential for interaction with zzso but not zzso The spacing between the zzso or zzso and the basic sequence also appears to be zzso Substituting a zzso zzso in place of zzso in zzso has no affect on the binding of zzso showing that these sites interact with zzso by a novel mechanism that does not require zzso
