A putative zzso gene was identified within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso contains zzso zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso started at about 18 h post infection zzso and the protein was first detected at 20 h zzso The times of zzso and expression are characteristic of a late zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso indicated that zzso was initiated from the zzso zzso located at zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start site and the zzso zzso tail was added at 267 zzso downstream from the stop zzso This is the first report on the molecular characterization of a zzso from a single zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso genes were extensively examined in comparison with zzso derived from bacteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso insects and zzso zzso and most zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso were clustered exclusively within zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso acquired their zzso genes from zzso
