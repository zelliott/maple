The zzso family of proteins exerts diverse influences on the signal zzso pathways of zzso We have newly identified a human zzso zzso the gamma zzso of the zzso family of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of human zzso was identical to that of rat zzso The human zzso gene zzso symbol zzso is highly expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, and zzso By zzso in zzso zzso analysis, the human zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso zzso hybrid mapping has shown that this gene is localized zzso zzso zzso to zzso a zzso marker located at the most zzso end of the common deletion region of zzso syndrome zzso This suggests that zzso of zzso may not contribute to the zzso zzso However, information regarding the precise zzso location of a member of the zzso family of genes will aid in examining the relationship between this family of proteins and human zzso
