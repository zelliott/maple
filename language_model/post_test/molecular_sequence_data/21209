zzso adult zzso zzso ticks were collected in an Atlantic rainforest area at zzso State Park, State of zzso zzso zzso From an zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully isolated in zzso cell culture by the shell vial zzso zzso isolation was confirmed by optical zzso transmission electron zzso and zzso targeting portions of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso on infected zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were zzso By zzso analysis, the partial sequence of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolate was closest to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso partial sequence was closest to the corresponding sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso partial sequence was closest to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso partial sequence was closest to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Since our zzso isolate was genetically distinct from other zzso species, we propose a new species designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso belongs to the zzso group within the zzso zzso together with the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Little or no zzso zzso was observed between zzso of zzso zzso guinea pigs and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso guinea zzso
