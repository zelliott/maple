We have used a collection of zzso forms of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso to study its interaction with zzso zzso This collection includes a set of nine zzso zzso each of which contains a structural disruption in one of the nine zinc fingers of zzso zzso zzso and a pair of complementary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and kinetic binding analyses in conjunction with zzso protection and interference zzso have been used to characterize the zzso interaction in each zzso We find that alternative binding modes are available for specific, zzso recognition of zzso zzso by zzso These binding modes are distinct zzso and zzso and the mode of recognition adopted by zzso zzso when binding to intact zzso zzso is dependent on the structural integrity of zinc fingers 5 and 6 in zzso and continuity of the zzso backbone in loop A of zzso zzso zzso of any of these components allows adoption of one or more alternative modes of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso complex, some portions of zzso most notably the zzso three zinc fingers, are prevented from interacting with zzso zzso in an energetically optimal way, and instead adopt a mode of binding that represents a compromise with the rest of the zzso
