It has recently been reported that tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso plays various roles in such zzso diseases as diabetes, multiple sclerosis zzso and systemic lupus zzso zzso However, it has still remained unclear whether there is a close relationship between TRAIL and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the association between the expression of TRAIL and zzso The specific zzso zzso acid zzso levels of TRAIL in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso from 60 AS patients, 20 zzso arthritis zzso patients, and 30 healthy controls were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that the expression levels of TRAIL zzso and serum zzso were significantly elevated in AS patients, compared with zzso patients and healthy controls, and there was a close association between TRAIL zzso and zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference between human zzso zzso zzso and zzso AS zzso In zzso patients, TRAIL zzso and zzso closely correlated with serum zzso and zzso protein zzso but did not correlate in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso expression of TRAIL might be somewhat specific for evaluation of zzso
