We have obtained the complete DNA sequence of zzso virus zzso an zzso also known as zzso disease virus or zzso zzso 1, using sequence fragments derived from six different strains zzso Becker, Rice, zzso zzso and zzso The assembled zzso zzso sequence comprises zzso zzso As expected, it matches the predicted gene arrangement, zzso size, and restriction zzso digest zzso More than 70 open reading frames were identified with zzso in related zzso none were unique to zzso zzso zzso II zzso control elements in the zzso zzso including core zzso zzso sites, and zzso sites, were identified with computer prediction zzso The correlation between predicted and zzso determined zzso start and stop sites was zzso The zzso control architecture is characterized by three key features: core zzso elements shared between zzso yielding divergent transcripts and a large number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso and short repetitive sequences that could function as zzso against improperly terminated zzso Many of these features are zzso in the zzso zzso and have important implications for gene array zzso
