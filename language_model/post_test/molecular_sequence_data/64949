zzso to a clinically significant drug hypersensitivity syndrome associated with zzso use seems to have a strong genetic zzso We have previously shown that the presence of zzso strongly predicts zzso hypersensitivity and have identified a potential zzso locus within a zzso region between the zzso and zzso zzso in the central zzso We now report the results of fine zzso genetic mapping in an expanded patient population of 248 zzso fully zzso zzso individuals in the Western Australian zzso zzso zzso in which 18 cases of zzso zzso hypersensitivity zzso and 230 tolerant controls were zzso zzso mapping within patients with zzso markers of the zzso ancestral zzso suggests a zzso locus within the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was present in zzso of hypersensitive cases compared with zzso of controls zzso ratio, zzso P zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulting from the substitution of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was found in combination with zzso in zzso of hypersensitive cases and zzso of controls zzso ratio, zzso P zzso zzso zzso with zzso hypersensitivity demonstrated increased zzso tumor necrosis factor expression in response to ex zzso zzso zzso which was zzso with zzso T cell zzso These data indicate that the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is necessary for the development of zzso zzso which is likely to be zzso by an zzso immune response to zzso
