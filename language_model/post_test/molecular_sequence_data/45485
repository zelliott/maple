To investigate the zzso significance of zzso zzso in a marine zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso we cloned and characterized zzso zzso its zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso consisted of 995 zzso and zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso consisting of 510 zzso zzso contained a putative signal zzso an zzso domain with two pairs of zzso a zzso zzso a single zzso domain, and a zzso zzso domain with box 1 and box 2 regions, all of which are characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was detected only in the zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso revealed the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, kidney zzso cells, and zzso zzso The zzso expression levels in the zzso were about five times higher in zzso seawater than in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates water and zzso balances through zzso expressed in the zzso zzso as is the case with zzso zzso zzso
