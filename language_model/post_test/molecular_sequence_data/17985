The pea zzso gene in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of pea nuclear DNA was introduced into tobacco by zzso zzso zzso plants contained pea zzso located within the zzso zzso membrane zzso Analysis of zzso from a zzso transgenic plant containing a single copy of the pea zzso gene indicated that zzso zzso for the pea gene contained almost twice as much pea zzso as zzso zzso for the pea zzso zzso zzso contained approximately equal amounts of pea and tobacco zzso The amount of tobacco zzso in leaves of transgenic plants was unaffected by the expression of the pea zzso zzso The zzso from the pea gene in tobacco was indistinguishable by northern zzso and zzso zzso protection from the zzso found in zzso In both pea and transgenic zzso expression of the pea zzso gene was induced by light in leaves but was suppressed in zzso zzso zzso free of zzso tobacco zzso was zzso from transgenic tobacco plants and shown to be indistinguishable from natural pea zzso by zzso protein sequencing and zzso zzso zzso
