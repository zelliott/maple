zzso zzso of zzso at a site within zzso on the zzso zzso zzso controls peripheral zzso zzso production and zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso precise zzso of zzso from zzso requires 5 and 7 zzso of zzso DNA, suggesting that zzso zzso involves a zzso zzso zzso The site specificity of zzso zzso was examined in zzso zzso and shown to be specific for a zzso target, zzso zzso of numerous zzso events at the target site in zzso indicated that zzso is also orientation zzso The frequency of zzso zzso at the zzso target site zzso zzso zzso determined by quantitative zzso is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than the frequency of zzso precise zzso from the same zzso zzso of zzso sites for zzso and the highly related zzso from zzso zzso suggests DNA sequence and/or structural features that may contribute to site recognition and zzso by the zzso of zzso
