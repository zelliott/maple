In this study, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are described that identify a novel bovine cell surface marker of zzso zzso The zzso reacted with a discrete population of resting zzso in peripheral blood which, in young animals, constituted about zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained less than zzso positive zzso These cells were negative for surface zzso a zzso marker, and the T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in the outer zzso of zzso zzso in the marginal zones of the zzso in the zzso and zzso layers of the skin and in the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso cells in zzso blood zzso cells responded in zzso and zzso mixed zzso cultures, and when zzso they responded to zzso A in the presence of zzso zzso zzso These observations suggested this population of cells belonged to the T cell zzso In order to zzso define their zzso zzso clones zzso bovine T cell zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso Northern zzso analyses of zzso cell populations and of established cell lines of various lineages demonstrated that they expressed zzso delta and zzso zzso delta and zzso zzso zzso alpha was not zzso whereas only a truncated form of zzso beta zzso was zzso These results indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso define a unique population of zzso zzso T zzso
