The zzso brain tumor zzso gene is considered to be one of the tumor zzso genes of zzso and its zzso zzso are associated with zzso transformation of the zzso in the zzso zzso The structure of zzso protein is similar to zzso sex comb on zzso zzso protein which is a member of zzso group zzso zzso We have isolated here the first human zzso of the zzso zzso designated zzso zzso hybrid mapping and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis localized the zzso gene to zzso zzso The zzso transcript is expressed in most of the human adult normal zzso and cultured cell zzso However, some cancer cells markedly reduce the zzso protein zzso zzso study revealed that the zzso protein shows a speckled and scattered distribution in zzso zzso and completely associates with condensed zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso has been shown to be different from that of zzso protein which is a component of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso protein by using a zzso gene zzso system leads to failures of proper zzso segregation and zzso which result in formation of zzso in zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso protein has functions distinct from those of zzso proteins and may play a role in proper progression of cell zzso
