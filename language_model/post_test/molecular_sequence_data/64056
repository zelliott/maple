zzso zzso may play a role in host colonization of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity suggests that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso activated by zzso and is present in the zzso and possibly associated with the inner leaflet of the zzso A zzso open reading frame zzso identified from overlapping zzso zzso clones showed zzso zzso identity and 51% zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is expressed as a zzso zzso transcript and is present as a single copy in zzso zzso This gene sequence was modified to account for zzso zzso and expression in zzso coli produced a zzso zzso which compares well with the product predicted from the zzso This zzso is a strong candidate for contributing the zzso activity of zzso zzso protein zzso
