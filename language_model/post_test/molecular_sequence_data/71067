zzso is one of the two integral inner membrane proteins of the zzso transport zzso To identify functional regions in this zzso we characterized a collection of zzso zzso obtained by random zzso We analyzed their growth on zzso and zzso the zzso levels and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Only 2 of the 21 zzso zzso proteins allowed growth on zzso and zzso Most zzso resulting in zzso proteins mapped to zzso zzso indicating that insertions affecting zzso segments gave rise to unstable or lethal zzso All zzso zzso zzso even those zzso truncated or with large zzso zzso were inserted into the zzso zzso Having identified zzso leading to reduced zzso level, to partial zzso and/or to zzso we were able to assign to some regions of zzso a role in the assembly of the zzso complex and/or in the transport zzso
