Cell surface carbohydrates present on zzso human embryonic stem cells after 28 days of differentiation were examined using two classes of zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was verified using zzso zzso to block zzso interaction, zzso to cleave specific sugar zzso that are receptors for these zzso and zzso zzso to destroy susceptible sugar zzso zzso zzso were used to identify various tissue types and germ layers present in the 12- and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 12 and zzso differentiated zzso bodies were compared to determine changes over zzso A slight increase in the zzso of zzso was seen between 12 and 28 days of differentiation due to the presence of zzso zzso and/or other zzso zzso zzso zzso were also observed in zzso the T zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso during this time zzso Additionally, some distinct differences in the pattern of zzso zzso between 12 and 28 days were zzso Not unexpectedly, the presence of most differentiated zzso increased during this time period with the exception of neural zzso which zzso zzso cells, which were prevalent in the zzso zzso were zzso after 28 zzso We conclude that several changes in zzso occurred during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, and that these changes may play a role in embryonic zzso
