zzso zzso zzso bacteria have been recognized as an important sink for fixed nitrogen and are detected in many natural zzso However, their presence in zzso zzso has long been zzso and their contribution to the nitrogen cycling in natural and agricultural zzso is currently zzso Here we describe the enrichment and characterization of zzso bacteria from a zzso zzso zzso After 8 months of incubation with the natural surface water of the sampling site and increasing ammonium and zzso zzso zzso cells constituted 40 to 50% of the enrichment zzso The two dominant zzso zzso were affiliated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The enrichment culture converted zzso and zzso to zzso with the previously reported zzso zzso and had a maximum specific zzso ammonium zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso The diagnostic zzso lipids were detected at a concentration of 650 zzso zzso zzso and zzso was the most abundant zzso zzso
