zzso zzso is a brackish zzso member of the zzso zzso complex that is distributed along the coast of West Africa and is a major malaria zzso within its zzso Because little is known about the population structure of this species, we zzso 15 zzso markers and zzso zzso of zzso in 11 zzso zzso populations collected throughout its zzso Compared with its sibling species zzso zzso zzso zzso populations have a high level of genetic differentiation between them, representing its zzso distribution due to its fragmented zzso habitat that is associated with zzso and salt zzso zzso zzso clustered into three distinct groups representing Western Africa, Southern Africa and zzso Island populations that appear to be mostly zzso zzso differences in the zzso are present between all three zzso and a zzso zzso analysis of the zzso data found no evidence for migration from mainland to zzso Island zzso and little migration was evident between the Southern to the Western zzso Surprisingly, zzso divergence between the three zzso zzso clusters is on par with levels of divergence between other species of the zzso zzso complex, and no support for zzso was observed in a zzso zzso zzso Finally, an approximate zzso analysis of zzso data indicates that zzso Island zzso zzso populations were connected to the mainland populations in the past, but became isolated, presumably when sea levels rose after the last zzso period zzso zzso zzso zzso This study has exposed zzso genetic divergence within zzso zzso and also has implications for control of this malaria zzso
