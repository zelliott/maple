In this paper we report data regarding the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by analysis of: 1) its zzso zzso zzso 2) the frequency of its expression on human zzso zzso and zzso molecules from normal and pathological zzso Furthermore, comparison of zzso repertoire and nature of binding of human zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso was performed to confirm the natural zzso properties of these zzso zzso isolated from zzso of patient DJ zzso zzso which expresses the zzso zzso has been classified to zzso zzso From ten zzso tested only zzso from patient zzso zzso zzso has been shown to express zzso zzso zzso human zzso bound to zzso zzso acid bacteria, mouse zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso Higher percentage of the expression of zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of patients suffering from zzso diseases such as zzso zzso arthritis and psoriasis zzso as well as in patients suffering from chronic infections of the lower urinary zzso zzso binding repertoire and properties of zzso zzso zzso frequency of zzso expression on zzso zzso and its concentration in normal and pathological zzso indicate the important biological role of this zzso within the immune zzso
