A new ice nucleation gene from zzso zzso was isolated and zzso as a fully active protein in zzso coli in order to gain experimental data about the structure of ice nucleation zzso No evidence of a signal sequence or secondary zzso was zzso zzso in the extent of zzso were shown to zzso the ice nucleation zzso The circular zzso spectrum of the zzso protein indicated the presence of zzso zzso This finding supports a recently proposed hypothetical model for the structure of ice nucleation zzso which provides a plausible explanation for their zzso zzso
