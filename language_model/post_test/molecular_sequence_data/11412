zzso of the zzso zzso is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso C mediates its effects via zzso of serum response factor zzso which interacts with the serum response element zzso zzso and calcium mediate their effects via zzso of zzso zzso regulatory element binding zzso presumably by zzso of a protein zzso A or zzso zzso We have examined the function of these elements in zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso as well as a T zzso cell line zzso We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on zzso zzso However, zzso C zzso zzso zzso combined with either zzso zzso plus zzso or calcium stimulation zzso leads to greatly enhanced zzso zzso By contrast, zzso in the presence of calcium shows no zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso and has little or no effect when combined with zzso The main difference between Ramos (B zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso is that zzso plus calcium is strongly synergistic in zzso and is without effect in zzso Analysis of zzso activity using gel mobility shift zzso confirms that the requirements for zzso in zzso zzso induction are paralleled by requirements for zzso in induction of zzso zzso Signaling in B cells due to zzso stimulation involves both zzso C zzso and release of zzso zzso and results in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso between the zzso C zzso and calcium is needed for efficient zzso induction since neither of these two alone zzso zzso zzso That zzso of signaling pathways is relevant for the zzso induction of zzso is supported by the fact that zzso agents and zzso acid further enhance zzso induction of zzso These results suggest that zzso patterns of zzso are an essential feature for zzso induction and may be relevant for zzso control through B and T cell zzso zzso
