Monitoring the emergence of drug-resistant influenza zzso is crucial in influenza surveillance zzso 

zzso A zzso and the emergence of drug-resistant strains in hospitalized patients treated with zzso were zzso 

zzso samples from zzso and zzso hospitalized patients in the period November 2011 through April 2012 were zzso zzso gene was zzso in samples from zzso treated zzso zzso analysis of the viral population was performed in patients unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso was determined in 24 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso patients treated and 24 (10 zzso and 14 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso shedding was significantly reduced in treated vs zzso zzso patients (7 vs 22 days, zzso zzso zzso load decreased significantly in zzso and zzso treated patients as compared with zzso and zzso zzso patients zzso and zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso zzso In two zzso treated patients with prolonged virus zzso the zzso resistance zzso zzso was zzso In these patients, zzso analysis of the virus population showed the presence of additional zzso zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso 

zzso resistance is reported for the first time in zzso virus strains during the zzso influenza zzso Different drug-resistant viruses emerged in hospitalized zzso patients showing prolonged virus zzso
