A zzso clone for a zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was a member of the zzso zzso which includes mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed as early as in late zzso and the transcript was evident in a zzso region at the vegetal end or the vegetal zzso In early zzso the gene was expressed in the cells of the zzso zzso from which the majority of zzso cells as well as some zzso cells are zzso The zzso expression disappeared by the end of zzso and was not detected in early zzso zzso This expression pattern of zzso suggests its role in an early step of zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, double zzso of late zzso and early zzso with a probe specific for zzso and one for zzso (the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the regions of zzso and zzso expression at the zzso end of the zzso did not zzso the region with zzso expression being zzso by a zzso region of zzso zzso A gap without expression of the two genes was located between them, and the gap was seen around the zzso lip in the early zzso These observations suggest implication of the two zzso zzso with different roles, in zzso zzso
