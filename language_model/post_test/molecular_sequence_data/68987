The division cycle of zzso cells is regulated by a family of protein zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso The sequential zzso of individual members of this family and their zzso zzso of critical zzso promotes orderly progression through the cell zzso The complexes formed by zzso and the zzso zzso have been strongly implicated in the control of cell proliferation during the zzso zzso zzso exists, in part, as a zzso complex with a zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associates separately with a protein of zzso zzso particularly in cells lacking a functional zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a human zzso complementary DNA and demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso and zzso the zzso activity of the zzso D zzso zzso seems to act in a regulatory feedback circuit with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
