A fatty zzso with a reaction mechanism similar to that of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso has been zzso from culture zzso of a zzso zzso zzso containing the cloned zzso zzso structural zzso Typically, more than 35 zzso of protein were isolated from 2 L of culture zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and molecular weight of the zzso protein corresponded to predictions based on the sequence of the zzso indicating that the signal sequence had been correctly removed during export but that no further processing had zzso Analysis of the zzso circular zzso zzso spectrum of the zzso showed that it consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso protein with a variety of zzso resulted in zzso near the zzso This led to an increase in zzso activity against lipids in zzso zzso and increased rate of zzso of zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a change in the CD spectrum and a change in its zzso zzso The zzso cut site was located between the two zzso in the zzso Evidence is presented that the zzso are joined by a zzso bond and therefore cannot participate in zzso zzso This may distinguish the microbial zzso from zzso zzso This is the second zzso zzso zzso protein that we have shown can be activated by zzso after it is zzso
