To understand the zzso of zzso zzso disease requires an appreciation of how the T zzso inflammation is targeted, and how the organ function is zzso In this study, zzso was documented to influence both of these parameters by modulating the distribution of T zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso disease is induced by zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso transferred or actively induced zzso to zzso bound to the zzso zzso in the functional and degenerative zzso zzso and the zzso remained zzso zzso Transfer of zzso zzso T cells targeted the degenerative zzso and spared the functional zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso the coexistence of zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso led to a dramatic zzso of the zzso inflammation to the growing and mature zzso zzso with destruction of the zzso functional zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso inflammation and zzso zzso zzso and zzso was induced by zzso and rat zzso zzso to multiple distinct native B cell zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by reacting with the native zzso in tissue zzso zzso alters the distribution of T zzso zzso and results in destruction of the functional units of the target zzso We propose that this is a clinically important and previously unappreciated element of zzso action in zzso zzso
