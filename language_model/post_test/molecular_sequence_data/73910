In this report, we demonstrate for zzso T cell clones that single zzso acid modifications of the zzso zzso can result in not only zzso zzso or zzso but also increased, T cell responsiveness zzso zzso We further studied the effects of combinations of multiple zzso with different effects in single zzso zzso with peptides carrying multiple zzso acid exchanges revealed that the final outcome of zzso zzso by a given zzso is the integration of negative, neutral, and positive effects of each single zzso In addition, the introduction of zzso zzso together with zzso modifications of primary and secondary zzso contacts resulted in zzso zzso These findings indicate that: 1) the specificity of a single zzso is highly zzso 2) zzso exist for zzso T cells that have higher zzso activity than the zzso zzso 3) the rules to search for zzso zzso in zzso should take into account that zzso acids at certain positions within an zzso zzso may exert zzso activity and compensate for the negative effects of zzso at other positions that would otherwise not be zzso
