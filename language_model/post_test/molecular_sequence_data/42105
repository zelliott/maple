A method has been developed for counting active sites of zzso protein zzso Known zzso of a synthetic zzso similar to a zzso of the zzso inhibitor of the zzso were included in otherwise routine zzso mixes containing several different volumes of zzso stock zzso The concentration of active sites of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso in the stock solution was then determined by fitting observed zzso to an equation that accounts for the presence of a zzso zzso The method yielded estimates of zzso zzso concentration comparable with those derived from more traditional measures of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso samples were zzso since zzso counting assumes only a mutually specific, zzso interaction between zzso and inhibitor and does not require that samples be zzso In principle, the method can be adapted to other protein zzso for which a specific, zzso zzso inhibitor is zzso
