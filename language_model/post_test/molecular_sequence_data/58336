As an initial approach to define the regulatory elements and zzso factors that account for zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we isolated and characterized the zzso gene and identified regions of the gene zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the rat zzso gene was isolated from a zzso zzso The zzso sequence contained the uninterrupted sequence of the zzso region of a previously isolated zzso zzso clone indicating the lack of zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso protection zzso and/or zzso zzso analysis indicated the expression of zzso zzso in rat brain but not in kidney or liver, which is consistent with the major expression of this gene in zzso zzso The zzso gene segment was used to identify sites of zzso initiation and promoter activity by zzso protection zzso and transient zzso of reporter gene zzso With the use of zzso zzso progressively upstream of the zzso start site, zzso protection zzso with rat brain total zzso indicated multiple sites of zzso initiation within a approximately zzso span zzso to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso start zzso The zone of zzso initiation was part of a larger zzso area of the zzso gene segment that is a characteristic of genes initiating transcripts at multiple zzso The promoter activity of this zone of zzso initiation and the influence of gene segments zzso to this area were addressed using zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso of reporter gene zzso indicated that a zzso gene zzso zzso relative to the zzso start zzso was sufficient to direct zzso in the zzso X zzso hybrid cell line zzso a cell line expressing the zzso zzso zzso activity was not observed in zzso lacking the zone of zzso zzso The promoter segment was inactive when introduced into the rat zzso cell line zzso the rat zzso cell line zzso and the rat pancreatic beta cell line zzso all of which do not express the zzso zzso zzso Upon incubation with nuclear zzso a zzso zzso encompassing the promoter exhibited a gel mobility shift pattern that was specific for cells expressing the zzso protein and involved a nuclear protein that recognized a zzso zzso These data indicate that a zzso gene promoter segment of the zzso gene functions in a zzso zzso
