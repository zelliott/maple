Three zzso zzso were raised against three distinct zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso characterized by Western zzso zzso and used to determine the distribution of zzso protein in adult rat zzso The three zzso all yielded similar zzso data, leading to increased reliability of the results zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected exclusively in zzso zzso was localized primarily to zzso structures with prominent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected primarily in scattered zzso near the lateral zzso area and the zzso zzso High zzso of zzso zzso fibers were present in zzso regions of the zzso and zzso zzso scattered zzso positive fibers were observed in the cerebral cortex, the zzso formation, and the zzso zzso Moreover, very high zzso of zzso fibers were detected in the zzso zzso with the overall zzso pattern of zzso associated closely with hormone responsive zzso High zzso of zzso positive terminals were also associated with zzso zzso However, zzso studies revealed clearly that zzso zzso was not localized within the zzso cells or zzso In contrast, nearly all of the zzso zzso zzso cells, and most fibers in the zzso and zzso also expressed zzso The overall pattern of expression and zzso with zzso suggests that zzso by regulating the zzso turnover of zzso may zzso zzso zzso and other behaviors through diverse zzso zzso
