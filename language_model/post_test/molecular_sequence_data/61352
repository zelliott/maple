zzso exerts its zzso effects by binding to its zzso and zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso and other cell zzso To identify the components of the zzso signal zzso pathway, an approach was developed in which zzso expressed zzso fragments of zzso zzso b zzso were used as affinity zzso zzso binding to the zzso form of the zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of the zzso domain of its zzso Two of the three zzso zzso of zzso at positions zzso and zzso are zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso of zzso was used to identify proteins that bind to this zzso The zzso domain containing protein zzso zzso 2 zzso was isolated from bovine and mouse zzso by using this zzso After zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso into zzso cells, zzso results in direct binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The bound zzso is itself zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso is not zzso after zzso treatment when a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso In the absence of zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso are not affected by zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso results in a decreased zzso of zzso and may act to zzso zzso signal zzso The method used in this report can in principle be used to isolate additional components of the zzso or other, signal zzso zzso
