The zzso gene of zzso zzso has an uninterrupted open reading frame, predicted from the zzso sequence to zzso a protein of 522 zzso acid zzso Nevertheless, an zzso is present, and functional activity of the gene in zzso cells requires an zzso processing event to remove the zzso This results in a change in reading frame and production of a protein of 463 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso activity of proteins derived from the zzso zzso open reading frame, the zzso open reading frame, and several zzso was zzso The zzso included a series of deletions constructed by removing restriction fragments at the 3' end of the cloned zzso gene and a set of zzso zzso previously isolated in screens for radiation zzso All of these proteins were zzso in zzso coli as zzso zzso zzso that were subsequently zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that elimination of the zzso third of the protein did not result in a serious reduction in zzso zzso activity, but deletion into the midsection caused a severe loss of zzso The biological activity of the zzso zzso which encodes a truncated zzso with full zzso zzso activity, and the zzso zzso which encodes a more severely truncated zzso with no zzso activity, was zzso The two zzso were equally sensitive to the lethal effect of zzso light, but the spontaneous zzso rate was elevated zzso over the zzso rate in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The elevated spontaneous zzso rate correlated with the zzso of zzso activity, but the radiation sensitivity did zzso These results indicate that the zzso portion of the zzso protein is not essential for zzso activity but is crucial in the role of zzso in DNA damage zzso
