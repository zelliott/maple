The impact of transient viral load zzso on zzso immune responses and on zzso rebound following treatment interruption zzso is not zzso Clinical and zzso parameters were measured during 40 weeks of zzso therapy zzso and following zzso in an zzso cohort of 16 chronically zzso subjects with or without observed viral load zzso during zzso During therapy, zzso in seven subjects were associated with higher zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso responses zzso zzso zzso without a significant difference in T cell zzso or total zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso responses when compared to nine matched zzso zzso interruption resulted in a significantly higher viral rebound in zzso by 8 week despite retention of higher zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso and a rise in zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cell responses in zzso by week 4 when compared to zzso Past week 4 of zzso therapy zzso criteria were also met by a higher frequency in zzso by week 14 zzso zzso zzso with no difference between groups by week zzso These data support that zzso have higher zzso zzso responses while on ART but experience equal to higher viral rebound as compared to matched zzso upon zzso
