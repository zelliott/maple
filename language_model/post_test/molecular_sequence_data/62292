The zzso skeleton lacks ribs and pelvic zzso and has fused bones in the zzso and zzso It has been hypothesized that this zzso simplified zzso zzso is due to reduced complexity of the zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we determined the zzso structure of zzso clusters in the Southern zzso zzso zzso and interrogated zzso databases for the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso Both species have at least seven zzso zzso including two copies of zzso and zzso zzso a single zzso zzso and at least two zzso zzso with a portion of a third zzso cluster in zzso zzso support zzso zzso before divergence of zzso and zzso zzso followed by loss of a zzso cluster in the zzso lineage and loss of a zzso cluster in the zzso zzso Comparative analysis shows that duplicate genes continued to be lost for hundreds of millions of years, contrary to predictions for the permanent preservation of gene zzso Gene expression analysis in zzso zzso by in zzso zzso revealed evolutionary change in gene expression as predicted by the zzso zzso These experiments rule out the hypothesis that the simplified zzso body plan is due to reduction in zzso cluster complexity, and support the notion that zzso zzso contributed to the radiation of zzso into half of all zzso species by increasing zzso diversification of duplicate genes in daughter zzso
