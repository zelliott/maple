zzso zzso delta genes are located in the midst of the zzso alpha gene zzso In the chicken, one large V delta gene family, two D delta gene zzso two J delta gene zzso and one C delta gene have been zzso The zzso delta genes were deleted on both zzso in alpha beta T cell lines, thereby indicating conservation of the combined zzso alpha delta locus in zzso V alpha and V delta gene segments were found to rearrange with one, both or neither of the D delta segments and either of the two J delta zzso zzso activity, zzso and zzso during zzso delta zzso contributed to zzso delta repertoire diversification in the first embryonic wave of T zzso An unbiased V delta 1 repertoire was observed at all ages, but an acquired J delta 1 usage bias occurred in the zzso delta zzso The unrestricted zzso diversity of relatively complex zzso gamma and delta zzso may contribute to the remarkable abundance of gamma delta T cells in this avian zzso
