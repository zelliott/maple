zzso is a widely used zzso zzso Its action on zzso zzso channels in skeletal muscle is not well documented and we have here zzso its effects on zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso currents in zzso skeletal muscle zzso were recorded using zzso and zzso zzso clamp techniques zzso Action zzso were generated using current zzso 

Under zzso zzso clamp conditions, the zzso for zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso For zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced peak zzso by approximately zzso but outward zzso values were reduced by approximately zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and fast zzso were zzso shifted towards zzso zzso ( approximately 10 zzso at 25 zzso zzso zzso were markedly flattened by zzso zzso under maintained zzso was reduced to approximately zzso of control values by 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso time zzso were increased at least zzso Lower zzso (10 or 25 zzso reduced zzso slightly but zzso zzso Action potential generation threshold was increased by 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso acts zzso on zzso and zzso channels in skeletal zzso This suggests at least multiple sites of action including the zzso zzso Our data may provide a first insight into specific mechanisms of zzso channel interaction in zzso other than cardiac muscle and could suggest possible zzso that need to be further zzso
