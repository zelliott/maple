The zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a small, zzso protein that appears to play a role in zzso its transcript rapidly accumulates in response to high-intensity light zzso and the zzso gene family is required for survival of cells in high zzso In order to discover regulatory factors involved in zzso zzso in zzso a screen was performed for chemically generated zzso unable to properly control expression of the zzso gene in response to zzso One such zzso was identified, and zzso analysis led to the identification of the affected zzso designated zzso Based on its deduced protein zzso zzso appears to be a zzso zzso sensor zzso zzso of zzso regulatory systems in zzso The zzso zzso was unable to properly control light zzso expression of several other zzso zzso including all three zzso genes and the zzso zzso The zzso was also unable to control expression of the zzso and zzso genes in response to zzso zzso light, a response that may be related to the zzso regulation of the zzso Additionally, in response to zzso zzso the zzso zzso was unable to properly control zzso of the zzso transcript and associated degradation of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso dies more rapidly than zzso cells following exposure to zzso or zzso zzso likely due to its inability to properly zzso to these stress zzso Thus, the zzso protein is involved in the control of a number of processes critical for altering the zzso apparatus in response to both zzso and zzso stress zzso
