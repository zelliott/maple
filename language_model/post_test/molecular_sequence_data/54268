We investigate the genetic structure of European lineages of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and nuclear zzso and demonstrate the presence of ten cryptic zzso Within the zzso zzso species complex there are six different white pigmentation patterns but only three of these are unique for a single zzso No other consistent zzso differences were zzso We give new species names to seven of the lineages from our study, providing examples of combined zzso and molecular diagnoses, apply the available name zzso zzso to one species, and leave two lineages with single representatives zzso We also include new data and a diagnosis for the poorly known zzso zzso which also belongs to the zzso zzso species zzso
