zzso in zzso cause zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso a common genetic disease in which zzso form from kidney zzso The predicted product of this gene is a novel protein with zzso and zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso the product of the zzso zzso is a cell zzso zzso we raised zzso against peptides derived from the zzso zzso portion of the predicted zzso acid zzso These zzso recognized zzso zzso of zzso and 245 zzso in human fetal kidney zzso zzso was greater in fetal than adult kidney by both Western zzso analysis and zzso In fetal zzso zzso was localized to the plasma zzso of zzso bud and zzso and zzso zzso However, in more mature zzso in fetal zzso in adult zzso and in zzso zzso the majority of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso and spatial regulation of zzso expression during zzso development lead us to speculate that zzso may play a role in zzso
