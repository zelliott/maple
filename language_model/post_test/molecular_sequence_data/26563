Plant zzso zzso resemble animal and zzso zzso but the machinery and processes that zzso nuclear organization in these zzso lineages appear to be zzso zzso Among the candidates for nuclear architectural elements in plants are zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using genetic and zzso approaches, we dissect the function of the four zzso family proteins in zzso zzso by the zzso zzso which were originally named zzso zzso zzso 

zzso proteins are essential for viability as evidenced by the inability to recover zzso that have disruptions in all four zzso zzso zzso deficient in different combinations of the four zzso zzso exhibit altered nuclear organization, including reduced nuclear size, zzso nuclear shape and abnormal spatial organization of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate functional diversification among zzso zzso zzso plays the zzso role in control of nuclear size and shape followed by zzso Proper zzso organization is most sensitive to the zzso of zzso The reduction in nuclear volume in zzso zzso in the absence of a commensurate reduction in zzso levels leads to an increase in average nuclear DNA zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso proteins are important architectural components of plant zzso that play diverse roles in both zzso organization and the control of nuclear zzso
