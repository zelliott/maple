zzso infection of the chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso is known to zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of which is tightly governed by the zzso zzso zzso and calcium second zzso system in a zzso zzso We cloned the gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso C zzso to investigate the regulation of zzso expression and to better characterize zzso gene regulation by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene indicated that the protein product contained both the X and Y zzso which are the two zzso regions found in all known zzso with a 133 zzso acid extension between the 2nd zzso and the zzso in the X zzso In addition, the gene organization appeared to be highly similar to that of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in slow growth and produced colonies characterized by little aerial zzso and deep orange in zzso zzso reduced zzso of the zzso zzso as compared to the zzso was observed, which can be ascribed to the growth zzso However, other zzso characteristics including temperature sensitivity and zzso did not differ from the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed no zzso of the zzso gene transcript due to the disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso gene from zzso zzso restored zzso zzso which suggests that the cloned gene encodes zzso zzso The present study indicates that the zzso gene is required for normal zzso growth rate and colony zzso and that it regulates the zzso zzso which is also modulated by the zzso Although several zzso genes have been identified in various simple zzso organisms, the deletion analysis of the zzso gene in this study appears to be the first report on the functional analysis of zzso in zzso zzso
