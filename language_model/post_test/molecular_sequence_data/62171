zzso proteins zzso are a structurally diverse group of proteins that have the ability to modify ice crystal structure and inhibit zzso of zzso zzso are well characterized in fish and insects, but very few bacterial species have been shown to have zzso activity to zzso Thirty eight freshwater to zzso lakes in the zzso Hills and zzso Hills of Eastern zzso were sampled for zzso during zzso Eight hundred and sixty six bacterial zzso were zzso A novel zzso zzso designed for zzso analysis in zzso demonstrated putative activity in zzso of the zzso zzso analysis of the putative positive zzso showed 19 zzso with significant zzso zzso zzso zzso The 19 zzso active zzso were characterized using zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso and zzso zzso zzso They belong to zzso from the zzso and zzso with zzso from the zzso being zzso The 19 zzso zzso were isolated from four zzso diverse zzso Ace Lake and Oval Lake were both zzso with zzso characteristic chemically zzso water zzso zzso Lake was a saline zzso lake with different chemical properties to the two zzso zzso Triple Lake was a zzso lake rich in dissolved organic carbon and zzso zzso The environments from which the zzso zzso were isolated are remarkably zzso It will be of interest, therefore, to zzso the evolutionary forces that have led to the acquisition of functional zzso activity in microbes of the zzso Hills lakes and to discover the role the zzso play in these zzso
