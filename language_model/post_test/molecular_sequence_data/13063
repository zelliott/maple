zzso zzso growth factor zzso added zzso to cells has been proposed to enter the nucleus and stimulate DNA zzso but it has remained controversial whether or not zzso zzso has the capability of crossing cellular zzso To test this, a novel principle to study zzso of proteins to the zzso was developed by fusing a zzso zzso zzso a zzso tag zzso zzso zzso A zzso an zzso zzso acid, and X zzso any zzso zzso onto zzso zzso is only known to occur in the zzso and possibly in the zzso When incubated with zzso cells overnight, about one-third of the zzso zzso growth factor was zzso indicating that efficient zzso had taken zzso zzso to specific zzso receptors was required for zzso to zzso Part of the zzso growth factor was found in the nuclear zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso added zzso to cells is able to cross cellular zzso and enter the zzso and the zzso
