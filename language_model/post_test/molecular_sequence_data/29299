The zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso both viral zzso and zzso zzso although only the zzso viral zzso zzso is packaged into zzso To define the domain within the zzso virus zzso N protein that mediates these zzso 14 zzso and zzso deletion zzso were cloned into a bacterial expression zzso zzso and zzso to zzso Each protein was examined for its ability to bind the zzso S segment zzso with filter binding and gel zzso mobility shift zzso These studies mapped a minimal region within the zzso N protein zzso acids 175 to zzso that bound zzso zzso alignments made from several zzso N protein sequences showed that the region identified has a zzso identity and an zzso similarity among these zzso acid zzso Two peptides corresponding to zzso acids 175 to 196 zzso and 197 to 218 zzso were zzso The zzso binding of each zzso was measured by filter binding and competition zzso Three zzso were used to measure binding affinity and assess zzso The zzso zzso contained the major zzso binding zzso while the zzso zzso when mixed with zzso contributed to the specificity of zzso zzso
