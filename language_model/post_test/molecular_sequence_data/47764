zzso zzso fragments zzso were generated from two zzso zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso region of zzso B virus, respectively, using different assembly cloning zzso The zzso fragments were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso were in the zzso range for all forms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of both zzso were mapped using solid phase zzso synthesis on continuous cellulose zzso and turned out to be linear zzso The minimal zzso for the zzso zzso zzso was identified to be zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso For the zzso zzso MA zzso the minimal zzso proved to be the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso Complete zzso analyses as well as zzso experiments revealed key zzso for these zzso zzso On the basis of those results we used zzso modeling techniques to suggest models for both zzso interactions providing insight into the structural basis of these molecular zzso
