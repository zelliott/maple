The zzso zzso zzso anchors of zzso proteins contain linear zzso zzso zzso sequences that bear additional zzso zzso and in some cases include a fourth Man and a zzso or zzso zzso zzso of these zzso structures are zzso in the zzso zzso by sequential zzso of zzso zzso In previous studies zzso zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a series of putative zzso of this assembly process were isolated from human zzso cells and zzso zzso and several of the more polar products were found to contain a second zzso attached to the Man zzso zzso 1) zzso to zzso In this study, the most polar zzso cell zzso species was zzso by normal phase zzso cell zzso species was zzso by normal phase zzso high performance liquid zzso and its zzso was zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso analyses of fragments produced by nitrous acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso in conjunction with zzso labeling studies indicated a structure containing a third zzso zzso linked to the zzso of Man zzso The polar zzso product exhibited a zzso core lacking additional Man or zzso The implications of the identification of this zzso zzso species to zzso zzso anchor zzso are zzso
