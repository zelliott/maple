zzso regulate proliferation and differentiation of cells in target zzso such as the female zzso zzso In mature mice, zzso stimulate cell zzso whereas zzso results in zzso of the female zzso zzso In contrast, zzso exposure to zzso including zzso zzso zzso persistent, zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors later in zzso These effects are due to altered cell fate following zzso exposure during a critical zzso zzso The detailed mechanisms underlying the zzso and irreversible cell proliferation in zzso induced by zzso at different ages has not been zzso zzso we examined differences in gene expression pattern using DNA zzso analysis in mouse zzso 6 zzso after a single injection of 2 mug zzso per gram of body weight, and proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso cells 24 zzso after the injection at zzso days zzso 0, 5, 20, and zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells showed cell proliferation at zzso 20 and 70, and at zzso 0 and 5, zzso DNA zzso analysis exhibited 54 zzso genes and 9 zzso genes in zzso at zzso 0, whereas more than 200 zzso genes were found in zzso at zzso 5 and 20, and 350 genes at zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes in the zzso at different ages revealed that genes induced by zzso at zzso 5 were closer to the adult type than that of zzso zzso Genes related to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso were induced by zzso The number of zzso genes during the critical period, zzso 0, was smaller than those found after the critical zzso These results give insight toward understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the critical period in mouse zzso
