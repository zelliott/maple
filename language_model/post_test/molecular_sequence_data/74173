We studied the differences in gene sequence of zzso I gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso 

We cloned zzso and its full-length zzso from zzso zzso zzso by the modified zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso 

The total length of zzso was 1500 zzso It contained 2 zzso and zzso 453 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso The upstream sequence zzso zzso of zzso gene was also cloned and zzso It contained two putative binding sites for the carbon zzso zzso zzso I and two putative binding sites for zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso 

The zzso strain zzso was a multiple zzso of the wild strain zzso The zzso produced several times more zzso activity per zzso of culture medium when compared with zzso The zzso gene sequence of the zzso was the same with the wild zzso While four single base zzso were detected on the upstream sequences zzso zzso of zzso zzso result suggests that the evidently enhanced zzso activity of the zzso is not due to zzso zzso sequence zzso The true reason maybe refer to single base zzso of the upstream sequence that effect the zzso regulation of zzso zzso As a result, the zzso of zzso I zzso
