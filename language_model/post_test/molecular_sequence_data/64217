We zzso nearly the entire zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso or zzso zzso 4 zzso from 29 species of flies representing all major zzso within zzso or higher flies, and several zzso zzso zzso We compared these sequences with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso to assess structure, compositional bias, and zzso zzso zzso is large zzso zzso complex zzso of three major and myriad minor functional zzso and relatively free of zzso extreme zzso bias (except third zzso zzso and large zzso zzso The zzso domain possesses moderate levels of zzso divergence among zzso of intermediate evolutionary age and conveys considerable zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences under varying methods and assumptions resulted in zzso strongly supported trees zzso with many traditional ideas about higher zzso zzso and with prior zzso from zzso zzso The most robustly supported major zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusive of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is zzso apparently single copy (at least within zzso zzso readily obtained from several insect orders using zzso described zzso and exhibits considerable zzso utility, it should have wide zzso in insect molecular zzso
