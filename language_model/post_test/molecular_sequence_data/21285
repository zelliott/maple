Animals can act as a zzso and source for the emergence of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso clones in human zzso Here, we report the discovery of a strain of S zzso zzso isolated from bulk milk that was zzso resistant to zzso but tested negative for the zzso gene and a preliminary investigation of the extent to which such strains are present in bovine and human zzso 

zzso of bovine zzso were obtained from the Veterinary zzso Agency in the zzso and zzso of human zzso were obtained from diagnostic or reference laboratories zzso in the UK and one in zzso From these collections, we searched for zzso zzso bovine and human S zzso zzso showing zzso zzso zzso We used zzso sequencing to establish the genetic basis for the observed zzso zzso 

A divergent zzso zzso zzso was discovered in the zzso zzso located in a novel zzso cassette zzso zzso element, designated zzso zzso The zzso was zzso identical to S zzso zzso zzso and was initially detected in 15 S zzso zzso from dairy cattle in zzso These zzso were from three different zzso sequence type lineages zzso zzso and zzso spa type zzso zzso with zzso was identified in zzso of bovine zzso When human zzso zzso zzso were tested, the zzso zzso was identified in 12 of 16 zzso from Scotland, 15 of 26 from England, and 24 of 32 from zzso As in cows, zzso was the most common spa type detected in human zzso 

Although routine culture and zzso zzso testing will identify S zzso zzso with this novel zzso zzso as zzso zzso present zzso methods will not identify them as zzso New diagnostic guidelines for the detection of zzso should consider the inclusion of tests for zzso
