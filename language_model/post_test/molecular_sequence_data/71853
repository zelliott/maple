The zzso zzso zzso zzso in two zzso After zzso step I, a major zzso of the zzso occurs to establish the active site for step zzso Here, we report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso the human zzso of the zzso second step zzso factor zzso We show that zzso associates with the zzso late in the zzso pathway, but at a stage prior to recognition of the 3' zzso site for step zzso In the absence of zzso zzso is stalled between the zzso steps in a novel complex, the zzso zzso We provide evidence that this complex differs significantly in structure from the known zzso complexes, yet is a functional intermediate between the zzso steps of zzso Together, our observations indicate that zzso is required for a structural zzso of the zzso prior to the establishment of the zzso active zzso for step zzso
