We have recently cloned the human zzso for a zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein zzso identical to the bovine zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso for the zzso zzso zzso We now present data on the cloning and structural analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and confirm its preferential expression in zzso zzso The predicted zzso and human zzso proteins are almost zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are different genes and that they are probably members of a related family of zzso zzso studies with the human zzso protein demonstrate that zzso has zzso activity against the zzso and zzso I zzso but binds to these proteins with a significantly weaker affinity than does the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso which will in subsequent communications be zzso as zzso might be a zzso for other known or as yet unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could have other zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso transcripts are detected in zzso cells, where the earliest zzso precursors are zzso When these precursors undergo proliferation and differentiation in zzso a dramatic increase in zzso expression is zzso zzso probably has a significant function during the growth and development of zzso zzso
