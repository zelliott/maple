zzso of von zzso factor zzso with circulating zzso promotes zzso when a blood vessel is zzso The A1 domain of zzso is responsible for the initial interaction with zzso and is well zzso among zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso DNA sequences for human zzso allowed us to predict the zzso sequence for zzso zzso in zzso and amplify its entire coding region by zzso The zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso identity to human zzso The same strategy was used to predict in zzso the zzso sequence for the zzso of zzso in a further six zzso Many of these predictions zzso substantially from the putative zzso zzso derived by zzso zzso zzso Our predicted sequences indicated that the zzso gene has a zzso structure of 52 zzso in all seven zzso species zzso as well as in the zzso There is a minor structural variation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso gene in this species has 53 zzso zzso of the translated zzso acid sequences also revealed a high degree of zzso In particular, the zzso zzso are zzso precisely throughout both the zzso and the mature zzso sequence in all species, with a minor exception in the zzso zzso zzso where two adjacent zzso zzso are zzso The marked conservation of zzso zzso emphasizes the importance of the intricate pattern of zzso bonds in governing the structure of zzso and regulating the function of the mature zzso zzso It should also be emphasized that many of the zzso features of the zzso gene and protein were obscured when the comparison among species was based on the putative zzso zzso instead of our predicted zzso zzso
