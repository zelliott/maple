We have recently diagnosed a patient with zzso severe zzso and diabetes zzso As the clinical characteristics resembled zzso zzso syndrome, despite the absence of malfunctioning of the zzso zzso in this patient, we have performed DNA analysis to seek for deletions in zzso DNA analysis showed a novel zzso deletion in zzso of zzso in zzso with high proportions of deleted zzso in zzso liver, zzso and zzso No deletion could be detected in zzso of zzso from her mother and young brother, indicating the sporadic occurrence of this zzso During culture, skin zzso exhibited a rapid decrease of zzso indicating a selection against the deletion in zzso zzso We estimate that per cell division zzso levels decrease by zzso By techniques of fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso transformation of zzso cells we could show zzso as well as zzso variation in the distribution of deleted zzso in a cell population of cultured skin zzso Furthermore, we studied the zzso translation capacity in zzso cells containing various proportions of deleted zzso This result revealed a sharp zzso around zzso in the proportion of deleted zzso above which there was strong depression of overall zzso translation, and below which there was zzso of the deleted zzso by the zzso zzso Moreover, catastrophic loss of zzso occurred in zzso cells containing zzso deleted zzso
