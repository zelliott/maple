We examined the genetic structure and zzso relationships of some Chinese populations from the Chang zzso zzso drainage of the zzso zzso zzso We zzso the complete zzso zzso b gene of 64 individuals from 6 upper and middle tributaries of the zzso and zzso zzso to assess their population structure and zzso The combined analyses of the zzso information and the population structure suggested that Chinese zzso zzso consist of four distinct zzso lineages which exhibit high genetic variation and zzso diversity zzso zzso The high molecular divergence observed among zzso zzso zzso lineages zzso zzso distance, mean zzso and their zzso structure indicate that all four lineages have evolved zzso Analysis of molecular zzso zzso indicates that most of the genetic variation observed is found among the four zzso zzso lineages zzso zzso zzso suggesting restricted gene flow among the Chang zzso zzso zzso interruption of gene flow was also evidenced by zzso values higher than zzso that could be zzso by the zzso zzso of the lineages inhabiting upper zzso zzso and middle zzso zzso Chang zzso zzso The significant correlation between the geographic and genetic distances provide support for the importance of geographic zzso in shaping the zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso results were zzso with zzso relationships recovered and confirm the genetic distinctiveness of four independent zzso zzso These four groups zzso to the four zzso zzso zzso lineages recovered in the zzso and were defined by zzso zzso permitting zzso and zzso confidence of zzso or zzso The high level of zzso sequence divergence separating all zzso zzso lineages suggested that the zzso zzso populations from the Chang zzso drainage probably zzso to four different zzso
