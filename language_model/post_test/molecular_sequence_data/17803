The effects of zzso protein zzso on the dynamic surface tension lowering and resistance to zzso of zzso of calf lung zzso extract zzso and zzso of synthetic zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso were studied at 37 degrees C and rapid cycling rate (20 zzso zzso of zzso to zzso which already contains zzso and zzso gave a slight improvement in the time course of surface tension lowering on an zzso bubble apparatus in the absence of zzso protein molecules such as zzso or zzso However, when these proteins were present at zzso of zzso zzso zzso substantially improved the resistance of zzso to their zzso zzso The beneficial effect of zzso required the presence of zzso zzso and disappeared when zzso was zzso for this zzso zzso in the zzso The effect was also retained when zzso was heated to 50 degrees C prior to addition to zzso but was abolished by heating zzso to 99 degrees zzso Additional studies showed that similar improvements in resistance to zzso were found when zzso was added to synthetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso containing only zzso The requirements for zzso and calcium for the beneficial effects of zzso on surface activity suggest that the formation of ordered, larger zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso The finding that zzso enhances the ability of zzso and other zzso zzso containing zzso to resist zzso is an advantage that will need to be weighed against other factors such as increased zzso and heat sensitivity in therapeutic applications in zzso replacement zzso
