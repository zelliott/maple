zzso zzso are approximately zzso zzso some of which have been shown to play important zzso roles during plant zzso We developed comparative zzso approaches to systematically identify both zzso and their targets that are zzso in zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso zzso candidates, representing seven newly identified gene families, were zzso validated in zzso bringing the total number of reported zzso genes to 92, representing 22 zzso zzso newly identified target candidates were confirmed by detecting zzso fragments diagnostic of zzso zzso in zzso Overall, plant zzso have a strong propensity to target genes controlling development, particularly those of zzso factors and zzso zzso However, plant zzso have zzso regulatory functions extending beyond development, in that they also target zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso the zzso zzso increases upon zzso zzso showing that zzso can be induced by environmental zzso
