The zzso complex plays a central role in the DNA repair pathways of zzso cells and takes part in many other zzso including cell cycle checkpoint zzso zzso DNA replication and zzso zzso This complex is formed by the interaction of the products of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This paper reports the molecular zzso expression and interactions of the zzso gene in several wheat species with different levels of zzso The zzso zzso wheat genes were found to show a high level of zzso Most of the zzso zzso and motifs previously described in other species were also present in wheat zzso these proteins are therefore likely to have similar zzso zzso between the zzso wheat proteins and their zzso counterparts in the zzso complex were zzso The level of expression of zzso in each of the species examined was determined and compared with those previously reported for the zzso zzso In some cases similar levels of expression were seen, as zzso The expression of the zzso zzso genes was assessed in two zzso wheat species using quantitative zzso In both cases, an zzso of the zzso gene was zzso Although the results indicate the maintenance of function of these zzso three zzso zzso zzso the biased expression of zzso might indicate ongoing zzso of one or both other zzso in zzso zzso To assess the consequences of such zzso on the formation of the zzso complex, the interactions between individual zzso of zzso and their zzso counterpart zzso genes were zzso The results indicate the zzso of zzso specificity in the interactions between these zzso This would guarantee the formation of an zzso complex in zzso
