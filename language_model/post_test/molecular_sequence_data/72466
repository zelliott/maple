With the view of investigating the metabolism of zzso a plasma zzso zzso in an animal model of inflammatory syndrome, we isolated zzso from pig zzso A high yield was obtained zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by affinity zzso on zzso In contrast to bovine zzso was highly similar to human zzso its heavy chains are zzso to the human zzso and zzso heavy zzso as shown by zzso and zzso properties, zzso and zzso zzso Pig may therefore represent a good animal model to study zzso metabolism and zzso its zzso zzso
