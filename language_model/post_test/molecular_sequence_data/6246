We have reviewed a large zzso of zzso zzso delivery systems for protein and zzso zzso These systems include monolithic type devices in which the drug is dispersed throughout the zzso and zzso zzso where the drug is zzso bound to the zzso These delivery systems have unique challenges associated with their development that are related to both protein stability and protein release zzso Despite numerous reports in the scientific literature which include many encouraging results in zzso models, very few of these systems have been developed into viable zzso The products that have made it to market, however, have proven to be very successful and demonstrate the significant advantages that these systems can zzso The continuous advances in biotechnology will produce more proteins and peptides that will be difficult to administer by conventional means, and an increased demand for controlled or zzso delivery systems is zzso
