zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a well-developed genetic zzso Its zzso nature offers a simple system in which to perform zzso using bacterial and zzso zzso Although zzso systems in zzso are generally more similar to those in zzso than those in bacteria, the order zzso has a unique complement of DNA replication zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso proteins and no obvious zzso zzso A search for zzso of zzso and repair proteins in zzso zzso has revealed a mixture of zzso zzso and some zzso zzso Some repair pathways appear to be completely zzso but it is possible that zzso proteins could carry out these zzso The zzso zzso and repair systems in zzso zzso are an interesting mixture of zzso and bacterial zzso and could provide a system for uncovering novel interactions between proteins from different zzso of zzso
