Our understanding of zzso diversity is based predominantly on zzso studies of community zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso have historically been used for the assessment of microbial diversity without adequate regard to the degree of specificity of primer pairs to different zzso zzso In a reassessment of the published zzso commonly used for zzso and zzso 16 S zzso sequence amplification we note that substantial variations in specificity zzso An zzso choice of zzso may therefore lead to significant bias in determination of microbial community zzso In particular, zzso primer sequences typically lack specificity for the zzso and zzso and are often biased towards certain zzso New primer pairs specifically designed for zzso zzso 16 S zzso sequence amplification, with zzso to all four zzso groups, have been zzso Here we present the application of these new zzso for preparation of 16 S libraries from zzso zzso
