A sequence of zzso cell zzso allocation to four principal zzso zzso zzso and cell loss occurs along the zzso axis of the mouse zzso The sequence is completed in a few days and is zzso throughout the zzso of the zzso We have used an zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso zzso as a model for studying regulation of gene expression in this unique zzso zzso zzso mapping studies in transgenic mice identified a zzso zzso element zzso that binds small zzso nuclear proteins and zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso patterns of zzso zzso studies using zzso and electron zzso indicate that it does so by acting as a zzso of gene expression in the zzso small zzso as a zzso of gene zzso in zzso and zzso cells located in the zzso of zzso and as a zzso of expression in the growth factor and zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso domain has no obvious sequence similarities to known zzso factor binding zzso The three functions modulated by this compact element represent the types of functions required to establish and maintain the zzso remarkably complex spatial patterns of gene zzso The zzso described in this report also appear to be useful in characterizing the zzso stem cell zzso
