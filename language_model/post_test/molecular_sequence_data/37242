The seven zzso zzso in zzso coli each contain two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most previous studies have focused on the zzso zzso zzso Here we report a systematic analysis of the activity and regulation of the zzso zzso promoter in order to define the intrinsic properties of zzso zzso promoters and to understand better their contributions to zzso synthesis when they are in their natural setting downstream of zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the conclusions reached in some previous studies, we find that zzso zzso is zzso it displays clear responses to zzso acid availability zzso zzso zzso gene dose zzso zzso and changes in growth rate zzso zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso but growth zzso control of zzso zzso does not require zzso The zzso zzso core promoter sequence zzso to zzso is sufficient to serve as the target for growth zzso zzso
