During acute zzso zzso release zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso but the zzso mechanisms and consequences of this process are not yet fully zzso zzso the zzso zzso type, produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso but not the tissue zzso of zzso After zzso these cells also activate zzso zzso In zzso diseases, zzso undergo great zzso to the zzso are activated by zzso and are zzso to release zzso B in zzso zzso levels and net activities of zzso B were found to be absent in degenerative zzso but significantly increased in zzso zzso The zzso sites in cartilage type II collagen by zzso B were determined by a combination of reverse phase zzso liquid zzso zzso degradation, and mass zzso zzso The analysis revealed the site specificity of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso by zzso B, and the preferential absence and presence of zzso modifications at zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso B leaves the zzso peptides intact, which are known from studies with zzso T zzso zzso zzso was detected at a critical position for zzso zzso These data lend support to the thesis that zzso zzso and other zzso modifications of zzso peptides may be critical in the establishment and perpetuation of zzso zzso
