The zzso gene encodes a zzso master regulator involved in the development of the zzso The quail zzso gene is expressed in the zzso from two zzso zzso and zzso zzso being activated at the onset of zzso zzso In this paper we have identified two regions in the quail zzso gene zzso zzso zzso located 6 and zzso zzso upstream from the zzso promoter that, like the previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function as zzso enhancers whose activity is restricted to the zzso zzso Moreover, the activity of these zzso enhancers in embryonic zzso cells is weaker at day 5 than at day 7, like the zzso zzso and parallels the level of expression of zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso factors bind to these zzso zzso zzso In addition we show that these quail zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso promoter, are structurally and functionally zzso in zzso These results strongly suggest that these zzso elements may contribute to the zzso zzso regulation of the zzso gene in zzso Thus the complex regulation of the quail zzso gene is also zzso in zzso
