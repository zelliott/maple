zzso zzso D zzso zzso is the key zzso for the production of the D and J series of zzso and the first recognized zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We isolated the genes and zzso for human and mouse zzso The human and mouse zzso contained a coding region corresponding to 199 zzso zzso with calculated molecular masses of 23 zzso and 23 zzso zzso Both zzso proteins zzso expressed in zzso coli showed zzso activities for zzso and zzso and had almost the same zzso properties as the rat zzso Northern analyses demonstrated that the zzso genes were expressed in a highly zzso zzso Whereas the human gene was widely distributed, in contrast, the mouse gene was detected only in samples from zzso and zzso By zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the human and mouse zzso genes were mapped to zzso and zzso zzso The human and mouse zzso genes spanned approximately 41 and 28 zzso respectively, and consisted of six zzso divided by five zzso The zzso boundaries of both genes were completely identical to those of the zzso zzso zzso although the zzso sequences of the latter were only zzso identical to those of either zzso These findings suggest that the zzso genes evolved from the same ancestral gene as the members of the zzso zzso zzso
