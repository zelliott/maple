zzso zzso zzso is, together with zzso 70 and zzso the major zzso agent involved in acute zzso conjunctivitis outbreaks zzso However, the standard virus isolation method followed by zzso or zzso region sequencing is zzso A rapid method for the detection of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso specimens would be useful in the context of explosive and extensive zzso A zzso real-time zzso zzso based on zzso technology was thus developed and assessed on 36 zzso zzso from outbreaks of conjunctivitis in Morocco in 2004 due to a zzso zzso zzso and in zzso in 2006 due to zzso type 3, and 83 virus strains including 41 zzso zzso zzso collected in French zzso and zzso in 2003, in the Democratic Republic of the zzso in 2003, in Morocco in 2004 and 42 other virus species genetically close or known to be responsible for zzso All the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso related outbreak and the 41 zzso zzso zzso strains were tested positive by the zzso zzso within zzso This novel zzso real-time zzso zzso is sensitive and specific, and consists in a reliable and faster alternative to the viral culture for recent and future acute zzso conjunctivitis outbreaks caused by zzso zzso zzso
