zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are the site of a zzso zzso As part of a differential display screen for rhythmic gene products in this system, we have identified a zzso zzso expressed in peak abundance at zzso zzso cloning revealed an open reading frame zzso a putative 388 zzso acid protein that we have named zzso (for zzso This protein has strong sequence similarity to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso factor, zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels exhibit a high zzso zzso rhythm and nuclear zzso analysis indicates that it is controlled by the retinal zzso clock at the level of zzso Our observations suggest that zzso may function through zzso interaction either as a component of the zzso clock or as a downstream zzso of clock zzso
