In zzso zzso zzso is light zzso A key factor in this process is zzso zzso zzso which requires light to catalyze the reduction of zzso to zzso It is believed that this protein originated from an ancient zzso zzso that was introduced into zzso cells during the primary zzso Here we report that zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso function in zzso First, we found that the zzso zzso zzso shows a higher affinity to its zzso zzso than the zzso zzso but a similar affinity to plant zzso zzso the reduced size of zzso bodies caused by a zzso zzso of one of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso could be zzso by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso lines, however, was retained at a low level as in the parent zzso zzso zzso indicating that the observed formation of zzso bodies was irrelevant to the assembly of zzso zzso This work reveals a new view on the formation of zzso bodies and provides new clues about the function of zzso in the zzso zzso
