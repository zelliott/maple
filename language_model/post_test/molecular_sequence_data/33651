The zzso zzso located at the reported zzso locus zzso on zzso zzso was zzso to be associated with zzso zzso This study investigated the association of zzso with high zzso in zzso high zzso patients and zzso zzso 

High zzso patients had zzso errors of zzso zzso or greater and zzso length longer than 26 zzso Control subjects had zzso errors less than zzso zzso and zzso length shorter than 24 zzso The zzso promoter, all coding zzso and adjacent zzso regions of the zzso gene were screened in all study subjects by zzso chain reaction and direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with variable zzso and AG repeat lengths were prepared and zzso into human zzso cells prior to zzso for their zzso zzso 

No sequence zzso in the coding or zzso regions showed an association with high zzso Two zzso repeats, zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter region were found to be highly zzso and significantly associated with high zzso Higher repeat numbers were observed in high zzso patients for both zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increased risk associated with the zzso repeat zzso p zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso analysis showed elevated zzso activity with increasing individual zzso and zzso and combined zzso repeat zzso 

Our results revealed an association between high zzso and zzso and AG zzso repeat lengths in the zzso zzso promoter, indicating the involvement of zzso in the zzso of high zzso
