The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso It exhibits close to 50% zzso with several recently cloned zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor and the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso exists in an zzso zzso form of 47 zzso and a zzso zzso form of about 60 zzso The zzso gene does not have a signal zzso which might explain why the major portion of zzso remains zzso Several response elements have been identified in the promoter region which are necessary for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid induced expression of the zzso These include two zzso sites, and response elements for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso has not been clearly zzso It may have zzso functions and appears to play a role in programmed cell zzso
