The DNA in dormant spores of zzso zzso as well as other zzso species is extremely well protected against damage resulting from treatments such as zzso heat, zzso agents, and zzso and gamma zzso This high degree of DNA protection is a major factor in the survival of spores of these species, not only when subjected to the treatments noted above, but also when incubated under common environmental conditions for many zzso zzso that play major roles in overall spore resistance include the low zzso of spores to toxic chemicals and the decreased zzso water zzso However, although decreased spore zzso and water content appear to at least partially protect spore DNA from zzso damage, these factors seem to play little or no role in protecting spore DNA from heat zzso The major factor preventing damage to spore DNA is the zzso of this DNA with a novel group of small, zzso proteins of the zzso whose binding greatly alters zzso chemical and zzso zzso as well as its zzso zzso zzso of these proteins is also a key factor in spore DNA resistance to zzso heat, zzso agents, and zzso zzso
