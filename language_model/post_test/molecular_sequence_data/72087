We studied membrane binding and zzso function of six zzso forms of human steroid zzso zzso a zzso zzso from a patient with zzso adrenal zzso four artificial deletions in the zzso terminal region zzso and del zzso the first and second zzso segment, zzso the region in between, zzso the combination of zzso and one naturally zzso zzso in a region implicated to be critical for membrane integration zzso zzso function was zzso after transient expression in zzso cells, and membrane binding was studied by coupled in zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso retained some zzso activity but showed severely reduced membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had abolished zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not affect membrane zzso zzso zzso had slightly reduced binding with a qualitative difference suggested by the absence of a zzso form of the zzso and zzso had abolished membrane zzso No significant differences could be identified for the zzso zzso These data support that zzso spans the membrane through its first zzso domain only, and that the protein lacking this segment retains sufficiently normal structure to enable zzso They also confirm that zzso is responsible for the severe zzso of the patient in which it was found, and indicate that the common zzso zzso does not have a major effect on zzso zzso
