G zzso receptors zzso share a common architecture consisting of seven zzso zzso zzso Various lines of evidence suggest that this fold provides a generic binding pocket within the TM region for hosting zzso antagonists, and zzso zzso zzso an automated method was developed that allows a fast analysis and comparison of these generic zzso binding pockets across the entire zzso family by providing the relevant information for all zzso in the same zzso This methodology compiles zzso acids lining the TM binding pocket including parts of the zzso loop in a so-called zzso zzso binding pocket zzso and translates these zzso zzso in a second step into zzso zzso zzso zzso It aims to support various aspects of zzso drug discovery in the pharmaceutical zzso zzso of zzso similarity analysis of these zzso zzso include definition of zzso zzso prediction of species differences within zzso in regard to in zzso pharmacology and identification of nearest neighbors for zzso of interest to generate starting points for zzso lead identification zzso These aspects of zzso research are exemplified in the field of zzso trace zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, it is demonstrated how zzso zzso models of the zzso can support the prediction of zzso acids involved in zzso recognition, the understanding of zzso data in a zzso context and the zzso of binding modes for zzso zzso and their zzso Furthermore, guidance through zzso zzso zzso modeling for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso will be zzso zzso examples are taken from the zzso family class C, zzso zzso receptors 1 and 5 and sweet taste zzso and from the zzso class A, zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso
