A zzso named zzso zzso small exported proteins zzso across zzso species has been zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso contain a predicted signal zzso at the zzso an internal zzso region and a zzso zzso region at the zzso One member of the zzso zzso family, zzso encodes an integral membrane protein expressed along the entire zzso zzso zzso results indicated that zzso is targeted to the membrane of the zzso zzso up to the early zzso of zzso while, in late zzso it zzso in structures within the zzso After zzso zzso zzso is still zzso in free zzso thus suggesting its involvement in the early steps of zzso zzso Seven members of the zzso in zzso zzso have been zzso Two of them zzso to previously reported gene sequences included in a family of early transcribed membrane proteins zzso zzso functional and zzso features of the zzso family, shown in the present work, zzso this previous zzso zzso proteins are exported beyond the zzso membrane and zzso early after invasion, to the host cell compartment in association with zzso zzso zzso results indicated that zzso zzso zzso at the stage of zzso with that of zzso a protein associated with zzso zzso zzso structures in the zzso of zzso red blood cells, most probably involved in trafficking of zzso zzso The specific signals necessary to direct zzso proteins to the zzso membrane in zzso zzso or to the host cell compartment in zzso zzso remain to be zzso
