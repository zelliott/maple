Although many individuals with zzso develop zzso against zzso little is currently known of the structural features, V gene zzso and degree of zzso zzso of these zzso Such information is critical to any meaningful understanding of the nature and significance of this zzso immune response to zzso We have constructed zzso display libraries from six individuals with zzso cancer and a zzso serum immune response against zzso Following panning with zzso zzso a total of 43 binding zzso were zzso Four of these zzso bound with high affinity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10-8 - zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso analysis, and were highly specific for both zzso and cell zzso zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso mapping showed they were zzso with the N zzso of human zzso between zzso 27 and zzso zzso analysis showed that the heavy chains were derived from the zzso gene family, and the light chains from zzso The pattern of replacement and silent zzso in the zzso sequence indicated that negative selection had occurred in the framework regions of all the zzso zzso We show that zzso from individuals with cancer represent a valuable source of high affinity human zzso against zzso This approach provides an opportunity to examine the genetic structure of these naturally occurring zzso and to draw zzso regarding the nature of the immune response that produced zzso zzso identified in this way have a number of potential therapeutic zzso
