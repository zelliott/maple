The zzso River is an extreme environment located at the core of the zzso zzso Belt zzso It is an unusual zzso due to its size zzso zzso zzso constant zzso pH zzso zzso zzso and high concentration of heavy metals, iron, and zzso in its waters, characteristics that make the zzso River zzso comparable to zzso mine drainage zzso zzso In this paper we present an extensive survey of the zzso River zzso zzso using two zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and cloning of zzso zzso zzso The zzso affiliation of the zzso showed a high degree of zzso falling into 5 different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso meanwhile, all the zzso were affiliated with the order zzso zzso involved in the iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sulfur zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycles were identified, and their distribution was correlated with zzso parameters of the zzso zzso iron was the main electron zzso for the zzso of organic matter in the most acid and zzso zzso so zzso zzso zzso bacteria appeared widely in the clone zzso With increasing zzso the zzso of iron decreases and zzso bacteria become dominant, with the ecological role of zzso being zzso Considering the identified zzso according to the zzso zzso and zzso coverage values, cover almost all of the zzso their corresponding zzso we suggest a model of the iron, zzso and organic matter cycles in zzso zzso
