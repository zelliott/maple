zzso protein zzso zzso pathways are zzso zzso that mediate diverse cellular processes and have been highly zzso among zzso By using a functional zzso screen in zzso we have identified a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that shares zzso with members of the mixed lineage zzso zzso family and therefore was called zzso zzso zzso We report the structure of the zzso zzso from which are generated two zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for proteins of 800 and 456 zzso zzso zzso By using a combination of solid phase protein zzso zzso transient zzso in cells, and analysis of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso canine kidney cells, we found that zzso zzso activates zzso via zzso and zzso through zzso We also show that expression of wild type zzso increases the cell population in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, whereas dominant negative zzso zzso the zzso arrest caused by zzso In addition, exposure of cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may mediate zzso signaling leading to cell cycle arrest and that zzso activity is necessary for the cell cycle checkpoint regulation in zzso
