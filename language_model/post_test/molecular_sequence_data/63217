zzso zzso sensors of zzso concentration are based on zzso between zzso and yellow fluorescent proteins zzso a bacterial zzso zzso Such sensors have yet to find quantitative applications in zzso because of poor response zzso in zzso buffers or when expressed on the zzso cell zzso We have improved our zzso fluorescent reporter zzso by systematic zzso of zzso sequences and zzso zzso Using zzso which exhibits a zzso increase in response magnitude over the original zzso we demonstrate quantitative optical zzso of the time course of synaptic zzso release, zzso and zzso in cultured zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso spatial zzso During burst zzso functionally significant zzso persists for hundreds of zzso These zzso levels appear sufficient to prime zzso zzso potentially affecting zzso spike initiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggests a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
