Cotton is the world's primary fiber crop and is a major agricultural commodity in over 30 zzso Like many other global commodities, sustainable cotton production is challenged by restricted natural zzso In response to the anticipated increase of agricultural water demand, a major research direction involves developing crops that use less water or that use water more zzso In this study, our objective was to identify zzso expressed genes in response to water deficit stress in zzso A global expression analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted to compare root and leaf gene expression profiles from a putative drought resistant cotton zzso grown under water deficit stressed and well watered field zzso 

We identified a total of zzso zzso expressed transcript derived zzso Of these, 147 transcript derived zzso sequences were functionally zzso according to their gene zzso Nearly 70 percent of transcript derived fragments belonged to four major zzso 1) zzso 2) zzso 3) zzso and 4) gene zzso We found heat shock zzso and zzso oxygen zzso transcript derived fragments to be among the major parts of functional pathways induced by water deficit zzso Also, twelve novel transcripts were identified as both water deficit responsive and cotton zzso A subset of zzso expressed transcript derived fragments was verified using reverse zzso chain zzso zzso expression analysis also identified five pairs of duplicated transcript derived fragments in which four pairs responded zzso between each of their two zzso under water deficit zzso 

In this study, we detected zzso expressed transcript derived fragments from water deficit stressed root and leaf zzso in zzso cotton and provided their gene zzso zzso distribution, and possible roles of gene zzso This discovery demonstrates complex mechanisms involved with zzso zzso zzso response to naturally occurring field water deficit zzso The genes identified in this study will provide candidate targets to manipulate the water use characteristics of cotton at the molecular zzso
