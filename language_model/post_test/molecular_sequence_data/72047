Higher plants have two complexes that bind the zzso structure of zzso and mediate interactions between zzso and zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso Both complexes contain a small zzso that binds the zzso structure of zzso and a large zzso zzso or zzso that binds other translation factors and zzso zzso zzso were used to cleave native zzso complexes into structural zzso which were zzso by affinity zzso We show here that zzso contains a central zzso domain that binds specifically to zzso zzso This domain spans zzso to zzso and includes four of the six zzso blocks shared by zzso and zzso A slightly shorter overlapping zzso from zzso to zzso had no zzso acid binding activity, indicating that the zzso end of the zzso acid binding site lies within zzso to zzso The binding of the central domain and native zzso to zzso zzso and double- and zzso zzso was zzso Both molecules had highest affinity for zzso and recognized zzso and zzso zzso
