The structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was determined by X-ray zzso analysis at zzso A resolution, and its stability was examined by zzso This is the first report of the X-ray structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone, although the structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso has already been zzso The structure of zzso was essentially similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso complex from zzso zzso The sequence alignment with secondary structures of zzso and zzso in zzso form showed that six zzso in the zzso region and three zzso in the zzso region were deleted in zzso and one zzso at zzso of zzso and at zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso temperature of zzso was higher by 35 degrees C than the reported values from zzso at approximately pH zzso On the basis of structural information on both zzso the analyses of the contributions of each stabilization factor indicate that: zzso the higher stability of zzso is not caused by either a zzso interaction or an increase in zzso zzso zzso the number of hydrogen bonds involved in the main chains of zzso is greater by about zzso than that of zzso indicating that the secondary structures of zzso are more stabilized than those of zzso and zzso the sequence of zzso seems to be better fitted to an zzso stable structure than that of zzso as assessed from X-ray structure zzso
