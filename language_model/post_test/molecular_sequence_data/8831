zzso finger genes zzso proteins that act as zzso zzso The zzso zinc finger 1 zzso gene encodes a zinc finger protein with two zzso zzso that recognize two distinct consensus zzso is zzso expressed in zzso cells, and may be involved in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of human peripheral blood zzso cells cultured under zzso conditions demonstrated zzso expression during both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of the zzso and zzso zzso which are a marker of and a zzso factor required for zzso proliferation and zzso respectively, revealed closely spaced zzso consensus binding sites found by zzso mobility shift zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression in different cell types resulted in specific zzso of zzso zzso activity driven by the zzso or zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso by zzso activity plays a role in zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso under the control of different promoters were zzso into zzso embryonic stem cells which, under defined in zzso culture conditions, generate colonies of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso with the ability of embryonic stem cells to undergo zzso commitment and zzso colony formation and prevented the induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso during differentiation of these zzso These data indicate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso by modulating the expression of genes involved in this zzso
