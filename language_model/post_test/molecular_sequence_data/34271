zzso the mechanisms underlying biological phenomena, such as zzso conservative trait zzso is predicated on knowledge of the natural relationships among zzso However, despite their enormous ecological significance, many of the ubiquitous soil inhabiting and plant symbiotic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are incorrectly zzso 

Here, we focused on a frequently used model zzso registered as culture zzso This fungus is a zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which in 1983 was zzso with zzso zzso It has since then been used as zzso zzso zzso We show by zzso zzso based on type material, collected zzso of zzso zzso and on type material and living zzso cultures of zzso zzso that these two zzso species cannot be zzso and by molecular zzso that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso 

This study highlights that experimental works published during the last zzso years on an zzso named zzso zzso or zzso refer to zzso zzso a species that is actually zzso separated by hundreds of millions of years from all members of the zzso in the zzso and thus from most other commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substantiate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso positioning it systematically in the order zzso thus enabling an evolutionary understanding of zzso zzso and ecological traits, relative to those of other zzso zzso zzso is widely cultured as a laboratory strain of zzso whereas zzso zzso appears not to have been cultured nor found in the field since its original zzso
