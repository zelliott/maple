The zzso family of zzso zzso is composed of two members in zzso zzso and zzso Both have been shown to bind to zzso factors and function as zzso zzso in specific cell and promoter zzso We have previously defined a novel repression domain localized to the zzso of each zzso family member, the zzso repression zzso which is necessary for zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel zzso of zzso lacking the zzso repression zzso In contrast to full-length zzso this zzso is expressed predominately in the embryonic and adult zzso It can bind zzso zzso but is unable to repress zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso repressive activity may be modulated by the generation of zzso of zzso lacking the zzso repression zzso
