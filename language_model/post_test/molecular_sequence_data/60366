The zzso family of zzso zzso present on human zzso and zzso cells, are used as receptors for zzso expressed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso can express 11 zzso of these zzso called zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso protein recognizes a distinct spectrum of zzso zzso zzso binding is zzso by the zzso domain of the zzso and occurs through zzso zzso In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis for the binding between the zzso and zzso protein families by mapping zzso acids in zzso receptors that determine zzso protein zzso We performed zzso scanning zzso between zzso which binds multiple zzso zzso and zzso which binds none, and tested both zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso in solution zzso and in zzso involving full-length receptors expressed by zzso zzso We found that three zzso in the zzso zzso are required for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso proteins that recognize the same spectrum of native zzso molecules showed differential binding of receptors with zzso activity, indicating that the binding characteristics of these zzso proteins are actually slightly zzso These data provide a first step toward resolving the structural requirements for zzso zzso
