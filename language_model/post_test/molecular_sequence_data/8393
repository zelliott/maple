The pharmacological and zzso properties of zzso zzso channels are dependent on their zzso zzso spontaneously occurring changes in zzso composition during zzso development may result in dramatic functional differences between embryonic and adult forms of the zzso zzso In the present study, in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the zzso composition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the developing inferior zzso zzso This zzso is thought to be a zzso zzso channel comprised of selected zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the majority of which have several zzso alpha zzso beta zzso gamma zzso and zzso zzso Among the 13 zzso zzso present in the zzso central nervous system, alpha 2-5, beta 3, and gamma zzso zzso are expressed at significant levels in the inferior zzso zzso Two clearly different zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression were zzso The expression of alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 3, and gamma 2 zzso was at a peak during embryonic and early zzso development followed by rapid zzso zzso zzso alpha 2, alpha 4, and gamma 1 zzso expression was very low or absent during early development, and a pronounced increase was observed at the end of zzso week zzso These studies suggest that there are zzso changes in the zzso composition of the zzso zzso in inferior zzso zzso These changes in zzso zzso which occur during a period of major zzso in zzso and zzso synaptic connections, may zzso a change in the role of zzso from its function as a zzso factor to that of an zzso zzso
