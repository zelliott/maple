Multiple sclerosis is zzso by an zzso process causing selective destruction of zzso zzso which is expressed in the brain selectively in zzso is a target of high affinity zzso in serum and zzso fluid of multiple sclerosis zzso A three-dimensional model of human zzso was developed based on the crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso 33 peptides overlapping human zzso by 5 zzso acids were zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso active human zzso recognized zzso zzso corresponding to linear zzso zzso zzso and zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso Four zzso peptides harboring charged zzso acid zzso with zzso exposed side chains were identified by zzso from 13 multiple sclerosis patients with predetermined zzso to zzso zzso binding to the most prominent human zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso with zzso and zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso mimicry between zzso zzso and viral zzso may be a decisive factor in directing zzso to zzso in multiple sclerosis zzso
