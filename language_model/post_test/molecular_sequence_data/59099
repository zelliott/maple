zzso zinc finger protein genes zzso zzso zzso proteins involved in the regulation of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc finger protein 1) is one member of a small family of zzso zinc zzso sequences previously characterized from zzso The zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso zzso has been zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso is a unique, zzso gene which encodes a zzso zzso zzso highly expressed in roots and zzso A construct in which zzso zzso of zzso upstream sequences is linked to the zzso gene was introduced into zzso by zzso transformation of zzso zzso analysis of transgenic zzso carrying the zzso promoter: zzso fusion shows good correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso This transgenic line will be a useful tool for analyzing the regulation of zzso to further our understanding of its zzso
