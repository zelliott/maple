zzso zzso is currently based on the administration of zzso extracts containing natural zzso However, its broad application is limited by the poor quality of these zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccines for zzso zzso can be zzso Furthermore, they can be modified to reduce their zzso activity and to avoid zzso side zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso of two grass zzso zzso zzso derivatives could be increased by engineering them as a single hybrid zzso We used a zzso zzso p 2 mosaic, generated by fragmentation of the zzso p 2 sequence and zzso of the resulting peptides in an altered order, and a truncated zzso p 6 zzso to produce a hybrid zzso The hybrid retained the reduction of zzso zzso and zzso activity of its components as shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the hybrid zzso demonstrated the increased zzso of this zzso leading to higher levels of zzso zzso zzso compared to the single zzso These zzso could inhibit patients' zzso binding to the zzso zzso Thus, the described strategy allows the development of safer and more zzso vaccines for the treatment of grass zzso zzso
