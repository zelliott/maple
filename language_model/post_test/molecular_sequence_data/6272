zzso c is an integral part of the zzso respiratory zzso It is confined to the zzso space of zzso and has the function of transferring electrons between its zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso c indicate that the zzso of the zzso is sensitive to the zzso strength of the zzso 

The crystal structures of zzso c from several species have been solved at extremely high zzso strengths of zzso solutions of ammonium zzso Here we present the first crystal structure of zzso c at low zzso strength refined at zzso A zzso In general, the structure has the same features as those determined zzso However, there are some differences in both backbone and zzso zzso in several zzso These areas coincide with those observed by zzso and resonance zzso zzso to be sensitive to zzso zzso 

Neither zzso strength nor zzso interactions have much influence on the zzso of horse zzso zzso Nevertheless, some differences in the zzso zzso at high and low zzso strengths may be important for understanding how the protein zzso Close examination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso c leads us to propose the zzso zzso zzso to describe this unusual zzso
