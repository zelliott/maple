zzso zzso zzso zzso is predominantly zzso by a family of zzso whose zzso activity depends on their interaction with a zzso complex composed of zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report that a segment of 50 zzso of zzso bridges the zzso zzso domain to zzso The crystal structure of zzso in zzso complex with zzso and zzso reveals that both proteins binds zzso zzso located on opposite sides of zzso zzso zzso zzso engages in several hydrogen bonds and van der zzso contacts within a zzso zzso formed by the junction of two zzso on zzso zzso analyses of both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveal that the interactions between zzso and zzso are important for the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso Overall, this study provides the structural basis underlying the formation of the zzso zzso and further highlight the crucial role of zzso in scaffolding the zzso core zzso
