The three-dimensional structure of the zzso 20 zzso portion of zzso which consists of the zzso binding region and the zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso is an zzso family protein that zzso supports the zzso of zzso zzso through recruitment of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso This 20 zzso zzso construct contains the minimal sequential region required to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure consists of six zzso where the first three are unique to zzso and believed to be important in the zzso zzso of zzso The last three zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The first zzso zzso 1, which contains a zzso zzso motif believed to be necessary for zzso zzso is transient and not packed against the rest of the zzso zzso 1 is joined to zzso 2 by a flexible zzso zzso 2 packs loosely against the zzso surface, whereas zzso 3 packs tightly and makes critical contributions to the zzso zzso A long insert loop, also unique to the zzso zzso is seen between zzso 4 and zzso zzso zzso with a previously reported structure of zzso containing only zzso 3-6 shows a significant difference in the zzso zzso segment of the zzso The region where zzso 1 is located zzso to the expected region of the zzso zzso domain seen in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the location of zzso 1 differs from the zzso binding regions of two other zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and viral large T zzso The variety of biological functions performed by zzso proteins such as zzso as well as the observed differences in the structure and function of their zzso binding regions, supports the notion that zzso proteins act as zzso zzso that recruit their more general zzso partners to specific biological zzso
