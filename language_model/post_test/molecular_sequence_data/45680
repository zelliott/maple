zzso zzso zzso use two zzso to convert zzso to their zzso zzso Here we report the X-ray structure of one of these zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso chain of the zzso folds into a zzso zzso domain and a smaller zzso domain, and the zzso packs as a zzso in the zzso The zzso domain binds zzso zzso and the zzso product, zzso in a fashion similar to the common binding mode of this zzso in zzso zzso There is a zzso site in the vicinity of the SAM site with a bound zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expected zzso binding site near the zzso zzso is occupied by zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The geometry of the SAM and the zzso binding sites is similar to that found in zzso zzso The results suggest zzso is a zzso and its most likely function is to zzso the transfer of a zzso group from SAM to the zzso zzso in the second zzso reaction of zzso zzso Based on the zzso of the putative zzso zzso C, to the structure of the zzso zzso complex, we propose a model for zzso binding and zzso In this model, the zzso group of the zzso ring zzso the zzso with its zzso facing the zzso group of SAM at a distance that would allow zzso of the zzso
