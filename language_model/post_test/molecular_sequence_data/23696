In a previous environmental survey of a zzso area, the authors identified two zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso in environmental bacterial zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso and also in soil DNA zzso In the present study, using information of stable zzso arrangement and zzso gene zzso the complete zzso zzso of these two zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso differ in six zzso positions, and the putative protein sequences differ only by a single zzso acid, zzso or zzso at position zzso Even though the three-dimensional model does not suggest a significant influence of such an zzso acid substitution on zzso function, the zzso zzso differed significantly from the zzso zzso in lower turnover number and in lower apparent zzso for zzso zzso These results are evidence of the importance for zzso function of zzso acids not directly influencing active site structure and prove the utility of recovering zzso evolved and selected for special functions in natural zzso
