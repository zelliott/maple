23 S zzso zzso is a persistent positive strand zzso virus found in zzso zzso The viral zzso is small zzso zzso and only encodes its zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have succeeded in generating 23 S zzso virus from an expression zzso containing the entire viral zzso zzso Using this in zzso launching system, we analyzed the zzso signals for zzso The zzso region of 23 S zzso contains two zzso One is a stretch of 4 zzso at the 3' end, and the other is a mismatched pair in a zzso structure that partially zzso the terminal 4 zzso In the latter element, the loop or stem sequence is not important but the stem structure with the mismatch pair is zzso The mismatched bases should be zzso Any combination of zzso at the mismatch pair bestowed capability of replication on the zzso whereas converting it to a single zzso at either side of the stem abolished the zzso The terminal and penultimate zzso at the 3' end could be eliminated or modified to other zzso in the launching zzso without affecting virus zzso However, the viruses generated regained or restored these zzso at the 3' zzso Considering the importance of the viral 3' ends in zzso zzso these results suggest that this 3' end repair may contribute to the persistence of 23 S zzso virus in zzso by maintaining the zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss possible mechanisms for this 3' end repair in zzso
