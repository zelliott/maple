zzso zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso reduced the resistance of the zzso spores to zzso The zzso zzso spores lost their optical density at the same rate as the zzso spores upon incubation with zzso but became only phase gray and did not zzso The response of the zzso spores to a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also extremely poor; in this medium zzso spores exhibited only a small loss in optical density and gave a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso transcripts in various zzso zzso indicated that zzso was transcribed by zzso zzso with zzso beginning at 2 h after the start of zzso The zzso promoter was localized by primer extension analysis, and the sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions were similar to the consensus sequences of genes recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of proteins zzso from intact zzso zzso spores showed an zzso in the protein profile, as zzso and zzso zzso identified as zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso along with some other minor zzso zzso microscopic examination of zzso spores revealed changes in the spore coat, including a reduction in the density and thickness of the outer layer and the appearance of an inner coat zzso structure around the outside of the zzso This abnormal coat structure was also observed on the outside of the developing zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in assembly of some coat proteins which have roles in both spore zzso resistance and zzso
