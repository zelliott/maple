We show that the mechanisms of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the gene 4 protein of zzso zzso differ in the pathways by which these reactions are zzso In the presence of zzso gene 4 protein zzso assemble as a ring that binds zzso DNA and couples the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and the unwinding of duplex zzso When mixing zzso zzso with zzso lacking the zzso base for the zzso reaction, we observe that each zzso zzso zzso zzso independently in the absence of zzso zzso zzso when either these zzso inactive zzso or altered zzso incapable of binding zzso DNA are mixed with zzso zzso a small fraction of altered to zzso zzso causes a sharp decline in zzso zzso zzso We propose that sequential zzso of zzso is coupled to the transfer of zzso DNA from zzso to adjacent zzso
