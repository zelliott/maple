The zzso gene is involved in two zzso zzso zzso zzso and the suppression of white gene zzso Both require the ability of zzso protein to zzso dependent on three zzso zzso zzso repeats in the zzso zzso The first step is zzso through a zzso zzso Two other zzso repeats are then required to form higher zzso The zzso zzso which causes the zzso suppression of white, creates a new zzso nucleus that allows the formation of a new and larger zzso The zzso zzso which suppresses even zzso copies of white, makes even larger zzso The zzso suppression of white by a series of zzso is strictly correlated with zzso and the larger the zzso the weaker the requirement for the pairing of zzso zzso of the zzso protein in zzso is suppressed by zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso This zzso zzso also zzso the zzso zzso in zzso and restores normal color, demonstrating that zzso product also exists in a zzso complex in the zzso zzso in zzso is strictly correlated with the prevention of zzso of the zzso zzso products in zzso supporting the interpretation that excessive association of zzso and zzso proteins is responsible for their repression of white gene zzso
