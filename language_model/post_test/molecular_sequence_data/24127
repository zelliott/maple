zzso zzso larvae from two different sources were used for the detection of zzso zzso zzso larvae A, which were collected from a pasture of an endemic farm, and larvae B, which originated from zzso female ticks fed on calves with no clinical signs of disease and with low zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso A were collected zzso from January to May in zzso Two hundred zzso female ticks fed on calves that provided larvae B were divided into groups of 10 and kept in a controlled environment at either 18 degrees C or 28 degrees zzso Fifty larvae were used from each sample for DNA zzso and 5 zzso of DNA were submitted to amplification of the sequence of zzso gene of zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso Seven out of 50 samples of larvae A zzso were positive for the presence of DNA of zzso zzso showing amplified product of zzso zzso Ten out of 91 samples of larvae B zzso kept at 18 degrees C were positive, and all larvae B at 28 degrees C were zzso Thus, this study confirmed the presence of zzso zzso DNA in zzso zzso larvae by zzso The zzso restriction zzso analysis confirmed the specificity of the zzso which resulted in two zzso 265 zzso and 192 zzso The sequencing analysis of the zzso from larvae demonstrated zzso zzso with the zzso sequence from Florida zzso zzso zzso
