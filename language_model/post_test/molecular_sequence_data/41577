zzso zzso is a zzso aromatic zzso that is formed during the cooking of zzso zzso is a potential human zzso it zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso that bind to DNA and zzso including serum zzso zzso The structures of zzso zzso formed in zzso are unknown and require zzso before zzso protein zzso can be implemented as zzso in human zzso We previously examined the reaction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with human zzso in zzso and identified zzso zzso formed at zzso zzso however, other zzso products were thought to zzso We have now identified zzso of zzso formed at multiple sites of zzso reacted with zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso used for study were zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso peptides were separated by ultra performance liquid zzso and characterized by zzso trap mass zzso employing zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso modified with zzso revealed that zzso occurred at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the only site of zzso zzso was detected at zzso zzso a penultimate zzso of zzso that zzso with DNA to form zzso zzso did not appear to form stable zzso with zzso instead, zzso and zzso an zzso reaction product of the proposed zzso zzso of zzso were recovered during the zzso of zzso zzso Some of these zzso zzso products of zzso may be implemented in molecular epidemiology studies to assess the role of zzso cooked meat, zzso and the risk of zzso
