zzso is the main zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso central nervous zzso When zzso binds to the ubiquitous zzso receptors on zzso zzso channels are activated leading to a rapid increase in zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso The zzso receptors are targets for many clinically important drugs, such as the zzso general zzso and zzso All of these drugs enhance the zzso current activated by zzso Of the zzso zzso family, the zzso 2 is critical for the treatment of anxiety spectrum zzso To avoid unwanted side effects, it is necessary to find highly selective drugs that interact only with zzso 2 but not with the related receptors such as zzso 1, 3, and zzso To realize such a goal, it is important to have not only the zzso zzso structure of zzso 2 but also the zzso structures of zzso 1, 3, and zzso In this study, the zzso structures of all the four zzso of zzso receptors have been zzso The zzso zzso structures bear the following features: zzso each of the five zzso in the zzso has an zzso zzso bond, a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso zzso those zzso which are sensitive to the binding of the zzso site zzso are grouped around the zzso zzso and zzso those zzso which are sensitive to the binding of zzso molecules are grouped around the zzso zzso All these findings are fully consistent with experimental zzso Meanwhile, for those sensitive or key zzso a close look at their subtle difference among the four zzso has been provided through a highlighted zzso zzso In addition to providing the atomic zzso the predicted structures have further clarified some ambiguities that could not been uniquely determined by the existing experimental data, such as the zzso of the zzso arrangement in the zzso The zzso models may provide a reasonable structural frame or footing for designing highly selective zzso The present models might be also useful in understanding the basic mechanism of operation of the zzso zzso stimulating novel strategies for developing more specific drugs and better zzso
