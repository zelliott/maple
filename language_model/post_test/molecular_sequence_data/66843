zzso levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are expected to cause zzso change with negative effects on the earth's zzso and human zzso zzso a variety of CO2 disposal options are discussed, including injection into the deep zzso Because the dissolution of CO2 in seawater will decrease ambient pH zzso negative consequences for deep-water zzso have been zzso zzso zzso associated with natural CO2 reservoirs in the deep sea, and the dynamics of zzso liquid, and solid CO2 in such zzso are of great interest to science and zzso We report here a zzso and zzso characterization of a microbial community inhabiting zzso sediments zzso a natural CO2 lake at the zzso zzso IV zzso field, southern Okinawa zzso We found high zzso zzso zzso of microbial cells in zzso zzso above the CO2 lake, decreasing to zzso low cell numbers zzso zzso at the liquid zzso zzso The key groups in these sediments were as zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso group of zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso and zzso The detection of functional genes related to zzso zzso and the presence of highly zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso suggest that zzso assimilating CO2 and/or zzso dominate the liquid CO2 and zzso zzso Clearly, the zzso zzso is an exceptional natural laboratory for the study of consequences of CO2 disposal as well as of natural CO2 reservoirs as potential microbial zzso on early Earth and other celestial zzso
