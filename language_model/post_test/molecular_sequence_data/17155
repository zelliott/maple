The zzso and zzso zzso in zzso coli represent alternative genetic systems zzso to mediate the essential zzso process of zzso cluster zzso assembly under zzso or zzso conditions, zzso Some of the proteins in these two zzso share strong sequence zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and presumably play the same role in the zzso assembly zzso However, other proteins in these zzso share no significant zzso and occur in a mutually exclusive manner in zzso assembly zzso in other organisms zzso zzso and zzso These latter proteins presumably play distinct roles adapted to the different assembly mechanisms used by the two zzso zzso has three zzso zzso zzso that function as a template for zzso assembly while accepting a sulfur atom from zzso zzso in contrast, does not function as an zzso assembly template but has been suggested to function as a shuttle protein that uses a zzso linkage to a single zzso zzso zzso to transfer a sulfur atom from zzso to an alternative zzso assembly zzso Here, we present and analyze the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso The structure shows that the zzso zzso occurs at the tip of a loop with elevated zzso where its zzso is buried from zzso exposure in a zzso cavity located beneath a highly zzso zzso Despite the lack of sequence zzso the core of zzso shows strong structural similarity to zzso and the zzso site in zzso zzso with the location of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cluster assembly in zzso Thus, a zzso core structure is implicated in zzso the interactions of both zzso and zzso with the mutually zzso zzso zzso zzso present in their respective zzso A similar core structure is observed in a domain found in a variety of zzso cluster containing zzso including zzso zzso where it also mediates zzso zzso zzso the core fold of zzso has been adapted to mediate zzso interactions in diverse zzso protein systems in the course of zzso
