The zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I) is a hot spot for zzso causing zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso causing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso episodes syndrome zzso We have used zzso coli and zzso zzso as model systems to study the effect of zzso zzso and zzso which change zzso zzso in zzso and cause zzso The vicinity of these zzso was also explored with a series of zzso in charged zzso The zzso zzso results in zzso substitution in human zzso Replacement of the equivalent zzso in zzso coli with zzso or zzso zzso from zzso assembly and the assembled zzso was zzso However, the equivalent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso failed to assemble completely (or was rapidly zzso Also the corresponding substitution with zzso decreased the zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, lowered the zzso activity by zzso In addition, an zzso of the zzso during zzso turnover was seen in this bacterial zzso something that was even more pronounced in another zzso in the same loop, zzso Several other zzso in this region decreased the zzso zzso The studied zzso zzso are situated in a zzso loop, which appears to be highly sensitive to structural zzso The results provide new information on the function of the region affected by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that is not zzso from patient samples or current zzso zzso
