The human blood group A and B zzso catalyze the transfer of zzso and zzso to the zzso structure zzso alpha zzso zzso to form the blood group A and B zzso zzso zzso four zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso alters the specificity from an A to a B zzso A series of hybrid blood group zzso zzso were produced by zzso these four zzso acids in synthetic genes coding for soluble forms of the zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso hybrid zzso were characterized by zzso zzso kinetic analysis using both zzso and zzso donor zzso The A and B zzso were screened with other donor zzso and found to also zzso the zzso donors zzso and zzso zzso The kinetic data demonstrate the importance of a single zzso acid zzso in determining the A zzso B donor zzso
