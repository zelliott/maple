zzso zzso zzso are among the most characteristic cell wall molecules of virulent strains of zzso zzso They comprise a family of zzso zzso with an array of zzso fatty acids at various positions of the zzso zzso Although their structure has been well zzso most of the zzso involved in their zzso such as zzso are zzso It is demonstrated here by zzso zzso with zzso abundant incorporation into zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso in comparison to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most abundant zzso zzso I, is present in virulent strains zzso and zzso but absent in attenuated zzso zzso zzso with the donor zzso zzso and whole cell zzso of zzso resulted in the synthesis of four major zzso zzso II, IV and zzso A search for zzso gene sequences in zzso tuberculosis yielded gene zzso a zzso zzso gene slightly zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso and expressed as a 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso exhibited activity towards the zzso zzso zzso and zzso No activity was detected with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso may occur at zzso of the zzso Treatment of zzso products with zzso zzso resulted in the release of zzso material showing that zzso was at the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso tuberculosis zzso and total zzso zzso showed one major product corresponding to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso with activity towards typical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
