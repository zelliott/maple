The major zzso site of zzso disease virus zzso is contained in a zzso loop zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso located on the surface of the viral zzso zzso corresponding to this sequence generally elicit protective levels of zzso zzso in guinea zzso In some instances, however, the level of zzso zzso is low although the level of zzso against the zzso determined by zzso is as high as that in the zzso with high zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to ascertain the reason for this difference, we have zzso on a cellulose membrane 10 overlapping zzso offset by one zzso covering the segment zzso of zzso of two viruses belonging to zzso A12 and zzso and tested them with guinea pig zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso and zzso particles zzso zzso With type A, some peptides which were strongly positive with highly zzso zzso did not include the zzso zzso located at zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with low zzso zzso reacted only with zzso which included the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso coupled to the same carrier, zzso high levels of zzso zzso in guinea zzso In the case of zzso O, highly zzso zzso to virus reacted in zzso with peptides zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso is not an indispensable constituent of peptides able to elicit a zzso zzso response against the zzso
