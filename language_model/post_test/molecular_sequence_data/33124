zzso are zzso zzso factors that play key roles in infection establishment in a variety of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso formation requires the action of zzso dedicated zzso that zzso associate zzso building zzso In zzso pneumoniae, a major human zzso all genes required for zzso formation are zzso in a single zzso zzso which encodes three structural proteins zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms the backbone of the zzso zzso to which minor zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso involved in zzso of the zzso fiber and displays a lid which encapsulates the active site, a feature present in all zzso zzso In this work, we show that zzso by zzso proceeds through a zzso zzso constituted of zzso zzso and zzso and that lid instability affects protein fold and zzso In addition, we show by zzso shift analysis that lid flexibility can be stabilized by the addition of zzso zzso a feature shared by other zzso zzso We also report the characterization of a trapped zzso intermediate formed between zzso and zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso systems in many zzso pathogens points to a common mechanism of zzso recognition and zzso that should be taken into consideration in the development of zzso zzso
