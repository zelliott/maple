Human respiratory zzso virus zzso is a frequent cause of hospitalization and mortality in children zzso The molecular epidemiology and circulation pattern of zzso in Saudi Arabia is mostly zzso In the current study, the genetic zzso and zzso relationships of zzso type A strains circulating in zzso Province were zzso zzso zzso were collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory symptoms during the zzso seasons of zzso and zzso Among 175 samples zzso 39 zzso were positive for zzso by zzso zzso zzso type A and zzso type zzso zzso of positive samples in zzso cells permitted the recovery of the first Saudi zzso zzso zzso zzso among Saudi zzso strains was evaluated by sequence analysis of the complete attachment zzso protein zzso The zzso sequence was compared to representatives of the previously identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that the strains examined in this study were very closely related at both the zzso and zzso acid level, and all of them are clustered in the zzso zzso (and mostly belonged to the zzso zzso A total of 23 zzso sites, 14 of which resulted in an zzso acid change, were recorded only in Saudi zzso This is the first report on genetic diversity of zzso strains in Saudi zzso Further analysis of strains on a geographical and zzso basis is needed to fully understand zzso circulation patterns in Saudi zzso
