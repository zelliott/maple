The complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of the 0 and E zzso of lettuce mosaic zzso zzso have been zzso These two zzso differ by their behavior towards two lettuce resistance genes and by their seed transmission zzso zzso is unable to induce disease in lettuce carrying either one of the zzso and zzso zzso resistance zzso whereas zzso is able to induce disease in the same zzso The zzso of these two zzso are zzso zzso zzso in zzso excluding the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso The open reading frame is flanked by a zzso zzso region of 103 zzso and a 3' zzso region of 212 zzso Ten proteins were zzso The zzso zzso with 377 zzso is the longest zzso zzso protein characterized to date while the zzso zzso with zzso zzso is among the longest zzso proteins zzso zzso comparisons between the two zzso demonstrated only limited sequence zzso The overall zzso and zzso acid sequence identities between zzso and zzso are 94 and zzso zzso The greatest zzso occurs in the zzso and in the variable zzso region of the coat zzso while the zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso the zzso of the helper component zzso and the 3' zzso region are extensively zzso While this sequence analysis does not allow direct identification of zzso involved in the resistance breaking or in the seed zzso properties, these data are a first step towards the characterization of these zzso
