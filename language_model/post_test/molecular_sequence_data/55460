The zzso zzso coli zzso zzso characterized by the zzso strain zzso is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing zzso A major zzso factor of zzso is the type II zzso system zzso responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized the two type II zzso systems, designated alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and describe the prevalence of both systems in other zzso coli zzso Under laboratory conditions, the zzso is assembled and functional in the zzso of zzso into culture zzso whereas the zzso is zzso zzso zzso of the three genes located upstream of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is not required for assembly of the zzso zzso or zzso of zzso that zzso is likely the zzso zzso required for the function of zzso and that zzso is required for assembly of the zzso zzso and thus function of the zzso zzso and zzso analysis further demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is a novel outer membrane zzso protein that is integral for assembly of the zzso by zzso zzso to the outer zzso zzso zzso forms the zzso zzso zzso through which zzso zzso are zzso
