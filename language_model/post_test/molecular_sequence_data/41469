zzso zzso zzso constitute a typically zzso zzso zzso zzso fold of approximately 110 zzso acids that perform zzso roles in diverse proteins from all zzso of zzso The zzso terminal zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso oxygen zzso result in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that is relayed via a short downstream zzso to a second zzso domain, zzso At zzso the signal is amplified and passed on to zzso zzso generating the zzso zzso state of the zzso Although the crystal structure of zzso zzso reveals regions that contribute to the zzso zzso 21 zzso acids at the extreme zzso of zzso are zzso Furthermore, the structure and function of the zzso between the two zzso zzso has not been zzso In this study we have investigated the importance to zzso of zzso extending beyond the core zzso zzso Our results zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso connecting the two zzso zzso in zzso signal zzso and demonstrate a role for these zzso regions in controlling the zzso state of zzso in zzso
