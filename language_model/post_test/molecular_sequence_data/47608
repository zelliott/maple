Cloning of a novel Homo sapiens gene from zzso libraries of human zzso using zzso procedure with zzso zzso zzso against zzso coli zzso protein was carried zzso The zzso sequence and zzso zzso of this gene were zzso Computer modeling of its primary transcript was zzso The gene investigated is localized on the P arm of zzso 19 within the zzso cluster and consists of seven zzso and six zzso It has a leader, 3' zzso and translated zzso The translated sequence encodes a zzso protein that displays zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences are situated at positions zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso The absence of zzso or zzso sequences may indicate that this gene is zzso
