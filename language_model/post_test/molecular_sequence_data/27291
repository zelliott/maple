The entry process of the avian zzso and zzso virus zzso family of zzso requires first a specific interaction between the viral surface zzso zzso and a zzso on the cell surface at a neutral zzso triggering zzso changes in the viral zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by exposure to low pH to complete zzso The zzso TM zzso has been proposed to adopt a structure similar to that of the Ebola virus zzso zzso each contains an internal fusion zzso flanked by zzso zzso predicted to be in a zzso zzso In a previous study, we concluded that the zzso zzso the internal fusion zzso in zzso TM are critical for efficient function of the zzso viral zzso in zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso were constructed and genetically selected for improved replication capacity in chicken zzso zzso with single zzso zzso reverted to the zzso zzso However, viruses with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso retained both zzso and acquired a zzso zzso that significantly improved the zzso of the genetically selected virus zzso A zzso zzso substitution in the TM internal fusion zzso at position 30 is preferred to rescue the zzso zzso zzso zzso envelope zzso that contain the zzso and zzso zzso bind the zzso zzso at zzso levels and have improved abilities to trigger zzso changes and to form stable TM zzso compared to those of the zzso zzso zzso
