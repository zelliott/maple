The zzso coli type III zzso zzso belongs to a large family of bacterial zzso factors that activate host zzso zzso signaling pathways through an unknown molecular zzso Here we report direct evidence that zzso functions as a potent and selective zzso exchange factor zzso for zzso The zzso structure of the zzso complex revealed that zzso mimics the zzso strategy of the zzso zzso family but has a three-dimensional architecture that is nearly identical to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparative analysis between human and bacterial zzso revealed a previously zzso pairing mechanism between zzso and the variable zzso zzso region of zzso We propose a zzso selection model that is zzso validated by the preferential zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results significantly expand the repertoire of bacterial zzso mimics and unify a zzso selection mechanism for host zzso zzso
