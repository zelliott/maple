Although the cost of generating zzso zzso sequence continues to decline, refining that sequence by the process of zzso zzso remains zzso zzso finished sequence is an appropriate goal for the human zzso and a small set of reference zzso however, such a high-quality product cannot be zzso for large numbers of additional zzso at least for the foreseeable zzso Here we describe the generation and quality of an intermediate grade of finished zzso sequence zzso zzso finished zzso which is tailored for use in zzso sequence zzso Our analyses indicate that this sequence is very high quality (with the residual gaps and errors mostly falling within repetitive zzso and reflects zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso sequence finishing requires approximately zzso less zzso and approximately zzso less personnel effort compared to the generation of near-perfect finished zzso such as that produced for the human zzso Although applied here to finishing sequence derived from individual bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso one could envision establishing routines for refining sequences emanating from zzso shotgun sequencing projects to a similar quality zzso Our experience to date demonstrates that zzso sequence finishing represents a practical and affordable option for sequence refinement en route to comparative zzso
