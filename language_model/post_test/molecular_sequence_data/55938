We have expressed in zzso coli the 36 zzso domain of the human zzso zzso This zzso comprises the zzso part of the DNA binding domain, as well as the zzso region of the zzso but lacks the zzso motifs of the zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso By probing the crude zzso coli protein extracts with radioactive DNA zzso zzso zzso we have shown that the 36 zzso domain binds a DNA probe of 222 zzso but does not bind a shorter probe of 66 zzso This interaction is stronger when the zzso is fused to the 55 zzso zzso domain of the zzso
