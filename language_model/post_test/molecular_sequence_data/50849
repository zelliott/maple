A zzso element has been identified previously on the zzso of the chicken zzso genes placed next to the major zzso in this domain zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso fragments of this negative element show the requirement of the entire DNA segment for maximum zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso including the previously defined zzso zzso Factor 1) sequence seem to play an important role on the negative action of this zzso zzso characterization of the nuclear factor interacting with the zzso sequence was carried zzso zzso interference experiments show the contact points and, by zzso zzso analysis with zzso and zzso zzso the critical role of these contacts points on the formation of the zzso complex could be zzso These results provide a basis for further experiments on the characterization and understanding of the mechanisms of action of the coupled positive and negative regulatory zzso
