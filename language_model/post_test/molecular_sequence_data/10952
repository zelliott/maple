zzso A is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was assumed to initiate zzso breakdown just after the onset of seed zzso This zzso was zzso from zzso of zzso zzso On zzso zzso gels, active zzso A migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 21 zzso whereas after heat zzso its molecular size on zzso was 29 zzso Although zzso A is capable of zzso storage zzso in zzso it could not be localized in the zzso fraction of zzso from zzso zzso zzso clones zzso zzso A precursor have been obtained by zzso The precursor is composed of an zzso signal sequence followed by a zzso the region zzso mature zzso A, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A with a derived molecular mass of zzso Da does not have the zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the zzso A precursor is zzso identical to zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso A zzso appears de zzso in zzso of zzso zzso seeds, where its amount increases up to day zzso No zzso A zzso was detected in other zzso zzso not even in the zzso zzso which contains stored zzso By means of zzso raised against the zzso and against zzso produced zzso A, the zzso bands of mature zzso A were detected in zzso extracts of zzso seeds when zzso degradation has already far zzso The reported data do not agree with the proposed triggering role of zzso A in zzso breakdown during zzso
