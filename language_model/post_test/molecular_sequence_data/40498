zzso occurring zzso is a zzso consisting of two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso Prior to this study, however, the function of the two zzso in zzso deposition of iron in zzso was zzso The data show that, upon zzso addition of zzso zzso to zzso iron zzso occurs only at the zzso zzso center of zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso such zzso is zzso by the extension zzso (a specific domain found in zzso of zzso because the zzso zzso is able to remove zzso from the center to the inner cavity better than the zzso zzso These findings support the idea that the zzso and zzso zzso play different roles in iron zzso in zzso Interestingly, at medium iron loading zzso zzso zzso zzso soybean seed zzso zzso exhibits a stronger activity in catalyzing iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that a synergistic interaction exists between the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso during iron zzso Such synergistic interaction becomes considerably stronger at high iron loading zzso zzso as indicated by the observation that the iron zzso activity of zzso zzso is zzso times larger than those of zzso and zzso This helps zzso the widespread occurrence of zzso zzso in zzso
