Several repetitive DNA families were identified in zzso zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso of one of these repetitive DNA families showed the presence of multiple copies of zzso zzso autonomously replicating sequence zzso core consensus zzso The zzso zzso zzso consensus sequences allowed a zzso zzso zzso to replicate autonomously in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was located in one member of this zzso zzso repetitive DNA zzso
