The invasive pathogen zzso zzso has evolved a sophisticated device that allows it to enter zzso host zzso This process requires the expression of zzso zzso island 1 zzso which encodes a specialized type III protein zzso system zzso This zzso delivers a set of zzso that produce a marked zzso of the host zzso generating a zzso membrane zzso at the site of interaction, driving bacterial zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso system zzso the expression of the zzso machinery by zzso the zzso of its master regulator, zzso In this work, we reveal the presence of a zzso zzso within zzso This zzso is composed of the zzso and zzso zzso which zzso a protein that interacts with the zzso zzso and a putative zzso protein of the zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, expression of this zzso is directly activated by the zzso form of the response regulator, which recognizes a zzso box located at the zzso region relative to the zzso start zzso Additionally, under zzso conditions, zzso expression is driven both by the zzso promoter, induced by the zzso master regulator zzso and by the directly controlled zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that in contrast to the rest of the genes zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is expressed during and after zzso entry into its host cell, and they suggest a role for the products of this zzso after host cell zzso
