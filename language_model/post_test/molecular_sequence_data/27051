zzso gene transfer has been occasionally mentioned in zzso zzso but such events appear much less numerous than in zzso where they play important functional and evolutionary zzso In zzso few independent cases have been zzso some of which corresponding to major zzso functions, but no systematic screening of zzso transferred genes has been attempted so zzso Taking advantage of the zzso conservation among five newly zzso and zzso zzso of zzso we carried out a systematic search for zzso candidates zzso genes present in only one species within zzso zzso zzso Out of 255 zzso zzso we discovered 11 candidates for zzso based on their similarity with bacterial proteins and on reconstructed zzso This zzso to a minimum of six transfer events because some zzso acquired genes appear to rapidly duplicate in zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of the zzso family in zzso zzso We show that the resulting copies are submitted to a strong functional selective zzso The mechanisms of DNA transfer and integration are discussed, in relation with the generally small size of zzso zzso Our results on a limited set of species expand by 50% the number of previously published zzso cases in zzso zzso suggesting that this type of event is more frequent than usually zzso Our restrictive method does not exclude the possibility that additional zzso events zzso Actually, ancestral events common to several zzso species must have been zzso and the absence of zzso in present databases leaves open the question of the origin of the zzso remaining zzso genes inserted within zzso zzso zzso
