Human zzso virus reverse zzso zzso exhibits a strong sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso a zzso site directed zzso for DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso (1976) zzso 15, zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso followed by sodium zzso reduction of the zzso zzso results in irreversible zzso of zzso activity while zzso H activity associated with zzso is minimally zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso is zzso Yet one of the sites of zzso action appears to be involved in the process of zzso binding as judged by zzso competitive mode of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso into zzso protein by the addition of zzso zzso Furthermore, this site is the only zzso zzso site which is accessible to zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso mapping of zzso treated with zzso under a variety of conditions permitted the identification of a zzso zzso site containing zzso Furthermore, zzso of this site was also blocked by inclusion of zzso zzso and appropriate zzso The zzso acid composition and sequence analysis of this zzso showed that a zzso zzso present at position 263 in the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso is the site of zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso 263 serves as an important part of the zzso domain in zzso
