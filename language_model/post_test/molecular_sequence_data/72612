The promoter regions of most zzso zzso units have been reported to consist of zzso zzso and zzso consensus zzso However, a few promoters with no zzso to the consensus elements have also been zzso A novel class of zzso zzso zzso as non consensus type II zzso zzso effect low-level zzso expression of respective genes in zzso as well as zzso zzso is described in this zzso The abundance of zzso zzso transcripts remains zzso even when zzso zzso are shifted to the zzso In contrast, transcripts from zzso and zzso elements containing consensus type zzso promoters accumulate to high levels in zzso as compared with zzso zzso of roots and cultured zzso Moreover, zzso of these transcripts is greatly affected by zzso The zzso of zzso protein synthesis has no apparent effect on the abundance of the zzso transcripts whereas levels of CT transcripts are greatly zzso In zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso treatment also reduces the levels of CT transcripts with no apparent zzso effect on the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of transcripts from both classes of zzso however, is reduced when zzso protein synthesis is inhibited by in zzso treatment with zzso The results are suggestive of the possible existence of at least two distinctive systems for the synthesis and/or maintenance of zzso transcripts which differentiate between two classes of transcripts in a zzso specific zzso
