The almost complete sequence of the zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This allowed zzso analysis of zzso zzso by comparing sequences of the zzso zzso gene of this zzso to similar genes of other zzso zzso It was shown that this zzso zzso belongs to the zzso cluster I, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso related to another zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso and can be zzso clustered within the zzso zzso with a low DNA zzso content grouped in zzso zzso zzso zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso identity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Like other members of the zzso cluster I, zzso A, zzso zzso possesses such common zzso features as a zzso cell wall structure, zzso derivation of energy from zzso zzso yielding zzso acid among other organic acids and the capacity for zzso zzso However, the scale of evolutionary change in the zzso zzso gene between zzso zzso and zzso related zzso species does not zzso to the profound changes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso features of the latter are large cell size, zzso (up to seven spores per zzso alternative modes of development and an unusual membrane zzso
