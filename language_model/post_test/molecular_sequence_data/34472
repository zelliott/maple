Land plant zzso zzso four functional zzso zzso chain release factors zzso of zzso origin, two zzso and zzso zzso for each zzso zzso zzso we have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required not only for termination of translation but also for stabilization of zzso stop zzso zzso zzso A previously undiscovered zzso zzso zzso is localized to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso complex and found only in vascular zzso zzso zzso positions of zzso unequivocally indicate that zzso arose from a zzso of zzso zzso zzso is lacking the two most important zzso motifs characteristic for all zzso and zzso zzso zzso described so far: the stop zzso recognition motif SPF and the zzso center zzso for zzso zzso zzso studies, as well as functional and molecular analyses of two zzso zzso in zzso both of which lead to a specific zzso of the zzso zzso complex, revealed that zzso is essentially required for zzso zzso zzso transcript, zzso and translation analyses indicate that zzso has been recruited in vascular plants for zzso and zzso regulation of stability of 3' processed zzso transcripts to adjust zzso zzso zzso
