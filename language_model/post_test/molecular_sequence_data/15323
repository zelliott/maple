Three zzso zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found with a similarity search were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso under the control of an zzso zzso zzso The selected zzso of all three zzso zzso showed activity with zzso used as a model zzso The most promising zzso of the zzso zzso gene construct was cultivated in a laboratory zzso with a production yield of zzso g zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso exploiting a zzso His zzso The N zzso of the zzso was found to be zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso was determined to be around zzso zzso by mass zzso zzso had higher activity on shorter zzso to zzso fatty acid zzso of zzso than on longer ones, and it also exhibited zzso zzso zzso had optimal activity between pH 7 and 8 but retained activity over a wide pH zzso The zzso retained zzso of its activity after 20 h of incubation at 50 degrees C, but residual activity decreased sharply at 60 degrees zzso zzso analyses and determination of released zzso products showed that the zzso was able to zzso apple zzso and birch outer bark zzso
