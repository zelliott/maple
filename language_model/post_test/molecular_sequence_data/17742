In the zzso bacteria, as in other zzso bacteria, two main zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso which functions as an zzso zzso The structural genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso They present the same organization, with the gene zzso the small zzso zzso zzso masses zzso and zzso zzso zzso preceding the gene zzso the large one zzso zzso masses zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two zzso genes apparently belong to the same zzso The deduced protein sequences of the small and of the large zzso share nearly zzso and zzso zzso identity, respectively, with their counterparts in zzso zzso found in zzso zzso However, unlike in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso another open reading frame zzso was found downstream and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso whose zzso seemed to depend on the same zzso promoter as zzso zzso contained zzso zzso capable of zzso a zzso zzso of 262 zzso acids zzso zzso
