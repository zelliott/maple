zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso designated zzso protein zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of molecular zzso The gene zzso zzso was zzso expressed and zzso A partial library from zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was constructed in zzso zzso and was screened by the zzso to zzso zzso zzso which has specificity for a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso gene region consists of a putative zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso and 97 zzso zzso The zzso structure was led by a consensus zzso promoter zzso zzso searches using the derived zzso acid sequence have revealed that zzso is zzso identical to zzso of zzso zzso zzso another protein zzso by the zzso shows extensive sequence zzso zzso identical to zzso of zzso coli which is a member of zzso
