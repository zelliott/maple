zzso zzso is by far the most widely used drug to counteract human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection, both in zzso and in combination therapy zzso However, the majority of patients under prolonged zzso therapy have been shown to zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying reduced sensitivity to the drug in zzso In order to investigate the zzso role of in zzso resistance to zzso six zzso zzso subjects were evaluated zzso zzso follow-up zzso months, range zzso zzso for zzso DNA load in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and for the presence of zzso pol gene zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA was performed by competitive zzso chain reaction zzso and the pol zzso was determined by direct sequencing of zzso zzso All of the six patients developed one or more of the zzso pol zzso known to zzso resistance to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso association was found between zzso DNA burden and the level of zzso resistance, as predicted on the basis of the pol zzso zzso zzso Both virus load and zzso resistance were zzso correlated with zzso cell zzso These results are compatible with a direct in zzso zzso role for pol gene zzso shown to be involved in resistance to zzso in zzso Monitoring the degree of zzso resistance to zzso and to other zzso drugs should be considered in designing protocols for the management of treated zzso
