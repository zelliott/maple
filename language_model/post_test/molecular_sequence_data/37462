zzso zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso gene family that was originally cloned from a zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using a zzso zzso recognized a protein with the predicted zzso of zzso in zzso derived from a transformed zzso cell line known to express zzso zzso zzso of the zzso loop zzso domain of zzso notably at the zzso zzso with other zzso that inhibit zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso may inhibit similar zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso indeed zzso zzso K and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso rate zzso zzso for the zzso reactions of zzso with zzso K and L were zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed zzso complexes with zzso K and zzso a characteristic property of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso with zzso K and L were indicated by zzso of zzso near the predicted zzso zzso by these zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso possesses specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso
