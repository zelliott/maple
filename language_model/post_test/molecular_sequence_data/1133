As a structural component of the outer membrane of zzso bacteria, zzso also known as zzso zzso exhibits strong zzso properties, rendering it a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso zzso Our attempt to identify zzso proteins from the zzso of the zzso crab led to the isolation and identification of zzso protein zzso as the zzso zzso protein during zzso zzso zzso is an zzso ancient member of a zzso of zzso It is a major protein in acute phase of infection in zzso Our investigation of zzso response to zzso zzso unveiled a robust innate immune system in the zzso zzso which displays rapid suppression of a dosage of zzso zzso of bacteria in the first hour of infection and zzso complete clearance of the pathogen by 3 zzso Such a high dose would have been lethal to zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of the untranslated regions suggests their crucial role in zzso regulation of zzso transcript zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated an acute zzso of zzso by about zzso in zzso h of zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide new insights into the importance of zzso as a zzso zzso for pathogen zzso
