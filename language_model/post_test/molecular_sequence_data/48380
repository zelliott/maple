Cystic zzso is one of the most important zzso affecting various species of intermediate hosts and zzso In this report, we present zzso zzso infection in a horse and its molecular zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial sequencing of zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1 zzso genes were zzso According to the zzso zzso result, the horse isolate was grouped with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the partial zzso sequence corresponded to the zzso zzso This is the first study of the molecular characterization of the horse isolate of zzso zzso in zzso
