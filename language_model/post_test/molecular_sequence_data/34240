An zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a core sample of a deep zzso oil zzso zzso were zzso zzso and stained zzso It grew at zzso zzso ranging from 6 to zzso zzso with optimal growth at zzso zzso zzso and at temperatures between 25 and zzso with an optimum at zzso The optimum pH was zzso zzso zzso no growth at pH zzso and pH zzso The doubling time in zzso growth conditions was zzso zzso zzso zzso used exclusively carbohydrates as carbon and energy zzso The end products of zzso degradation were zzso zzso ethanol, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso fatty acids zzso zzso and zzso The G + C zzso of the DNA was zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso formed a distinct lineage within the family zzso order zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity of zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso and zzso properties, strain zzso is proposed to be assigned to a novel species of a novel zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
