zzso zzso fever virus zzso is a zzso agent that causes zzso life-threatening disease, with a case fatality rate of zzso It is the most widespread zzso virus in the world, with cases reported in Africa, Asia and Eastern zzso zzso is a genetically diverse zzso Its genetic diversity is often correlated to its geographical zzso zzso zzso of zzso was determined within few endemic areas, however limited data is available for zzso Furthermore, there is little information about the zzso genetic changes of zzso in endemic zzso Kosovo is an important endemic area for zzso Cases were reported each year and the zzso rate is significantly higher compared to nearby zzso In this study, we wanted to examine the genetic zzso of zzso obtained directly from zzso patients, hospitalized in Kosovo from 1991 to zzso We zzso partial S segment zzso zzso sequences from 89 zzso Our results show that several viral zzso are present in Kosovo and that the genetic diversity is high in relation to the studied zzso We also show that zzso are mostly zzso distributed throughout Kosovo and that limited evolutionary changes have occurred in 22 zzso Our results also suggest the presence of a new distinct lineage within the European zzso zzso zzso Our study provide the largest number of zzso zzso sequences from patients in 22 year span in one endemic zzso
