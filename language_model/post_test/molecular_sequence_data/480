The zzso zzso hormone alpha zzso family regulates zzso and zzso functions in zzso Little is known concerning zzso family members in primitive zzso A previous zzso analysis revealed the presence of two genes zzso to the zzso alpha zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso however only one zzso zzso contained both the zzso structure and zzso site characteristic of family zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain the zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso expression in the anterior part of the nerve zzso and on the left side of the central zzso Because zzso possesses only one true zzso zzso while zzso possess two zzso hormone alpha zzso zzso zzso or zzso and the common alpha zzso of zzso and zzso zzso hormones, zzso our results suggest that zzso was acquired later in the zzso lineage through gene zzso
