A detailed insight to the structure of a given major zzso complex zzso complex can strongly support and also improve the analysis of the zzso binding capabilities of the zzso zzso and the characterization of the developing T cell zzso The number of zzso class zzso crystal structures is zzso therefore constructing and analyzing computer models can serve as efficient complementary tools when someone deals with zzso determined binding and/or functional zzso Commercial programs are available for modeling protein and zzso complexes, in zzso However, more accurate results can be obtained if the parameters are directly zzso to a given complex, especially in the case of special proteins as zzso class II, an integral membrane zzso whose functional parts behave like regular zzso zzso Here, we present the zzso of an approach used for modeling zzso class II molecules zzso with various peptides fitting into the binding groove and several ways to analyze them with the help of experimental zzso
