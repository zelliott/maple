zzso amplified zzso DNA zzso has been used for rapid typing of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used with either zzso zzso DNA serving as template in the zzso chain reaction, or with crude cell zzso and using a zzso primer with zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso by zzso zzso zzso after separation on zzso zzso zzso from 20 zzso zzso strains and two zzso zzso strains were zzso using the zzso products moment correlation zzso zzso and the zzso pair group method with zzso averages zzso With some exceptions, the two sources of template DNA gave the same clusters and zzso of strains at the similarity level of zzso About 50% of the strains could be individually separated from all the other tested zzso The buffer brand, the amount of primer and crude cell extract used in the zzso were crucial for the final zzso
