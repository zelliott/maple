zzso are proteins produced during the late stages of plant zzso development and following any environmental stimulus involving zzso In order to investigate the zzso of a zzso gene zzso in cultivated and wild sunflower zzso zzso zzso near-complete zzso were isolated by the zzso chain reaction and zzso All of the isolated sequences were found to contain the typical zzso zzso and interrupted by an zzso The number of zzso zzso and zzso per site was zzso With respect to the overall zzso variation in both the coding and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences was much larger among wild zzso than among zzso No variation was observed in zzso from cultivated zzso Different coding regions showed a different numbers of synonymous and zzso zzso The Y and K zzso were the most zzso in both wild and cultivated zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso proteins showed that zzso zzso in wild zzso should also determine large zzso differences at the protein zzso All of the isolated zzso were however functional, at least at the zzso zzso To our knowledge these are the first data on zzso genetic zzso of such a stress response zzso The low zzso of zzso genes from cultivated sunflower is discussed in relation to the origin of sunflower zzso The possibility of rescuing general genetic zzso through crosses to wild zzso of zzso zzso rather than using wild zzso species is also zzso
