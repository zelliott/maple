zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly activated zzso gene expression without affecting zzso gene zzso Northern zzso and reporter zzso demonstrated that this induction was due to zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso To further define the underlying zzso we prepared a zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso hybrid construct by inserting the zzso of zzso zzso just downstream from the zzso coding sequence and zzso it into zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced the activity of this construct by zzso zzso analyses indicated that an zzso element zzso located between zzso to 625 within the zzso zzso was required for this zzso zzso gel shift zzso demonstrated that this zzso bound an zzso zzso This protein has been zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells by zzso and zzso affinity zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and Northwestern analyses indicated the molecular mass of this protein as 24 and 52 zzso Finally, zzso treatment markedly enhanced this zzso binding by a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso located between zzso and 625 within the zzso zzso zzso which binds an zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso
