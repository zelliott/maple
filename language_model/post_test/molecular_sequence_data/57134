The three-dimensional structures of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined in the absence zzso and presence of bound zzso zzso and compared to a zzso zzso containing a zzso at position 36 which does not change signaling behavior of the intact zzso The structures of the zzso forms were determined in order to assess the effects of zzso on the structure and its influence on zzso changes upon zzso zzso As in the case of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain is zzso and is composed of zzso bundle zzso zzso related by a zzso zzso axis in the zzso form and by a zzso axis in the zzso zzso A comparative study between the zzso and zzso structures has led to the following zzso 1) The long zzso zzso of the individual zzso in the zzso structures are bent toward each other to accommodate the zzso zzso 2) The rest of the zzso zzso is very similar to that of the zzso 3) The zzso angle of the zzso zzso structure is larger by about 13 degrees when compared to the zzso zzso zzso 4) The nature and magnitude of the zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso structures are very similar to those of the zzso zzso
