This review summarizes the characteristics of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso I of zzso bacteria and zzso II of zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso bacteria, the zzso from zzso coli has been extensively examined and zzso are associated with the zzso fraction of cell zzso zzso from zzso bacteria are zzso and the structural gene of zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and used in our laboratory for replacement with the zzso coli zzso This review discusses the possible regulatory mechanisms of zzso synthesis in zzso coli, which are closely related to the zzso zzso and properties of zzso zzso and highlights the zzso regulatory model which assumes two forms of zzso zzso zzso molecules bound with zzso zzso of the membrane are active in zzso zzso whereas others in the zzso are zzso In addition, considerations of the origin and evolution of the two vastly different zzso of zzso zzso of bacteria are also zzso
