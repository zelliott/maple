zzso protein zzso is a serum zzso participating in the innate immune defense by zzso various zzso for zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso and low levels of the protein can partially be explained by the dominant effect of three different zzso in the structural part of the zzso zzso Large zzso differences in the zzso of these zzso have previously been zzso but they cannot explain the large zzso variation in zzso serum zzso We describe the existence of additional zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso The promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso show associations with high, zzso and low levels of zzso serum zzso zzso Moreover, this represents a genetic system with additive effect of zzso in which a low producing zzso zzso in the zzso state zzso the zzso expression of zzso as effectively as a single structural zzso zzso of pure zzso zzso and black Africans show marked zzso differences in the zzso of promoter zzso regulating the expression of the normal zzso with the zzso zzso frequency varying from zzso in zzso via zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso The zzso zzso frequency varies from zzso in zzso via zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso The zzso zzso frequency varies from zzso in zzso via zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso The effect of the promoter zzso can explain almost all of the ethnic differences not zzso by the structural zzso zzso
