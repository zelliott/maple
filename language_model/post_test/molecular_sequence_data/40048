Four DNA fragments zzso a reverse zzso zzso gene related to that of long terminal repeat zzso zzso were isolated from the red zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that one clone exists as a single copy per zzso Its full-length zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso which are most closely related to those of the zzso zzso zzso although two stop zzso were present within the zzso zzso We did not find any sequence related to zzso zzso other than zzso H in zzso These results indicate that zzso is a single zzso zzso gene and a defective zzso of zzso zzso
