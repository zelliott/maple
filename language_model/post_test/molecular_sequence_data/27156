zzso persists in a zzso of zzso infected zzso T cells in individuals treated with highly active zzso therapy zzso Here we identify central memory zzso and transitional memory zzso zzso T cells as the major cellular reservoirs for zzso and find that viral persistence is ensured by two different zzso zzso primarily persists in zzso cells in subjects showing zzso of the zzso compartment upon zzso This zzso is maintained through T cell survival and low-level zzso proliferation and is slowly depleted with zzso In contrast, zzso DNA is zzso detected in zzso cells from zzso individuals with low zzso counts and higher amounts of zzso zzso zzso a mechanism that ensures the persistence of these zzso Our results suggest that viral zzso might be achieved through the combined use of strategic interventions targeting viral replication and, as in cancer, drugs that interfere with the self renewal and persistence of zzso memory T zzso
