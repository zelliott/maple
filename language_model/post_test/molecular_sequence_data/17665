The zzso sequence of a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso designated zzso shares zzso zzso sequence identity and zzso zzso acid identity with previously characterized zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso gene spans 8 zzso and appears to contain 11 zzso ranging in size from 57 zzso to over zzso zzso One of the zzso interrupts the proposed active site region that is zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso B and zzso Southern zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso is zzso by a small gene family in zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared against the zzso protein react on Western blots with 35 and zzso proteins of adult zzso These proteins were not zzso by Western zzso analysis in three zzso zzso zzso stages of zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso indicate that zzso transcripts for the gene family are present at low levels in a mixed population of zzso and zzso larvae but highly abundant in adult zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso and suggests a role for the zzso in blood zzso
