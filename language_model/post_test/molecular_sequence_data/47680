zzso is a zzso zzso nuclear import zzso for two essential zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate direct binding of zzso to each of these zzso We have defined the nuclear zzso signals in both zzso and zzso by zzso binding in zzso and zzso nuclear import in zzso The nuclear zzso signals map to similar zzso zzso zzso in both proteins and are thus termed zzso zzso signals to distinguish them from classical nuclear zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso like other known zzso (or zzso interacts directly with the small zzso zzso However, unlike other known import factors, Ran binding is not sufficient to mediate release of zzso from zzso efficient zzso zzso release requires zzso Also, addition of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso release of both proteins from the zzso We suggest a simple cycle in which zzso and zzso upon import, are released in the nucleus at sites of zzso by the concerted action of zzso and binding to newly zzso zzso The resulting zzso complexes are exported to the zzso where zzso zzso to zzso and zzso contributing to their release from zzso
