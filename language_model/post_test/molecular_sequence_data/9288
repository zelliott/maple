zzso development depends on the activity of zzso in plants, and thus control of cell fate in the zzso is crucial to plant development and its zzso In grasses such as rice and zzso the fate of zzso zzso changes from indeterminate zzso such as zzso and branch zzso to zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso Here we analyzed a zzso zzso of rice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso that showed zzso zzso such as a zzso branching pattern, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Close examination revealed that regulation of zzso fate was compromised in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was delayed, transition from the branch zzso to the zzso zzso was accelerated, and stem cell maintenance in both the branch zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso The genetic program was also disturbed in terms of zzso zzso Gene isolation revealed that zzso encodes a zzso zzso that is related to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso It is likely that the zzso defects are associated with zzso of multiple genes related to zzso function in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso also showed zzso of zzso bud growth and disturbed zzso in the zzso phase, suggesting that the function of this gene is closely associated with zzso zzso zzso with these observations and the molecular function of zzso zzso zzso signaling was also compromised in the rice zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso regulates various aspects of zzso processes and zzso responses as a zzso zzso in zzso
