The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso define a family of zzso zzso with no sequence similarity to previously characterized zzso zzso The zzso A resolution structure of zzso coli zzso reveals a zzso zzso with a zzso domain that zzso closely on that of other zzso zzso A domain that appears to be unique to zzso family zzso hinges over the zzso domain, possibly serving to zzso the zzso zzso The active site comprises zzso that are zzso in other zzso zzso although at least one comes from a structurally distinct part of the zzso zzso the connectivity of the structural elements of the zzso zzso domain is a circular zzso of that of its zzso Because the sequence of the zzso segment, a zzso that bisects the zzso domain, is zzso among zzso from bacteria, zzso and zzso the zzso likely happened early in zzso
