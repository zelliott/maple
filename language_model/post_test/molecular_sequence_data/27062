zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was shown to depend mainly on the correct folding and integrity of its 55 zzso acid long, partly zzso zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso indicates different zzso and zzso interactions of the zzso domain during zzso A regulation mechanism is suggested where this domain switches the zzso from the inactive to the active zzso zzso of recently obtained electron and X-ray zzso data of zzso led to a zzso based model of zzso molecular switching involved in zzso
