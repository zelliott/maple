zzso editing in the zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in bacteria and zzso contain zzso zzso zzso suggesting an evolutionary link between the two zzso In zzso zzso undergo both zzso and zzso editing, but the relationship between the two reactions is zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso leads to a reduction in both zzso and zzso editing of zzso in zzso Surprisingly, in zzso this zzso can mediate zzso editing of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso but not both in either zzso The ability to use both DNA and zzso provides a model for a zzso editing zzso zzso the ability of a single zzso to perform two different zzso reactions also suggests that this zzso still maintains zzso that would have been found in the zzso zzso providing a first line of evidence for the evolution of editing zzso
