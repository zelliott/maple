The regulation of zzso levels during differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso was investigated using zzso acid and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which contained the entire coding sequence for the zzso form of zzso zzso was isolated using a zzso zzso zzso was detected in several cell lines but was not zzso in three zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso during the differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by changes in cell shape, from small zzso cells to large flat zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells began zzso h after addition of the zzso zzso In comparison, zzso zzso activity showed a zzso increase beginning after 24 to 36 h and zzso zzso were shown to increase about zzso beginning 36 to 60 h after induction of zzso The levels of zzso per se, as determined by zzso were also shown to increase with differentiation of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in the restructuring of zzso filaments which accompanies the dramatic changes in cell shape during zzso
