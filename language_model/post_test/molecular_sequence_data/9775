The zzso sequences of the open reading frames of zzso for zzso W from skeletal muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso monkey and human are zzso zzso translation of the coding sequences indicated highly similar proteins of 88 zzso and zzso or 87 zzso monkey and zzso zzso zzso In 73 of 88 positions the specified zzso acids are identical for all five zzso zzso zzso zzso is the 13th zzso of all the zzso The zzso rat and sheep open reading frames terminate with zzso but the human and zzso monkey coding regions terminate with zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences are identical for the rat and mouse zzso and for the human and monkey zzso The similarity of the zzso continues in the 3' zzso regions through the putative zzso zzso sequence zzso elements which are required for correct interpretation of the zzso zzso The region between the zzso elements and the zzso signals showed much lower zzso The cloned rat gene for zzso W is zzso bases long, with the zzso bases of the zzso in six zzso The zzso start site was identified by zzso protection zzso to be 16 bases upstream of the longest zzso zzso A zzso zzso box occurs 150 bases upstream, but the zzso did not indicate the presence of longer zzso
