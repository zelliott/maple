We have determined the sequences of zzso zzso and spliced leader zzso zzso zzso and adjacent zzso regions for representatives of all known zzso zzso zzso zzso The genetic zzso have been analyzed separately as well as by a combined zzso Several zzso assigned by zzso to different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to belong to a single species with an unexpectedly wide host and geographical zzso An unnamed zzso isolated from rats in Egypt was found to belong to the zzso zzso so far associated with insect hosts zzso It is closely related to zzso zzso a zzso of a zzso biting zzso Apparently several different zzso species can zzso one insect species, as exemplified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were isolated from different specimens of zzso zzso on the same locality and zzso However, since the same species of zzso was obtained from insect hosts belonging to different zzso some insect zzso may have low host zzso Our data revealed additional discrepancies between molecular zzso data and cell zzso rendering current zzso zzso zzso
