zzso zzso zzso is an zzso cell surface zzso belonging to the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso Adult T cell leukemia zzso cells express zzso zzso and show zzso after treatment with an zzso zzso zzso We established the ATL cell line zzso which showed resistance to zzso zzso and found that zzso expressed two forms of zzso zzso the normal form and a truncated zzso The truncated transcript lacked 20 base pairs at zzso 9, resulting in a frame shift and the generation of a premature stop zzso at zzso acid zzso The same zzso was detected in primary zzso cells and peripheral blood zzso The zzso was not detected in zzso zzso cells, however, although all of the primary ATL cells were of the same zzso zzso A zzso gene transfer of the truncated zzso to zzso cells rendered the cells resistant to zzso zzso suggesting a dominant negative interference zzso These results indicate that an ATL zzso acquires a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso enabling the zzso to escape from zzso zzso by the zzso zzso system and zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene may be one of the mechanisms underlying the progression of zzso
