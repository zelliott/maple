A novel, zzso bacterial strain was isolated from forest zzso Among species with zzso published names, the zzso zzso gene sequence is related most closely zzso 93 % zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, differently from this species, it forms both zzso and aerial zzso The aerial zzso are straight to slightly zzso starting to zzso to form chains of more than 20 zzso spores with a zzso zzso The strain is zzso with a pH range for robust growth between zzso and zzso and an optimum around zzso The zzso type is zzso zzso The polar lipids are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unknown zzso zzso zzso are zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso are the main cellular fatty zzso The DNA zzso content is zzso zzso The distinct zzso position and the unusual combination of zzso characteristics justify the proposal of zzso zzso zzso with the type species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso
