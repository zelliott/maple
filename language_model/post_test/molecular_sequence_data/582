This study reports zzso and molecular characterization of a novel zzso zzso carried by two zzso zzso zzso collected from two hospitals in zzso zzso experiment, Southern zzso zzso testing, zzso zzso zzso and sequencing techniques as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were carried out to describe the characterization of the novel zzso zzso The analyses of zzso profiling and zzso gel zzso of the novel zzso were performed to investigate zzso The zzso products had 967 zzso and a novel zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso was implicated in this zzso zzso Two strains exhibited a zzso zzso zzso profile that included zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso differed from that of the zzso zzso by the zzso change at position zzso The novel zzso was susceptible to zzso the same response being observed for other zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso were also zzso Furthermore, two resistant genes of clinical strains were closely zzso The emergence of a novel zzso zzso zzso was rarely described in other zzso This study illustrated the importance of molecular surveillance in tracking zzso strains in large teaching hospitals, suggested the horizontal transfer of zzso zzso genes contributed to the dissemination of zzso zzso in hospital zzso and emphasized the need for zzso zzso
