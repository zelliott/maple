The plant hormone zzso regulates virtually every aspect of plant growth and zzso zzso acts by binding the zzso protein transport inhibitor response 1 zzso and promotes the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that efficient zzso binding requires assembly of an zzso zzso complex consisting of zzso and an zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso and quantitative zzso binding zzso using zzso proteins showed that different combinations of zzso and zzso proteins form zzso complexes with a wide range of zzso zzso zzso affinity seems to be largely determined by the zzso As there are 6 zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and 29 zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso interactions may result in many zzso with distinct zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso selectively binds the zzso zzso zzso This zzso system zzso the effective concentration range of the hormone and may contribute to the complexity of zzso zzso
