zzso is a major neurotransmitter of the cochlear zzso zzso Based on its high level of expression in hair cells, the recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Cell 79 zzso zzso is likely to be the zzso zzso for zzso in hair cells either as a zzso complex or with other zzso yet to be zzso To further study this zzso we cloned and zzso zzso zzso from the guinea pig organ of zzso library zzso and zzso zzso zzso 62 (1992) zzso The sequence of the guinea pig zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso with identities of zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso Most differences are in the zzso loop domain between the zzso segments 3 and zzso We also observed minor differences in the putative zzso binding zzso zzso differences between zzso receptors on outer hair cells of rat and guinea pig have been reported, and the minor structural changes we observe could account for these zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed a high expression of zzso in the organ of zzso while expression was low or not detected in the spiral zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed expression of zzso zzso in both inner and outer hair cells, with much higher expression in outer hair cells than in inner hair zzso In the inner hair cell, silver grains were more abundant over the zzso part of the cell than over the zzso zzso zzso showed a pattern of distribution of the zzso protein similar to that seen for zzso with in zzso zzso zzso was most intense at the bases of both inner and outer hair zzso To determine the effect of hair cell loss on zzso zzso hair cells were destroyed by either systemic or local application of zzso This treatment led to a down regulation of zzso in hair zzso this down regulation appeared to zzso hair cell zzso In the spiral zzso a transient up regulation of zzso as determined by zzso was seen 4-6 weeks after zzso zzso
