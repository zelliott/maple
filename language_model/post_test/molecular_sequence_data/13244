Although the origin of zzso zzso to zzso DNA is not known, the zzso structures of such zzso indicate that they are produced in response to zzso zzso In accordance with this, results from experiments using artificial complexes of DNA and zzso zzso for zzso have indicated that DNA may induce these zzso zzso the zzso of DNA in zzso may depend upon other structures or processes that may render DNA zzso We report that in zzso expression of a single zzso zzso the zzso virus T zzso is sufficient to initiate production of zzso DNA and zzso zzso but not a panel of other zzso zzso of a zzso zzso T zzso did result in strong production of zzso to the T zzso but only borderline levels of zzso to DNA and no zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA containing the complete zzso sequence for T zzso did not evoke such immune responses, indicating that DNA by itself is not zzso in zzso The results represent a conceptual advance in understanding a potential molecular basis for initiation of zzso in systemic lupus zzso
