Using DNA zzso tracking zzso we characterized human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso genetic populations in multiple blood plasma samples collected over an average of 7 months from 24 chronically infected human zzso We observed complex and dynamic zzso genetic populations in most zzso Comparisons of zzso and zzso population changes over the course of the study showed that major shifts in genetic populations frequently occurred in one region but not the other, and these observations were independently confirmed in one subject by zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso regions of zzso often evolve independently during chronic zzso
