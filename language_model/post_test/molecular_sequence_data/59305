Among zzso secondary structures zzso zzso have been much less zzso studied than zzso zzso mainly because of the lack of well characterized model zzso In the present paper the secondary structure of a zzso de zzso zzso consisting of 26 zzso acids zzso and the corresponding double zzso acid replacement set have been studied by circular zzso and zzso infrared zzso The model zzso was found to be zzso in zzso solution at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but to adopt a predominantly zzso structure in the presence of 15 zzso sodium zzso zzso or at zzso zzso Although the zzso is composed of zzso acids with low zzso zzso it formed a zzso zzso structure in zzso zzso The zzso acid replacement set was zzso in order to study the zzso stability of the model zzso selectively in distinct zzso The data show that both the zzso present in 50% zzso as well as the zzso domain formed in the presence of sodium zzso zzso or at zzso zzso are located in the region between zzso and zzso zzso substitution of adjacent zzso acids by their corresponding zzso acids provides a pronounced zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that double zzso acid replacements may be used to locate zzso zzso in zzso
