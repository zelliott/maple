The zzso acid sequence of zzso a zzso zzso zzso from a tropical plant, revealed an additional zzso extension at its zzso zzso The role of this extension zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity, folding and stability of the zzso is zzso For this study, we expressed two zzso forms of the zzso in zzso coli, one retaining the zzso and the other with it zzso The zzso with the extension shows zzso zzso zzso at a higher pH of zzso whereas deletion of the extension results in a more active form of the zzso This zzso was not found to be zzso during zzso or by limited zzso by different external zzso zzso modeling and simulation studies revealed that the zzso blocks some of the zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and thereby partially zzso accessibility of the zzso to the active site, which also corroborates the experimental zzso The zzso in the model structure shows tight packing with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso by strong zzso and zzso zzso thus restricting accessibility of its zzso sites to the zzso itself or to the external zzso zzso stability analyses zzso and zzso ) and zzso experiments show similar zzso stability and zzso efficiency for both zzso These data suggest that the zzso has an zzso role in the zzso activity of zzso but does not have a major role either in stabilizing the zzso or in its folding zzso
