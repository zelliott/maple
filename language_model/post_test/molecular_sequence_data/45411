zzso interference is a widely used tool for analysis of gene function in zzso zzso zzso zzso of specific target genes can be maintained in cell lines and live organisms using zzso delivery of short zzso zzso driven by zzso zzso III zzso Here we describe a zzso incorporating the human zzso promoter for zzso gene zzso in the zzso embryonic zzso stem cell zzso Our preliminary experiments with the zzso zzso expression zzso indicated that its activity could be hindered by random zzso zzso In order to counter this zzso zzso we inserted a zzso region sequence to generate an zzso zzso zzso We compared the effects of zzso versus exclusion of the zzso sequence on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso III and zzso A zzso While the zzso sequence is not strongly correlated with the zzso status of the expression zzso our studies indicate that inclusion of the zzso element significantly enhances the stability of zzso gene zzso in the zzso stem zzso
