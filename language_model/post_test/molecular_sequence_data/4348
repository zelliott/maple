The zzso factors zzso and zzso are known to be involved in the regulation of the zzso of zzso and their specific zzso Since the zzso of zzso is responsible for the zzso degradation in zzso arthritis zzso exact analysis of zzso levels of zzso and zzso ex zzso may serve to monitor progression or zzso of the disease activity in zzso Here we report on a method based on a quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso for rapid zzso of the zzso levels of the immediate early genes zzso and zzso zzso with suitable internal standards, easily generated by the use of hybrid zzso allows us to zzso measure zzso and zzso induction levels in low numbers of cultured cells or very small tissue samples obtained by zzso zzso The sensitivity of the method was zzso zzso for zzso and 10 zzso for zzso zzso
