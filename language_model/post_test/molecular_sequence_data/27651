zzso is an zzso of the human zzso blood group system carried by a zzso zzso residing in the zzso zzso We examined the structure, organization, and inheritance of zzso gene identified in zzso DNA from an Oriental zzso Southern zzso detected a useful genetic marker tightly linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and secondary restriction analyses showed that zzso gene is a fusion hybrid of delta and alpha zzso zzso zzso mapping by extensive use of synthetic zzso with overlapping sequence zzso allowed us to define the zzso junction site and disclose the organization of the zzso zzso The junction point of zzso hybrid gene is zzso by an zzso zzso sequence of the delta gene at the zzso site, and an expressed sequence of the alpha gene spanning zzso 59 through 71, at the 3' zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the occurrence of zzso gene as a single copy in the zzso Blood group zzso evaluated by DNA zzso established the tight linkage of zzso to the alpha M and delta S zzso The data support a single unequal zzso event between zzso delta and alpha genes on the zzso zzso as the mechanism for the origin of zzso zzso The zzso gene is similar in overall structure to another zzso hybrid zzso zzso but differs from it in junction structure, copy number, gene linkage, and zzso zzso
