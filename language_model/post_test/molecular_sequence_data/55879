zzso are zzso and zzso peptides that contain zzso zzso acid zzso including six zzso zzso whose zzso zzso bonds zzso and stabilize them in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso processing of zzso zzso acid precursor zzso the constitute zzso zzso of the total cellular protein in human and rabbit zzso zzso zzso and are also produced by rabbit lung zzso and by mouse and rabbit small zzso zzso zzso Despite their prominence in rat zzso zzso are not found in zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso includes gram positive and gram negative bacteria, zzso zzso zzso many zzso and some enveloped zzso zzso exert zzso zzso activity against a wide range of normal and zzso targets, including cells resistant to zzso and zzso zzso They appear to kill zzso target cells and zzso by a common zzso which involves initial zzso interactions with zzso charged target cell surface molecules zzso the head groups of polar membrane zzso followed by zzso into the cell zzso which they zzso forming zzso zzso In addition to their zzso and zzso properties, some zzso act as zzso while others inhibit protein zzso C, bind specifically to the zzso zzso and block zzso or act as selective zzso for zzso zzso are a newly delineated family of zzso molecules whose contribution to host defense, zzso and zzso may be considerable for humans, even though it is unlikely to be revealed by zzso with zzso
