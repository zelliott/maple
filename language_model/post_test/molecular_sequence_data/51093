We have developed a simple procedure to incorporate an zzso complex at a rationally selected site within a full-length zzso Our procedure has two steps: In step 1, we use zzso zzso to introduce a unique zzso zzso zzso at the site of zzso In step 2, we zzso the resulting protein with zzso a novel aromatic zzso zzso of zzso We have used this procedure to incorporate an zzso complex at zzso acid 2 of the zzso motif of each of two zzso motif zzso DNA binding zzso zzso gene zzso protein zzso and zzso and we have analyzed zzso DNA affinity zzso by the resulting protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA at base pair 2 of the DNA zzso in the zzso complex, and the zzso zzso zzso DNA at base pairs zzso to 5 of the DNA zzso in the zzso zzso We zzso that zzso acid 2 of the zzso motif of zzso is close to base pair 2 of the DNA zzso in the zzso complex in solution and that zzso acid 2 of the zzso motif of zzso is close to base pairs zzso to 5 of the DNA zzso in the zzso complex in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
