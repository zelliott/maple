A zzso protein zzso zzso termed zzso zzso enriched zzso was previously isolated and zzso zzso studies with a zzso zzso zzso recognized several zzso zzso and suggested that additional zzso zzso zzso This study reports the isolation of two alternatively spliced transcripts of the zzso zzso One of these, zzso (with a predicted molecular mass of 20 zzso was further characterized and found to lack the zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis detected a zzso zzso zzso message in mouse zzso The second alternatively spliced transcript, zzso has a zzso open reading frame that encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 61 zzso and contains a single zzso zzso zzso The zzso organization responsible for the novel zzso and zzso sequences was determined in the mouse zzso zzso zzso We propose that the original zzso along with zzso and zzso are members of a zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may have distinct functions within the central nervous zzso
