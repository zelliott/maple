zzso growth factor beta 4 zzso 4) is unique to avian species, though its roles in zzso have not yet been well zzso In this paper we describe the expression and partial characterization of zzso chicken zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso system in a modified zzso methodology we generated the zzso of zzso sequence zzso the zzso 4 zzso which was zzso cloned into zzso and zzso into the Chinese zzso zzso cell line zzso A cell line zzso expressing zzso 4 precursor protein was established from zzso zzso zzso mature zzso 4 inhibited the growth of mink lung zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 4 also zzso the expression of type I zzso and enhanced heat shock protein 47 zzso expression in chicken zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso beta 4 is likely regulated through zzso of heat shock zzso factor 1 zzso Because the presence of zzso 1 has not been documented in avian cells and our data show that zzso 4 elicits biological activities in chicken zzso cells, which closely parallel that of zzso 1, we propose that zzso 4 plays roles in avian species similar to what zzso 1 plays in zzso zzso
