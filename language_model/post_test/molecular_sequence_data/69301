The zzso to zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was amplified using the zzso chain zzso This DNA zzso was cloned and zzso and various deletion zzso derived from the zzso zzso region were fused to the zzso zzso zzso These reporter genes were analyzed in transient zzso zzso using primary cultured human zzso zzso obtained from patients with zzso of zzso Two distinct regions upstream from the zzso start site, which was determined using zzso zzso analysis, were identified to be responsive to the oxygen tension in culture zzso values of 150 or 40 zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso revealed proteins closely zzso to two sequences located at zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso We have designated these oxygen responsive elements zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso corresponding to each site have demonstrated the formation of specific complexes using both cultured human zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso bind disparate proteins with equal precision as bound complexes could be zzso away with identical sequences but not with either the other ORE or an unrelated zzso zzso of these oxygen responsive elements into a reporter gene governed by a zzso promoter similarly regulated zzso zzso activity according to the oxygen tension in zzso
