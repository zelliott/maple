The zzso zzso zzso specific for type zzso collagen zzso zzso Gordon, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van der zzso zzso and Olsen, zzso zzso (1989) zzso Cell zzso in zzso was used to characterize the intact form of type zzso collagen from chick zzso leg zzso On an zzso of a zzso zzso gel of zzso zzso one sharp band is recognized by the zzso at Mr zzso zzso while two fuzzy and poorly resolved bands are seen at Mr zzso 270,000 and Mr zzso zzso By zzso of zzso zzso culture media and zzso of the zzso material, bands with the same zzso are observed, indicating that type zzso collagen is not zzso processed in the zzso zzso Type zzso collagen was extracted from zzso with 1 M zzso in a zzso buffer and partially zzso by zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso using dot zzso to monitor the zzso zzso highly enriched in bacterial zzso proteins with the same zzso properties as type zzso collagen were zzso These zzso did not stain with zzso blue and neither they nor the zzso type zzso collagen were affected by zzso ABC zzso indicating that type zzso collagen is not a zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by affinity zzso on an zzso column and further zzso by gel zzso Its zzso zzso acid sequence was shown to be unique, demonstrating that type zzso collagen is a zzso zzso 1 zzso After bacterial zzso zzso both the zzso zzso preparation and the zzso zzso extract fraction showed by gel zzso the presence of a large zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso of the zzso type zzso fraction demonstrated that the zzso has the structure of a cross consisting of a 75 zzso zzso tail, a central zzso and three 60 zzso arms each ending in a small zzso After heat zzso and zzso only a very large zzso can be seen, attached to the triple zzso zzso These results show that type zzso collagen has a unique structure and is different from the other zzso constituents described so zzso
