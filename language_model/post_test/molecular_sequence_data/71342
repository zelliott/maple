zzso of zzso precursor proteins across the zzso outer membrane is facilitated by the zzso of the outer membrane zzso zzso By using zzso zzso we have mapped interactions between TOM proteins and a zzso precursor protein arrested at two distinct zzso stage A zzso at 0 degrees zzso and stage B zzso at 30 degrees zzso in the zzso across the outer membrane at high resolution not achieved zzso Although the stage A and stage B zzso were assigned previously to the forms bound to the zzso site and the trans site of the TOM complex, respectively, the results of zzso indicate that the zzso of the zzso at both stage A and stage B is already on the trans side of the outer zzso The mature domain is unfolded and bound to zzso at stage B whereas it remains folded at stage zzso After zzso from the TOM complex, zzso of the stage B zzso but not of the stage A zzso across the inner membrane was promoted by the zzso domain of zzso We propose a new model for protein zzso across the outer zzso where zzso of the zzso and unfolding of the mature domain are not necessarily zzso
