Nine zzso components containing zzso inhibitor activity were isolated from zzso zzso seeds by zzso zzso gel zzso affinity zzso and zzso in an overall yield of zzso of activity and zzso of zzso The components obtained with highest yield of total activity and highest specific activity were zzso by zzso degradation and their molecular masses determined by mass zzso The zzso contained 31, 32 and 27 zzso per zzso and their sequences were: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which differed by an zzso E in the zzso form, were not zzso under the conditions zzso The sequences are consistent with consensus sequences obtained from 37 other zzso zzso where capital letters are zzso zzso acid zzso and lower case letters are the most preserved in this zzso zzso and zzso form complexes with zzso with a zzso zzso and have zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
