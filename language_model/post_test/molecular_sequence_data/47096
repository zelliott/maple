zzso transport across cell zzso is zzso by a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso The retinal zzso zzso zzso expresses a unique member of this family, zzso A portion of the human zzso gene was cloned by zzso chain reaction using zzso designed from rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The human zzso sequence was used to design zzso to clone human zzso zzso and to identify a bacterial artificial zzso clone containing the human zzso zzso The human zzso zzso contained a zzso open reading frame with a deduced zzso sequence zzso identical to rat zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequences revealed that the zzso gene was composed of five zzso distributed over 5 zzso of zzso The zzso borders were zzso between the human and the chicken zzso zzso Using radiation hybrid zzso the zzso gene was mapped to zzso 22 between markers zzso and zzso A search of zzso 22 in the zzso Centre database confirmed the location of the human zzso gene at zzso
