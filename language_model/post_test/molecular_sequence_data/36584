zzso analysis of the low density zzso zzso zzso gene was performed in Norwegian subjects zzso for familial zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA, using an zzso 18 specific probe and the restriction zzso zzso showed that two out of 57 unrelated FH subjects had an abnormal zzso zzso zzso Further analyses revealed that this abnormal band was due to a zzso zzso deletion that included zzso 16 and zzso The zzso deletion zzso was after 245 zzso of zzso 15, and the 3' deletion zzso was in zzso 18 after zzso zzso of zzso Thus, both the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso had been zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso method was developed to identify this deletion among other Norwegian FH zzso As a result of this screening one additional subject was found out of 124 subjects zzso Thus, three out of 181 zzso unrelated Norwegian FH subject possessed this zzso The deletion was found on the same zzso in the three unrelated subjects, suggesting a common zzso zzso The deletion is identical to a deletion zzso that is very common among Finnish FH zzso However, it is not yet known whether the zzso evolved separately in the two zzso
