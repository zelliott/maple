Many cases of zzso familial Alzheimer's disease have been linked to zzso within two genes zzso the proteins zzso and zzso The zzso are zzso proteins that can be zzso zzso to generate an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso fragments of zzso but not full-length zzso were readily detected in both human and mouse cerebral zzso and in zzso and zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso was detected almost exclusively in cerebral zzso as the full-length zzso with a molecular mass of 56 zzso The association of the zzso with zzso zzso membrane zzso following the isolation of these structures from cerebral zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and subsequent zzso density zzso zzso was also zzso A minor fraction zzso of both the zzso and zzso fragments of zzso was associated with the zzso zzso membrane zzso whereas a considerably larger proportion of full-length zzso was present in the same membrane zzso In addition, a significant proportion of full-length zzso was present in a zzso zzso zzso zzso enriched in zzso The presence of the zzso in zzso zzso membrane zzso indicates a possible role for these specialized regions of the membrane in the lateral separation of Alzheimer's zzso proteins within the zzso zzso and/or in the distinct functions of these zzso
