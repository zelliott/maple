The zzso zzso was observed in zzso of zzso cells from a 3-year-old boy with zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso Since this zzso is a zzso marker of zzso we undertook to investigate its mode of formation and role in zzso The zzso zzso on zzso 14 occurs in zzso the same band wherein lies the zzso zzso zzso chain zzso and Southern zzso analysis of peripheral blood and bone zzso DNA uncovered a zzso zzso in the D zzso delta region of this zzso DNA encompassing the zzso was isolated by molecular zzso and further analysis revealed it to be the zzso zzso zzso sequence determination of the junction indicates that the zzso zzso occurs immediately adjacent to the D delta 2 gene zzso zzso the zzso arose as an zzso zzso between the downstream zzso signal of D delta 2 and a zzso zzso signal adjacent to the zzso 11 zzso Finally, comparison of the zzso in band zzso with those of other zzso zzso identified a zzso cluster region of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso of which may promote the development of zzso
