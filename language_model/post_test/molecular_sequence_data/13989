The zzso zzso zzso complex is an unusual electron transfer zzso Its principal zzso zzso zzso is a zzso integral membrane protein consisting of two zzso zzso and zzso We used a novel method to measure precisely the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in high purity from human zzso membrane preparations using a novel affinity zzso zzso We performed direct zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso and detected two zzso acid sequences which matched predicted sequences for zzso and zzso We zzso amounts of both zzso acids released from zzso and zzso in each sequencing zzso zzso over 25 cycles, the mean zzso ratio of released zzso acids was zzso zzso zzso To correct for recovery differences between individual zzso zzso we measured individual zzso ratios for the eight different zzso acids common to both zzso and zzso in the first 25 zzso The mean of individual zzso ratios for the eight common zzso acids was zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios for each of the eight common zzso acids varied from zzso to zzso Taken together, measured ratios for total and individual zzso acids are consistent with a predicted ratio of zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
