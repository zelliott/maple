zzso release zzso by the zzso zzso zzso regulates many important cell functions including zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, by which membrane zzso controls the opening of zzso via the zzso zzso Among the three zzso zzso zzso mediates skeletal muscle zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso cannot substitute for zzso We carried out expression experiments using cultured zzso skeletal zzso not having intrinsic zzso zzso release channels to study the zzso relationship of zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this region the zzso acid sequences are highly divergent between zzso and zzso and the corresponding sequence is lacking in zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso rescued zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of either the entire zzso region or its zzso half from zzso preserved the function of zzso as a zzso release channel but resulted in the loss of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region for the corresponding sequence of zzso had no effect on the function of zzso These results indicate that the presence of the zzso region is critical for zzso zzso in skeletal muscle, although the zzso region alone cannot determine the functional difference between zzso and zzso
