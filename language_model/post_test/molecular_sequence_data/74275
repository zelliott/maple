zzso proteins play a major role in the regulation of zzso zzso They are recruited to activated receptors and can suppress signaling by different mechanisms including targeting of the zzso complex for zzso zzso The activity of zzso proteins is regulated at different levels including zzso control and zzso zzso We describe here a novel regulatory mechanism for zzso one of the members of this protein zzso A zzso zzso deficient in recruitment of the zzso zzso complex completely failed to suppress zzso zzso This zzso was not caused by altered turnover of zzso but by loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso no such effect was seen for binding to zzso The interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso complex, which depends on the levels of zzso zzso zzso was easily zzso This regulatory mechanism may be unique for zzso as similar zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no functional zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso box not only plays a role in the formation of zzso zzso complexes but, at least for zzso can also regulate the binding modus of zzso zzso zzso
