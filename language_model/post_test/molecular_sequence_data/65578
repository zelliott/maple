We previously demonstrated that the orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is highly expressed in zzso and zzso regulates osteogenesis and expression of zzso markers in the rat zzso cell differentiation system, and is zzso in the rat zzso model of zzso zzso There are conflicting published data on the zzso regulation by zzso of the gene for zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein required in bone zzso and a potential direct target zzso zzso effects in zzso We therefore zzso zzso gene regulation by zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines using a mouse zzso 2 zzso zzso promoter zzso A minimal zzso promoter zzso spanning from zzso to zzso zzso is activated in zzso cells but zzso it in zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso response element in this minimal zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso function 2 zzso domain or a naturally occurring zzso zzso of zzso zzso were all better zzso than zzso zzso in zzso cells, activities that were generally paralleled by repression in zzso zzso Finally, we found that the zzso of zzso harbors a zzso domain that acts in a cell zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an zzso target gene whose promoter is regulated by zzso in a cell zzso manner and that a predicted zzso zzso in zzso or a more flexible zzso 12 increases zzso zzso activity, effects with implications for zzso as a therapeutic target in zzso
