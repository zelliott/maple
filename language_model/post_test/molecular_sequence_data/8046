We have characterized two copies of a zzso zzso DNA element that we call zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The two copies of Wendy reside in different zzso regions at opposite positions in the zzso zzso Like many mobile DNA zzso both copies of Wendy are bordered by zzso repeats and contain several additional zzso copies of these repeat sequences in direct or zzso zzso In addition, four zzso are repeated in direct zzso Two major open reading frames zzso are predicted from the DNA sequence of Wendy zzso These zzso are zzso from a promoter inside the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the larger of these zzso shares some weak similarities with sequence motifs of zzso and zzso of other mobile zzso Wendy II appears to be altered relative to Wendy I by point zzso and small deletions and insertions which destroy the zzso The leader sequence of the Wendy transcript is nearly identical with the leader sequence of the zzso transcript of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso (where the complete Wendy was also zzso Furthermore, both copies of Wendy are bracketed by gene clusters that are separated in zzso zzso but are zzso in zzso zzso where they exist in an zzso orientation compared with zzso zzso Wendy was not found in any of the completely zzso zzso zzso of rice, zzso zzso zzso or zzso nor in any other zzso zzso Our results suggest that Wendy has invaded zzso zzso after divergence from other zzso zzso zzso illegitimate zzso or zzso zzso events or both may have contributed to scrambling of the zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso of other zzso
