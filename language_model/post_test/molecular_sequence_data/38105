The zzso zzso zzso Model for regulation of growth in plants is based on the simultaneous zzso and incorporation of new zzso into the cell wall observed in growing plant zzso The zzso of growth in rice zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso confirms similar results observed previously in zzso zzso and provides direct evidence for a role of zzso in control of plant zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that these sequences are not related to any other previously known family of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso should be classified as a new zzso group zzso zzso These discoveries enable new initiatives for further investigation of the zzso role in control of plant zzso
