Floral zzso usually initiate at fixed positions in concentric whorls within a zzso Although it is understood that floral zzso genes determine the identity of floral zzso the mechanisms of position determination and the development of each organ have not been clearly zzso We isolated a novel zzso rabbit ears zzso with defects in zzso zzso In zzso zzso petals are formed at the correct position in a zzso and the initiation of zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso affects the second zzso organ shapes independently of the organ zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and is located in the nucleus, and thus may be a zzso zzso zzso transcripts are expressed in zzso zzso and their precursor cells, and disappeared at later zzso When cells that express zzso are zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts downstream of zzso and zzso zzso These characteristics suggest that zzso is required for the early development of the organ zzso of the second zzso
