In zzso zzso cell suspensions, the expression of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso induced by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso To identify molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of these zzso a zzso zzso screening was performed with an zzso part of the zzso zzso This screening identified three members of the zzso zzso factor zzso zinc finger protein family from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These proteins bind in a zzso manner to the zzso and zzso promoters in zzso and repress the activity of these promoters in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso proteins can repress the zzso activity of zzso zzso domain zzso factors, the zzso on the zzso zzso The expression of the zzso genes is rapidly induced by zzso extract and zzso These results suggest that the zzso proteins act as zzso in the regulation of zzso secondary metabolism in zzso zzso
