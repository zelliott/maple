zzso of the zzso zzso with the axis of cell division is an essential process in zzso zzso that is zzso by interactions between zzso zzso and the cell zzso We found that a cortical zzso the zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso Two striking abnormalities were observed in zzso zzso First, the initial movement of the zzso pole body zzso toward the emerging bud was zzso This zzso is similar to that previously observed in cells lacking the zzso zzso and, in fact, zzso and zzso were found to be in the same genetic zzso Second, abnormal pulling interactions between zzso and the zzso appeared to cause zzso zzso in zzso cells to transit back and forth between the mother and the zzso We therefore propose that zzso may zzso or alter the function of cortical zzso sites in the zzso Additionally, we present evidence that other bipolar bud site zzso together with cortical zzso are also required for zzso zzso
