Analysis of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected three zzso zzso at the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso with no intervening stop zzso This tandem zzso arrangement is zzso between humans and the mouse and is unique among the genes of the classical zzso Until now it was assumed that the principal open reading frame zzso starts at zzso Our experiments showed that: zzso translation of the zzso zzso under the zzso promoter starts predominantly at zzso leading to the generation of a 55 zzso acid sequence preceding the signal zzso zzso the longer form is being likewise correctly processed into mature zzso zzso the translation of the region between zzso and zzso zzso the overall zzso a feature which depends on the sequence of the zzso zzso Specifically, a sequence of 13 zzso acids containing multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso In the absence of zzso these previously zzso characteristics of the zzso of the zzso present a novel mechanism to zzso and potentially to regulate zzso
