zzso libraries were generated within the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso pol gene zzso the zzso H zzso of reverse zzso zzso as well as the structurally related zzso and human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso were zzso based and resulted in zzso zzso zzso within an zzso IN bacterial expression zzso were based on zzso and resulted in zzso zzso The effects of the insertions were examined in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso A total of 178 individual zzso zzso were zzso 40 zzso insertions within zzso zzso zzso 108 zzso insertions within zzso 13 insertions zzso stop zzso within zzso zzso and 17 insertions zzso stop zzso within zzso For zzso zzso 56 zzso were zzso In both zzso and zzso zzso regions are identified which functionally tolerate zzso zzso For zzso these zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the junction between the IN core and C zzso and the C zzso of zzso For zzso zzso in addition to the junction between the IN core and C zzso and the C zzso of zzso insertions between the N zzso and core zzso maintained integration and disintegration zzso Of the 40 zzso insertions within the zzso zzso zzso H zzso only the three zzso insertions mapping to the zzso zzso junction were zzso These results correlate with deletion studies mapping the domain and zzso boundaries of zzso and zzso zzso these genetic zzso provide a means to identify zzso regions within zzso and IN for targeted gene therapy zzso
