The industrial zzso zzso zzso zzso high yields of an alkaline zzso zzso zzso which is zzso as a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso We investigated the possibility of using this system for the zzso of human zzso factor zzso zzso a zzso This protein is naturally zzso in the plasma by an unknown, signal zzso mechanism and has so far been found to be zzso in zzso We have designed six hybrid genes zzso fusion proteins between increasing portions of the zzso zzso and the precursor or mature forms of zzso All zzso directed zzso of the zzso precursor into the zzso zzso Transport of the zzso and zzso hybrid precursor to the zzso apparatus appeared to be strongly rate limiting, and most of the precursors appeared to be partially zzso One of these zzso directed the zzso zzso of a low amount of zzso zzso These results indicate that fusion to the zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso stretch allows zzso to be zzso albeit zzso through the zzso zzso and to follow a classical zzso zzso
