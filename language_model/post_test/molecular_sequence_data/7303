The area of foot and mouth disease virus zzso zzso zzso 140 and 160 of zzso protein zzso has been used extensively as an zzso in natural and experimental zzso A detailed zzso mapping of this region, however, has not been zzso For this purpose a synthetic zzso containing the zzso 135 to 160 zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso was analyzed for its zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is highly zzso either by itself or coupled to a carrier protein zzso elicits a long-lasting zzso zzso response in mice, and provides solid protection against virulent zzso By using a set of synthetic zzso overlapping zzso which cover the entire sequence zzso of zzso we have shown that at least four discrete B zzso are regularly distributed along the zzso Although zzso with each of the zzso coupled with zzso as a carrier protein induced zzso zzso responses, individually none of the zzso was able to induce zzso zzso However, zzso zzso sorted by zzso zzso using each of the zzso revealed the existence of at least four discrete zzso sites: one spanning zzso zzso at least two more between zzso 140 and zzso and another in the region zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were identified, both by zzso proliferation zzso and by adoptive cell zzso By both methods, a zzso zzso was located in the area zzso zzso zzso the cell transfer experiment, which seems to be more sensitive, also identified a second zzso zzso between zzso 150 and zzso Interestingly, when the region zzso which contains both zzso and zzso zzso was in a tandem repeat zzso it induced a strong zzso zzso response in mice and solid protection against the zzso
