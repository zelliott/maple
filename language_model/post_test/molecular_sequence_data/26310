zzso acid is the first committed precursor for the synthesis of zzso such as zzso and zzso In many organisms zzso is zzso from zzso in a three-step zzso zzso zzso The key step in this conversion is a zzso reduction of zzso to zzso zzso is a specific zzso for an zzso zzso zzso zzso which is capable of zzso recognition of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso it zzso both in protein and in zzso zzso This reduction reaction represents a novel role for zzso where it zzso in a zzso conversion of its zzso acid into a low molecular weight zzso which is subsequently not used in zzso bond zzso
