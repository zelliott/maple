The microbial populations in zzso agricultural soil and casts of the earthworm zzso zzso were examined by zzso and molecular zzso zzso libraries of the zzso zzso genes were prepared from DNA isolated directly from the soil and earthworm zzso Although no single zzso dominated the soil library of 95 zzso the largest numbers of clones were from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While the cast clone library of 102 clones was similar to the soil library, the zzso of several zzso were zzso Representatives of the zzso zzso as well as the zzso and zzso increased in number, and one group of zzso organisms found in the soil library was absent in the cast zzso Likewise, soil and cast zzso zzso zzso gene libraries were similar, although the zzso of some groups were zzso Two hundred and thirty zzso bacteria were also isolated on general zzso media from zzso zzso and zzso The cast zzso were both zzso and zzso different from the soil zzso The cast zzso were more likely to reduce zzso grow on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso fewer zzso than the soil zzso On the basis of their zzso the cast zzso were dominated by zzso zzso zzso which were not found in the soil zzso and other zzso zzso In contrast, the soil zzso were mostly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained from the sides of earthworm burrows were not different from the soil zzso Diversity zzso for the collections of zzso as well as zzso gene libraries indicated that the species richness and zzso were decreased in the casts from their levels in the zzso These results were consistent with a model where a large portion of the microbial population in soil passes through the gastrointestinal tract of the earthworm unchanged while representatives of some zzso increase in zzso
