The soluble zzso sensitive factor attachment protein zzso zzso family of proteins is required for zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso fusion for formation of the zzso membrane zzso a membrane compartment that forms de zzso during zzso zzso requires zzso function, zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso D zzso zzso which generates zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso production while the functionally redundant zzso in zzso growth, zzso is zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso bind similarly in zzso to PA or zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso domain largely mediates zzso Both green fluorescent zzso fusion proteins zzso to the developing zzso in zzso cells and to the zzso pole body in zzso cells induced to zzso However, the zzso region of zzso binds zzso zzso in zzso with a greater ability than the equivalent region of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells induced to zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso activity is not increased under these conditions, indicating that zzso has roles in addition to stimulating zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso PA and zzso collaborate at multiple levels to promote zzso fusion for zzso zzso
