Based on in zzso selection of effective zzso zzso from two different zzso gene libraries in which several zzso in the D and zzso were randomized, we show that the position of the zzso zzso in the zzso normally formed between zzso zzso zzso with the length of the zzso When the zzso has the normal zzso the position of the zzso zzso in the zzso is always such that it zzso two zzso zzso zzso for the zzso that fills the space between the D and zzso However, when the zzso becomes zzso the position of the zzso zzso changes in the way that more zzso are now allocated to the zzso zzso so that the total length of the zzso and of the zzso remains the zzso Such compensation guarantees that in all zzso the D and zzso are always juxtaposed in the standard zzso It also demonstrates the major role of the two zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso
