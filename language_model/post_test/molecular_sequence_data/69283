A set of zzso zzso zzso with one, two, or all zzso acid zzso replaced by the corresponding zzso zzso and two zzso with zzso and zzso instead of zzso were zzso and tested as zzso for protein zzso zzso All of the peptides were zzso by the zzso The zzso rate of the reaction with the zzso zzso was more than one order of magnitude lower than that for zzso zzso with zzso The same applied to the peptides with zzso or with zzso in position zzso with respect to zzso The zzso values for the peptides containing one zzso acid were close to that for the zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, when two or more zzso acids were present, the zzso value increased zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso also reduced the zzso rate and increased the zzso zzso One can conclude that the zzso of protein zzso C is much less pronounced than that of protein zzso A, which is in agreement with the less clearly pronounced zzso specificity of the former zzso
