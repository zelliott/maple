The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 66 zzso is zzso as a precursor zzso 112 zzso composed of the zzso signal zzso of 27 zzso zzso the mature zzso part and a large zzso zzso When the zzso gene is expressed in zzso coli under the control of the zzso promoter, the mature zzso is zzso into the medium through the outer zzso whereas zzso and two zzso zzso (40 zzso and zzso zzso zzso processed from the zzso domain, are accumulated in the membrane zzso Although treatment of the intact cells with zzso caused slight zzso of zzso and zzso the main parts of zzso and zzso both of which are detected in the outer zzso were resistant to zzso even after the cells had been zzso zzso zzso with this, a high content of zzso structure in zzso was suggested by marked zzso as determined by their zzso zzso on zzso zzso These findings suggest rigid integration of zzso and zzso in the outer zzso Upon induction of the zzso promoter, rapid zzso of zzso into the medium was first accompanied by the zzso of zzso in the outer zzso which was followed by conversion of zzso to zzso zzso was not detected during the zzso of zzso in the zzso but it was gradually accumulated after the zzso of zzso had reached a zzso In addition, zzso still containing the intact zzso signal zzso was completely zzso with zzso when added to zzso shocked zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
