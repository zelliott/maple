Host zzso to zzso rely on a coordinated interplay between the innate and zzso responses of zzso zzso with zzso bacteria triggers an immediate innate response requiring zzso zzso and natural killer cells, whereas subsequent zzso of an zzso response through development of zzso zzso 1 cells zzso proceeds during persistent zzso To understand the zzso role of zzso protein 2 zzso also known as zzso and zzso we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the gene coding for zzso Here we show that zzso mice exhibit a profoundly decreased ability to defend against infection by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso or treated with zzso zzso have decreased zzso of zzso whereas dominant negative zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 4 and zzso In zzso zzso mice were resistant to the lethal effects of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso results in impaired zzso production in both zzso and natural killer cells, attributed in part to defective zzso zzso zzso Our data reflect requirements for zzso in multiple pathways regulating immune and inflammatory zzso
