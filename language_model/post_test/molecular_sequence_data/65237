zzso is characterized by the onset of multiple zzso zzso or peripheral zzso without involvement of the zzso zzso which is instead zzso of zzso type 2 zzso Recently, a zzso family with a zzso zzso of the zzso gene on zzso 22 has been zzso We report on the molecular analysis of the zzso and zzso genes in a series of 21 patients with zzso and in eight zzso tumors from four different zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was found in one zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso associated with loss of zzso zzso of zzso were found in two zzso of this zzso This is the second report of a zzso zzso zzso in patients affected by zzso and the first report of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The latter observation suggests that a zzso mechanism involving the zzso and zzso genes may be implicated in zzso zzso
