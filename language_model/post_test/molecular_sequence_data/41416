zzso structural zzso exist in the zzso zzso However, how they arise is not clear since there is a scarce distribution of zzso and lack of zzso in song control zzso This suggests that other receptors are zzso The zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso is a candidate but has never been investigated in zzso In this study, we characterized its gene and protein in the zebra zzso zzso Analysis of the putative zzso protein sequence revealed a strong similarity to avian and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the gene was elevated in the zzso of both sexes from zzso day zzso 15 to zzso with a zzso sex difference at zzso and zzso In comparison, expression at younger zzso ages and in adults was significantly zzso At zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso and overlapped with song control zzso Of particular interest, the number of zzso cells was greatest in zzso and zzso but less in zzso and Area zzso zzso in zzso was also zzso with more cells present in males than in zzso In parallel with the zzso by adulthood, protein expression was reduced across most brain zzso Taken together these data suggest that zzso may contribute to differences in song system development by zzso zzso responses to zzso In addition, the extensive protein distribution indicates that it may also have a role in general brain development in both zzso
