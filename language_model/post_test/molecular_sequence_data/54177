zzso zzso consists of zzso strains that cause sporadic gastrointestinal illness or epidemic zzso disease and zzso strains that grow and persist in coastal aquatic zzso Previous studies of zzso strains have shown zzso zzso to be a primarily zzso bacterial species, but zzso analyzed have been strongly biased toward zzso zzso while representing only a small sample of the vast diversity in environmental zzso In this study, we characterized zzso zzso and structure among 152 environmental zzso zzso zzso and 13 other putative zzso zzso from coastal waters and sediments in central California, as well as four clinical zzso zzso zzso using zzso sequence analysis of seven zzso zzso zzso regions were identified by at least three detection methods in zzso of our zzso zzso zzso Despite frequent zzso significant linkage zzso was still detected among the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso but zzso associations were observed for maximum likelihood zzso from the individual zzso Overall, our estimated zzso rate in zzso zzso of zzso times the zzso rate is similar to those of other sexual bacteria and appears frequently enough to restrict selection from zzso much of the neutral zzso zzso These data suggest that frequent zzso among zzso zzso may hinder the identification of zzso in this zzso zzso
