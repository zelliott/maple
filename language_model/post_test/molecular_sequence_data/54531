Little is known about the structure of the envelope zzso of zzso C virus zzso To identify new regions essential for the function of these zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso containing zzso envelope zzso E1 and zzso from different zzso in order to detect zzso zzso between these two zzso Several zzso combinations were zzso for zzso zzso Of interest, a combination of E1 from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso We therefore used this zzso complex and the recently described structural model of zzso to identify new functional regions in zzso by exchanging protein regions between these two zzso The functionality of these zzso envelope proteins in the zzso system and/or the zzso infectious virus zzso was zzso We showed that the zzso variable region zzso zzso region 2 zzso and another segment in domain II play a role in zzso zzso We also demonstrated zzso interactions within domain zzso zzso we also identified a segment zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the stem region of zzso which is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance structural analyses of the synthetic zzso zzso containing this segment revealed the presence of a central zzso zzso which likely folds upon membrane zzso Due to its location in the stem region, segment zzso is likely involved in the reorganization of the zzso complexes taking place during the fusion zzso In conclusion, our study highlights new functional and structural regions in zzso envelope zzso zzso
