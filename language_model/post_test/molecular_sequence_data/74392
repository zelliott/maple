zzso zzso nuclear body zzso zzso proteins mediate an intrinsic cellular host defense response against virus zzso zzso express proteins that zzso zzso or zzso proteins by a variety of strategies, including degradation of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso The consequences of zzso interactions during infection in zzso have yet to be investigated in detail, largely because of the zzso zzso of many human zzso zzso zzso 68 zzso is emerging as a suitable model to study basic biological questions of zzso interactions because it naturally zzso zzso zzso we sought to determine whether zzso targets zzso zzso as part of its natural life zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso degradation through a zzso mechanism and that loss of zzso results in more robust virus replication in mouse zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso degradation was zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso which shares zzso with the cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso is essential for production of infectious zzso zzso zzso are zzso in all zzso but so far have no assigned zzso Our studies shed light on a potential role for this unusual protein in zzso biology and suggest that zzso will be a useful model for investigation of zzso interactions in zzso
