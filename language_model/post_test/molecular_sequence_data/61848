zzso zzso are involved in many essential processes in zzso However, the roles of zzso and protein zzso in an zzso complex are often hard to zzso In many zzso complexes, including the zzso and the Group II zzso one main function of the protein zzso is to facilitate zzso zzso However, in other systems, the protein zzso may perform additional functions, and can affect the biological activities of the zzso zzso In this review, we use zzso P zzso P) as an example to illustrate how the protein zzso of this zzso affects different aspects of zzso zzso P plays an essential role in the processing of the precursor to transfer zzso zzso and is found in all three zzso of zzso While every cell has an zzso P zzso P) zzso only the bacterial and some of the zzso zzso P zzso zzso component of zzso P) are active in zzso in the absence of the zzso P zzso zzso P is a remarkable zzso in the fact that it has a zzso zzso core composed of zzso around which a diverse array of zzso interact to create the zzso P zzso This combination of highly zzso zzso and altered protein components is a puzzle that allows the dissection of the functional roles of protein zzso in these zzso zzso
