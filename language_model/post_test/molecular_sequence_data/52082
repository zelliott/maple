The previously described zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified at zzso 3 by incorporation of both natural and zzso zzso acids with varying zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso and delta zzso zzso binding affinities were evaluated by testing the compounds for displacement of zzso zzso zzso in a guinea pig brain zzso binding zzso zzso obtained with the bulky aromatic zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the shape of the zzso zzso with which the side chain of the internal aromatic zzso interacts differs for delta and zzso zzso This zzso of either zzso can accommodate the zzso zzso bulk of the zzso side chain but only the delta zzso can readily accept the more zzso zzso side zzso Several zzso with zzso zzso side chains in zzso 3 were zzso In general, these zzso display diminished binding to zzso and delta zzso consistent with previous findings for zzso with zzso 3 zzso of modified electronic zzso Several zzso with zzso side chains in zzso 3 were also zzso While delta zzso binding affinity is severely diminished with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso substitution is very well zzso indicating that, contrary to the widely held belief, an aromatic side chain in this portion of the zzso is not required for delta zzso zzso Where possible, comparison of results in this zzso zzso series with those reported for analogous modification in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and linear zzso zzso reveals similar zzso
