In our previous paper, we reported a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso This zzso displayed a remarkable reduction in zzso activity and an evident decrease in the intensity of the zzso band around 600 zzso zzso 1 charge transfer zzso In this study, we report the preparation of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and characterize their zzso activities, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso show no zzso activity and a great reduction in the intensity of the zzso band around 600 zzso Furthermore, their zzso zzso show no type 1 copper zzso but only a type 2 copper zzso however, zzso by zzso caused the type 1 copper signal to zzso On the other hand, zzso as expressed shows both type 1 and type 2 copper signals in its zzso spectrum, the type 1 copper atom parameters being very different from usual blue copper proteins but very similar to those of zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso for zzso is quite low zzso but the activity for zzso zzso is similar zzso to that of the wild type zzso These results indicate that zzso is important for characterizing the features of the type 1 copper of zzso zzso
