zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to the zzso zzso zzso regulatory sequence of target genes and regulate gene zzso A typical zzso consists of at least three zzso zzso repeats of the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso is able to recognize zzso zzso that contain gaps in the array of the zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso fails to recognize such sites in zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso of the zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of zzso that enabled zzso to regulate the zzso of genes containing zzso zzso The zzso facilitated zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso domain is important for this zzso zzso Furthermore, other zzso derivatives of zzso were capable of recognizing zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso is important for the zzso specificity of zzso and imply that zzso possesses the ability to bind to and regulate gene expression via various types of zzso in diverse cellular zzso
