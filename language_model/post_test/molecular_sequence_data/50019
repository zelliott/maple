zzso defensive skin zzso are complex, zzso cocktails of biologically active zzso including many zzso zzso The study of such zzso for novel zzso discovery is zzso as zzso are in rapid global zzso While zzso zzso analysis is zzso zzso analysis has until now required killing of specimens prior to skin dissection for zzso library zzso Here we present the discovery that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides are present in defensive skin secretions, stabilized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus parallel zzso zzso and zzso analyses can be performed without killing the zzso in this model zzso zzso finding that has important implications in conservation of zzso within this threatened zzso zzso and whose zzso may have broader implications in zzso zzso
