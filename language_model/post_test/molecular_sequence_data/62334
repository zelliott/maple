zzso zzso against the zzso of the high affinity zzso zzso are claimed to play a zzso role in zzso zzso The best methods for detection of functional zzso are currently the zzso serum skin test and the zzso zzso release zzso A simplified and feasible screening test would facilitate the diagnosis of zzso zzso Here we offer an explanation for the difficulties in establishing a screening test for zzso directed against the zzso of the high affinity zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso patients and healthy donors belonging to the natural zzso repertoire were found by sequence analysis of zzso zzso isolated by repertoire cloning from zzso zzso These natural zzso bound to the zzso and triggered zzso release but only if zzso was previously removed from the zzso zzso zzso used for detection of zzso directed against the zzso zzso may require signal comparison with and without the artificial removal of zzso immune complexes, and complement in order to avoid false positive or negative zzso After zzso removal diagnostic tests will detect natural zzso against the high affinity zzso zzso regardless of whether they are zzso or zzso
