Nuclear zzso filaments and associated proteins form a zzso zzso network required for transcription, zzso zzso organization and zzso regulation in zzso zzso defects cause human disease zzso and are linked to zzso zzso factor zzso is a mobile and essential component of the nuclear zzso that binds directly to zzso zzso and zzso zzso including the inner nuclear membrane protein zzso and has roles in zzso structure, zzso and gene zzso To understand zzso mechanisms of action, zzso associated proteins were zzso from zzso cell nuclear zzso using zzso zzso and identified by tandem mass zzso or independently identified and zzso using the zzso zzso We recovered A- and zzso zzso and core zzso all known to bind zzso directly, plus four human zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and several proteins and zzso that regulate zzso Association with zzso zzso was independently validated by zzso from zzso cells for seven candidates including zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso binding protein 4 zzso zzso DNA binding protein 1 zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso each associated with zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, suggesting zzso and zzso have dynamic roles in zzso integrity and might help couple DNA damage responses to the nuclear zzso zzso We conclude this zzso is a rich source of candidate partners for zzso and potentially also A- and zzso zzso which may reveal how zzso regulation and zzso integrity are linked to nuclear zzso
