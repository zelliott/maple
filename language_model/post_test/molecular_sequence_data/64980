The zzso variety caused by zzso zzso in zzso chain in zzso zzso syndrome zzso prompted the complexity of structure changes of zzso chain that was little to know zzso In this study, we expressed a domain of zzso chain containing different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were revealed in two zzso zzso with different zzso zzso and the corresponding domain of a control in zzso zzso The zzso proteins were characterized by zzso and mass zzso and analyzed the secondary structure by using circular zzso zzso zzso CD analysis showed that the zzso protein containing zzso zzso identified in the pedigree of zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso that was not found in the control zzso zzso The spectrum of the zzso protein containing zzso zzso identified in the pedigree of zzso zzso was slightly different from that of the control, that is, mostly with the random zzso and the zzso while without zzso These results demonstrated that two kinds of zzso zzso although in the same domain of zzso chain, displayed the distinctly different secondary zzso The changes of the secondary structure could explain the zzso zzso of zzso which would be hardly understood solely by analyzing zzso DNA or zzso of zzso zzso
