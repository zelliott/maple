This paper explores the connection between the size of the spectral zzso of a zzso or any other symbolic sequence and the distribution of zzso along certain zzso It explains the connection between the zzso distribution and the size of the spectral zzso and gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a zzso to have a prescribed zzso Furthermore, it gives a fast zzso for computing the value of a given spectral zzso of a zzso zzso discussing periods 3 and 4 as zzso Finally, it shows that the spectrum of a symbolic sequence is zzso in the sense that there exists a linear zzso that determines the values of all the zzso from those of a zzso
