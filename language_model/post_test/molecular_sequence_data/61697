The competence zzso system of zzso zzso consists of zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and the response regulator, zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a protein that is needed for the zzso zzso and modification of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both necessary and sufficient for the production of active zzso which is released as an zzso zzso Laboratory strain zzso and a number of natural zzso of zzso differ in the primary sequences of their zzso as well as in the masses of their zzso zzso We have shown that zzso zzso and the zzso sensor domain of zzso are highly zzso in natural zzso of zzso all closely related to the laboratory strain of zzso zzso In this study, we used two statistical tests (the ratio of synonymous and zzso substitution rates and the zzso D zzso to demonstrate that these zzso sequences evolved by diversifying selection rather than by neutral zzso We show that the choice of zzso zzso is determined by the zzso zzso sequence of zzso rather than by the zzso zzso The implications of these findings for the evolution of the zzso system and for the zzso interactions involved in determining specificity are zzso
