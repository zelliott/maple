We identified a zzso zzso of the plant zzso fungus zzso zzso that is defective in the polar distribution of cell wall components and shows abnormal zzso The affected zzso zzso was cloned by zzso It encodes a putative target soluble zzso fusion protein attachment protein zzso zzso suggesting a function in membrane zzso A zzso fusion protein localized to zzso that showed rapid zzso motion along zzso These zzso are part of the zzso zzso and accumulate at sites of active growth, thereby supporting the expansion of the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso is impaired and zzso of zzso zzso at cell poles is zzso resulting in zzso distribution of wall components and zzso zzso This suggests that a membrane recycling process via early zzso supports polar growth of zzso zzso
