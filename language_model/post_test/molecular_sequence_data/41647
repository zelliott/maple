The bacterial zzso locus encodes a zzso complex in which the zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso in the zzso A site zzso The antitoxin, zzso both binds and zzso zzso and regulates zzso through operator binding and conditional zzso controlled by zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the intact zzso coli zzso complex at zzso zzso resolution, zzso both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain that binds zzso zzso and zzso associate into a zzso zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso domain at the zzso Our structure supports a model in which zzso is zzso bound by two adjacent zzso zzso units, and is not compatible with zzso binding of two zzso zzso The results thus provide a firm basis for understanding the model of conditional zzso at the molecular zzso
