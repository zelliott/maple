During its life cycle, the zzso zzso zzso zzso nova zzso a copy of its zzso which contains zzso DNA, into a zzso containing zzso zzso DNA zzso A region of the zzso zzso has been defined that gives rise to two distinct zzso DNA molecules during zzso Through analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the generation of the two zzso DNA molecules was shown to be the result of alternative use of zzso fragmentation zzso In addition, evidence was obtained that adjacent zzso precursors of zzso DNA molecules can overlap by a few base zzso The significance of these findings in relation to zzso zzso fragmentation is zzso
