We describe a novel DNA and zzso found in the zzso of the zzso natural isolate of zzso The majority of the zzso termed zzso is an zzso zzso zzso circular zzso complementary to one strand of a low zzso zzso circular DNA, zzso zzso combines some features of the human zzso delta virus, group I zzso zzso and plant viral satellite zzso zzso zzso in zzso performs a zzso reaction whose products terminate with a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso This reaction may be involved in the natural processing zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso lacks a zzso structure or substantial sequence similarity to any other zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso structure involved in zzso may be different from those in previously characterized zzso zzso
