The tobacco zzso zzso can transpose through an zzso intermediate in the zzso host zzso zzso We report here the identification and characterization of zzso linear and circular DNA forms of zzso in this zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso linear zzso possess two extra base pairs at each end compared with zzso integrated zzso Prior to integration into the host zzso the two terminal zzso at the 3' end of these linear zzso are removed, as in the case of the zzso zzso zzso and of zzso Our data, together with those from recent studies of zzso reinforce the idea that 3' zzso zzso is not restricted to zzso zzso and is probably a feature shared by many different zzso zzso
