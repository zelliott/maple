Several regulatory sequences have been characterized in the zzso zzso We report here identification of a sequence element downstream of the zzso start site within the first 52 zzso of the zzso R region, which acts zzso on the activity of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso either including or lacking this sequence element showed that the observed effect intervenes at the zzso zzso This negative element does not affect zzso activity of the zzso zzso box, but zzso zzso induced by strong zzso Thus, we propose that this so-called negative regulatory sequence functions as an zzso of zzso
