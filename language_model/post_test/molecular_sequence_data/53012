zzso zzso functions as both a zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso development and zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso exerts its repression function by recruiting members of the Groucho zzso zzso In a zzso zzso screen, the zzso gene product zzso was identified as a zzso partner zzso Both proteins interact zzso via two separate zzso the zzso Q and central SP regions of zzso and the zzso motif and zzso zzso domain of zzso The zzso state of zzso is altered in zzso upon zzso zzso Moreover, zzso efficiently zzso the zzso activity of zzso in an zzso zzso Similar protein interactions resulting in zzso repression were also observed between zzso related members of both the zzso and Groucho protein zzso In agreement with this evolutionary zzso the zzso motif of zzso proteins functions as a zzso repression domain in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso proteins can be converted from zzso zzso to zzso through interaction with zzso of the Groucho protein zzso
