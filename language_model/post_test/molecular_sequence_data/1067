zzso immune therapies aim at the induction of zzso T cells, which ultimately should kill tumor zzso The zzso cells should, therefore, not only exert zzso activity but also home to and zzso the tumor zzso zzso monitoring of immune modulating therapies should not be restricted to the circulating pool of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso but also include zzso zzso zzso as well as the correlation of these findings to the clinical zzso We report here on the zzso zzso zzso of a melanoma patient who developed remarkably potent ex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Such potent zzso responses to multiple tumor zzso have, to the best of our knowledge, not been described previously in melanoma patients, neither spontaneously nor after any zzso This patient first experienced a transient response to therapy but finally succumbed to disease progression and zzso zzso was associated with the decline of the numbers of zzso T cells in circulation and at skin zzso in addition to the loss of zzso class I zzso The zzso analysis revealed that fully functional zzso T cells were present in the peripheral blood of this patient during the phase of a relatively stable disease, and in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that these cells were also accumulated at zzso and visceral tumor zzso Furthermore, comparative zzso mapping of zzso and zzso depicted an overlapping zzso repertoire usage among these 2 zzso Since strong zzso responses as observed in this patient are the goal of cancer vaccination but are so far only rarely observed, the thorough analysis of patients exhibiting either exceptional clinical and/or zzso responses appears critical to understanding how vaccine therapies work and can be further zzso
