In view of our more comprehensive understanding with respect to zzso pathways and their regulation, a vast number of interesting drug targets appear to be in a space that can be addressed neither by small molecules nor by zzso zzso interference with zzso zzso zzso if successful, seems to offer considerable opportunities to expand the application of peptides as zzso in particular in the field of zzso This review focuses on requirements for the development of zzso zzso aiming at zzso zzso In addition, an outlook for developments in this field based on recent examples for peptides active in cellular zzso highlighting key requirement to assess zzso is zzso
