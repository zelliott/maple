The zzso of the zzso species are known to be zzso This toxicity has been attributed to the presence of small zzso zzso of 60 zzso acid zzso designated as zzso or zzso We investigated the zzso potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso and isolated another type of zzso component which is even more potent than zzso This zzso compound, which was designated as zzso was zzso to zzso and its zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso consisting of a single chain of 118 zzso zzso A detailed investigation of the zzso effects on zzso FL cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso leukemia zzso 60 cells revealed that zzso not only altered cell viability but also prevented cell zzso This is a property that was specific to zzso since other zzso zzso from various sources had no zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was not dependent on the presence of zzso zzso unlike its zzso zzso In particular, the zzso activity of zzso was identical in the presence or absence of either 2 zzso zzso or zzso or 6 zzso zzso We also present evidence based on chemical modifications that zzso activity was not correlated with zzso zzso Thus, modification with zzso zzso totally abolished the zzso activity of zzso which nevertheless retained zzso of the zzso of native zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso gave a compound that retained zzso of the zzso activity of the parent zzso but was devoid of zzso zzso
