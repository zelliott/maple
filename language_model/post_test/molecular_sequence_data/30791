We found an activated Kirsten zzso gene in the zzso breast zzso cell line by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this cell line carries a single G to C point zzso at position 12 leading to a zzso zzso However, only a fraction of the cell population seems to contain this zzso zzso Since zzso can occur in cell lines during in zzso culture, we searched in breast zzso samples for the presence of single zzso at zzso 12, but also for the presence of the double zzso previously found in the zzso breast zzso cell zzso Using zzso chain reaction zzso we detected one primary zzso carrying a single zzso at zzso zzso No double zzso was found in any of the zzso These results show that zzso gene zzso could be involved in breast zzso albeit at a low zzso
