The avian zzso exhibits zzso in adulthood, with zzso production from zzso zone zzso precursor zzso To follow the commitment of newborn cells to zzso zzso we used their expression of the Hu family of zzso zzso proteins to identify them before their migration from the zzso Adult zzso were injected with zzso as a marker of DNA zzso sacrificed after varying zzso stained for Hu, and zzso We found that Hu was not expressed by zzso precursor cells, but rather appeared within hours in their zzso zzso which did not embark on zzso migration until 4 to 7 days zzso Hu was expressed by all zzso but not zzso both in zzso and in zzso as determined by zzso analysis as well as zzso of Hu and zzso selective zzso In addition, zzso for Hu and zzso whose expression is zzso on zzso zzso from the zzso revealed their initial zzso by zzso daughter cells still within the zzso These results suggest that Hu expression may be used as a very early indicator of zzso differentiation by zzso zzso Furthermore, the data indicate that in the adult avian brain, zzso zzso is established within hours of precursor zzso even though the zzso daughter cells do not initiate zzso migration for at least 4 days thereafter, following their zzso of zzso
