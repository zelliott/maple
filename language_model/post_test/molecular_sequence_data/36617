A zzso mercury resistance locus zzso from a spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was isolated on a 6 zzso DNA zzso by shotgun cloning into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso genes form part of a very large zzso DNA sequence present in zzso zzso zzso This element was amplified to about 20 copies per zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and was missing from strains like zzso zzso zzso cured for the zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a 5 zzso region encompassing the whole region required for zzso mercury resistance revealed six open reading frames zzso transcribed in opposite directions from a common zzso zzso The protein sequences predicted from the two zzso transcribed in one direction showed a high degree of similarity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso from other zzso and zzso zzso zzso if any, similarities were found between the predicted zzso sequences of the other four zzso and other known zzso
