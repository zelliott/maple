A zzso library was constructed from zzso prepared from zzso zzso of zzso pine zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso protein zzso were identified using a pea gene as the zzso zzso Three zzso clones were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of two of the genes corresponded to Type I and one to Type II zzso proteins which were zzso zzso zzso to their zzso zzso The transit peptides of the zzso pine zzso showed features common to zzso transit zzso The three zzso had a 70 to zzso preference for G + C in the third base zzso zzso and zzso profiles and zzso zzso position bias suggested that two of the corresponding genes lie within zzso zzso
