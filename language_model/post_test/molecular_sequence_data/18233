This paper reviews our work on the zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso in normal adult zzso and the regulation of its synthesis and that of its zzso We detected zzso alpha zzso in brain zzso and showed the zzso alpha zzso derived from the human brain stem is virtually identical to the zzso derived from human zzso zzso zzso In cells derived from anterior zzso zzso another site of zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso levels can be regulated by zzso zzso The expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso which is also the zzso alpha zzso is also zzso by zzso zzso Similar stimulation of zzso and zzso expression in human breast cancer cells was shown in response to zzso zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to stimulate its own synthesis and that of its zzso suggests the presence of an zzso positive feedback loop, however we were unable to break this loop in the breast cancer cells by zzso that blocked the interaction of zzso alpha with the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso alpha expression appears to require protein zzso C, since zzso of this zzso blocked the ability of zzso to stimulate these zzso These studies raise the possibility that hormones capable of zzso protein zzso C could stimulate zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso
