A zzso clone for zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library prepared from the zzso zzso of zzso pumpkin zzso The zzso zzso a zzso with zzso zzso zzso whose sequence is more than zzso identical to those of zzso from other higher plants and contains the zzso zzso zzso which is a putative targeting signal to zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso protein is exclusively localized in zzso in zzso pumpkin zzso Double labeling experiments with protein zzso particles of different sizes showed that zzso protein coexists with a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso pumpkin zzso indicating that transformation between zzso and leaf zzso occurs directly during zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso analysis showed that the amount of zzso protein increased markedly during zzso and decreased rapidly when zzso were exposed to zzso which induced the zzso transition from zzso to leaf zzso In zzso zzso the level of the zzso protein and zzso zzso increased again with the reverse transition of zzso from leaf zzso to zzso Changes in the amount of zzso protein did not zzso to the changes in the level of zzso zzso during zzso and zzso of the zzso an indication that zzso regulation plays an important role in the zzso zzso
