zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso of zzso after its release from zzso zzso Four such zzso have so far been cloned from the rat zzso One, the zzso zzso zzso has been detected in the zzso zzso in which the principal zzso zzso of the auditory zzso between the inner hair cells and zzso of type I spiral zzso zzso has been suggested to be zzso The distribution of zzso was therefore investigated to provide clues to the handling of zzso in the zzso This was studied using light and electron microscopic zzso in rats and guinea pigs with zzso raised against synthetic peptides based on the sequence for zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso sheath formed by satellite cells surrounding the type I spiral zzso zzso and along the plasma zzso of supporting cells around the inner hair zzso other cells in both locations were only zzso zzso if at zzso The absence of substantial numbers of zzso in the spiral zzso suggests that zzso is unlikely to be associated with the zzso of synaptic zzso after release in this zzso zzso associated with the inner hair cells is consistent with the zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso
