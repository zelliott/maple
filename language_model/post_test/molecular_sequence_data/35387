zzso zzso formation is essential for the propagation of many organisms including humans and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells communicate with each other directly via large zzso bridges called ring zzso Ring canals are often derived from arrested zzso rings during incomplete zzso However how ring canal formation, maintenance and growth are regulated remains zzso To better understand this process, we carried out an unbiased genetic screen in zzso zzso germ cells and identified multiple zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso had previously been reported to be unnecessary for early zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso We found that loss of zzso leads to zzso nascent ring canals and subsequently tiny mature ring canals, through which zzso transfer from nurse cells to the zzso is impaired, resulting in small, zzso zzso zzso is expressed in germ cells undergoing incomplete zzso completely zzso with the zzso zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso This zzso together with genetic interaction studies, suggests that zzso functions together with zzso to zzso regulate zzso activity during ring canal zzso The identification of two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as the first two main players required for ring canal zzso indicates that tight regulation of zzso activity is essential for zzso zzso formation and reproduction in zzso zzso and probably other species as zzso
