zzso zzso often recruit zzso assembly of a zzso complex; many zzso antagonize zzso These activities can involve direct interactions with proteins in the zzso zzso We used an zzso zzso zzso system to screen mouse zzso libraries for proteins that interact with zzso protein zzso zzso revealed an interaction between zzso and a single member of the zinc finger family of zzso factors, zzso Two members of the protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso family, zzso and zzso also zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from nuclear zzso suggesting the interaction occurred in zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso which indicated that other nuclear proteins were not required for the zzso zzso analysis mapped the zzso domain of zzso to the zzso zzso and the zzso domain on zzso to a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso issue seven known zzso proteins from four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each with different cell zzso expression zzso the zzso domain reported here is the only part of the zzso zzso region shared by all seven zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso and zzso also zzso with zzso Our results suggest that all zzso proteins might mediate zzso regulatory signaling at the zzso interface and that previously unknown levels of complexity could exist in the gene regulatory interplay between zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
