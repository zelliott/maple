zzso zzso zzso proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 434 zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 1 to zzso were connected in a zzso arrangement with a part of the natural zzso sequence that connects the N and zzso zzso of the intact zzso Compared to the isolated zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso showed at least zzso higher binding affinity in zzso and a slightly stronger repression in zzso The recognition of the zzso zzso operator sequence by this zzso zzso was indistinguishable from that of the naturally zzso zzso in terms of binding zzso zzso I protection pattern and in zzso zzso zzso Using the new, zzso zzso zzso proteins with altered zzso specificity have also been zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso of the recognition zzso in one of the zzso with the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of altered zzso This new zzso zzso recognized an zzso artificial zzso zzso operator with high zzso Similar zzso in both 434 zzso have led to a new zzso zzso which showed high affinity binding to a natural, zzso zzso zzso These findings, supported by both in zzso and in zzso experiments, show that the zzso architecture allows for the introduction of independent changes in the binding zzso and suggest that this new protein framework could be used to generate new zzso in zzso zzso
