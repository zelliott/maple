Two disorders, zzso zzso zzso zzso and a group of skeletal zzso belonging to the zzso zzso spectrum, are caused by zzso zzso They are considered mutually exclusive because of the different presumed effects of the respective zzso gene zzso leading to loss of function zzso and gain of function zzso zzso We describe here the first patient zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso a skeletal zzso of the zzso A novel de zzso zzso zzso in zzso 45 of the zzso zzso was zzso It leads to two zzso zzso one full-length transcript with the point zzso causing a substitution of a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and a second shortened transcript lacking 21 zzso due to the creation of an zzso zzso donor site in zzso zzso We propose that the dual zzso is caused by two functionally different, zzso zzso A proteins and therefore represents an exceptional model case of zzso zzso and zzso zzso due to a single zzso zzso
