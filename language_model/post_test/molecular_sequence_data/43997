Because exposure to nitrogen dioxide zzso alters plasma membrane structure and function in pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso we examined whether zzso exposure is associated with zzso of plasma zzso proteins in zzso Exposure to 5 zzso zzso for 24 h had no significant effect on total protein zzso However, two-dimensional gel zzso of isolated plasma zzso from zzso zzso zzso exposed to zzso for 24 h demonstrated 3- to zzso increases in the synthesis of several proteins with molecular masses of 36, 39, and 40 zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and zzso analysis identified the zzso plasma membrane protein as zzso II zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso expression for zzso II in zzso cells was also zzso These results suggest that exposure to zzso results in induction of plasma membrane zzso II, an important zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso
