The serum zzso protein zzso the zzso vitamin A alcohol and plays an important zzso role in the transport of this zzso The zzso zzso zzso the three-dimensional structure of which is known, constitutes a zzso member of the zzso family of zzso We report here the functional expression of the zzso in zzso coli by zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso in a single step by metal zzso affinity zzso exhibits the same zzso binding characteristics as described for the natural zzso zzso zzso unfolding and zzso experiments suggest that the zzso zzso protein adopts a stable zzso despite being expressed and zzso in the absence of the large zzso zzso The expression system described here should also be useful for the zzso production of other zzso zzso thus permitting the zzso of the zzso relationships of zzso binding by protein zzso
