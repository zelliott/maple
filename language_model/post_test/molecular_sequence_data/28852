zzso are zzso proteins consisting of a common alpha zzso linked to one of the beta zzso beta A or beta zzso During pregnancy, the zzso is the main source of zzso A production and the zzso transformation of zzso cells into zzso is associated with an zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso region of the human zzso alpha gene was isolated and zzso Three zzso initiation sites were zzso When zzso zzso in zzso cells with a zzso reporter zzso the sequence displayed promoter zzso zzso I zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso analysis showed a specific zzso interaction in the promoter when using zzso nuclear zzso This interaction was weaker with zzso nuclear zzso Moreover, the deletion of this zzso interaction region suppressed the promoter zzso In an attempt to identify this factor, the potential binding of known factors delta zzso zzso and zzso were excluded by competition zzso zzso We suggest that it may zzso to an zzso protein zzso The identification of the human zzso alpha promoter could help in understanding the mechanisms modulating zzso gene zzso Moreover, the identification of a factor, whose presence is related to the zzso cell differentiation state, could help in understanding the transformation of zzso cells into zzso
