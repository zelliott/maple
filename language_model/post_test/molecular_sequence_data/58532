The gene coding for the S zzso the smaller of the two envelope zzso of the duck zzso B virus zzso is transcribed from a zzso zzso In this study, we localized the promoter to a zzso segment of the zzso that was capable of efficiently driving expression of a linked reporter gene upon transient zzso into the differentiated zzso cell lines zzso and zzso However, no measurable activity from this construct could be detected in similar zzso with the zzso cell line zzso or the zzso cell line zzso Located at position zzso relative to the zzso start site was a sequence zzso to the consensus binding site for zzso nuclear factor 3 zzso zzso of this region reduced activity of the reporter gene to barely zzso levels in zzso zzso The results of zzso mobility shift analysis zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso containing this sequence formed a specific complex with zzso proteins from zzso and zzso cells but not with nuclear extracts obtained from zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso S promoter zzso and a rat zzso expression zzso resulted in zzso of only those zzso in which the candidate zzso site was zzso Furthermore, zzso using zzso nuclear extracts containing zzso expressed zzso formed complexes with the same migration and competition properties as those in which the proteins were derived from the differentiated zzso zzso Thus, several lines of evidence suggest a critical role for zzso in activity from the zzso S zzso
