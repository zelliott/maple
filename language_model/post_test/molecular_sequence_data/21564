Although most zzso agree that species are independently evolving zzso lineages that should be zzso with several kinds of data, the zzso practice in zzso primates zzso looks quite zzso Several recently described zzso species are based solely on evidence of genetic distance and diagnostic characters of zzso DNA sequences sampled from a few individuals per zzso Here we explore the zzso of this procedure for species zzso in zzso using published sequence zzso 

We show that genetic distance estimates and zzso zzso Analysis zzso are inappropriate for species zzso in this group of zzso zzso and zzso genetic distances overlapped in 14 of 17 cases independent of the genetic marker zzso A simulation of a zzso zzso study indicated that for the zzso zzso the minimum required number of individuals sampled per location is 10 in order to avoid false zzso via zzso 

zzso distances estimates and zzso alone should not be used for species zzso in zzso Instead, several nuclear and zzso zzso should be considered and combined with other data sets from zzso ecology or zzso Independent of the data source, sampling should be done in a way to ensure a quantitative comparison of zzso and zzso variation of the zzso in zzso The results of our study also indicate that several of the recently described zzso species should be reevaluated with additional data and that the number of good species among the currently known zzso is probably lower than currently zzso
