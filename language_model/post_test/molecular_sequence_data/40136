Little is known about the evolutionary processes that structure and maintain microbial diversity because, until recently, it was difficult to explore zzso patterns of variation at the microbial zzso Now, zzso sequence data enable such variation to be assessed across large segments of microbial zzso Here, we discuss how zzso analysis of these data can be used to determine how selection and genetic exchange shape the evolution of new microbial zzso We show that once independent lineages have been identified, such analyses enable the identification of zzso changes that drive niche differentiation and promote the coexistence of closely related lineages within the same zzso We suggest that understanding the evolutionary ecology of natural microbial populations through zzso analyses will enhance our understanding of zzso evolution across all zzso of zzso
