The aim of this study was to describe the zzso of zzso gene zzso corresponding plasma protein detection and zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso exposure of zzso zzso to test differential responses of zzso suitable for environmental zzso Male fish were exposed to a nominal concentration of 150 zzso zzso for 28 days, and later transferred to zzso water zzso for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 or 28 zzso Blood and zzso samples were obtained in order to analyze zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins by Western zzso liver samples were used for gene expression and to assess tissue damage and further recovery of all the analyzed zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso with zzso of several zzso supports that the partial sequence obtained for zzso zzso belongs to zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was highly zzso by zzso zzso zzso bands of 62, 52 and 50 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso 75 and 64 zzso for zzso were detected after 28 days of zzso exposure in plasma and zzso zzso After transfer of treated fish to clean water, zzso zzso in plasma disappeared rapidly zzso zzso while zzso zzso decreased zzso no zzso were detected on day 28 of zzso Similarly, zzso transcripts abruptly returned to background levels zzso zzso earlier than for zzso zzso 7) or zzso zzso zzso Liver from zzso treated fish showed tissue zzso eccentric and zzso zzso zzso and intense zzso zzso After the recovery period, these changes were still evident though less zzso accounting for zzso of tissue damage or the requirement for a longer period of zzso The present results confirm that for zzso and molecular zzso such as induction of female proteins in male fish exposed to zzso complete recovery is achieved after adequate time of zzso zzso zzso Male zzso expression reflects a recent exposure to zzso zzso while zzso may reveal past zzso The combination of zzso with different zzso responses such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso provides a more comprehensive interpretation of pollution zzso
