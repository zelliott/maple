zzso zzso zzso and zzso are chemically related zzso zzso obtained from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Each contains zzso one zzso acid zzso two zzso zzso linkages and a long zzso zzso zzso these zzso resemble zzso zzso studies with zzso showed that zzso bound to rat zzso zzso is totally zzso by zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which differs from zzso zzso in containing zzso instead of zzso at zzso 2, zzso instead of zzso at zzso 4, and zzso acid instead of zzso at zzso 9, only zzso displaced bound zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the ability of the zzso to interact with the zzso binding site is not solely dependent on the long zzso tail or the zzso zzso
