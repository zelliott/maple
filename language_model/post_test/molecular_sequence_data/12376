zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein from zzso that specifically binds to the surfaces of zzso bacteria via the zzso A component of zzso To obtain information about the responses of zzso zzso to zzso damage by zzso two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso zzso were used to identify proteins that were induced or zzso following zzso zzso The majority of the affected proteins are involved in central zzso zzso Upon addition of zzso the zzso of the F1 portion of zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso zzso whereas six proteins were induced up to zzso Three of the latter were identified as zzso zzso zzso carrier protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso Additionally, a novel zzso zzso was identified that is induced over zzso by zzso sequence analysis suggests that it belongs to the zzso zzso and interacts with zzso A zzso zzso motif is present in the regulatory regions of several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso Only one of the zzso proteins was induced when cells were treated with zzso B, which also binds to zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso and zzso B affect different global regulatory networks in zzso zzso even though they bind with high affinity to the same zzso zzso
