The organic zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is essential for zzso acid and zzso disposition and for the zzso zzso To better understand the mechanism underlying zzso gene regulation, the effects of zzso acid zzso on zzso gene expression were zzso The results show a zzso induction of zzso but not zzso expression in both zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso A novel functional zzso zzso response element zzso so-called zzso in the promoter of zzso gene was zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso was verified by zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso and its functional importance by zzso promoter zzso in zzso reporter zzso The studies demonstrated that the zzso is also a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding site for zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso is a target of both zzso (by binding to zzso zzso and zzso and zzso (by binding to zzso zzso gene regulation zzso In zzso this study has uncovered a novel zzso zzso element in the promoter of zzso that binds zzso or zzso zzso with zzso and appears to function zzso with the zzso element to provide zzso induction of zzso in response to zzso These findings demonstrate a role for zzso and zzso in controlling zzso expression zzso
