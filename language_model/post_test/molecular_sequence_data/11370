In this work, we have zzso random amplified zzso DNA zzso for the use of human DNA in altering the concentration of the reaction components and the steps of the zzso profile in the zzso chain zzso By using two zzso in every reaction and zzso U zzso DNA zzso we found that DNA zzso between 50 and 500 zzso gave zzso zzso zzso The tested DNA was extracted in seven different ways giving the same amplification results in six of zzso We have also observed that reactions consisting of 35 cycles gave sufficient product zzso A slow zzso from the zzso to the extension temperature increased the number of amplified bands and enhanced zzso We conclude that zzso is a robust and, under the mentioned conditions, zzso method that could prove very useful for scientists and zzso
