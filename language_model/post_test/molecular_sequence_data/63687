zzso zzso is the most precise way to manipulate the zzso As a tool it has been used extensively in bacteria, zzso zzso embryonic stem cells, and a few other specialized cell lines but has not been available to researchers in other systems, such as for zzso zzso cell zzso Recently, work has shown that the creation of a zzso DNA zzso break can stimulate zzso zzso by several zzso in zzso zzso zzso These zzso breaks can now be created in zzso zzso by zinc finger zzso zzso zzso are artificial proteins in which a zinc finger zzso domain is fused to a zzso zzso zzso This chapter describes how to identify potential targets for zzso cutting, to make zzso to cut this target site, and how to test whether the newly designed zzso are active in a zzso cell zzso zzso
