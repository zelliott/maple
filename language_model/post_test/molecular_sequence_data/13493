The specific interaction between zzso and zzso was exploited in the affinity zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso library zzso by means of the zzso method in which zzso on variable positions is carried out using an zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso was used to cap the zzso zzso groups remaining after zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso The following synthesis and zzso procedures were performed as usual in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso mixture containing zzso sequences was performed by affinity zzso on an zzso zzso The unwanted terminated sequences were retained in the zzso column while the zzso zzso mixture was zzso as indicated by zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso The zzso column was zzso and the zzso sequences were released under zzso zzso zzso The usefulness of zzso for zzso library zzso is demonstrated here for the first time for a zzso mixture containing zzso that cannot be separated from the mixture by classical zzso zzso This zzso technique could be applied to all zzso presenting difficult reacting zzso
