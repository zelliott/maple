The lateral assembly of zzso zzso zzso gives rise to membrane proteins with complex zzso which play important roles in zzso zzso zzso the assembly of zzso zzso containing TM zzso is the first step toward the development of functional zzso zzso Here we report novel directed assembly of zzso zzso zzso with zzso mobile TM zzso The TM zzso were incorporated into zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and the zzso were then transferred onto glass zzso using zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso were assembled using zzso zzso fusion on top of the LB zzso The novelty is the incorporation of the peptides into the zzso at the first step of zzso zzso which allows control over the zzso concentration and zzso The zzso orientation of the peptides was confirmed using oriented circular zzso zzso lateral mobility was assessed using zzso recovery after zzso zzso and diffusion zzso were determined using a novel boundary profile evolution zzso zzso The described zzso approach can be used to develop versatile zzso platforms for studying membrane proteins interactions in native zzso zzso
