zzso zzso contains zzso acids zzso zzso dry zzso mainly zzso acid zzso and also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellulose zzso zzso but is devoid of zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso M zzso acid at 100 degrees C for 2 h released approximately zzso of the zzso and approximately zzso of the zzso acid and its zzso After zzso of the products with zzso zzso and zzso zzso three main zzso zzso zzso were zzso They represented approximately zzso of the zzso acid, and approximately zzso of the neutral zzso contained in the zzso zzso The compositions of zzso zzso and F3 were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The structures of the three zzso were determined using chemical methods zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso was zzso zzso and F3 was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been previously isolated from other zzso especially from wheat zzso and soluble zzso from wheat zzso this is the first report of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that these zzso are zzso constituents of zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid is probably partly responsible for the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso chains through zzso acid zzso
