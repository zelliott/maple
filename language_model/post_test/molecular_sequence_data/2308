The relationship between zzso of alpha and beta zzso zzso and zzso genes and the interaction of zzso zzso zzso factors has been examined in zzso zzso cells following zzso with zzso zzso 2 zzso 2) and zzso virus zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso 2 prior to zzso virus infection increased the zzso levels of zzso 1, zzso 2, and zzso as well as the final yield of biologically active zzso Analysis of nuclear zzso promoter DNA interactions by zzso zzso zzso demonstrated increased factor binding to zzso 1 and zzso regulatory zzso although no new zzso complexes were zzso On the basis of competition zzso zzso zzso results, factors interacting with the zzso 1 and zzso promoters appear to be distinct zzso zzso zzso factor binding was localized to the zzso domain zzso to zzso of the zzso regulatory element, a sequence motif with zzso zzso to the recognition site of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso interactions within the zzso zzso domain were, in fact, specifically zzso by either excess zzso zzso zzso or the human zzso virus zzso element which contains two duplicated zzso B recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso containing either the zzso regulatory element or the human zzso virus zzso element linked to the zzso virus 40 promoter, were analyzed for virus and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso In the zzso cell line, both plasmids were zzso expressed but not virus zzso while in zzso cells, zzso zzso activity from these plasmids was induced by zzso agent zzso These experiments suggest that induction of zzso gene expression may be controlled in part by zzso regulatory proteins binding to an zzso zzso site within the zzso zzso
