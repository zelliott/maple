In the course of molecular characterization of zzso isolated from zzso leaves collected in zzso zzso zzso strains were detected that clustered with the zzso in molecular zzso analyses of the zzso regions coding for the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene and the internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso In the trees zzso the zzso formed a zzso zzso branch of zzso supported with high zzso zzso As the zzso could not be identified with any known zzso we have described them as zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region coding for the zzso zzso zzso the type strain of the novel species contained a group zzso zzso that was similar in location and sequence to zzso found in certain species of zzso and zzso As no similar zzso have been detected in zzso the new zzso might represent a zzso link connecting these three zzso
