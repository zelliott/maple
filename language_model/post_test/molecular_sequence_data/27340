zzso are a novel class of genetic control elements that function through the direct interaction of small zzso molecules with structured zzso zzso The zzso is bound with high specificity and affinity to its zzso target and zzso zzso changes of the zzso secondary and zzso structure upon zzso To zzso the molecular basis of the remarkable zzso selectivity and affinity of one of these zzso extensive zzso molecular dynamics simulations in explicit zzso zzso 1 zzso total simulation zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso sensing zzso are zzso The zzso dynamics is studied when the system is bound to its zzso zzso zzso as well as bound to the zzso zzso zzso and in its free zzso The simulations indicate that zzso zzso in the zzso domain functions as a general zzso platform for zzso zzso whereas the interactions between zzso and the zzso are crucial for zzso zzso These findings either suggest a zzso zzso recognition process, including a general zzso binding step and a subsequent selection of the zzso zzso or hint at different initial interactions of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso binding zzso To explore possible pathways of complex zzso various zzso simulations are performed which account for the first steps of zzso zzso The results delineate the minimal set of zzso changes needed for zzso release, suggest two possible pathways for the zzso reaction, and underline the importance of long-range zzso contacts for zzso the zzso in the zzso
