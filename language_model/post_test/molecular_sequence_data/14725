zzso small nuclear zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in the process of zzso zzso zzso yet many questions remain regarding the location, zzso and roles of its functional zzso To address some of these questions, we developed the first in zzso zzso system for zzso zzso small nuclear zzso zzso We used this system to examine the functional zzso of zzso by measuring zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to previous work in human extracts and zzso zzso we found that the 3' zzso of zzso is necessary for efficient zzso with zzso In particular, the loop is sensitive to changes in both length and zzso zzso a number of zzso that we tested resulted in more stable interactions with zzso than zzso zzso Nevertheless, each of these zzso was impaired in its ability to support zzso indicating that these regions of zzso have functions subsequent to base pair formation with zzso Our data suggest that one such function is likely to be in zzso formation, when zzso joins the zzso zzso We have identified two regions, the upper stem of the 3' zzso and the central domain, that promote zzso zzso In addition, the loop of the 3' zzso promotes zzso formation, while the central domain and the zzso domain appear to antagonize zzso zzso
