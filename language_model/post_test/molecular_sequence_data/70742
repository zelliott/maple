zzso growth zzso protein 6 zzso an zzso protein with preferential affinity for zzso growth factor zzso II, belongs to a family of binding proteins with at least six zzso We have characterized the zzso structure and the zzso location of the human zzso which is present in the human zzso as a zzso gene spanning zzso zzso It consists of four zzso zzso the translated regions, with sizes of zzso zzso zzso and 123 zzso while the intervening zzso are zzso zzso and 844 zzso Three zzso cap sites were localized 101, 100, and 96 zzso upstream of the zzso translation start zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region does not have any zzso or zzso consensus zzso The zzso was localized to zzso 12 by analysis of zzso cell hybrids and zzso to zzso by zzso DNA in zzso zzso
