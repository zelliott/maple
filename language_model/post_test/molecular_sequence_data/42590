Two series of overlapping peptides zzso the entire sequences of the zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared by a comprehensive synthetic strategy in order to identify all linear regions of the zzso that may participate in binding of the hormone to its zzso Each series of peptides (15 zzso in zzso spanned the entire zzso acid sequences of the two zzso The peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso or zzso to rat zzso zzso and for their ability to inhibit zzso zzso production in a zzso cell zzso The most potent inhibitor of zzso binding was a zzso containing the sequence beta zzso a zzso binding site of the zzso beta zzso not previously zzso The concentration at which zzso binding was inhibited at 50% zzso was 20 zzso and 30 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso These peptides also inhibited the stimulation of zzso production by zzso in zzso cell zzso In order to determine important zzso that inhibit binding within this region, a third set of peptides was zzso in which each zzso of zzso beta zzso was zzso replaced with the zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were critical for zzso zzso of zzso binding by zzso beta zzso In addition to site beta zzso other sites that inhibited zzso binding but with significantly lower zzso included zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
