zzso D zzso was zzso to high zzso from rice zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso activity were resolved by zzso Q zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso in both zzso was 82 zzso on zzso and 78 zzso in gel zzso zzso raised against the protein in one of the zzso zzso the zzso activities in both zzso zzso characteristics of zzso in the two zzso were identical except for a difference of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis covering more than zzso of the zzso acids of the proteins and zzso mapping did not detect any difference in the primary structure of the zzso A zzso for zzso was isolated from rice and it zzso a protein of zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso matched the deduced zzso acid sequence starting from zzso zzso A Northern zzso showed this gene was expressed in leaves, roots, developing seeds and cultured cells, and a Southern zzso detected a single band of rice zzso DNA zzso to the zzso A zzso for zzso was also isolated from zzso The similarity of the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso was zzso between rice and zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
