Group A zzso zzso the most frequent bacterial cause of zzso infections in humans, expresses on the cell surface M proteins with capacity to bind factor zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso This has been interpreted as a mechanism developed by this pathogen to decrease zzso by zzso and zzso zzso We report the analysis of the capacity to bind factor zzso zzso and zzso of 69 clinical zzso from 19 different zzso We show that strains binding complement regulators zzso belong to specific M zzso Of these, zzso strains are relatively frequent and interact with all three complement regulators zzso However, the most virulent zzso and zzso strains did not bind complement regulators in our zzso The relevance of the interaction between complement regulators and zzso zzso was analyzed using different approaches with the conclusion that under zzso conditions only zzso and zzso bind to zzso We show that zzso presents a higher binding affinity for zzso zzso than factor H because it carries a zzso zzso zzso binding site in addition to the zzso binding site in zzso Using synthetic peptides we provide evidence that the zzso zzso binding site in zzso involves the zzso tail zzso that zzso zzso from factor zzso
