zzso D zzso zzso or zzso toxins are well characterized in zzso zzso zzso and have been described in some strains of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso D molecules cause skin necrosis and occasional severe systemic manifestations, such as acute zzso zzso In this paper, we identified new zzso D zzso acid sequences from various organisms belonging to 24 distinct zzso of which, 19 are zzso These zzso D share a zzso active site and a zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso tail is responsible for stabilizing the entire internal structure of the zzso D Tim barrel and that it can be considered an zzso D hallmark in combination with the zzso acid zzso from the active zzso Most of these zzso sequences were discovered from zzso and the zzso D activity was zzso confirmed in the fungus zzso zzso Because most of these novel zzso D are from organisms that are endowed with zzso properties similar to those evoked by these zzso alone, they might be associated with their zzso zzso
