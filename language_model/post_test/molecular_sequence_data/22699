zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso cells toward the zzso zzso and is a notable illustration of cell zzso To identify genes involved in SE, zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to generate transcripts highly enriched for zzso zzso using zzso prepared from a mixture of zzso callus and zzso zzso zzso as the zzso and zzso from zzso zzso as the zzso After differential screening and subsequent confirmation by reverse Northern zzso analysis, a total of zzso zzso expressed zzso fragments were identified, and 242 zzso significantly zzso during cotton zzso were recovered, as confirmed by Northern zzso and zzso zzso analysis of representative cases, including most previously published zzso genes in zzso In total, more than half had not been identified previously as zzso zzso including dominant crucial genes involved in transcription, zzso and transportation, and about one-third had not been reported previously to zzso or were expected to be unknown, or newly identified zzso We used zzso zzso to further investigate the expression patterns of these genes in zzso zzso culture, ranging from zzso masses to zzso zzso at every zzso The zzso collection is composed of a broad repertoire of zzso genes which is an important resource for understanding the genetic interactions underlying zzso signaling and zzso Our results suggested that a complicated and concerted mechanism involving multiple cellular pathways is responsible for cotton zzso This report represents a systematic and comprehensive analysis of genes involved in the process of zzso zzso
