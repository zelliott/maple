The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso also known as zzso is a zzso zzso protein that has been shown to have zzso roles in zzso It is zzso by a gene that is widely zzso in zzso species, zzso its importance in the zzso zzso Here we determined the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso analysis, and studied its zzso zzso The gene covers approximately zzso zzso of zzso DNA, is zzso by four zzso and the zzso site consensus sequence is maintained in all zzso zzso similar to that reported for the human zzso With primer extension analysis, two zzso initiation sites were zzso One was assigned to the zzso C and the other (a minor zzso to the zzso G, at positions 1 and zzso zzso These are at 313 and zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso zzso In about 770 zzso upstream region of zzso that has been cloned and zzso multiple zzso factor binding sites including a zzso zzso zzso were zzso We specifically studied the function of the eight zzso zzso sequence zzso at zzso (or zzso depending on the strain of zzso of the promoter zzso It can bind to the zzso factor zzso zzso element zzso in gel mobility shift zzso using mouse zzso nuclear zzso and the binding can be inhibited by a 28 zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso Similar binding and zzso zzso using rat nuclear extract suggest the existence of a rat zzso sequence and the involvement of zzso in rat zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso is necessary for the zzso activity of the zzso promoter, and Northern analysis shows that zzso transcripts are absent in zzso zzso The results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso expression is under the control of zzso and that this zzso regulator for zzso might be zzso in other zzso at least in the zzso
