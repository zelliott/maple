Here we report on the construction of two zzso plasmids for zzso zzso allowing in zzso construction of zzso zzso Both plasmids contain two zzso in zzso the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso devoid of its own regulatory sequences and the first two zzso followed by a zzso gene for selection in zzso zzso Both zzso are flanked by the zzso and zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso allowing integration of both zzso at the zzso locus of the zzso zzso zzso For propagation in zzso coli, the plasmids contain the zzso origin of DNA replication and the zzso zzso Whereas one zzso needs a promoter, a zzso sequence and the beginning of a gene fused zzso to zzso the other one already carries a zzso zzso The versatility of the gene fusion zzso was demonstrated by the integration of the regulatory regions of the zzso and the zzso zzso In the first case, zzso expression was found, and by comparison with an zzso fusion, it seems that the zzso zzso is regulated at both the zzso and the zzso zzso In the second case, zzso regulation of the gene fusion could be zzso
