A comparative study examining replication and disease zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso avian influenza virus zzso infection of chickens and ducks was zzso The replication and zzso of highly zzso zzso zzso has received substantial zzso however, the behavior of zzso zzso which serve as precursors to zzso has received less zzso Thus, chickens or ducks were zzso with an isolate from a wild bird zzso zzso zzso or zzso from chickens zzso zzso zzso zzso and virus zzso induction of a zzso response, and disease zzso were investigated, and the zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences of the zzso were zzso zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso showed that H5N1 zzso better in zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso better in zzso zzso of the zzso gene sequences showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso both have a deletion of 20 zzso acids in the zzso stalk region, which was absent in the H5N1 zzso zzso examination of numerous zzso showed that zzso and zzso zzso caused zzso in chickens in a variety of zzso but to a greater extent in the respiratory and zzso zzso whereas H5N1 zzso in ducks were observed mainly in the respiratory zzso This study suggests that the zzso zzso and zzso infections occurred at distinct sites in chicken and zzso and that comparative studies in different model species are needed to better understand the factors influencing the evolution of these zzso
