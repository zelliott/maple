In higher zzso zzso zzso resulting from injury to the central nervous system zzso is characterized by a rapid increase in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Little is known about the zzso signals that initiate the increase in zzso following zzso zzso We demonstrated recently zzso Oh, zzso zzso zzso Von zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH rapidly increases zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein in cultured zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso that a rapid increase in zzso can be evoked in mature zzso cultures by exposing the cells to an zzso zzso We investigated the zzso zzso involved in initiating increased zzso a hallmark of zzso zzso The increase in zzso produced by exposure to zzso medium was blocked by zzso with zzso zzso by such zzso of zzso calcium channels as zzso zzso and zzso by zzso inhibitor I, or by the zzso calcium zzso zzso At zzso zzso treatment with the calcium zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso which could be blocked by zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso exposed to low pH exhibited a marked increase in a zzso zzso with a molecular weight of 48 zzso In zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso of zzso was also found to be zzso producing fragments with molecular weights of zzso zzso As anticipated, zzso with zzso inhibitor I prevented the zzso degradation of both zzso and zzso in these zzso These results suggest that the initial increase in zzso after zzso injury appears to be linked to zzso influx, and is zzso further by a zzso process that seemingly involves the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
