zzso of zzso (formerly zzso a member of the zzso gene family in zzso zzso increases dramatically upon heat zzso An expression zzso in which the promoter of zzso is fused to the zzso coli zzso gene zzso was constructed and transformed into a zzso zzso zzso The zzso grew on zzso at 23 degrees C, but increased expression of the zzso fusion gene inhibited growth of cells on zzso at 37 degrees zzso zzso for survivors under zzso conditions yielded a class of zzso termed zzso (for heat shock zzso which showed reduced levels of expression of the zzso gene fusion as determined by measurement of zzso zzso Similar effects on zzso activity were obtained when an zzso fusion zzso was introduced into the zzso suggesting action in trans through the zzso zzso Analysis of Northern zzso blots demonstrated that the reduction in expression was a result of decreased zzso levels for the fusion zzso In addition, zzso levels of the zzso zzso gene are reduced in an zzso zzso zzso analysis has shown that these zzso act in trans and affect both zzso from the zzso promoter and turnover of the fusion zzso These are the first zzso zzso known to affect directly the zzso regulation and transcript stability of heat shock genes in zzso
