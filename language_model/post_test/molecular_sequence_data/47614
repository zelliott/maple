The adaptation of the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso DNA standard to zzso the human zzso zzso zzso B zzso gene in clinical samples is zzso The zzso zzso is a solution zzso system with zzso end stage detection of zzso A DNA internal standard zzso was designed by replacing a probe sequence used currently within the zzso region with a zzso zzso allowing zzso with the same zzso primer sets and differentiation by probe zzso Two DNA fragments zzso to the zzso and IS sequences were generated and used for zzso studies to construct a standard zzso From this the copy number of the zzso gene present in clinical samples could be zzso zzso with 1000 IS copies allowed zzso of zzso zzso DNA copies in a single zzso This zzso was validated subsequently using blood samples tested by the zzso zzso zzso and showed a trend of increasing zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso This rapid zzso avoids using gel zzso and cumbersome quantitative zzso It has the potential for early identification of patients at high risk of developing zzso disease, and for therapeutic zzso
