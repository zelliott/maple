We present data supporting a general role for zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the efficient iron zzso zzso in maintaining iron zzso throughout plant zzso In addition to its well-known expression in zzso we show that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso seed and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are defective in early zzso and are almost completely zzso both defects being rescued by iron and/or zzso zzso The zzso fertility zzso is caused by zzso abortion and is associated with the male zzso expression of zzso Iron imaging shows the presence of important deposits of iron on the surface of aborted zzso zzso This points to a role for zzso and zzso in proper iron nutrition of zzso and zzso Based on the findings that iron acquisition in zzso zzso and zzso depends on zzso we propose that zzso zzso release in the zzso space represents an important process by which efficient iron nutrition is achieved between adjacent zzso lacking zzso zzso These results reveal a zzso role for zzso in the zzso transport of iron throughout development, and provide a general model for zzso organisms in the zzso transport of iron involving zzso zzso
