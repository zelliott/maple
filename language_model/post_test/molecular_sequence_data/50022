An zzso with a specificity that has not been described zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso had a molecular mass of zzso zzso whereas a molecular mass of zzso zzso was observed under zzso conditions, zzso that the zzso may exist as a zzso with identical zzso zzso zzso was found to have a narrow zzso zzso converting only zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were accepted as zzso Based on the partial protein zzso the zzso gene was zzso zzso comparisons place zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Unlike most members of this family, zzso requires zzso but no zzso for zzso zzso The DNA sequence surrounding the gene suggests that it belongs to an zzso that also contains several components of zzso zzso Both zzso evidence and protein sequence zzso comparisons indicate that similar zzso are widespread among the zzso zzso Their apparent biological role is to participate in zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso and zzso zzso routes described zzso
