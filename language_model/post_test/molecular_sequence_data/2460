Rapid detection of point zzso in zzso DNA has been achieved by chemical mismatch analysis of zzso formed between amplified zzso and target sequences in the human factor IX zzso zzso and mismatch detection zzso analysis of DNA from relatives of zzso B patients permitted carrier diagnosis by direct identification of the presence or absence of the zzso in all cases, thus eliminating the need for the zzso segregation of zzso zzso This extends diagnostic capability to virtually all zzso B zzso zzso analysis permits detection of all sequence variations in zzso DNA and is therefore zzso to direct diagnosis of zzso and zzso diseases and for identification of new zzso for genetic zzso
