Numerous in zzso as well as genetic studies have demonstrated that the activities of the zzso proteins are regulated at multiple levels, including zzso of DNA binding by the Id zzso association with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Here, we use affinity zzso of zzso zzso combined with mass zzso in order to show that zzso interacts with the entire ensemble of Id zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we find that the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso the protein zzso zzso 5 zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso family associate with zzso zzso We also identify a spectrum of zzso acid zzso in zzso that are zzso including an zzso zzso zzso We did, however, find that zzso of the identified zzso zzso site by itself did not zzso B cell zzso In sum, these studies show that the entire ensemble of Id proteins has the ability to interact with zzso identify factors that associate with zzso and reveal a spectrum of zzso zzso in zzso including an zzso zzso zzso
