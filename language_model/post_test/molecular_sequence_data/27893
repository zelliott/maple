The crystal structure of zzso zzso a zzso with its zzso zzso and zzso has been determined and refined at a resolution of zzso zzso With zzso bound at the zzso storage site, the zzso zzso binds at the zzso site and causes the regulatory and zzso zzso to separate with the loss of stabilizing interactions between zzso zzso zzso between the active sites of the zzso zzso results from zzso in zzso contacts between zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso changes in the core of the interface are correlated with those observed on zzso zzso by zzso at zzso zzso zzso
