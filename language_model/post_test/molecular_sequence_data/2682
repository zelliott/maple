We report the complete primary and secondary structures of a zzso Mr zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso was derived from the zzso sequence of three overlapping complementary DNA clones isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso zzso zzso features of the zzso sequence are two distinct regions of zzso and zzso structures at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso search suggests that the zzso is a zzso gene product formed by fusion of the zzso of an Mr approximately 14,000 zzso zzso with an internal domain of the collagen alpha zzso zzso treatment with zzso confirmed the presence of a zzso structure in the zzso zzso the entire sequence is greater than zzso zzso to a rat low affinity zzso zzso
