This study was aimed to investigate the efficiency of modified zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, used to detect the promoter zzso of zzso gene in six zzso zzso cell lines, and to explore the application in selection of zzso zzso cell lines with promoter zzso and make them to be an zzso cell models for studying the relationship between gene zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and then were subjected to zzso modification and a zzso was used to amplify the promoter region, zzso MSP product of zzso gene promoter was analyzed and zzso The results showed that the zzso of zzso gene was detected in zzso and zzso however, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were zzso In conclusion, zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso cell lines can be perfectly detected by zzso method, which is simple, sensitive and specific for screening all kinds of zzso zzso cell lines with zzso gene zzso
