In the context of a project aimed at the identification of zinc finger proteins involved in skeletal muscle zzso and zzso we isolated a zzso zzso named zzso The zzso partial zzso clone zzso to the 3' region of the zzso and contains a zzso open reading frame zzso four zzso zinc finger zzso organized in zzso This zzso zzso with multiple transcripts zzso zzso and zzso whose expression levels vary in different zzso and at different zzso stages in the same zzso At least in skeletal muscle we observed differences in the zzso state of the transcripts at different stages of zzso Moreover, zzso expression is correlated with cell proliferation and zzso zzso analysis and genetic mapping indicate that zzso is the zzso of zzso one of the linked zinc finger zzso genes localized on human zzso zzso In humans, a high frequency of zzso zzso is found in this zzso zzso As expected, zzso maps to the corresponding region on zzso 9 in the zzso
