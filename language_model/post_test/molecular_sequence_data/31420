Although zzso biting zzso act as a zzso of important human and domestic animal diseases, their ecology is poorly zzso The lack of proper identification systems of zzso larvae is one of the main obstacles to progress in zzso Based on zzso sequences of 19 Japanese zzso species, we designed a universal primer set to amplify the partial sequence of the zzso zzso c zzso I zzso zzso The zzso chain reaction product amplified from extracted DNA of zzso larvae using the primer set was directly zzso and species identification based on the variation at zzso was zzso Using the molecular identification system, we sorted 243 specimens of zzso larvae from the southern part of Japan into 10 species including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are regarded as zzso of important livestock animal zzso Eight species of zzso larvae, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recovered from active zzso fields and an abandoned zzso zzso The result suggests that zzso fields contribute to breeding a variety of zzso species and maintenance and spread of zzso zzso In contrast, larvae of zzso zzso were collected from cattle zzso in zzso The molecular identification system described zzso using zzso sequences successfully achieved zzso identification and will be useful for a better understanding of zzso zzso of zzso biting zzso
