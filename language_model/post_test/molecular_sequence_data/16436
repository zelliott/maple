zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are sorted to zzso zzso Among proteins interacting specifically with both zzso is the zzso zzso protein zzso consisting of four zzso recognition motifs zzso and a zzso auxiliary zzso The zzso interaction studies presented here reveal that zzso association with zzso and zzso zzso is exclusively zzso by zzso zzso zzso binding studies with zzso deletion zzso demonstrate preferential binding of zzso zzso even to zzso while zzso zzso exhibit a lower affinity for those zzso An optimal interaction with both zzso and zzso sequences is only achieved by full-size zzso
