zzso a large family of zzso active and inactive zzso belong to a unique zzso of protein zzso zzso that use zzso zzso rather than zzso as zzso zzso Here, by zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso studies of human zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso we define the molecular basis for this unique zzso zzso zzso zzso bind in a pocket located on a positively charged face of the zzso suggesting an zzso mechanism for membrane zzso A flexible, zzso zzso makes extensive interactions with the zzso zzso of zzso explaining the specificity for zzso zzso An extensive zzso network and zzso interactions within the active site pocket determine zzso zzso zzso The conservation of these specificity zzso within the active, but not the zzso zzso provides insight into the functional differences between the active and inactive zzso
