The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso like the zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso of four zzso The larger size of the zzso zzso protein is due to an additional stretch of 120 predominantly zzso zzso acids within domain zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso as a zzso fusion zzso The zzso protein zzso point, zzso has a weak zzso zzso By zzso I zzso studies, each of the 17 zzso boxes zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso region was found to be protected by the zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso proteins carrying a deletion of the zzso located zzso zzso motif or with zzso acid zzso in zzso A zzso or zzso B zzso no longer interact with zzso zzso A substitution of basic zzso acids in the loop of the zzso motif zzso or zzso entailed the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins with little or no capacity for binding to zzso zzso Thus, like in zzso coli, the zzso located domain IV is absolutely necessary for the specific binding of zzso A zzso protein lacking a stretch of zzso zzso acids corresponding to domain II is not affected in its DNA binding zzso Whether the zzso domain II interacts with accessory proteins remains to be zzso
