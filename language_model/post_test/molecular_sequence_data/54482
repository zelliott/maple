Surveillance of zzso zzso resistance and the molecular characterization of the mechanisms underlying these resistance zzso are essential in order to establish correct empirical therapies, as well as to describe the emergence of new mechanisms in local bacterial zzso To address these goals, 149 zzso were collected over a zzso period zzso zzso at the Ontario Public Health Laboratory, Toronto, Canada, and zzso profiles (8 zzso were zzso zzso in previously identified targets or the presence of some zzso related to resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso plus intermediate zzso or reduced zzso zzso to the antibiotics tested were also zzso A significant proportion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found in these zzso zzso resistance was observed in zzso of the zzso Although all the strains were susceptible to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of them displayed reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso 2 mosaic structures were found in all of these zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso and double zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions zzso zzso were associated with and presumably responsible for the resistance zzso zzso This is the first description of zzso in zzso The detection of this zzso indicates a change in the epidemiology of this resistance and highlights the importance of continued surveillance to preserve the last zzso options zzso
