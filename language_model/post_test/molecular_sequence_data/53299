The gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The gene consisted of zzso zzso and had a promoter, zzso and zzso type zzso termination sequences typical in zzso The protein deduced from the sequence consisted of 526 zzso zzso and had a putative signal zzso of 14 zzso acids and 5 possible zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence was zzso to the 12 other zzso from different zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso from the transformed zzso coli had a zzso of 39 zzso and lacked zzso zzso The zzso point and the optimum pH for the activity of zzso were similar to those of original zzso zzso However, the zzso stability was lower, and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso was higher than those of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of the zzso contribute to their zzso The zzso value for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso implied that the affinity of zzso for the zzso was zzso higher than that of the original zzso
