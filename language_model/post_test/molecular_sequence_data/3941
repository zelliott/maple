The control of zzso zzso by zzso is vital for maintenance of normal zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso to efficiently inhibit target zzso A specific zzso sequence zzso in high affinity zzso zzso a zzso change in zzso that is particularly important for factor zzso zzso zzso Thus, synthetic zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso as compared with only zzso versus zzso We built molecular models and identified zzso unique to the active site of zzso that we predicted were important for interacting with the zzso center loop of zzso zzso To test our predictions, we generated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso and examined the rate of association of these zzso with zzso in the presence and absence of zzso zzso interacts with zzso alone with a nearly normal zzso however, we observe only a zzso increase in zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso crystal structure of zzso reveals that zzso forms part of the zzso and zzso pocket, suggesting that the zzso region of the zzso center loop of zzso is crucial for zzso the acceleration in the rate of zzso of zzso by zzso zzso
