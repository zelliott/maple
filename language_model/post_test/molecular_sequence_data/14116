Studies on zzso abnormalities and cell lines have implicated zzso zzso as being important in the zzso of zzso zzso linkage studies have also mapped a zzso locus to zzso zzso The gene zzso is present on zzso zzso and deletions within it are the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso A melanoma cell line zzso a zzso deletion involving the zzso gene and the presence of zzso protein in developing mouse zzso led us to investigate whether zzso deletions and/or zzso protein expression occur in sporadic zzso DNA extracted from 32 fresh zzso was amplified by standard zzso chain reaction for the four common deletions of the zzso gene that occur in zzso In addition, frozen and zzso sections of these zzso were stained with zzso zzso that detect full-length and truncated zzso zzso The results of the study show that deletions of zzso do not occur in zzso Indeed, full and truncated zzso protein also could not be detected zzso in the zzso and frozen sections of the zzso We conclude that the zzso gene and its protein are probably not directly involved in the zzso of zzso
