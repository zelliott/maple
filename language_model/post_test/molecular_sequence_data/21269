Iron zzso by bacteria in zzso environments involves zzso as a zzso zzso from the environment, followed by reduction to the zzso zzso zzso iron reduction is poorly understood in most bacterial zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a gene adjacent to, and zzso with, the zzso gene zzso zzso the outer membrane zzso for transport of a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso was essential for zzso stability, as were zzso zzso zzso in the protein that likely coordinate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso activity on those zzso Furthermore, reduced zzso in zzso zzso was oxidized by zzso iron in zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells that was diminished in an zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were strongly induced under zzso conditions, but transcript levels were low and unresponsive to iron in an zzso zzso lacking the global iron response zzso regulator zzso Thus, zzso positively controls the zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of previously zzso proteins found in many zzso and some zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are not confined to zzso but may be common in zzso
