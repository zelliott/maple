The transforming activity of the human zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of the zzso family, was investigated by testing the effect of zzso avian zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso on chickens or cultured chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso virus did not induce transformed zzso After several passages of the virus stock on zzso cells, however, a few zzso were detected in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso virus at the stage of zzso zzso developed zzso 3 to 6 weeks after zzso The viruses obtained from these zzso and from one of the tumor zzso showed high transforming activity in the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that these viruses carry spontaneous zzso of the zzso zzso Four zzso genes from zzso zzso infected with transforming viruses were zzso zzso and their products were confirmed to possess transforming zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso genes showed that two of the four zzso have zzso instead of zzso at position 338 in the zzso zzso The other two zzso carry deletions of 78 and 108 base pairs, respectively, which result in complete loss of region C of zzso The overall level of proteins containing zzso was significantly higher in transformed cells than in normal zzso zzso Our data indicate that when expressed at high levels in a zzso normal zzso cannot cause cellular zzso but that zzso zzso with either a single zzso acid substitution in the zzso domain or a deletion including region C produces a transforming zzso perhaps due to enhanced zzso zzso zzso This is the first observation that deletion of region C can zzso the potential transforming activity of a zzso family zzso
