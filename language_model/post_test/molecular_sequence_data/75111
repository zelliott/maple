The zzso zzso contains two genes zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene is zzso and is expressed in all cells except zzso while the zzso gene is expressed exclusively in zzso zzso The mouse zzso contains no zzso derived from zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso and zzso strain mice contain six other regions with sequences zzso to those of zzso zzso These zzso sequences are likely derived from the zzso gene by zzso because all are located on zzso zzso and because none appear to be interrupted by zzso Two of the presumed zzso contain sequences zzso to all regions of the zzso zzso while the other four zzso regions were truncated at the zzso zzso or both zzso One of the truncated zzso was zzso Its zzso sequence was not flanked by direct repeats, suggesting that loss of the zzso and/or 3' ends of this zzso may have occurred following its integration into the zzso Our evidence suggests that zzso zzso arose initially more than 100 million years ago and have continued to arise until so recently that some are unique to different mouse zzso
