A zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso sample from the Baltic Sea, zzso zzso using a zzso approach and comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing showed that strain zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and displayed more than 3 % zzso zzso gene sequence divergence from all zzso species with zzso published zzso zzso zzso zzso did not produce aerial zzso zzso zzso were zzso white to pale zzso and fragmented into zzso or zzso zzso The cell wall contained zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of zzso zzso an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso and genetic zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
