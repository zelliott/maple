The Thai zzso of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso zzso Laboratory zzso zzso isolation was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso The virus zzso was determined using zzso multiplex zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was able to detect at least zzso of zzso Of 137 Thai zzso zzso belonged to the European zzso zzso and zzso to the North American zzso zzso zzso products of the eight US strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the six zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for genetic variation zzso The US strains of the Thai zzso are clustered within the same group and are more closely related to the zzso from Canada zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso strains were very similar to the zzso prototype, zzso virus zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso identities within the US zzso tested in this study compared to the US prototype, zzso varied from zzso to zzso whereas zzso zzso acid identities were zzso Based on the zzso tree, each pair of the Thai zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso was identical despite they were collected from different zzso zzso there was no geographic influence on the spreading of zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso shared over zzso similarity of the zzso zzso sequence and zzso of zzso acid identity with the European zzso zzso zzso However, modified live virus vaccines for zzso have not yet been used in the zzso population in zzso The results suggested that both US and zzso zzso exist in zzso genetic variation does occur in both zzso and the sources of the viruses appear to be from Canada and Northern Europe, zzso In addition, the spreading of zzso in Thailand might be due to introducing infected replacement pigs or infected zzso into the zzso
