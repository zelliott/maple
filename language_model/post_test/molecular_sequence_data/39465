zzso peptides exist zzso as a host defense system in a broad range of species, including insects, zzso and zzso The binding of these peptides is followed by the disruption of zzso zzso leading to bacterial cell zzso however, the precise mechanism of membrane destruction has remained zzso In this study, we have examined the mechanism of action for the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We find that the zzso of zzso against either zzso coli or zzso zzso can be zzso by the addition of sugar or zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The dependence of zzso on zzso size suggests the formation of pores with an effective diameter of zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso was observed for cell killing by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also protected cells against the zzso of zzso expressed zzso as a zzso extension of the carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso produced zzso was also dependent on zzso size, in a manner that was in agreement with that observed for zzso added synthetic zzso These data indicate that the formation of discrete pores in the zzso membrane is a key factor in the mechanism of bacterial killing by zzso
