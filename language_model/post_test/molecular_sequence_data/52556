LIGHT is a tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso member, which binds two known cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso entry zzso zzso LIGHT is a zzso that activates zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding zzso via LIGHT were identified by introducing point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and D zzso E zzso of zzso which altered binding to zzso and zzso One zzso of LIGHT exhibits selective binding to zzso and is inactive triggering cell death in zzso cells or induction of zzso in zzso Studies with zzso or zzso zzso further indicated that zzso does not zzso either zzso or by direct zzso to the death zzso activated by zzso zzso not zzso recruits zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso death is blocked by a dominant negative zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso recruitment zzso death signals initiated by zzso interaction and implicates a distinct biological role for zzso zzso
