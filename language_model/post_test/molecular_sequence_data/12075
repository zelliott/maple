The isolation and detailed characterization of a zzso gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso rat is zzso An enriched library, zzso zzso was screened with a human zzso probe, zzso and from which a beta minor zzso zzso was isolated, zzso and zzso A zzso rat zzso probe, zzso derived from the zzso zzso was then used to screen a zzso rat zzso library, zzso zzso The clone zzso was isolated and identified to include the entire zzso gene and part of another zzso zzso zzso which was zzso upstream from zzso zzso walking upstream using the zzso zzso led to the isolation of an overlapping zzso zzso which was shown to include two full-length zzso zzso the most zzso was zzso followed by zzso zzso data suggests that zzso is a beta major zzso whereas zzso is a hybrid gene of zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed this particular zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso may be the zzso of the zzso cluster in zzso
