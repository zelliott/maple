In zzso coli, components of a signal recognition particle zzso and its zzso have been identified which appear to be essential for efficient zzso of several zzso In this study we use zzso to demonstrate that zzso coli zzso interacts with a variety of nascent zzso proteins and integral inner membrane zzso Evidence is presented that the interaction is correlated with the zzso of the core region of the signal sequence and thereby with its ability to promote transport in zzso A second zzso coli zzso which is identified as trigger factor, can be efficiently zzso to all tested nascent chains derived from both zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso and trigger factor act as zzso and general molecular zzso respectively, early in protein zzso
