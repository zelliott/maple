zzso zzso virus zzso is an zzso zzso zzso virus belonging to the family zzso of the order zzso The zzso infectious zzso of zzso is zzso zzso in length zzso of the zzso zzso and contains eight overlapping genes that are expressed from a zzso zzso set of seven zzso zzso To investigate the importance of the overlapping gene arrangement in the viral zzso and to facilitate the genetic manipulation of the viral zzso a series of zzso full-length zzso clones was constructed in which either zzso open reading frames zzso 4 and 5 or zzso 5 and 6 or zzso 4, 5, and 6 were separated by newly introduced zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso transcribed from each of these plasmids was zzso demonstrating that the overlapping gene organization is not essential for zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso viruses zzso with almost the same efficiency, zzso reached nearly the same infectious zzso as the zzso virus, and zzso maintained the zzso that were zzso The zzso site engineered between zzso 5 and 6 was subsequently used to generate a virus in which the zzso of the zzso zzso M protein was extended with nine zzso acids derived from the extreme zzso of the zzso protein of mouse zzso virus zzso family zzso order zzso This zzso contains a functional zzso signal as well as an zzso recognized by an zzso zzso zzso both of which were expressed by the zzso zzso Although the hybrid virus had a clear growth disadvantage in comparison to the parental virus, three serial passages did not result in the loss of the foreign genetic zzso
