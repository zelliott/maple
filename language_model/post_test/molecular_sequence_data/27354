The zzso protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in zzso zzso zzso in zzso It contains two zzso zzso and a WW zzso The zzso protein interacts with zzso a zzso factor, via its WW zzso We previously characterized a rice zzso zzso which was zzso to zzso Here, we found that the zzso protein could interact through its WW domain with the following zzso zzso a protein containing a zzso domain present in zzso factors such as zzso and zzso a protein similar to zzso factor zzso a protein similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein is associated with the 3' end processing machinery in zzso Thus, we examined interactions between zzso and the rice zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso could bind zzso whereas the zzso protein could bridge the interaction between zzso and zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso could interact with several proteins other than zzso through its WW domain and may play several roles in zzso
