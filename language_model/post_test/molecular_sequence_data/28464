zzso zzso genes code for principal zzso regulators of animal body zzso The zzso and divergence of zzso zzso changes in their regulation, and changes in the regulation of zzso target genes have all been implicated in the evolution of animal zzso It is not known whether zzso proteins have also acquired new activities during the evolution of specific zzso zzso sequences outside the zzso zzso of zzso zzso diverge zzso These sequence differences may be neutral with respect to protein function, or they could be involved in the functional divergence of zzso proteins and the evolutionary diversification of zzso Here, we identify a zzso repression domain in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This domain is highly zzso among zzso zzso in other insects, but is absent from zzso in other zzso and zzso The evolution of this domain may have facilitated the greater zzso diversification of zzso zzso and anterior abdominal segments characteristic of modern zzso
