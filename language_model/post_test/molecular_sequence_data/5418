The bacterial zzso and signal recognition particle zzso protein zzso mechanisms are zzso between zzso and higher plant zzso A third zzso mechanism in zzso zzso zzso concentration difference zzso zzso was previously thought to be zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of proteins transported through this zzso zzso in isolated zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso membrane zzso which shows zzso to open reading frames from all completely zzso bacterial zzso which suggests that the zzso zzso has been zzso since the zzso origin of zzso Thus, the third protein zzso pathway, of which zzso is a zzso is found in both bacteria and zzso
