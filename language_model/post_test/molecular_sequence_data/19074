The zzso zzso of zzso species play an important role in electron transfer to zzso zzso in long-range electron transport through zzso zzso and in direct zzso electron zzso Although multiple lines of evidence have indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso have a zzso zzso independent of the presence of zzso zzso this claim is still zzso In order to further investigate this phenomenon, a strain of zzso zzso designated strain zzso was constructed in which the gene for the native zzso the structural zzso zzso was replaced with the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso PA expressed and properly assembled zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and exhibited a profile of outer surface zzso zzso similar to that of a control strain expressing the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the strain PA zzso were decorated with the zzso zzso zzso in a manner similar to the control zzso However, the strain PA zzso were zzso less zzso than the zzso of the control strain, and strain PA was severely impaired in zzso oxide reduction and current zzso These results demonstrate that the presence of zzso on zzso is not sufficient to zzso zzso to zzso and suggest that there are unique structural features of the zzso zzso zzso that are necessary for zzso
