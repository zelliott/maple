The properties of an zzso triplex formed in zzso at the zzso region of the human zzso genes were studied by chemical and physical zzso Chemical modifications performed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso at positions zzso through zzso These zzso were induced by negative zzso low zzso and zzso zzso zzso point zzso associated with zzso persistence of fetal zzso zzso altered the extent of the modifications and some of the zzso Specifically, zzso and zzso significantly decreased the zzso whereas the patterns were increased and altered in the zzso zzso and zzso caused local decreases in zzso zzso at the upstream zzso duplex were modulated by the composition of the zzso zzso In zzso our data indicates the formation of an zzso triplex between zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso and the downstream sequence containing the zzso zzso All of the zzso point zzso altered the zzso More than one sequence alignment is possible for each of the zzso In addition, a consequence of some of the point zzso may be to facilitate zzso of the third strand relative to the zzso zzso
