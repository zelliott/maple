zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from four zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso and rice zzso contained entire coding regions, whereas the zzso zzso lacked the zzso zzso The zzso profiles of the deduced zzso acid sequences predicted the existence of six zzso zzso which are highly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso level for the zzso was high in zzso containing dividing zzso It was suggested that there are multiple copies of zzso genes in both zzso and zzso The soybean zzso was expressed as inclusion bodies in zzso coli, zzso with detergents, and then zzso into zzso The resulting zzso exhibited high zzso transport zzso The activity was inhibited by zzso like those of zzso zzso zzso
