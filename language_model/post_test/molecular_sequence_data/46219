In zzso zzso is a simple procedure that allows for zzso synthesis of zzso molecules of any sequence from short zzso to those of several zzso in zzso to zzso zzso It is based on the engineering of a template that includes a zzso promoter sequence zzso from the zzso zzso upstream of the sequence of interest followed by zzso using the corresponding zzso zzso In zzso transcripts are used in zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso structural studies (for zzso and X-ray zzso in zzso and genetic studies zzso as zzso zzso and as functional molecules zzso and zzso
