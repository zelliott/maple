The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes have been isolated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 217 zzso acids zzso whose zzso sequence is zzso identical to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 210 zzso whose zzso sequence is zzso identical to that of the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso were disrupted by sequential zzso transformation where the zzso zzso was used as a selection marker for zzso The resulting zzso strain of zzso and zzso was used to examine the ability of the zzso genes to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
