The zzso and zzso proteins suppress programmed cell death, whereas zzso promotes zzso We investigated the pattern of expression of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso differentiation and zzso All three proteins were widely expressed in zzso rats but, in the adult, zzso levels were zzso to zzso lower in the cerebral cortex, zzso and heart muscle, whereas zzso was not zzso in any of the zzso zzso In the cerebral zzso and zzso the decrease in zzso levels occurred after the period of zzso cell zzso Further, zzso of a zzso expression zzso into cultured sympathetic zzso which depend on nerve growth factor for survival, induced zzso in the presence of survival factor and increased the rate of cell death after nerve growth factor zzso This effect could be blocked by zzso of an expression zzso for zzso or for the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that, during development, the sensitivity of zzso to signals that induce zzso may be regulated by modulating zzso levels and that zzso death requires zzso zzso
