zzso a neuroendocrine member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso is implicated in the processing of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso and zzso not only its own zzso in the zzso zzso but a subset of protein zzso in the zzso apparatus and in the zzso compartments of the regulated zzso zzso Likewise, mouse zzso zzso has previously been shown to cleave human zzso in zzso cells zzso contain zzso zzso while being unable to cleave zzso in cells, such as Chinese zzso zzso zzso or zzso which are devoid of zzso zzso In the current study, we show that removal of a zzso tail of zzso allows the efficient zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso tail thus appears to act as an inhibitor of zzso activity against certain zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso apparatus, and its zzso which occurs naturally in zzso zzso may explain the observed zzso processing of certain zzso These results also demonstrate that zzso is present in a partially active state prior to the zzso zzso where it is processed to a zzso active zzso
