zzso zzso zzso zzso can be considered as a condition of the whole body as zzso features derived from all the three embryonic lineages are recorded with varying frequency in addition to the presence of multiple zzso in the large zzso Here, we describe two unrelated cases of zzso with unusual zzso zzso namely several abnormalities of zzso origin strongly resembling zzso syndrome zzso or a zzso zzso Conventional zzso and FISH analysis did not reveal any gross zzso zzso on the long arm of zzso 5 where the zzso and zzso genes were zzso However, in case 2 the zzso zzso in the zzso gene was found in the donor zzso site of zzso 4 and was shown to result in a zzso and a premature termination zzso We propose that such zzso tissue abnormalities may result from zzso zzso zzso in combination with specific genetic and/or environmental zzso zzso
