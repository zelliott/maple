The zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor that is important for the normal zzso expression of mast zzso Most zzso factors function in cooperation with other factors by zzso zzso To search proteins interacting with zzso we carried out a zzso zzso screen and isolated zzso zzso protein related factor zzso as a partner of zzso When expressed with zzso in zzso cells, zzso was zzso with zzso The association of zzso with zzso was further confirmed by a zzso study and in zzso binding zzso The zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso were essential for the zzso zzso was expressed in cultured mast cells and zzso zzso cells containing mouse mast cell zzso zzso transcript zzso The zzso of dominant negative zzso in zzso zzso cells reduced the amount of zzso zzso The simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso significantly increased the promoter activity of the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso appeared to play important roles in the normal zzso expression of mast cells in association with zzso
