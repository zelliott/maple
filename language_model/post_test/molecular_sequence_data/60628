The zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is considered an orphan zzso as it has a low affinity for zzso peptides and no identified natural zzso We have reported a novel form of zzso zzso zzso present in high abundance in the pregnant zzso of women and zzso As zzso was originally cloned from guinea pig zzso we zzso that the zzso zzso zzso may be its natural zzso We have therefore cloned the gene for the sheep zzso of zzso and determined its zzso The sheep zzso gene spans 4 zzso and comprises three zzso with zzso borders at positions similar to those observed for the human and mouse zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso has approximately zzso identity with the human, mouse and guinea pig zzso zzso zzso zzso acids important in zzso zzso zzso zzso to second zzso and important in zzso binding were found to be zzso in zzso zzso One potentially important zzso was noted: zzso zzso possesses an zzso zzso at position zzso instead of a zzso zzso as found in all other zzso zzso was previously identified as important in zzso interactions while zzso was implicated in high zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso may have binding characteristics different from those of the human, mouse and guinea pig zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso and zzso but not in zzso of the pregnant zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Nor was zzso expression detected in the zzso zzso or in zzso This pattern of zzso expression is similar to that observed in the mouse but different from that observed in the human, rat and guinea zzso We conclude that there is no local interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the high expression of zzso in the zzso coupled with elevated circulating levels of this zzso zzso during pregnancy suggests an alternate zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso gene will permit a detailed functional analysis of this zzso in the sheep and its role in the mediation of action of zzso zzso
