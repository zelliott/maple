In this work, we analyze several characteristics influencing the low zzso of the zzso zzso in the major founder zzso Y zzso lineage containing the point zzso zzso Variation of zzso was compared with that of five other zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso All the other zzso showed significantly higher levels of zzso than zzso as measured by gene diversity and repeat number zzso Moreover, we had previously shown that zzso had high diversity in Brazilians and in several other populations zzso Thus, the slow zzso evolution in the zzso lineage seems to be both locus and zzso zzso To understand the slow zzso evolutionary rate, the zzso zzso were compared according to their mapping on the Y zzso and also on the basis of structural aspects such as the base composition of the repeat motif and zzso regions and the degree of perfection and size zzso zzso of the variable zzso The only observed difference that might be related to the low zzso zzso is its small average number of repeats, a value expected to be closer to the founder zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These data were also compared to other derived Y zzso The zzso lineage displayed a lower zzso zzso correlated to a small average repeat number, while in the zzso zzso a high zzso zzso was found associated to a larger average repeat zzso This approach reveals that evolution of Y zzso in lineages defined by slowly evolving zzso such as point zzso can be greatly influenced by the size zzso of repeats of the variable zzso of the founder zzso in each zzso zzso Thus zzso methods using zzso variation should be practiced with great zzso
