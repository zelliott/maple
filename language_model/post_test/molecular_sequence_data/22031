Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from soil and their zzso positions were investigated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso grew zzso at 30 degrees C and pH zzso without zzso They contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso Major polar lipids detected in the two strains were zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso that was zzso Their DNA zzso contents were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited no difference in their zzso zzso gene sequences and possessed a mean zzso zzso level of 92 zzso zzso trees based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strains zzso and zzso formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of strains zzso and zzso exhibited similarity values of less than zzso % to members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were distinguished from zzso related zzso by differences in some zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and genetic data, it is proposed that strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso be classified in a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
