The zzso gene in zzso coli encodes a zzso zzso DNA zzso which, although zzso for zzso is required for zzso mismatch repair and zzso zzso repair and zzso is believed to participate in zzso and DNA zzso We have shown in this study that zzso zzso in zzso are incompatible with zzso the zzso being a consequence of the chronic induction of zzso in zzso strains and the zzso zzso of the cell zzso inhibitor zzso (which is a normal target for degradation by Lon zzso zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which lead to persistent zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso induction was not observed in zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso zzso respectively, in zzso repair and mismatch zzso Nor was zzso zzso induction abolished by zzso in genes that affect mismatch repair zzso zzso repair zzso or zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso induction in zzso zzso is not a consequence of defects in these three zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso in DNA replication to unwind secondary structures on the lagging strand immediately behind the progressing replication fork, and that it is the absence of this function which contributes to zzso induction in zzso zzso
