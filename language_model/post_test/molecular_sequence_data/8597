In this report the differential regulation of zzso B and zzso oxide zzso was investigated in the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso following exposure to a mineral dust zzso and/or an zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso and zzso can significantly induce the zzso of zzso B as well as elicit enhanced production of NO in zzso zzso cells as part of an early inflammatory response zzso A 24-hour zzso study showed that NO release from these cells continued to increase following the initial stimulus by zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso B was zzso at 6 hours and then showed a steady decline to 24 zzso The production of NO was suppressed by zzso inhibitor and zzso both of which block the zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, the use of an NO zzso inhibitor resulted in an enhancement of zzso B zzso These findings suggest that NO produced in zzso cells in response to an inflammatory stimulus like zzso or zzso my be linked to a negative feedback role on the zzso of zzso zzso
