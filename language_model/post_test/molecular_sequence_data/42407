A major issue in zzso blood stem cell transplantation zzso for zzso is whether peripheral blood stem cell zzso harvests are less contaminated with zzso cells than bone zzso zzso cells zzso We compared zzso contamination in zzso harvests and zzso obtained zzso by using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in three patients with Philadelphia zzso zzso acute zzso zzso zzso one with zzso acute zzso zzso zzso and two with acute zzso zzso zzso Our zzso zzso method employed zzso zzso in the second step and can detect one zzso blast diluted into zzso zzso zzso In three of four patients with zzso ALL and zzso we detected zzso contamination in both zzso harvests and zzso In the remaining patient with zzso both zzso harvests and zzso were zzso Both zzso harvests and zzso from one patient with zzso were zzso In contrast, zzso harvests from another patient with zzso whose zzso could not be obtained because of bone zzso zzso were zzso after the first course of consolidation chemotherapy, but became zzso after the second zzso The present study does not support the hypothesis that zzso harvests are less contaminated by zzso cells than zzso but suggests that zzso harvests are contaminated when zzso are zzso
