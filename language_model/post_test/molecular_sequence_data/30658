Two independent zzso clones corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a rat liver zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso in the external domain when compared with the full-length rat zzso zzso sequence and 80 to zzso similarity relative to the human zzso However, the zzso sequence of these clones did not match zzso or any other known zzso and was distinct from the 3' end of the zzso zzso which encodes a truncated zzso in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed an open reading frame which is zzso to the external domain of the zzso but which zzso prior to the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of rat zzso DNA indicated that the zzso sequence of this transcript is derived from the zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso clone containing the 3' end of the zzso transcript revealed that this sequence is present as a discrete zzso in the zzso of the zzso gene in proximity to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso Introduction of an expression zzso containing the truncated zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells led to the expression of a zzso protein which was detected in zzso media, by using zzso directed against the zzso A similarly sized protein was also detected in the media of zzso cells, a zzso zzso line of rat zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis established that the truncated zzso is zzso by a zzso transcript found in normal rat zzso Furthermore, Northern analysis of rat zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso transcript is expressed at differing levels in various fetal and adult zzso These data indicate that alternative zzso of the zzso primary transcript yields a zzso zzso which codes for a truncated form of the zzso This zzso is zzso by rat zzso zzso cells in culture, which suggests that it may be zzso by normal rat cells or zzso and perhaps serve an as yet unknown zzso zzso
