Diagnosis of zzso storage diseases zzso can be problematic in zzso cases where clinical zzso may overlap with other genetically distinct zzso In addition, zzso may result from zzso in genes not yet implicated in zzso Thus, there are individuals that are diagnosed with apparent zzso based upon clinical criteria where the gene zzso remains zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether comparative zzso approaches could provide useful insights into such zzso Most zzso arise from zzso in genes zzso zzso proteins that contain zzso zzso a zzso modification that acts as a signal for zzso targeting to the zzso We zzso zzso zzso proteins by affinity zzso and estimated relative abundance of individual proteins in the mixture by spectral counting of peptides detected by tandem mass zzso Our rationale was that proteins that are decreased or absent in patients compared with controls could represent candidates for the primary zzso directing zzso or zzso zzso On a survey of brain autopsy specimens from 23 patients with either confirmed or possible zzso disease, this approach identified or validated the genetic basis for disease in eight zzso These results indicate that this protein expression approach is useful for identifying defects in cases of zzso zzso disease, and we demonstrated that it can be used with more accessible patient samples, zzso cultured zzso zzso this approach was instrumental in the identification or validation of zzso in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the adult form of zzso zzso zzso
