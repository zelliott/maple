A series of synthetic fragments and zzso of zzso have been investigated, in the solid state, by means of differential scanning zzso and zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso were shown to possess both zzso regions and segments of long-range zzso Water, which interacts zzso with the zzso zones, behaves as zzso zzso zzso the localized motions of zzso zzso The results obtained have been correlated with zzso zzso in particular as far as the fundamental zzso role of water is zzso
