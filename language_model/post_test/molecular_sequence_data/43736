Many receptors involved in zzso protein transport through the zzso and zzso pathways of zzso and animal cells share common zzso They are all type I integral membrane proteins containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso tails with zzso sorting zzso The zzso zzso are thought to be involved in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso motifs interact with zzso zzso proteins during protein sorting along these zzso In addition, zzso signals are required for the retention and recycling of some of these membrane proteins to the zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of an approximately zzso zzso growth factor zzso type I integral membrane protein containing all of these functional motifs from zzso zzso (called zzso for zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is a membrane protein found at high levels in the roots of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso protein is present in two membrane zzso corresponding to a novel, undefined compartment and a fraction enriched in zzso containing zzso and its associated zzso zzso zzso may therefore serve as a marker for compartments involved in zzso protein trafficking in the plant zzso
