The aim of this study was to investigate the anatomical distribution of zzso of a recently described zzso zzso and the relationship with the preferred attachment sites of its zzso the brown dog tick zzso zzso zzso samples from 20 dogs were collected from eight anatomical sites and soaked twice in saline solution at zzso All samples were also zzso processed for the specific amplification of partial zzso c zzso 1 zzso zzso were zzso distributed on the body, with higher zzso on zzso region zzso zzso and on the head zzso zzso zzso abundance in dogs was positively correlated with the number of positive anatomical sites with a higher percentage of skin samples scoring positive at the microscopic examination of the first zzso zzso zzso than of the second zzso zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso were scattered in the zzso in association with inflammatory zzso zzso analysis of skin samples showed a lower frequency of positive sites zzso zzso when compared to the microscopic examination zzso zzso with five zzso zzso The results here presented suggested a close zzso of this zzso with its zzso
