The zzso library of rat zzso DNA was screened with the coding region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso Two independent clones having 36 zzso zzso and 31 zzso zzso of zzso were zzso Southern mapping analyses revealed that zzso codes for zzso and zzso for an zzso and that the genes differ markedly in the upstream regulatory zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso revealed that the zzso gene is organized with 6 zzso and 5 zzso spanning about 15 zzso thus coding an zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso starts at 114 by upstream of the translation initiation zzso and 32 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site there is a zzso zzso A sequence similar to Fat zzso zzso 2 zzso the negative regulatory element of zzso zzso was present at 45 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The tissue distribution and induction due to dietary manipulation of zzso and zzso zzso as revealed by Northern zzso were markedly different from each zzso
