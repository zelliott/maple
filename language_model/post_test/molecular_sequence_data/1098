The distribution of zzso DNA zzso variation in Italian zzso ( zzso zzso zzso populations was studied using zzso and zzso zzso In total, 67 populations were zzso and 14 zzso were identified by combining the two marker zzso A remarkable subdivision of zzso diversity in Italian zzso was found, as indicated by a high level of genetic differentiation ( zzso The highest level of total zzso diversity ( zzso was estimated for southern Italian zzso The highest number of zzso was found in the zzso region of the zzso The zzso zzso analysis provided evidence for past fragmentation events that may have been occurred during the zzso zzso and had a major role in defining the genetic structure of the zzso Italian zzso zzso Only one zzso apparently spread towards the north of Italy along the zzso chain and reached the Italian slope of the western part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso found along the zzso remained trapped in the Italian zzso Southern and central Italy represent hotspots of zzso diversity for Italian zzso
