The production of zzso for vaccines in plants has the potential as a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional production zzso Toward the development of a zzso expression system for the production of human zzso virus type I zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was introduced into the zzso of tobacco plants using zzso zzso gene zzso Southern zzso analyses confirmed the presence of the zzso coding sequence within the zzso of transgenic zzso Western zzso analysis of protein extracts from transgenic plants identified zzso zzso protein that zzso with a zzso zzso zzso thus confirming the maintenance of zzso zzso of the zzso protein using zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated yields of zzso zzso zzso per g of soluble leaf zzso Similar zzso levels of zzso were also detected in zzso plants, confirming that the zzso gene is transmitted zzso Our results indicate that zzso transgenic expression represents a viable means of producing zzso for the development of zzso vaccine and for use in zzso diagnostic zzso
