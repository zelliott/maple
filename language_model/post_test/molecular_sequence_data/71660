Plasma zzso transfer protein zzso is a factor that plays an important role in HDL zzso In this study we present data suggesting that zzso has an inherent zzso zzso After incubation of zzso in the presence of zzso plasma zzso the d zzso zzso zzso particles zzso zzso contained intact zzso zzso zzso while the d zzso zzso zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso in addition to intact zzso a zzso 23 zzso form of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso and produced a similar 23 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso increased as a function of incubation time and the amount of zzso zzso The process displayed typically an 8-10 h lag or induction period, after which the zzso proceeded in a zzso zzso This zzso was necessary for the development of the zzso activity during incubation at 37 degrees zzso The specific zzso zzso activity of different zzso preparations varied between zzso zzso zzso zzso per 1000 zzso per h of zzso zzso The 23 zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso specific for the zzso part of zzso indicating that the zzso zzso occurred in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso products were further characterized by mass zzso The 23 zzso zzso yielded a mass of zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso occurs in the zzso portion of zzso between zzso acid zzso 196 zzso and 197 zzso The intact zzso and the 23 zzso zzso revealed identical zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso of zzso could be inhibited with zzso and zzso suggesting that it is due to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso cells or using the zzso cell system caused an zzso zzso pattern identical to that obtained with plasma zzso The present results raise the question of whether zzso zzso zzso of zzso might affect plasma HDL metabolism by generating a novel kinetic compartment of zzso with an increased turnover zzso
