To disclose mechanisms involved in temperature zzso of fish muscle, we subjected zzso fish of zzso zzso zzso to cloning of zzso heavy chain genes zzso We cloned zzso zzso fast skeletal muscle zzso heavy chain zzso zzso from zzso libraries of zzso zzso to 10 and 30 degrees C and observed that different zzso zzso clones are expressed in the two zzso zzso zzso we isolated several overlapping zzso zzso by shotgun cloning strategy from a zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly of the complete zzso zzso zzso locus of 219 zzso revealed a cluster of zzso arrayed 11 zzso in which eight genes are actually zzso with the remaining three being zzso zzso analysis of the transcribed genes revealed that two genes were each highly expressed in zzso zzso to 10 and 30 degrees C, whereas comparatively lower expression levels of the three genes were exclusively observed in zzso zzso to 30 degrees zzso zzso of the remaining genes were too underrepresented in the libraries to determine the expression levels, and the transcripts could only be obtained by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso zzso acid sequences in the loop 1 and loop 2 regions of zzso were highly zzso suggesting that these zzso were functionally zzso The present findings consolidate our knowledge on zzso zzso zzso family and would provide further insight into the mechanisms by which expressions of individual zzso molecules are fine-tuned with environmental temperature fluctuations with further functional analysis of the genes zzso
