We introduce zzso zzso a method for modeling the structure of unknown zzso complexes using the X-ray crystal structures of zzso proteins and zzso with known zzso We present results from modeling the structures of protein zzso complexes using zzso and zzso as zzso These examples show that the zzso method may be used zzso to create and refine models for protein zzso complexes with an overall backbone zzso of less than zzso zzso for the zzso domain, when compared to published X-ray crystal zzso Further refinement of the models of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in complex with their zzso zzso from the published crystal structures was able to improve the zzso of the model complexes to below zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is a useful approach to the problem of zzso drug design in cases where little structural information is available for the target proteins and the binding mode of active compounds is zzso
