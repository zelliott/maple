We analyzed the role of zzso in the dissemination of zzso resistance in a recent zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This isolate harbors three zzso all on a zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso and sequencing zzso we found that zzso 1 has the zzso and zzso zzso The first cassette in zzso 2 contains the zzso zzso separated from its zzso site zzso zzso by a zzso insert containing a group II zzso this zzso codes for a putative zzso zzso on the complementary strand and is the first such zzso to be found associated with an zzso The zzso site is followed by a novel zzso resistance zzso zzso which has been characterized for its zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of this fused cassette suggests that zzso and zzso due to the zzso activity could have an important role in the evolution of zzso resistance zzso This gene is followed by an unknown open reading frame with a typical zzso site and a partial cassette composed of the beginning of the zzso cassette interrupted by zzso The sequence downstream of zzso revealed that the zzso cassette is incomplete and that the 3' zzso segment of this zzso is zzso zzso 3 is in a zzso zzso with the zzso cassette followed by three unknown zzso and zzso The presence of the group II zzso and the relationship of group II zzso in zzso with mobile elements suggest a possible role of this element in events such as cassette formation and/or zzso zzso
