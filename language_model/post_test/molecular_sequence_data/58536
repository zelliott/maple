Chicken infectious anemia virus zzso is a unique infectious agent with an zzso acid composition that has been found to be remarkably zzso even in zzso from different parts of the zzso We have characterized field zzso of zzso which vary significantly in terms of their abilities to replicate in culture, demonstrating a biological difference between zzso Two zzso of zzso cells that differ in their abilities to support zzso were zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso isolate of zzso was found to be less zzso than the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso which supports zzso zzso was found to be zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of previously examined zzso with those of the field zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso isolate revealed a previously zzso zzso region spanning zzso acid positions 139 to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were constructed to examine the potential for this region to affect zzso Transfer of a zzso region of zzso open reading frame 1 into zzso produced a virus with a zzso profile typical of zzso indicating that one or both of the zzso acid differences at positions 139 and 144 affect the rate of replication or the spread of zzso zzso experiments with additional zzso indicated that the inability of zzso to replicate in zzso cells is zzso by a larger region of the zzso which contains the zzso region in addition to upstream zzso acid zzso Analysis of zzso excluding the entire region of open reading frame 1 suggested the presence of a secondary zzso in the progression of infection in culture that was localized to a region containing a single zzso difference which results in zzso acid differences in both zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso signal of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated an increased zzso distribution of zzso and a general lack of zzso zzso bodies in infections of zzso and zzso containing zzso or zzso as opposed to a primarily nuclear distribution and association with zzso zzso bodies in zzso zzso
