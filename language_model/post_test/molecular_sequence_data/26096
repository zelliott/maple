zzso of pig kidney zzso at low zzso of zzso zzso allowed zzso of several peripheral membrane zzso Some of these associated proteins were identified as components of the membrane zzso Here we describe two novel zzso proteins of of Mr zzso zzso 1) and Mr 73,000 zzso 2) which zzso and zzso with zzso and can be stripped off zzso zzso by 1 M zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 were detected by zzso analysis in various cells and zzso including zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso 1 and zzso along the zzso cell surface of zzso cells of kidney zzso and zzso zzso ducts zzso of zzso 2 zzso were too weak for zzso In zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 are minor components bound to the zzso surface of the plasma zzso zzso 1 showed the same zzso mobility as protein zzso However, both proteins have different zzso points zzso 1, zzso 6; protein zzso zzso zzso different zzso fragments, and are zzso zzso Short pieces of sequence obtained from zzso 1 and zzso 2 were not found in any other known protein zzso The occurrence of zzso 1 and zzso 2 in diverse cells and zzso and their association with zzso suggests a general role of these proteins in zzso zzso
