The zzso zzso exhibit a very confined zzso specificity compared with other zzso bacterial zzso they selectively modify the zzso zzso and -C zzso but not other members of the zzso or Ras zzso In this study, the zzso acid zzso involved in the zzso zzso recognition by zzso from zzso zzso are identified by applying zzso analyses of the zzso zzso First, the minimum domain responsible for the recognition by zzso was identified as the zzso 90 zzso Second, the combination of the zzso basic zzso acids zzso the acid zzso zzso and zzso only slightly increases zzso but fully restores the binding of the respective zzso zzso to zzso Third, the zzso zzso and zzso also participate in binding to zzso but they are mainly involved in the correct formation of the zzso complex between zzso zzso and zzso Thus, these six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso distributed over the zzso part of zzso are involved in the correct binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso harboring these zzso shows a kinetic property with regard to zzso which is identical with that of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso given by the zzso occupancy have only minor effects on zzso
