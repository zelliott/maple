zzso peptides of the five alternative zzso sequences of Shaker when applied to the zzso side of zzso channels that have an zzso deletion zzso delta zzso block the channel with zzso correlated with the rate of zzso in the corresponding zzso These peptides share no sequence similarity and yet three out of the five have apparent zzso zzso between 2 and 15 zzso suggesting that the specificity requirements for binding are zzso To identify the primary structural zzso required for effective block of zzso delta zzso we examined the effects of zzso made to the 20 zzso zzso zzso on association and zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso appear to be important in stabilizing the binding through zzso zzso zzso to zzso showed there was a clear correlation between zzso and the zzso rate constant zzso with little effect on the association rate constant zzso Substituting charged zzso for zzso zzso within the region zzso disrupted zzso Within the zzso half of the zzso zzso that increased the net positive charge increased zzso with relatively small changes in zzso suggesting the involvement of long-range zzso interactions in increasing the effective concentration of the zzso zzso charged zzso produced small changes in zzso zzso within the region zzso act zzso zzso which zzso net charge produced little effect on either zzso or zzso The results are consistent with this region of the zzso having an extended zzso and suggest that when bound this region makes few contacts with the channel protein and remains relatively zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain of the intact zzso channel produced zzso similar effects on blocking and zzso zzso
