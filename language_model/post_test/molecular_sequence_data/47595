The zzso r zzso gene of 49 zzso of zzso group B isolated from various origins was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso and subsequently zzso with the restriction zzso zzso I and zzso zzso The restriction profiles of all group B zzso appeared to be identical indicating no zzso sequence variations of this zzso A zzso of the gene of two group zzso reference zzso including the zzso V2 region, could be amplified by zzso and zzso The sequence appeared to be identical and allowed the design of zzso zzso zzso The primer pair used produced an zzso with a size of zzso zzso and correctly identified all 49 group zzso investigated but none of the control strains of various species and zzso This primer could be used in a multiplex zzso and allowed a rapid identification of bacteria of this zzso
