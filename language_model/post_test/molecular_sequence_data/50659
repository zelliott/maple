zzso observed in the zzso of two related zzso are closely tied to a particular region of their zzso For the virulent zzso of this pair, zzso rabbit zzso virus zzso this region is the zzso zzso fragment, which is zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso this region is the corresponding zzso zzso fragment, which is zzso zzso As part of our attempt to understand the zzso of these two zzso we zzso these two DNA zzso The sequence for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is reported elsewhere zzso et zzso zzso We report here the sequence for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso open reading zzso and compare both DNA and open reading frame structures to those of zzso and other known zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso contains 12 open reading frames of 100 zzso acids or more, arranged similarly to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso similarities between zzso and zzso are seen in certain parts of this restriction fragment, including substantial stretches of DNA in which the two viruses are zzso Clear zzso exist between these zzso virus zzso and those of other related zzso To understand the zzso of virus infection, one must appreciate the structure of those viral genes that play important roles in zzso
