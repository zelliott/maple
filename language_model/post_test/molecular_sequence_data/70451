zzso growth factor is zzso as a zzso zzso acid precursor protein that contains zzso zzso zzso repeats of approximately 57 zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides have been isolated from zzso species and are growth factors implicated in zzso and zzso cell zzso Here they are identified as Human zzso zzso zzso zzso binding proteins using the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of selected zzso in an zzso zzso repeat caused loss of binding to zzso zzso zzso In zzso binding of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso repeats was also observed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is actively zzso from zzso cells and has been shown to serve as a zzso factor for zzso and for zzso cells, our observations suggest that zzso growth factors may function as biologically important zzso zzso zzso
