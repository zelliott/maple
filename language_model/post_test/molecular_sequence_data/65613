Human zzso zzso is a zzso unfolded protein whose zzso into zzso zzso is involved in the pathology of Parkinson zzso A full comprehension of the structure and dynamics of early zzso leading to the zzso states is an zzso problem of essential importance to researchers attempting to decipher the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and formation of zzso Traditional bulk techniques used so far to solve this problem point to a direct correlation between zzso unique zzso properties and its propensity to aggregate, but these techniques can only provide zzso information for zzso and zzso zzso They therefore cannot characterize the full complexity of the zzso zzso that trigger the zzso zzso We applied atomic force zzso zzso mechanical unfolding methodology to study the zzso equilibrium of human zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was characterized at the zzso zzso Three main classes of zzso including zzso and zzso structures, were directly observed and zzso without any interference from zzso soluble zzso The relative abundance of the zzso structures significantly increased in different conditions promoting the zzso of zzso the presence of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso This methodology can explore the full zzso space of a protein at the zzso level, detecting even poorly populated zzso and measuring their distribution in a variety of biologically important zzso To the best of our knowledge, we present for the first time evidence of a zzso equilibrium that controls the population of a specific class of zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with conditions known to promote the formation of zzso A new tool is thus made available to test directly the influence of zzso and pharmacological strategies on the zzso equilibrium of zzso zzso
