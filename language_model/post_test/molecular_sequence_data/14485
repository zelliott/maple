zzso 71 zzso which causes mild illness in children is also associated with severe neurological zzso This study analyzed the complete zzso of zzso strains derived from mild and severe diseases in order to determine whether the differences of zzso zzso were responsible for different clinical zzso Compared to complete zzso of zzso strains derived from mild cases (less virulent zzso zzso differences in zzso strains isolated from severe cases (more virulent zzso were observed primarily in the internal zzso entry site zzso of the zzso region zzso which is vital for the zzso translation of viral zzso In the zzso region, an zzso substitution at zzso acid position 145 of structural protein zzso that occurred in more than one of more virulent strains was zzso This site is known to be related functionally to zzso binding and zzso in zzso Overall, strains zzso zzso isolated from patients with fatal or severe zzso outcomes had greater sequence zzso in the zzso and/or zzso region and exhibited a relatively zzso zzso to less virulent strains across the entire zzso indicating the possibility of significant zzso diversity in the most virulent zzso zzso Further studies of zzso zzso should examine the significance of zzso diversity and the effects of multiple zzso in a viral zzso
