A zzso zzso zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a coastal hot spring of Green Island zzso located off zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that it shared zzso % sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso with six zzso units zzso was the major respiratory zzso and zzso : zzso zzso : 1) G, zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso zzso and/or zzso : zzso were the zzso fatty zzso The zzso polar lipids were zzso zzso and zzso Six unidentified zzso and zzso also occurred as minor zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with other zzso species and zzso fatty acid compositions and other zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
