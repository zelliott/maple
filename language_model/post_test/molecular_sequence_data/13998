zzso skeletal muscle development has become a paradigm for understanding the molecular basis of how cell lineages are established and how cells differentiate into specialized zzso Most zzso muscles are derived from individual zzso that produce two distinct muscle zzso the zzso muscles that generate the zzso and trunk zzso and a second migratory cell population that zzso regions of the developing zzso In both instances, muscle differentiation is accompanied by cell cycle arrest, fusion of individual zzso into zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Recent experimental progress has led to greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control zzso in the zzso Most of the advances have come from the identification and isolation of regulatory genes that are involved in controlling specific zzso zzso In particular, the muscle regulatory factor zzso and zzso zzso factor 2 zzso families have been implicated in establishing the zzso lineage as well as controlling terminal zzso Two additional zzso factors, zzso and zzso also appear to play a role in the production of a mature muscle zzso This review focuses on these four zzso zzso factor families and discusses the experimental evidence that these factors play important, zzso roles in regulating skeletal muscle zzso
