zzso protein interactions in zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso have been shown to involve low zzso zzso zzso Two different types of interaction have been zzso In the so-called type I interaction, zzso zzso interact with zzso zzso acids at low zzso thereby providing a rationale for the high zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The type II interaction involves charged zzso interacting with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coat protein and subsequent in zzso analysis were performed to distinguish between these two types of zzso zzso The results reveal a prominent role for the zzso zzso and zzso since zzso to an zzso zzso zzso symptom development on secondary leaves, indicating that spreading of the virus in the plant is zzso zzso zzso and coat protein synthesis are not altered, showing that these two zzso may play a role in the process of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coat protein in zzso coli leads to the formation of bona fide zzso showing that the two zzso are not critical in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso to zzso apparently did not interfere with virus zzso The functional role of the zzso during the infection cycle is discussed in terms of the structure of the coat zzso both at the level of zzso acid sequence conservation among the members of the zzso family and as the three-dimensional structure of the coat zzso
