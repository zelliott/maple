zzso can be an aggressive, zzso and fatal zzso In this study, we zzso zzso associated with the differentiation status of zzso to gain insight into the basis for its zzso zzso expression profiles determined in human tumors and normal fat specimens identified a zzso tumor expression signature consisting of 35 zzso zzso zzso expression was confirmed in a second independent sample zzso The zzso was the most zzso zzso and functional investigations assigned an important role in the growth of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso or stable zzso of zzso retarded tumor cell growth, decreased colony formation, and induced zzso zzso arrest in zzso and blocked tumor growth in zzso zzso in zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a direct target of zzso control which enhanced zzso signaling and zzso D1 zzso promoting tumor cell zzso In zzso our results point to important functions for zzso and zzso signaling in progression of zzso revealing zzso vulnerabilities that might be exploited for both zzso and therapeutic zzso
