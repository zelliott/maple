The clearance zzso for zzso peptides zzso a candidate gene for essential hypertension, is highly expressed in zzso zzso where is nutritionally zzso The objectives of the present study were to sequence the human zzso regulatory region of zzso to identify zzso zzso and their zzso and to study the zzso correlation in zzso zzso 

Using zzso chain reaction zzso and direct automated sequencing, a zzso zzso zzso was detected at position zzso in a zzso promoter element named zzso The novel zzso zzso makes the promoter sequence identical to the mouse gene and introduces a second zzso site in the amplified DNA, allowing the zzso of a large number of zzso In a random sample of 232 white Caucasians the zzso zzso was more commonly found zzso of all zzso with 155 zzso zzso 69 zzso zzso and only eight AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were determined in 84 patients with essential zzso In the presence of obesity zzso mass index zzso zzso or zzso 30 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly lower plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas zzso blood pressure zzso and mean blood pressure zzso had the opposite association zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 12 versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference in zzso levels were also present when overweight patients zzso zzso or zzso 27 zzso were zzso 

A common zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter is associated with lower zzso levels and higher zzso and zzso in obese zzso The zzso zzso in the presence of increased zzso might reduce plasma zzso through increased zzso zzso zzso contributing to higher blood zzso
