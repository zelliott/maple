The sequence specificity in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with DNA fragments of the zzso I gene of zzso coli was studied by using DNA sequencing zzso In order to map the sites of zzso zzso we took advantage of the zzso zzso activity associated with T4 DNA zzso which is blocked by bulky zzso such as zzso zzso A quantitative analysis of the sites of zzso is zzso zzso was demonstrated to zzso with zzso and, to a lower extent, to zzso zzso sequences and zzso sites in a zzso context are the most zzso sites towards zzso whereas zzso zzso CA, zzso sites are weaker sites with similar zzso zzso in zzso zzso sequences are also targets of zzso zzso We observed a less pronounced sequence specificity of zzso than that of other zzso derivatives already studied zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso A comparison with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is also zzso The role of zzso sequence and consequently of the local zzso at the various sites of zzso is zzso A preferential orientation of the zzso zzso during the zzso in the dark is zzso Hot zzso treatment of zzso DNA did not reveal any DNA strand breakage due to zzso zzso
