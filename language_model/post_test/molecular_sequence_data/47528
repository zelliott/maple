We have identified a zzso of the zzso family and named it novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from activated zzso human T cell zzso zzso Its sequence predicts a zzso protein with a zzso signal zzso a molecular mass of 22 zzso in mature form, and the highest zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene for zzso is on zzso zzso A zzso equivalent to zzso also was identified, which shows zzso zzso to human zzso zzso zzso is found mainly in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 130 zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 in the zzso human zzso zzso zzso shows activities typical of zzso family zzso In zzso it supports the survival of chicken zzso motor and sympathetic zzso In mice, it zzso serum zzso A, zzso the induction by zzso of zzso and zzso and causes body weight loss and B cell zzso with serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso stimulating zzso
