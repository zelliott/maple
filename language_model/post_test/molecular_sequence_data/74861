The zzso zzso a member of the zzso family isolated from zzso zzso zzso contains three open reading zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso included in this family produce zzso zzso zzso that contributes to copy number zzso The zzso zzso a transcript which consists of 54 zzso zzso is zzso on the opposite strand from the zzso zzso region and partially zzso an zzso zzso binding site zzso for zzso The zzso is integrated by the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso is complementary only to the zzso zzso sequence zzso This complementary sequence is located at a distance from the terminal loop of the zzso secondary zzso The zzso structure predicted by the zzso program suggests the possible generation of a terminal and an internal hairpin zzso The amount of in zzso translation product of zzso zzso was zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in the terminal and internal hairpin zzso of the zzso had zzso effects on its binding to the target zzso We propose that the intact structures of the terminal and internal hairpin zzso respectively, play important roles in forming the initial kissing and extending complexes between the zzso and target zzso and that these regulate the copy number of this zzso
