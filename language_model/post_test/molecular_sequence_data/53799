The zzso gene deletion syndrome zzso is characterized by zzso syndrome, zzso zzso mental zzso and zzso and is caused by a deletion in zzso zzso several genes including zzso zzso and zzso We have now cloned the zzso zzso and zzso genes and have mapped both novel zzso genes to mouse zzso X band zzso The zzso and human zzso show zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity at the zzso acid level, with conservation of the respective putative zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso are the true zzso zzso of the human zzso Furthermore, the mapping of zzso and zzso to zzso suggests that this zzso is zzso at least for a portion of zzso zzso
