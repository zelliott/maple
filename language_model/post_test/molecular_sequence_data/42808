The extent of diversity of the gamma delta zzso zzso zzso in normal human skin and Oriental zzso zzso zzso was examined by molecular analysis of the variable zzso delta gene segment, zzso zzso delta gene segment and zzso zzso To examine the expression of zzso delta zzso segments of gamma delta T zzso DNA isolated from normal human skin and from zzso were subjected to zzso gene amplification by the zzso chain reaction zzso method using zzso V zzso and J zzso zzso as zzso zzso amplification using these zzso indicated that the V delta 2 gene segment was predominantly used by gamma delta T zzso in both normal human skin and zzso To determine the extent of zzso diversity in the delta gene of gamma delta T cells in normal human skin and zzso we zzso the zzso acid sequences corresponding to the V delta zzso delta 1 zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso regions demonstrated broad zzso diversity in normal skin but only limited diversity in zzso Our findings support the hypothesis that skin gamma delta T zzso may derive from a fetal subset of gamma delta T zzso that leaves the zzso early and zzso the zzso The limited zzso diversity demonstrated in zzso zzso indicates that gamma delta T cells can undergo zzso expansion following recognition of a specific zzso and supports the idea that zzso regions are important in the recognition of zzso zzso
