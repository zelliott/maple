Relatively little is known about the development of zzso zzso zzso and their gene expression in zzso spinal zzso The expression of zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso gamma zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and adult rat spinal zzso and zzso root zzso zzso cells were studied by in zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Both techniques revealed the presence of all zzso zzso originally found in the rat brain, except for alpha 6, which was not zzso and zzso which was zzso detected only by zzso Two zzso distinctive sets of zzso zzso were found by in zzso zzso within the zzso zone zzso and mantle zone zzso The trio of alpha 4, beta 1, and gamma 1 zzso zzso emerged exclusively in zzso cells at embryonic day 13 zzso and remained zzso in the zzso until zzso In the zzso beta 3 zzso zzso was first detected at zzso while alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 2, gamma 2, and gamma 3 transcripts appeared at zzso Expressions of the zzso zzso in the zzso rapidly increased and expanded in a zzso sequence from zzso to zzso horn zzso before reaching a peak in the late zzso zzso zzso The zzso expressions declined during zzso development, by zzso zzso with alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1, and gamma 3 zzso zzso becoming barely zzso In contrast, alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 3, and gamma 2 transcripts persisted into adulthood with distinct anatomical zzso zzso analysis revealed unique zzso patterns in the zzso of zzso products, most of which were in good agreement with zzso changes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso amplified minute amounts of zzso for alpha 1, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1, gamma 3, and delta zzso in adults, which were not found in film zzso but could be detected in a few zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso cells expressed alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 zzso zzso during zzso but only alpha 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 zzso zzso were reliably detected in the zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
