We present a technique that allows zzso analysis of zzso zzso using zzso optical zzso zzso Observation of individual molecules of zzso zzso zzso allows determination of zzso zzso that are difficult or impossible to accurately obtain from bulk studies, and provides high zzso resolution of the zzso motion under a zzso mechanical zzso One limitation of previous single zzso studies was the difficulty in zzso the observed motion of zzso with its actual position on the DNA template to better than approximately 100 zzso In this work, we improved the spatial precision of optical zzso studies of zzso to approximately 5 zzso by using zzso zzso as an zzso marker of zzso template zzso This zzso method was sufficient to unequivocally locate and study a single known pause sequence zzso By applying various loads to assist zzso forward zzso we specifically investigated zzso zzso within this pause region and found that the dwell time at the pause sequence decreased with increasing assisting zzso This observation is consistent with bulk zzso studies that suggest zzso reverse zzso or zzso at the zzso pause zzso
