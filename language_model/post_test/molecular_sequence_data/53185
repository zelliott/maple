zzso zzso zzso is a family of nuclear receptors involved in various zzso zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Four transcripts arise as a result of differential promoter usage and alternative zzso at the zzso zzso The longer transcript, form A, encodes a zzso zzso The shorter transcript, form B, lacks the zzso domain, and hence could not activate zzso The difference in promoter usage generates zzso proteins with different zzso zzso All four transcripts appear to be expressed in most of the adult zzso zzso during zzso development, the zzso form is the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso transcript is expressed in the zzso spinal cord, zzso arch and zzso zzso including zzso liver, and zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso zzso implies its function in gut zzso
