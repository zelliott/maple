The zzso zzso harboring the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso 2 strain zzso in the zzso background of the zzso 1 strain zzso was defective in zzso gene zzso This zzso was corrected in the presence of zzso from zzso Based on this zzso result and an analysis of the induction requirements of the zzso zzso and its parent zzso it was hypothesized that the defective zzso gene induction in zzso was related to a dysfunctional interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso To verify this hypothesis, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and conclusions from this first set of analyses were then zzso by comparing zzso and zzso zzso Whereas only a few zzso differences were identified in the promoters and zzso ends of the coding regions of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of hybrid zzso genes showed that these differences collectively accounted for the poor zzso gene induction of strain zzso In contrast with the sequence similarity of the zzso zzso extensive divergence was seen between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso introduced in trans had little effect on zzso gene induction of zzso it enhanced the induction response of a strain zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso had been zzso by marker zzso These results suggest that zzso backgrounds provided by different strains of zzso zzso are not equivalent for zzso zzso Following zzso transfer of certain zzso plasmids to a new zzso host, evolution of the newly introduced zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso may lead to zzso of zzso interaction and zzso gene induction zzso
