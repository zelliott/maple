To evaluate the importance of the quantitative composition of zzso zzso egg zzso proteins during initial events of zzso zzso life, viable eggs were obtained from captive zzso zzso parameters zzso egg zzso zzso zzso rate zzso and zzso survival rate zzso at 0, 3, and 5 days zzso zzso were determined for 70 egg zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso from the eggs using zzso zzso separated and detected by zzso identified and characterized using mass zzso zzso using image zzso and finally correlated to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were identified as zzso products resulted from both zzso and zzso All the zzso zzso proteins were significantly correlated to zzso with a maximum explanatory effect zzso of zzso The concentration of the zzso zzso protein was significantly correlated with zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso and zzso at 0 zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso at 3 and 5 zzso The results showed the importance of zzso protein content in the egg for zzso and early zzso development and indicated its potential use to predict egg quality in zzso
