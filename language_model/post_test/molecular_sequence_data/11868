zzso are necessary for the development of zzso zzso The mechanisms by which the originally zzso zzso cancer cells are relieved of the requirement to use zzso for their growth are largely zzso The human zzso cancer cell line zzso has been shown to contain a point zzso in the human zzso zzso gene zzso suggesting that changes in the zzso may contribute to the abnormal hormone response of zzso zzso To search for point zzso in the zzso we used single strand zzso zzso analysis and a zzso chain reaction direct sequencing method to screen 23 zzso cancer specimens from zzso patients, 6 zzso cancer specimens from treated patients, and 11 benign zzso zzso zzso One zzso was identified in DNA isolated from zzso cancer zzso and the zzso was also detected in the zzso DNA of the patient and his zzso The zzso changed zzso 726 in zzso E from zzso to zzso and was a germ line zzso The zzso we found in zzso E of the zzso gene does not alter the zzso binding specificity of the zzso but the zzso zzso was activated by zzso to a significantly greater extent than the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso described in this study might be one explanation for the altered biological activity of zzso zzso
