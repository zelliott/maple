We identify a human zzso zzso in the zzso motif of zzso that is associated with zzso syndrome, a fatal cardiac zzso caused by altered function of zzso The zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso and also prevents zzso of zzso at cell surface sites in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both localized at zzso disc and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso from rat zzso These data suggest that zzso associates with zzso and that zzso is required for zzso zzso at excitable zzso in zzso Together with previous work in zzso these results in zzso suggest that zzso zzso in a common zzso for zzso of zzso zzso channels at sites of function in multiple excitable cell zzso
