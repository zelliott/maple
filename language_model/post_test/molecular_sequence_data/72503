In zzso zzso mice, a single base zzso of the zzso gene in zzso 105 results in the replacement of zzso by a premature stop zzso and production of a truncated inactive form of zzso These observations suggest that zzso activity may be zzso at least in part, to zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso To investigate this possibility, we zzso six overlapping zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso and examined their effects on body weight and food intake in female zzso zzso zzso When compared with zzso control mice, weight gain by mice receiving 28 daily zzso zzso injections of zzso zzso or zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso reduced with no apparent zzso Weight gain by mice receiving zzso zzso or zzso was not significantly different from that of zzso control zzso The effects of zzso zzso or zzso were most pronounced during the first week of zzso zzso Within 7 days, mice receiving these peptides lost zzso zzso and zzso respectively, of their initial body zzso After 28 days, mice given vehicle alone, zzso zzso or zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, than they were at the beginning of the zzso Mice given zzso or zzso were only zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas mice given zzso were zzso zzso Food intake by mice receiving zzso zzso or zzso but not by mice receiving zzso zzso or zzso was reduced by zzso The results of this study indicate 1) that zzso activity is zzso at least in part, in zzso between zzso zzso 2) that zzso peptides have in zzso effects similar to those of native zzso and 3) offer hope for development of zzso zzso of zzso having potential application in human or veterinary zzso
