We analyzed the zzso profiles of zzso mouse embryonic stem cells zzso and show that zzso bodies zzso zzso expressed genes associated with the zzso primitive streak, zzso and zzso of the developing zzso zzso zzso as a model system for identifying zzso of genes marking specific stages of zzso By comparing the zzso profiles of zzso zzso to those of their differentiated zzso we identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes selectively expressed in zzso zzso zzso Over zzso of the zzso genes were expressed in zzso and vice versa, zzso to the underlying similarity of zzso and zzso The expression of a cohort of 68 genes decreased greater than zzso during differentiation in both zzso and zzso As well as containing many validated zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso this cohort included an zzso gene zzso which we designated zzso zzso was expressed at the stem cell and zzso stages of zzso differentiation and in the zzso nervous system, zzso and zzso of the developing mouse zzso zzso and its more widely expressed zzso zzso comprise a new family of structurally unique genes zzso throughout zzso zzso
