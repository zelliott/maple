Based on the partial zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to group II, zzso from rat zzso the zzso zzso zzso was cloned by a new cloning strategy utilizing zzso zzso zzso At the zzso of the coded 146 zzso which were deduced from the zzso zzso the putative signal zzso was found despite the tight adherence of this zzso to the zzso The sequence of rat zzso exhibits zzso zzso with that of human group II zzso in the zzso zzso The result of zzso zzso analysis showed that rat zzso zzso contains the largest amount of the zzso transcript among the zzso zzso
