zzso zzso zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel 2) located on the Down syndrome region zzso in humans has been reported to have several alternative transcripts and transcripts longer than 4 zzso that do not have the zzso zzso We zzso zzso transcripts with a long zzso region zzso containing multiple zzso zzso elements zzso with the zzso zzso In a zzso transcript, 28 zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso were zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso revealed abundant expression of the zzso transcripts in the rat brain despite no zzso signals in other zzso zzso The zzso have been reported to mediate the turnover of zzso zzso proteins regulating cellular zzso and body response to inflammatory and environmental zzso This is the first study indicating that zzso channel transcripts have multiple zzso
