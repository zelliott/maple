The relationship between a putative zzso gene zzso and exposure to cadmium zzso in blood zzso zzso zzso is zzso In a zzso zzso experiment, mortality of zzso was found to zzso increase in the range of zzso zzso zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso for 16 days caused significant increases zzso in zzso zzso in whole zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso in these zzso increased with the duration of zzso Two zzso libraries constructed using the zzso from control and zzso zzso gave zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso zzso of 510 zzso in zzso was isolated from the treated zzso library using a zzso probe zzso from the blue zzso zzso zzso Northern analyses using zzso as a probe indicated low expression of the zzso zzso in control zzso In zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso for 4 days, zzso zzso level increased to approximately zzso but declined to zzso at day zzso After 12 and 16 days of zzso treatment, expression of the zzso gene was zzso and zzso respectively, compared to the zzso These observations suggest that induction of the zzso gene by a zzso dose of zzso is zzso occurring within 4 days of zzso
