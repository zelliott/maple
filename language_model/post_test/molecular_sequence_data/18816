zzso prenatal testing of zzso 21 zzso is being actively investigated using zzso zzso markers zzso that are present in maternal zzso Recently, 12 zzso on zzso 21 were identified based on zzso zzso characteristics between zzso and blood, and demonstrated excellent clinical performance in the zzso detection of fetal zzso However, the zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso have not been zzso zzso we validated the zzso zzso characteristics of these zzso for use in zzso detection of fetal zzso 

We performed a high-resolution zzso array analysis of human zzso 21 using a zzso binding zzso protein zzso method with whole blood samples from zzso normal women, whole blood samples from pregnant normal women, zzso samples of normal zzso and zzso samples of zzso zzso zzso array results were validated by zzso direct sequencing and zzso 

Among 12 zzso only four zzso were confirmed to be zzso in normal zzso and zzso in zzso One of these four showed a severe zzso in the zzso patterns of zzso zzso samples, and another was located within a region of copy number zzso Thus, two zzso were confirmed to be potential zzso markers based on their zzso zzso zzso The array results of these zzso were consisted with the results obtained by zzso direct sequencing and zzso Moreover, the two zzso were detected in maternal zzso 

We validated that two zzso have the potential to be zzso zzso which is consistent with their zzso zzso zzso The findings of this study suggest that zzso zzso characteristics should be considered in the development of zzso zzso for zzso prenatal testing of zzso
