zzso has previously been shown to zzso an essential zzso required for zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso C in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso 12, in zzso In this paper, we have determined that an unusual zzso zzso associated with the zzso disruption zzso is due to the zzso formation of a zzso fusion zzso This fusion protein is zzso to zzso thereby reducing the quantity of the zzso zzso available for zzso zzso C zzso We show that the zzso region of zzso contains the essential functional domain of the zzso and that a zzso zzso zzso containing only this domain is zzso for its function in zzso and in zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso domain is suppressed by five different genes on zzso zzso including zzso zzso the largest zzso of zzso zzso C and zzso which has been implicated in the activity of protein zzso
