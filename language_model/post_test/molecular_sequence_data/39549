A variable number of tandem repeats zzso zzso based on a zzso unit have been reported in the promoter region of the human zzso zzso A gene zzso Human zzso have been shown to affect zzso activity, and some reports suggest that zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been reported in the zzso zzso promoter but the zzso activities of the zzso remain to be zzso In the present study, we zzso the zzso promoter region of zzso zzso and compared the zzso activities of zzso zzso promoter sequences with those of zzso All apes examined were zzso in the region corresponding to the human zzso and two, four, three, and two zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeat structures in zzso zzso and zzso were considerably different from those in humans and zzso In a human zzso cell line, most of the zzso sequences that had a short repeat length zzso or zzso exhibited higher promoter activity than a human zzso sequence with a zzso repeat zzso However, an zzso difference dependent on the repeat number was not observed among the zzso zzso zzso
