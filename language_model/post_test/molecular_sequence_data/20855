The zzso relationship of purple sulfur bacteria zzso of the order zzso zzso zzso was analyzed based on zzso gene sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso and the results compared to zzso trees and groupings of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso genes were constructed and successfully used to amplify the zzso genes of members of 16 zzso of zzso In total, zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences of 66 zzso strains were zzso including 29 type strains and 28 new zzso The zzso zzso trees of the zzso and zzso zzso genes reflected a largely similar zzso development suggesting zzso of these essential genes within the zzso It is concluded that horizontal gene transfer of zzso genes within the zzso is highly unlikely, in contrast to the situation in other groups of zzso zzso bacteria belonging to zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso is therefore in good agreement with the current zzso zzso of zzso A zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso level is possible based on their zzso or zzso zzso and in many cases even to the species zzso In addition, our data support a correlation between zzso protein structure and the type of internal zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso
