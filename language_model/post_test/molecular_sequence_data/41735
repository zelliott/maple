To investigate the possible roles of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso processing, and stability of the protein in plant cells, five gene constructions deleting or zzso the zzso were made based on one of the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso These constructions were introduced into tobacco zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso on ripe seeds, it was demonstrated that none of the zzso was necessary for the sorting of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the mature gene products indicated that, for all of the modified zzso zzso precursors made, the proteins were zzso folded and correctly zzso However, the latter is less efficient when the internal zzso between the small and the large zzso is missing or when this internal zzso is zzso In an attempt to establish a rapid zzso system for modified zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were transformed with the same gene zzso It was demonstrated that the processing machinery in zzso cells differs from that in plants, and, in a perhaps related zzso differences in stability of a particular modified protein were zzso
