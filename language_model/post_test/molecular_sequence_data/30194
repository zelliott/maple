A pulse of the steroid hormone zzso at the end of zzso zzso development triggers coordinate changes in both zzso and zzso zzso that result in metamorphosis to the adult zzso In zzso zzso zzso this pulse activates a genetic regulatory hierarchy zzso by the induction of two kinds of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a small set of zzso zzso representing a primary response to the hormone, and a complex set of zzso zzso whose delayed appearance is dependent on proteins zzso during the primary zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso that occupies the early puff locus at zzso zzso contains two overlapping zzso zzso The zzso A unit is a zzso with the zzso gene and contains six zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are specific to this unit, and zzso 2-5, which are common to both zzso The zzso B unit is 20 zzso long and contains five zzso a zzso zzso zzso located within the second zzso of zzso A, and the common zzso zzso Large open reading frames start within the first zzso of each unit and continue into the last zzso and therefore zzso two different zzso Both proteins exhibit sequence similarity to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of proteins in the steroid zzso zzso The two putative zinc fingers that characterize the zzso domain are zzso by zzso A1 and zzso 2, so that the zzso A protein contains both fingers, whereas the zzso B protein contains only the zzso Both proteins contain the same putative zzso domain zzso by zzso zzso
