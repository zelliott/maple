We present a method of zzso zzso simulated zzso to order clones in a library with respect to their position along a zzso This ordering method relies on scoring each clone for the presence or absence of specific target zzso thereby assigning a digital signature to each zzso Specifically, we consider the zzso of zzso zzso to a clone to constitute the zzso In that the degree of zzso overlap is reflected in the similarity of their signatures, it is possible to construct maps based on the zzso of the differences in signatures across a reconstructed zzso Our simulations show that with as few as 30 zzso and a zzso density of zzso zzso zzso it is possible to assemble a small zzso zzso into 33 zzso blocks of clones zzso With higher zzso zzso and more zzso this number can be reduced to less than 5 zzso per zzso
