The zzso species are zzso important zzso widespread in the zzso These zzso zzso zzso possess an astonishing ability to bypass the plant resistance genes in few zzso However, the genes and mechanisms involved in this molecular determinism are not yet zzso Except zzso and zzso studies, few data are available concerning their zzso There is therefore an important need of molecular tools for genetic investigation of their zzso character and other aspects of zzso zzso In that respect, the presence of zzso zzso was assessed in these zzso zzso by a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso using zzso zzso designed from two zzso regions of the zzso zzso open reading frame zzso Four zzso species of the five tested revealed the presence of zzso in their zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that sequences zzso to the zzso zzso zzso clones occur at a moderate to low copy number in the different zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis show that the zzso zzso may form new zzso of zzso Moreover, five zzso clones were shown to possess a continuous zzso suggesting the presence of putative zzso coding zzso
