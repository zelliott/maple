To identify an zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso comprehensive analysis of zzso genes was zzso By zzso zzso zzso positive associations of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso were zzso The DNA typing of zzso gene and class II genes zzso zzso zzso showed positive associations of the disease with zzso zzso zzso * zzso and zzso * zzso confirming in part the zzso zzso zzso of odds ratio for the risk of disease revealed that zzso and zzso were primarily involved in the zzso while the associations with zzso * zzso and zzso * zzso were suggested to reflect a strong linkage zzso of these class II zzso with zzso in the Japanese zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso from patients confirmed that they were B zzso and B zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences of these zzso zzso zzso identified critical zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 63rd and 67th positions, respectively, which may determine the zzso to zzso zzso via binding and presenting a yet unknown zzso zzso
