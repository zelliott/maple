The zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso boundary in Southwest China, separating East Asia's zzso and zzso zzso However, little is known about the importance of this boundary in promoting zzso zzso subdivision and zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence data, we reconstructed the population history of zzso zzso a zzso zzso shrub widely distributed on either side of the zzso Specifically, we aimed at testing two long-standing explanations for possible zzso events across the zzso zzso Late zzso zzso zzso geological zzso of the eastern zzso zzso zzso or zzso a sharp environmental zzso associated with the establishment of different zzso regimes on either side of the zzso during the zzso zzso Our zzso analyses detected a major zzso split in zzso geographically largely consistent with the zzso and dated to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hence zzso the latest phase of eastern zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso patterns with mismatch zzso we found multiple zzso isolation and long-term demographic stability of populations in the west zzso Mountain zzso compared with extensive range expansions in the east, possibly during the last glacial zzso and followed by differentiation into regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although nuclear differentiation was less zzso the geographical pattern of zzso zzso provided some further indication of the zzso eastward expansion, possibly from source populations located just east of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, the present data reject the geological zzso explanation for the zzso and, instead, provide supportive evidence for its role as a zzso driven barrier to zzso plant zzso In addition, our study highlights changing temperatures and vegetation types during the last glacial zzso along with aspects of regional topography, to be important zzso of the glacial eastward expansion of zzso In consequence, our study lends support to a zzso zzso zzso hypothesis for the zzso zzso of Southwest China, which in turn is inconsistent with the traditional view of the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso
