The zzso zzso gene of the green zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso that are transcribed from different zzso Analysis of numerous nuclear and zzso zzso that are deficient in zzso I activity reveals that roughly one-quarter of them are specifically affected in zzso zzso zzso These zzso can be grouped into three zzso classes, based on their inability to perform either one or both zzso zzso The data indicate that the three zzso are transcribed independently as precursors which are normally assembled in trans and that the zzso reactions can occur in either zzso While some zzso zzso could act in zzso the nuclear zzso that fall into several zzso groups probably affect factors specifically required for assembling zzso zzso
