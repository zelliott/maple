zzso genes for 21 zzso proteins zzso have been identified in the zzso DNA of four plants by zzso sequencing and zzso comparison but few of the gene products have been zzso Here we report the zzso and zzso sequencing of seven proteins from the spinach zzso zzso The data show them to be the zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and thus support the view that their genes identified in the zzso DNA represent functional zzso The initiating zzso zzso was not detected in the mature protein in most cases but it was present in zzso indicating that only the zzso group is removed in this zzso This result and the previously reported finding of zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso indicate the existence of multiple zzso processing pathways in the zzso
