This study examines the effect of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on plant growth promoting activities like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso hydrogen cyanide and zzso production by zzso tolerant zzso zzso strain zzso The strain was isolated from mustard zzso The selected zzso were applied two to three times at the recommended zzso zzso zzso strain zzso tolerated a concentration of 1600 zzso each of zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The activities of zzso zzso strain zzso observed under in zzso environment were persistent in the presence of all zzso at lower zzso The plant growth promoting activities zzso decreased regularly, but was not lost completely, as the concentration of each zzso was increased from the recommended to three times of higher zzso Among all zzso zzso generally, showed maximum toxicity to plant growth promoting activities of zzso zzso strain zzso As an example, 40, 80 and 120 zzso of zzso added to liquid culture zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso activity of strain zzso by 93, 95 and zzso respectively over zzso zzso The study revealed that the higher rates of zzso though decreased the plant growth promoting activity but it did not completely inhibit the zzso activities of strain zzso The zzso tolerance together with growth promoting activities observed under zzso stress suggests that zzso zzso strain zzso could be used as bacterial preparation for zzso the growth and yields of crops even in zzso zzso with zzso
