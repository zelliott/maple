A novel zzso strain, zzso isolated from arid soil of zzso Nigeria, and zzso assigned to the zzso zzso was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarity to other type strains of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso major polar lipids zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristic zzso zzso and zzso major fatty acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso analysis, together with zzso and zzso test data, allowed strain zzso to be differentiated from strains of other zzso zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
