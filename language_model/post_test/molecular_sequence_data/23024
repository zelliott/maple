To investigate the antibiotics resistance of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of high-level zzso resistant zzso zzso in clinical specimens for the zzso of effective infection control zzso 

The resistance of 13 zzso agents was determined by zzso zzso or zzso dilution zzso And the zzso and high-level zzso resistant zzso zzso were screened by zzso zzso zzso of zzso was tested by the zzso disc zzso The zzso zzso genes were detected by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was used to analyze the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso 

No zzso resistant to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso did not produce zzso and 68 zzso zzso were screened at the rate of zzso The positive rate of zzso was zzso and 3 zzso had the new zzso gene designated zzso mostly similar to zzso Among 51 zzso zzso from zzso zzso grouped 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into 4 clusters zzso and 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into 8 clusters zzso of which the A cluster is the zzso 

zzso has become the important zzso resistance pathogen causing zzso zzso And the zzso gene was the main zzso zzso gene leading to zzso
