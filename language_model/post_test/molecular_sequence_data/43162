zzso and zzso based zzso maps were constructed that served as the framework physical maps for the zzso cloning of a candidate gene for zzso zzso The zzso map comprises 43 zzso and 86 zzso and spans approximately 8 zzso of DNA between the class I region of the major zzso complex on human zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso with published maps revealed a hole in the zzso and zzso zzso maps that includes the immediate region around the zzso gene zzso zzso 3 zzso of DNA was covered by a bacterial clone zzso that consists of 38 zzso 45 zzso 26 zzso clones and one zzso zzso The bacterial zzso zzso map comprises 153 zzso A zzso block of 8 zzso could be amplified from both human zzso 6 and zzso Further characterization of selected zzso and bacterial clones by radiation hybrid mapping and zzso in zzso zzso respectively, revealed the presence of a zzso DNA segment, more than one bacterial clone length in size, which is duplicated near the zzso zzso and part of which is present in multiple copies on zzso zzso zzso implications of the incomplete public zzso map and of the zzso segment for physical mapping and linkage zzso studies of the zzso candidate region are zzso
