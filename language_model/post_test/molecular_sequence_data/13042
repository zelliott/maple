A novel zzso was zzso from the rat liver zzso to zzso zzso via five column zzso steps zzso I, zzso zzso zzso I, zzso II, and zzso zzso The minimum molecular weight of the zzso zzso was determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso to be approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a native molecular weight of approximately zzso indicating the zzso being present in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed zzso activities, with a pH optimum of zzso toward various zzso and zzso zzso zzso except zzso zzso hormones, as well as zzso and zzso could also be used as zzso The apparent zzso value of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso determined at a constant 14 zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso The intact zzso was found to be zzso when subjected to zzso zzso Three internal partial zzso acid zzso obtained by analyzing its zzso fragments, were found to be distinct from the zzso sequences of other known rat liver zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of a full-length zzso isolated from a rat liver zzso library confirmed the identity of the zzso zzso as a new type of zzso zzso Upon zzso of zzso cells with an expression zzso zzso harboring the full-length zzso a zzso protein displaying zzso and zzso properties similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso
