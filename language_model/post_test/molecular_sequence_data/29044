This study describes a comparison of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The P zzso zzso gene zzso zzso two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso and the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from zzso and zzso showed highest similarities to the corresponding zzso zzso from other zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso genes zzso zzso synthesis to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso 104, zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso as often reported for other zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso zzso either zzso zzso gene also led to the incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso harboring either zzso zzso zzso gene even accumulated a zzso of zzso during zzso with zzso with zzso amounting to more than zzso of the cell dry matter if zzso was zzso Interestingly, zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso gene accumulated higher amounts of zzso when cultivated with fatty acids as sole carbon source, whereas zzso cells harboring zzso zzso accumulated higher amounts when zzso was used as carbon source in storage experiments in either zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso provided evidence that zzso is the major zzso for zzso synthesis in zzso zzso whereas zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso in this zzso to only a minor extent, and then only when cultivated on zzso
