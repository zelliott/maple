zzso in the thin filament is found to act as the putative zzso in cardiac zzso zzso of genetic engineering and zzso in zzso fibers are combined to delineate the molecular principles governing the length induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a better zzso than skeletal zzso and the differences in the two zzso are used as a guide to explore the zzso zzso Studies are described with zzso of both cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso a zzso of cardiac zzso in which zzso to site 1 was restored zzso by John zzso and zzso two zzso of skeletal zzso zzso with site 1 zzso and zzso a zzso in which 41 zzso in the zzso are entirely of the cardiac type and the remaining zzso are all of the skeletal type zzso at Albert zzso The results indicate that zzso property of site 1 is only partly responsible for the zzso of zzso and that the zzso outside zzso are also critical in both the zzso switching mechanism as well as the zzso zzso Further, we have also found that thin filaments are polarized such that zzso may be high at the free end of the filament and decreases towards the zzso reaching its lowest value at the fixed zzso This could serve as the basis for the conversion of zzso length change into a signal that can be zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
