A zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso strain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso following its zzso into the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with zzso near-perfect terminal zzso repeats and has three zzso zzso slightly overlapping potential open reading frames zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso gene in strain zzso generated a duplicate zzso target zzso On the basis of zzso acid sequence zzso the largest ORF, designated zzso is predicted to zzso a composite zzso zzso A zzso domain near the zzso zzso of the zzso protein has zzso zzso acid sequence identity with a corresponding domain for the putative zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso In addition, the sequence for the zzso 600 zzso of the zzso protein is zzso identical to that for the zzso zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins contain the zzso motif characteristic of a recently defined zzso consisting of bacterial zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso The two remaining zzso on zzso zzso proteins of unknown zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso harbors five zzso copies of zzso In comparison, zzso strain zzso harbors an extra zzso copy of zzso which was localized to the zzso zzso zzso Among five zzso distinct zzso strains zzso none was found to contain zzso sequences zzso to zzso
