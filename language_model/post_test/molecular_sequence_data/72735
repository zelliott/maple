The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for the zzso of many zzso and zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso may act through a zzso zzso intermediate in a general base zzso involving a highly zzso zzso zzso such as zzso To investigate this possibility, we used zzso zzso and expression of zzso human zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso comparison with zzso from other species indicated that zzso and zzso are the only zzso basic zzso Either zzso of the presumed zzso zzso zzso or the simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso to Ala produced proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at zzso or zzso with Ala, Met, zzso or zzso exhibited zzso zzso values for zzso zzso zzso but a marked loss of activity and zzso Finally, double replacement of zzso with zzso in zzso altered the zzso for zzso zzso zzso by zzso and for zzso zzso zzso and modified the zzso of zzso Thus, through their positively charged side zzso zzso and zzso seem to contribute to the zzso stability of zzso and zzso rather than acting as general base zzso Our results also support a mechanism in which zzso and zzso are involved in zzso binding and zzso stabilization of zzso
