zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis predicts that zzso zzso contains a putative zzso domain zzso However, the zzso activity in zzso has never been formally zzso In this study, we determined that zzso zzso is a functional zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso with zzso zzso unwinding zzso Further characterization determined the length requirement of the zzso zzso tail on the zzso template and the optimal reaction conditions for the unwinding activity of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso also contains zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso could be significantly zzso by zzso and zzso could partially rescue the zzso activity zzso caused by zzso Our study is the first to identify an zzso zzso zzso and further characterize its zzso unwinding and zzso activities in detail and should foster our understanding of zzso and other zzso
