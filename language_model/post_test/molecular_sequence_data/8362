A zzso zzso zzso zzso was created by ultraviolet light zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso The translated sequence of the zzso DNA revealed a high degree of similarity to a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed a pattern similar to zzso zzso zzso it was first observed within zzso zzso of induction and fully induced by 30 zzso The gene was completely zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso promoter was isolated and used to construct a promoter zzso Two genes were tested in this cassette for zzso regulation by creating zzso promoter zzso with their coding zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso was found to produce filaments only in zzso that were induced by zzso A second zzso zzso zzso which is a commonly used reporter zzso was tested and also found to be zzso When the zzso fusion was used to zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, the level of zzso activity was at least zzso greater for cells grown in zzso than for cells grown in zzso The zzso promoter is the first zzso promoter characterized in zzso zzso and the zzso gene is the first zzso gene shown to be expressed in this zzso zzso
