We have constructed a rotary zzso zzso scanner and zzso array zzso system that is designed to analyze over 1000 DNA sequencing or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso are arranged around the surface of a cylinder and a rotating objective in the middle of the cylinder excites and collects zzso from labeled DNA fragments as they pass the zzso detection zzso The zzso are zzso with a zzso zzso and the samples are zzso injected in parallel from a stainless steel zzso plate at the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the instrument is capable of producing zzso data from all zzso at a scan rate of 4 zzso zzso to a linear scan zzso of 121 zzso zzso sequencing data were obtained using a 128 zzso array mounted in half of the first zzso of the zzso In this initial run, read lengths greater than 500 bases were obtained in over zzso of the zzso
