zzso of the zzso factor zzso at the onset of zzso is one of the earliest molecular indicators of neural fate determination in zzso zzso of bone zzso protein zzso signaling is critical for zzso of zzso expression and fundamental for establishing neural identity in both zzso and zzso The mechanism by which interruption of zzso signaling activates zzso gene expression is not zzso Here, we report identification of a 215 zzso zzso module that is both necessary and sufficient to activate zzso zzso zzso upon interruption of zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that this zzso zzso response module zzso is required for expression in the whole zzso Multiple consensus binding sites for specific zzso factor families within the zzso are required for its activity and some of these regions are zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that interruption of zzso signaling zzso neural determination via a complex zzso involving multiple regulatory factors that cooperate to control zzso zzso
