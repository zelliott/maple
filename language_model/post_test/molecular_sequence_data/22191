zzso zzso are regulators of membrane trafficking that cycle between active zzso and inactive zzso zzso In this study, we report the identification of a new human zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso which we have named zzso zzso protein zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso and a Ras GAP zzso We show that the zzso domain is sufficient for the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso and that zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso We also find that the Ras GAP domain of zzso shows GAP activity for zzso zzso experiments reveal that zzso is associated with plasma membrane and small zzso zzso that also contain zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso affects both fluid phase and zzso zzso This study is the first to show that zzso is a novel regulator of zzso that exhibits zzso activity specific for zzso and GAP activity specific for zzso
