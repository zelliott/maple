zzso is a common zzso in zzso Both bacteria and zzso use zzso for swimming zzso but it has been well documented that structures of the zzso from these two zzso of life are completely different, although they contribute to a similar zzso Interestingly, information available to date has revealed that structurally zzso zzso are more similar to bacterial zzso zzso rather than to bacterial zzso With the increasing zzso sequence information and advancement in genetic tools for zzso identification of the components involved in the assembly of the zzso zzso is zzso A subset of these components shows similarities to components from zzso zzso zzso Whereas the molecular players involved in assembly of the zzso zzso are being identified, the mechanics and dynamics of the assembly of the zzso zzso have yet to be zzso Recent zzso analysis in our laboratory has identified zzso highly charged loop regions within one of the core proteins of the zzso the membrane integral protein zzso and predicted that these are involved in the interaction with the assembly zzso zzso Interestingly, considerable variation was found among the zzso of zzso from the two major zzso of zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso the assembly zzso and creating an interaction map of the molecular players in the zzso zzso will shed light on the details of the assembly and also the evolutionary relationship to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso
