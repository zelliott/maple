zzso finger is a zzso zinc finger motif present in a new family of proteins including zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing zzso finger motifs was identified by the zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso Using this zzso as a probe, we have isolated a novel zzso from rat brain zzso The predicted open reading frame contains a zzso finger domain at its zzso zzso The corresponding transcript was detected predominantly in the brain and therefore was designated brain finger protein zzso An zzso raised against a zzso zzso reveals the presence of the zzso in the zzso Interestingly, the zzso is induced during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso cells into neural zzso These findings suggest the possible involvement of zzso in some aspects of neural cell zzso
