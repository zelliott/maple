zzso zzso and proteins involved in the zzso signaling zzso are distributed in the nucleus as well as at the plasma membrane and in the zzso although their nuclear zzso mechanisms have not been clarified in zzso Generally, proteins that shuttle between the zzso and nucleus contain nuclear zzso signal zzso and nuclear export signal zzso sequences for nuclear import and export, zzso They bind to specific carrier proteins of the zzso family and are transported to and from the zzso Thus there is a steady state shuttling of the cargo molecules to and from the nucleus, and the shift in equilibrium determines their nuclear or zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso C zzso regarded as having zzso or plasma zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus when its zzso sequence is zzso In addition, a cluster of positively charged zzso on the surface of the zzso barrel is important for nuclear zzso In zzso cells, the shuttling equilibrium seems to be shifted to the nuclear export of zzso In this review, recent findings regarding the molecular zzso and mechanisms of the zzso shuttling of zzso will be zzso It is important to know when and how they are zzso A shift in the equilibrium in a certain stage of the cell cycle or by external stimuli is possible and resulting changes in the zzso environments (or zzso may alter proliferation and differentiation zzso zzso support the idea that an increase in the levels of zzso zzso shifts the equilibrium to the nuclear import of zzso A myriad of external stimuli have also been reported to change the nuclear zzso metabolism following accelerated zzso in the nucleus of other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso D in addition to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The consequence of the nuclear zzso of zzso is also zzso
