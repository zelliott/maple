zzso zzso mediates a number of diverse zzso functions in crustaceans by interacting with various zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso cloned from the zzso of the black tiger prawn zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso protein of 591 zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells demonstrated a zzso zzso binding with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso examined and is zzso expressed in the zzso during zzso maturation and spent zzso zzso zzso against the third zzso loop zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso protein was expressed in the zzso of zzso stages 1 and 2 but on the cortical rod and surrounding the zzso membrane of stages 3 and 4, suggesting that zzso zzso plays a critical role in regulating zzso maturation and zzso in zzso zzso
