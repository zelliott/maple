In order to investigate whether several DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso site analogue and zzso activate a zzso gene and to determine the type of zzso induced by the DNA zzso they were introduced into a synthetic zzso gene by DNA cassette zzso zzso The modified genes were zzso into mouse zzso cells and the zzso genes present in transformed cells were zzso zzso and zzso induced a zzso to A, zzso induced a zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso site analogue caused random zzso in the modified and adjacent zzso These results indicated that the synthetic zzso gene is very useful for the detection of zzso caused by a DNA zzso
