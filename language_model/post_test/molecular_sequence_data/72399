Several retinal zzso proteins involved in zzso have also been found in the zzso zzso This study demonstrates that rat and human zzso express protein zzso that are identical to the corresponding rod zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat and human zzso zzso have zzso sequence similarity to the earlier reported sequence of the bovine retinal zzso with complete conservation of the zzso regions containing the position of the zzso domain and sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso also expresses rod zzso and putative blue cone zzso Using zzso rod zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso in zzso in the human zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and a zzso involved in their zzso These findings correlate with an earlier report that zzso rats show zzso light sensitivity, and suggest that a functional zzso system may be present in the adult zzso zzso
