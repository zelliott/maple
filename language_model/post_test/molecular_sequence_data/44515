The zzso zzso has an zzso zzso sequence in the core zzso In order to search for alternative sequences which can support the zzso after the zzso zzso the core region of 10 zzso was zzso and subjected to in zzso selection by repeated cycles of transcription, reverse transcription, and zzso Active sequences were isolated after each zzso by zzso zzso and after nine cycles of selection, two sequences dominated the zzso Both sequences zzso broadly to the consensus core region except that in one sequence a single zzso zzso was observed while in the other two zzso at zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso efficiencies of these zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, as compared to zzso zzso zzso for the consensus zzso Interestingly, the consensus was not found in any of the selected zzso This discrimination against the consensus sequence was attributed to the specificity of the zzso used in the selection zzso
