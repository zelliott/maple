Using zzso zzso analysis method, the spatial structure and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso action were zzso The calculations were based on the zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso barriers and hydrogen zzso The computer data suggest that this zzso can exist only in several low energy zzso zzso The experimental results can be used for the analysis of zzso zzso
