Plant male zzso development is a complex biological process, but the underlying mechanism is not well zzso Here, we characterized a rice zzso zzso zzso male sterile zzso Based on zzso cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a zzso deletion in an zzso zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso causing abnormal zzso and male zzso zzso we named this zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is expressed specifically in zzso zzso from stage 8 zzso II zzso to stage 10 zzso zzso zzso Two genes zzso and zzso involved in the zzso of zzso fatty acids for the establishment of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play a key function in the processes related to zzso zzso or zzso transfer from zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso developed obvious zzso in zzso zzso zzso leading to rapid zzso of young zzso The results suggest that zzso plays a critical role in zzso formation and zzso development, similar to the zzso gene of zzso in zzso This work is helpful to understand the regulatory network in rice zzso zzso
