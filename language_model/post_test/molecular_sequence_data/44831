A reductive zzso zzso is the central zzso for the zzso zzso of aromatic pollutants and zzso zzso zzso ring reduction requires a large input of energy and this zzso capability has, so far, been reported only in zzso To determine the molecular basis for this environmentally important process, we cloned and analyzed genes required for the zzso degradation of zzso and related compounds from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A cluster of 24 genes was identified that includes twelve genes likely to be involved in zzso zzso degradation and additional genes that convert the related compounds zzso and zzso to zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso able to overcome the resonance stability of the aromatic ring, were identified by directed zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso the zzso activity of the protein expressed in zzso zzso zzso data and DNA sequence analyses indicate that the zzso zzso consists of unusual zzso for ring reduction and zzso zzso among zzso zzso to those catalyzing fatty acid zzso The cloned genes should be useful as zzso to identify zzso degradation genes from other metabolically distinct groups of zzso bacteria, such as zzso bacteria and zzso zzso
