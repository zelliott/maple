This study aimed to define the molecular basis of zzso resistance in Malawian zzso under the dual selective pressure of widespread zzso and zzso zzso 

We measured the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and translated zzso acid sequences for 143 zzso isolated from carriage and invasive disease in Malawi zzso 

zzso were highly resistant to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a 3 or 6 zzso zzso in the zzso site of zzso The zzso zzso fell into three zzso groups based on zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso substitution together with a zzso 92 substitution zzso and those with a novel zzso resistance zzso zzso The zzso sequence divergence and zzso of zzso and zzso remained stable from 2004 zzso 

zzso zzso exhibit almost universal zzso resistance in zzso and in zzso that we believe is driven by extensive zzso and zzso zzso More than one-third of zzso employ a novel mechanism of zzso zzso Resistance has now reached a point of stabilizing zzso The use of zzso to prevent zzso infection in zzso patients in sub-Saharan Africa should be zzso
