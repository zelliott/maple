The zzso domain, missing in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso simplified model of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso component zzso has now been expressed zzso This zzso zzso acid protein was named zzso with respect to its native molecular weight and represents the zzso domain of zzso This simplified biological object has kept the main characteristics of its counterpart in the native zzso It could incorporate zzso exclusively and stabilize a neutral zzso zzso zzso Both the radical and the fully reduced forms of zzso were able to transfer their electrons to zzso or zzso c zzso zzso was able to form a highly stable complex with zzso the zzso component of the zzso zzso containing an zzso cluster coupled to a zzso In agreement with the zzso zzso cycle of zzso only the fully reduced form of zzso could transfer one electron to zzso the transferred electron being localized exclusively on the zzso As isolated zzso has kept the main characteristics of the zzso domain of the native zzso a structural analysis by zzso was performed in order to complete the partial structure obtained zzso zzso modeling was performed using sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso These sequences were anchored using common secondary structural elements identified from zzso zzso data measured on the protein zzso The resulting structural model was zzso and subsequently refined using residual zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso measured in an zzso zzso The overall fold of zzso is very similar to that of bacterial zzso and of the zzso domain in zzso or zzso
