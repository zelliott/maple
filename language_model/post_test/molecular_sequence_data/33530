During last years the significant progress was achieved in studying of zzso systems of zzso Using these systems, zzso realize regulation of wide spectrum of zzso and zzso processes in plant zzso The review considers some types of plant zzso systems that differ in zzso organization and molecular mechanisms of signal zzso to the zzso proteins responsible for gene zzso Among them there activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling systems involving zzso protein zzso as a zzso and activated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso zzso Recently, signaling systems involving receptors of the zzso type and coupled with them zzso zzso which are widely presented in the animals and zzso were found in zzso zzso were drawn similarity of zzso and zzso signaling systems in plants and zzso and about unique nature of plant signaling systems involving zzso
