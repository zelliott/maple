zzso is a member of the family of tissue zzso of zzso involved in regulating the activity of zzso zzso degrading zzso The zzso zzso was obtained by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the corresponding zzso from human zzso Cloning and expression of the zzso zzso were performed in zzso zzso In the host zzso system zzso zzso is stored zzso in its zzso zzso form in inclusion zzso We report a new method for the zzso and zzso of zzso from zzso coli inclusion bodies to an active inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso presumably containing the correct assignment of the six zzso zzso A zzso with the zzso bound zzso zzso domain of the zzso as the affinity zzso provided an effective means for the separation of correctly zzso active zzso from inactive forms with mismatched zzso zzso and zzso the two most extensively examined members of the family of tissue zzso of zzso are known to form a complex with the activated forms of most zzso zzso and the zzso forms of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report on the complex formation of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The Ki values for the different zzso were determined in a kinetic zzso using a zzso zzso zzso In this zzso zzso had a more effective zzso capability against the zzso zzso domain of the zzso than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
