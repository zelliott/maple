zzso crops related to the model plant zzso zzso can adapt their root architecture to environmental conditions, both by branching and by establishing a zzso with zzso bacteria to form zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso stress affecting plant yield and root zzso Previous zzso analyses identified several zzso factors linked to the zzso response to salt stress in roots, including zzso zzso zzso zzso of one of these zzso factors, zzso induced formation of a shorter and zzso root system, whereas zzso zzso zzso promoted lateral root zzso The altered root system of zzso plants was able to maintain its growth under high zzso and roots in which zzso was zzso showed improved growth under salt zzso zzso expression of salt stress markers was decreased or induced in zzso zzso or zzso roots, respectively, suggesting a repressive function for this zzso factor in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in central symbiotic zzso zzso was induced by nitrate treatment, and zzso affected by salt in roots and zzso similarly to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated zzso in the zzso zone, and were prematurely zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor, which is zzso affected by environmental cues in root and zzso zzso in several pathways controlling adaptation of the zzso root system to the zzso
