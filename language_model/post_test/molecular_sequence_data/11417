zzso antagonism of zzso including the simple zzso zzso is linked to the zzso zzso In order to gain further information on the zzso preferences of the zzso we have undertaken a structural study of a zzso zzso the zzso of zzso A zzso study of zzso that is almost devoid of zzso activity, can also be useful to discriminate between the role of the two aromatic rings and of the basic nitrogen in determining zzso The structure of zzso has been solved in a zzso solution at zzso K by zzso zzso and in the solid state by X-ray zzso zzso The two zzso are almost zzso with an arrangement of the aromatic rings rather different from that of the putative zzso zzso of the parent linear zzso This difference points to the importance of zzso effects and is in agreement with the hypothesis that the positive center may be not essential for zzso
