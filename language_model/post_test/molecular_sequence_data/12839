Increased expression of DNA zzso II alpha has been associated with resistance to certain zzso zzso agents, but no zzso relationship or mechanism has been zzso To investigate this zzso we developed a model of zzso II zzso by zzso a full-length Chinese zzso zzso zzso II alpha into zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso II zzso cell lines demonstrated continued zzso II alpha zzso and protein zzso which were zzso in zzso lines, in stationary phase zzso The zzso II zzso were approximately zzso resistant to the zzso agents zzso and zzso Upon release from zzso the zzso II zzso demonstrated more rapid zzso incorporation and shorter zzso times than control zzso zzso zzso II and nuclear extracts with zzso zzso activity bound to zzso DNA with significantly greater affinity than to zzso DNA in a zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that expression of zzso II alpha may have a role in cellular resistance to zzso zzso zzso The mechanism for this may involve increased binding of zzso II alpha to zzso zzso zzso
