zzso is an zzso protein zzso responsible for linking growth factor receptors with zzso signaling zzso To study the role of zzso in cell growth, we have generated a new zzso cell line zzso based on zzso technology, as zzso zzso in zzso zzso genes are lethal in early zzso This novel cell line continuously expresses a short hairpin zzso that targets zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had the zzso integrated into the zzso DNA and carried on zzso of normal levels of zzso zzso zzso expression reduced, but did not zzso zzso cell growth zzso This could be reversed by either the addition of zzso to the cell cultures or by rescuing with an zzso construct zzso zzso to the zzso zzso but not with an zzso zzso zzso Thus, a viable zzso and rescue protocol has demonstrated that zzso is crucial for cell zzso
