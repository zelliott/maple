We cloned the putative zzso zzso genes zzso zzso for zzso A zzso from zzso zzso using an zzso probe designed on the basis of zzso zzso acid sequences of other zzso zzso zzso By DNA sequencing of an zzso zzso zzso that zzso with the zzso probe, 11 open reading frames zzso were zzso All of the zzso except for zzso were predicted to be translated in the same zzso Each of the deduced zzso has significant sequence similarity to the protein responsible for zzso zzso or spore zzso In particular, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso identical with genes coding for zzso for zzso zzso zzso DNA regions similar in sequence to zzso genes were found with zzso Southern zzso in all of the zzso producers zzso but were not found in zzso zzso suggesting that the genes cloned in this study zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso
