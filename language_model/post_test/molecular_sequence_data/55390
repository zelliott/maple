A zzso alkaline zzso producing zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected from the zzso zzso of Kashmir, India and identified as zzso zzso on the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso gene zzso The strain could grow well within a temperature range of zzso however, showed optimum growth at zzso The strain was found to zzso zzso when it was grown in media containing zzso as carbon source zzso U zzso The maximum specific zzso activity zzso U zzso was obtained using zzso oil as nitrogen source, however, the zzso nitrogen sources zzso ammonium zzso and ammonium zzso showed the lowest production of zzso zzso and zzso U zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso folds and the molecular weight of the partially zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso activity increased as the increase in zzso concentration while as the optimum zzso activity was found when zzso zzso zzso was used as zzso The zzso was highly active over a wide range of pH from zzso to zzso showing optimum activity at pH zzso The optimum temperature for the zzso was zzso zzso activity reduced gradually with higher temperatures with a decrease of zzso at zzso The zzso zzso was checked for the removal of protein containing tea zzso using a silk cloth within a temperature range of zzso The best washing efficiency results obtained at low temperatures indicate that the zzso may be used for cold washing purposes of delicate zzso that otherwise are vulnerable to high zzso
