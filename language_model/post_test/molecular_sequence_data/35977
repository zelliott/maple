We have determined the zzso acid sequence of the alpha chain of a zzso collagen from the body wall of the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso collagen chain consists of a zzso zzso domain and short remnants of zzso and zzso The zzso sequence showed one zzso of the collagen zzso zzso repeat structure due to a zzso zzso This zzso is correlated to a prominent zzso in the zzso observed by electron zzso No strong sequence similarity was found with the zzso zzso collagen types zzso V and zzso except for the zzso zzso zzso However, one of the two consensus zzso sequences was well zzso The zzso collagen shared with the zzso zzso many zzso zzso About 50% of the Pro and zzso zzso are found in the zzso position and were extensively zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso A few zzso zzso in zzso position were partially zzso to either zzso or zzso Despite the low sequence zzso zzso collagen was a potent zzso zzso for two human cell zzso Cell zzso could be inhibited by zzso against the zzso beta 1 zzso but not by zzso zzso This biological activity is apparently zzso in zzso zzso of zzso related species but does not require the two zzso sequences present in zzso zzso
