zzso calculations predict that, if zzso and zzso are each replaced by a zzso zzso it should be possible to form a third zzso bond in zzso zzso zzso zzso between these zzso with only minimal zzso changes at the zzso zzso The gene zzso such a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by the cassette zzso method using a chemically zzso zzso In order to reduce the toxic effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on an zzso coli host, we arranged for the protein to be zzso into the zzso space by using a zzso that harbors a gene for an alkaline zzso signal zzso under the control of the zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso toward zzso was approximately the same as that of zzso zzso at 37 degrees C zzso zzso Moreover, at 55 degrees C, zzso zzso retained nearly zzso of its activity while the activity of the zzso zzso was reduced to less than zzso zzso zzso was also more resistant to zzso by zzso than the zzso zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and almost totally zzso by boiling at 100 degrees C for 15 zzso
