The regulation of major zzso complex class II gene expression is directly involved in the control of normal and abnormal immune zzso In humans, zzso zzso and zzso class II zzso are zzso by a family of zzso and zzso genes clustered in the major zzso zzso Their expression is zzso controlled and normally restricted to certain cell zzso This control is zzso by zzso sequences in class II promoters and by zzso regulatory zzso Several nuclear proteins bind to class II promoter zzso In a form of zzso zzso characterized by a zzso in a zzso regulatory factor controlling class II gene transcription, we have observed that one of these nuclear factors zzso does not bind to its target sequence (the class II X zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated by screening a zzso expression library with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein has the binding specificity of zzso including a characteristic zzso of affinity for the X boxes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in the regulatory zzso indicating a zzso in the synthesis of a functional form of the zzso zzso
