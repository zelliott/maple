zzso zzso regulate gene expression by zzso gene zzso at zzso and zzso levels in higher zzso zzso and related target genes have been widely studied in model plants such as zzso and zzso however, the number of identified zzso in soybean zzso zzso is zzso and global identification of the related zzso targets has not been reported in previous zzso 

In our study, a small zzso library and a zzso library were constructed from developing soybean seeds for deep zzso We identified 26 new zzso in soybean by zzso analysis and further confirmed their expression by zzso zzso The zzso star sequences of 38 known zzso and 8 new zzso were also discovered, providing additional evidence for the existence of zzso Through zzso sequencing, 145 and 25 genes were identified as targets of zzso zzso and new zzso zzso GO analysis indicated that many of the identified zzso targets may function in soybean seed zzso Additionally, a soybean zzso of zzso zzso of gene zzso 3 zzso was detected as a target of the newly identified zzso zzso suggesting the presence of feedback control of zzso zzso 

We have identified large numbers of zzso and their related target genes through deep sequencing of a small zzso library and a zzso zzso Our study provides more information about the regulatory network of zzso in soybean and advances our understanding of zzso functions during seed zzso
