One novel zzso factor was isolated and zzso from the zzso of Taiwan zzso zzso zzso using two consecutive zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso Further characterization of the zzso protein indicated that it lacks the zzso activity toward zzso zzso suggesting that this protein factor does not belong to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso commonly found in the crude zzso of various zzso zzso The zzso protein exists as a native zzso protein of 26 zzso consisting of two closely similar zzso of 16 and 13 zzso held together by zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that both chains are zzso to each other at the zzso zzso and also similar to the factors zzso protein isolated from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso This study points to the existence of one new zzso zzso factor without zzso activity from Taiwan zzso which, in contrast to zzso promotes zzso zzso even in the absence of von zzso zzso Unlike factors zzso zzso it did not show affinity to zzso factors IX and X in the presence of zzso zzso It also shows no zzso on zzso in contrast with zzso a zzso inhibitor isolated from zzso zzso zzso We have therefore named this novel zzso factor zzso to distinguish it from some structurally related zzso factors present in various zzso and zzso zzso
