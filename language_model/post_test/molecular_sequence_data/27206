zzso zzso zzso is a newly described member of the zzso zzso that is directly implicated in the zzso of zzso diseases, including inflammatory zzso disease, zzso and zzso zzso We report the crystal structure of the human zzso zzso domain at a resolution of zzso A, which reveals a zzso fold typical of the zzso zzso This structural information, in combination with complementary zzso and zzso zzso provides insights into the binding interface and the specificity of the interactions between zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso These studies suggest that the mode of interaction between zzso and zzso differs from other characterized zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have generated functional zzso zzso with altered zzso bonding capability that exhibit enhanced solution properties, which will facilitate the production of materials for future zzso and whole animal zzso In zzso these studies provide insights into the structure and function of zzso and provide the basis for the rational manipulation of its interactions with zzso zzso
