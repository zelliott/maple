The coding sequences of four overlapping zzso starting at four different zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the stop zzso of the cap gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso were inserted under the control of the zzso promoter of zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso (four zzso zzso (three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (one zzso zzso zzso In all cases, infection of zzso zzso cells zzso by each of the four zzso viruses resulted in the production of zzso particles zzso 22-25 zzso in zzso The zzso produced by the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were abundant and contained three, two and one zzso zzso zzso the shortest zzso thus appears to be sufficient for assembly of zzso zzso similar to those formed with two to four zzso The ratio of zzso did not appear to be critical for assembly of the zzso The zzso starting at the first zzso immediately downstream from the zzso promoter was always the most abundantly expressed in infected cells, regardless of the zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso were unstable and produced less than zzso of the zzso produced by the zzso All VP transcripts started at the zzso late motif of the zzso promoter and had a zzso tail 14 zzso downstream of a zzso addition signal located 98 zzso downstream of the common stop zzso No significant zzso initiation inside the cap sequence of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso
