zzso are zzso bacteria characterized by a temporally regulated zzso zzso In the early stage of the cycle, metabolically zzso elementary bodies reorganize to dividing zzso bodies, a process about which little is zzso The purpose of this investigation was to identify and clone zzso genes that are expressed zzso during the early stage of the zzso cycle of zzso zzso zzso Several potential early genes were cloned with highly zzso zzso zzso zzso to screen a zzso zzso One clone appeared to zzso a gene that was particularly well expressed at 1 h zzso In further zzso we found that it encodes two complete open reading frames and one partial open reading frame of 370 zzso The partial open reading frame, designated zzso is very similar to bacterial zzso zzso and was demonstrated to be transcribed in zzso at 24 h zzso by primer extension zzso A zzso open reading frame zzso of 117 zzso was found upstream and divergent from zzso The zzso lacks zzso to known zzso and we were unable to demonstrate that it is transcribed in zzso The third open reading frame, of 182 zzso was found to be zzso with and partially overlap the zzso It was confirmed to be zzso expressed within the first zzso h of infection by Northern zzso zzso analysis and was designated the early upstream open reading frame zzso Like the zzso the zzso is not zzso to known zzso A major potential zzso start site of the zzso was identified by primer extension zzso However, the sequence upstream of the site does not closely resemble the consensus recognition sequences of bacterial zzso factors even though it is AT zzso The zzso is the first zzso gene specific to the early stage to be cloned and zzso
