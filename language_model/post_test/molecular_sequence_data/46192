zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso They are closely related zzso with similarly sized zzso zzso diagnostic techniques, especially those based on zzso chain reaction zzso can be successfully applied for the differentiation of zzso zzso In this paper, we describe a rapid and simple method for the identification of zzso zzso zzso among other members of the zzso zzso using a zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso available in molecular zzso DNA of zzso of zzso zzso yielded a specific zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso No product was yielded when the zzso were used for the amplification of DNA extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus allowing the differentiation of zzso zzso among other members of the zzso zzso The zzso was capable of detecting zzso zzso genetic sequences from suspensions with at least 10 zzso In conclusion, the zzso proved to be a reliable method to be used in the identification of zzso zzso zzso from feces of zzso
