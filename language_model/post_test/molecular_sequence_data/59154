Type zzso collagen is present in small amounts in cartilage, together with small amounts of type IX and type V zzso and large amounts of type II zzso Here, zzso based on the zzso sequences of partial human zzso and mouse zzso zzso that were analyzed by other investigators were used to isolate a zzso for the mouse zzso zzso zzso clones for the mouse zzso gene were isolated, and zzso zzso of the zzso sequences were zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences identified three zzso in the mouse gene that were recently shown to undergo alternative zzso zzso and Kimura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995; zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, analysis of the zzso clones revealed that the zzso end of the mouse zzso gene was located zzso with the mouse zzso X zzso beta zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that some transcripts from the zzso X zzso beta gene extend into the zzso zzso zzso there may be coordinate expression of the two zzso
