We have studied the zzso regulatory mechanism of the human zzso group zzso zzso and identified DNA zzso and zzso protein that control the expression of these genes which are important in blood zzso and organ zzso We introduced the zzso sequence of zzso genes into the zzso reporter zzso and characterized the promoter activity of deletion zzso using transient zzso zzso with gastric cancer cell line zzso III zzso The sequence just upstream of the zzso start site zzso zzso and an zzso element, which is located further upstream (between zzso and zzso base pairs zzso from the zzso initiation zzso and contains 4 tandem copies of a zzso repeat unit, were shown in gastric cancer cells to be responsible for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso DNA binding studies have demonstrated that a zzso factor, zzso bound to the zzso repeat unit in the zzso zzso importance of these zzso sites in zzso activity was confirmed by zzso experiments using reporter plasmids with zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso regulation of the human zzso genes is dependent upon binding of zzso to the zzso
