To further our understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso a zzso two hybrid screen was used to identify proteins binding to the zzso zzso zzso Two partial zzso zzso novel zzso zzso proteins were cloned and designated zzso and zzso Both have zzso to zzso a previously reported zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that She is expressed in heart, zzso brain, and skeletal muscle, while expression of zzso is restricted to the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the full length mouse zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso region, and a zzso zzso zzso A zzso expressed zzso domain bound multiple zzso proteins with relative molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso 100, 90, 78, 72 and 32 zzso from zzso cell zzso zzso contains five zzso zzso a zzso sequence preferred by zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a zzso zzso of zzso and may function as an adapter protein in the central nervous zzso
