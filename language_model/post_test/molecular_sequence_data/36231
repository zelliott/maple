In order to evaluate the role of zzso in the determination of the zzso we zzso the zzso domain of the zzso gene in 8 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 3 patients with related disorders, and compared our data with those obtained in 6 other similar zzso In our study, a zzso zzso of zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction and the internal zzso motif was zzso zzso sequences did not differ from those in normal males in any of our zzso Overall, 5 de zzso zzso have been identified among 56 patients with sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 de zzso zzso have been identified among 18 patients with related conditions zzso The unexpectedly low frequency of zzso within the zzso zzso domain in these patients could be caused by zzso zzso zzso outside the zzso domain in regions that control zzso during development zzso zzso zzso or to downstream zzso in other zzso genes that need not map to the zzso
