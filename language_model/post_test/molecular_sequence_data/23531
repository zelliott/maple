zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was generally thought to be essential for initiation of protein synthesis in all zzso based on studies conducted primarily in zzso zzso However, this view of zzso protein initiation has changed because some bacteria have been demonstrated to have the capacity to initiate protein synthesis with the zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso initiation factor zzso is required for zzso protein initiation in zzso zzso the first zzso shown to have the ability to initiate protein synthesis with both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso coli zzso which zzso exclusively in zzso protein initiation in zzso coli, was unable to facilitate zzso of zzso in initiation in zzso zzso However, the zzso coli zzso was made to function in zzso protein initiation in zzso zzso by decreasing the positive charge potential of the zzso that binds the zzso end of the zzso acid attached to the zzso zzso increasing the positive charge potential of this zzso in the zzso zzso zzso prevented the protein from participating in zzso protein zzso Thus, this is the first demonstration of a zzso zzso with an inherent capacity to facilitate zzso of zzso in protein zzso zzso the dogma that zzso zzso can only allow the use of zzso in protein zzso zzso these findings give important clues to the basis for discriminating the zzso zzso by zzso and for the evolution of alternative mechanisms for zzso
