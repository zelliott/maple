The zzso DNA zzso from 13 stocks of zzso designated as zzso zzso were zzso with various restriction zzso We also examined the distribution of restriction site zzso in the nuclear DNA of 9 of these stocks, using 7 different variable surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso fragments of some of these strains were cloned into zzso or zzso 18 zzso and zzso The restriction and sequence mapping showed that most of zzso zzso zzso belonged to the A1 and zzso types of zzso and to two new closely related types A3 and zzso A notable exception was zzso zzso derived from a Sudanese stock which was found to display a characteristic zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso are not only homogeneous in sequence but also the region similar to the zzso region in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is flanked on its zzso end by a zzso repeat of part of the zzso zzso The highly zzso sequence zzso which appears to zzso to the initiation of synthesis of one of the Okazaki fragments contains an additional G and is located as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso about 73 zzso zzso from the zzso The nuclear DNA analysis confirms the zzso study in that all the zzso zzso stocks are members of a very homogeneous group in terms of sequence zzso Moreover, our analysis also confirms that zzso zzso is more closely related to the West African zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than to other African zzso
