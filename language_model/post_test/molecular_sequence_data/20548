Single zzso zzso zzso are the most abundant form of genetic variation and are the basis for most molecular zzso Before these zzso can be used for direct zzso zzso detection or in a derived zzso zzso they need to be zzso For those regions or species where no validated zzso are available in the public databases, a good alternative is to mine them from DNA zzso The alignment of multiple sequence fragments originating from different zzso representing the same region on the zzso will allow for the discovery of sequence zzso The corresponding zzso zzso are likely to be zzso or zzso A large amount of sequence data to be zzso is present in the public databases (both expressed sequence tags and zzso zzso and is free to use without having to do large-scale sequencing zzso However, with the appearance of the next-generation sequencing machines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing is becoming widely zzso This will allow for the sequencing of zzso zzso on specific target areas and zzso zzso zzso In this paper we discuss the zzso tools required to analyze DNA sequence data for zzso zzso A general approach for the consecutive steps in the mining process is described and commonly used zzso discovery pipelines are zzso
