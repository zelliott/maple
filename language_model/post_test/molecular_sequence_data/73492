We report the isolation of three full-length zzso corresponding to the zzso of closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso expressed in normal cells and zzso zzso The zzso zzso result from A zzso G and C zzso T transitions at zzso zzso and zzso zzso The transitions changed zzso 104 from zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and changed zzso 113 from zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso changes are in the zzso active site of the zzso zzso zzso Computer modeling of the deduced crystal structures of the zzso peptides showed significant zzso in the zzso distances of critical zzso active site zzso acids as a consequence of the zzso acid zzso The zzso proteins expressed in zzso coli and zzso by zzso affinity zzso showed a zzso lower zzso zzso and a zzso higher zzso for the zzso zzso protein than the proteins zzso by zzso and zzso Analysis of 75 cases showed the relative frequency of zzso to be zzso higher in zzso zzso than in normal zzso These data provide conclusive molecular evidence of zzso of the human zzso zzso gene zzso resulting in active, functionally different zzso zzso zzso and should facilitate studies of the role of this gene in zzso zzso cancer, and other human zzso
