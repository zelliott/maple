Since the discovery of insulin and its zzso the downstream elements responsible for the zzso insulin signal have been difficult to zzso The recently discovered insulin zzso zzso zzso provides an innovative and simple way to think about this problem: zzso may mediate the control of various cellular processes by zzso zzso of zzso enhances zzso DNA synthesis in Chinese zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso protein zzso the maturation of zzso zzso We suspect that insulin signals are enabled when the activated insulin zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso in zzso These zzso sites associate with high affinity to cellular proteins that contain zzso zzso zzso zzso This association is specific and depends on the zzso acid sequence surrounding the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso A growing number of zzso zzso proteins have been identified, and we suspect that zzso has the potential to simultaneously regulate many of zzso We have only begun to identify the specific proteins that associate with zzso zzso One of them, the zzso zzso is activated when the zzso zzso in its zzso regulatory zzso bind to zzso zzso zzso also interacts with other proteins such as zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a protein that is implicated in zzso zzso The interaction between zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso proteins may ultimately explain the zzso effects of zzso
