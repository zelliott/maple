Active gamma zzso of skeletal muscle zzso zzso has been obtained by expression of the rat zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The protein exhibited the expected pH zzso activity ratio of zzso and its activity was insensitive to zzso addition, indicating that it was free gamma zzso and not a gamma zzso zzso It was zzso approximately zzso by zzso addition, demonstrating that it had retained zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso we have examined the role of six of the zzso acids that constitute the consensus zzso binding site of the protein zzso which in the gamma zzso is represented by the sequence zzso Changes were evaluated by the kinetic determination of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the maximum zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each exhibited an essentially identical zzso constant for gamma zzso zzso indicating that these zzso had not caused a global zzso in the protein structure but were limited to changes in the zzso binding site zzso zzso of either zzso (by zzso or zzso (by zzso two of the most zzso zzso in all protein zzso resulted in zzso with marginally zzso zzso In noted contrast, the zzso zzso which zzso the first zzso of the consensus zzso trio zzso and which is also very highly zzso retained at least zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso which restored a zzso to a position characteristic for most protein zzso had little overall effect upon the maximum rate of zzso Restoration of zzso to the more typical zzso which is present in most protein zzso had minimal effect on zzso These data provide the first direct evaluation of the roles that different zzso play within this consensus zzso zzso motif of the protein zzso which up to now have only been zzso to be of importance because of their zzso Two unexpected findings are that for one zzso that is very zzso zzso there is some flexibility of substitution not apparent from the evolutionary conservation and that a second quite zzso zzso in protein zzso zzso to zzso at position 31) does not produce a protein zzso for zzso zzso
