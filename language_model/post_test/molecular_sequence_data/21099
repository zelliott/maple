zzso structure and function are regulated by numerous proteins through specific binding to zzso The structural basis of many of these interactions is unknown, as in the case of the high mobility group zzso zzso protein family that regulates various zzso functions, including zzso Here, we report the architecture of the zzso complex determined by a combination of zzso relaxation zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso binds to both the zzso patch in the zzso zzso and to zzso DNA near the zzso point, zzso the zzso core and the zzso These results provide insight into how zzso regulate zzso structure through interfering with the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso as well as a structural basis of how zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso during zzso zzso our approach is generally zzso to the study of zzso interactions in zzso
