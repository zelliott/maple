We have studied the gene expression of ten growth factors in zzso zzso zzso cells from patients with lung zzso by using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso beta zzso was detected in almost all of the samples, and zzso beta and zzso zzso were detected in zzso The zzso zzso from the patients was found to have zzso activity for lung zzso Moreover, human zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso were found to promote the proliferation of lung zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso gene expression in zzso cells might be involved in the development of lung zzso
