Seven zzso zzso in six zzso of the zzso b zzso of zzso zzso selected for resistance to the zzso site zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso 8, zzso have been characterized by using optical and zzso zzso and zzso kinetic zzso The strains were compared with zzso strain zzso and with the zzso strain zzso zzso which is dysfunctional in its zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van den zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selected for zzso resistance induced a weakening in the binding of the inhibitor without discernible loss of zzso binding affinity to the zzso site or kinetic impairment to zzso zzso selected for zzso or zzso resistance, inducing weakening of inhibitor zzso all displayed impaired rates of zzso site zzso The most severe cases zzso zzso displayed loss of affinity for zzso and evidence suggests that parallel loss of affinity for the zzso zzso was incurred in these zzso The results provide a view of the nature of the interaction of Q and zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso Consideration of the zzso zzso and their structural positions along with comparisons with the zzso and QB sites of the zzso reaction center suggests a model for the structure of the zzso zzso
