zzso genes zzso zzso c zzso zzso were cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso respectively, while the zzso product is a zzso zzso zzso These zzso acid sequences are similar to those of zzso and zzso the members of high zzso content zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a sole zzso zzso in these organisms suggests the direct zzso transfer to zzso c zzso The zzso half of the zzso zzso proteins of these bacteria has a unique structure with three zzso zzso while the zzso half sequence is zzso A zzso tree using the latter region showed that high zzso zzso form a clear zzso with zzso but not with low zzso zzso
