We have developed a specific and efficient method for complete removal of zzso zzso tags zzso from the zzso of target zzso The method is based on the use of the zzso zzso zzso I zzso either alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In both cases, the zzso is zzso off by zzso which zzso a zzso zzso of a wide range of zzso from the zzso of a zzso zzso Some zzso however, are resistant to zzso zzso and a number of mature proteins have zzso zzso which protects them against zzso For such zzso zzso composed of an even number of zzso can be zzso off by treatment with zzso zzso When the target protein is unprotected against zzso a blocking group is generated zzso from a zzso zzso inserted between the zzso and the target zzso A protein with a zzso extension is incubated with both zzso and zzso As above, the zzso sequence is zzso off by zzso but when the zzso zzso appears in the zzso it is immediately converted into a zzso zzso by an excess of zzso and further zzso zzso is zzso The desired sequence is finally obtained by zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso All the zzso employed can bind to immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso zzso and in this paper we demonstrate a simple and highly effective process combining zzso zzso of zzso zzso our zzso method for specific zzso of zzso and use of zzso zzso for removing processing zzso Typical zzso were zzso for the zzso processing and zzso zzso The integrated process holds promises for use in large-scale production of pharmaceutical proteins because of a simple overall design, use of robust and inexpensive zzso and use of zzso of either zzso or plant zzso
