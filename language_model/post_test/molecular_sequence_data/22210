zzso virus zzso zzso 1 zzso has been shown to be more effective than the well-studied zzso zzso 2 zzso in muscle gene zzso Replacement of zzso acids 350 to 430 of zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso acids from zzso of zzso resulted in a hybrid zzso termed zzso which behaved similarly to zzso in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso particles per mouse of hybrid zzso carrying a human zzso zzso in zzso knockout mice resulted in an average level of human zzso in the plasma of 450 zzso zzso to zzso higher than in mice injected with an zzso zzso carrying the same zzso and zzso of the zzso levels in animals treated with the same dose of zzso DNA analysis of injected muscle showed a zzso higher copy number after gene delivery by the hybrid zzso compared with zzso A comparison of total DNA versus DNA from intact virus particles suggests a higher stability of hybrid virus zzso These results suggest that changes in the zzso zzso have an effect on zzso zzso interaction, and also influence trafficking and processing of the virus particle in the zzso This zzso zzso retains the zzso sites of zzso and, therefore, can be zzso by passage through a zzso column with the same efficiency as zzso When tested in zzso either in zzso knockout mice or in a zzso mouse model, the zzso hybrid zzso showed zzso higher activity than similarly zzso zzso This demonstrates the utility of this hybrid zzso in the performance of large-scale zzso column zzso to generate a zzso with a high expression profile for zzso gene zzso zzso of clinical studies with this hybrid zzso may be facilitated because it differs from zzso by only nine zzso zzso
