The study of zzso virus structure by zzso zzso requires accurate band zzso In previous work, zzso and zzso isotope zzso were implemented to zzso definitive assignments for zzso bands arising from zzso modes of the zzso coat protein main chain and aromatic side chains in the class I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Thomas, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Thomas, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 37, zzso Here, we extend the previous methods and expand the assignment scheme to identify zzso markers of zzso side chains of the coat protein in the native zzso zzso This has been accomplished by zzso analysis of 11 different zzso zzso selectively incorporating zzso at specific sites in either zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the coat zzso zzso markers are also identified for the corresponding zzso side zzso In combination with previous assignments, the results provide a comprehensive understanding of coat protein contributions to the zzso signature of the zzso zzso and validate zzso markers assigned to the packaged zzso DNA zzso The findings described here show that zzso side chains contribute zzso to the zzso zzso signature, that marker bands for specific zzso differ in general from those observed in corresponding zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso and zzso of many zzso markers are sensitive to secondary and zzso zzso zzso markers within the zzso zzso zzso also interfere seriously with the diagnostic zzso zzso III band that is normally exploited in secondary structure zzso zzso of these findings for the assessment of protein zzso by zzso zzso are zzso
