The zzso of six zzso zzso genes are known to be zzso to zzso We report here that a similarly oriented gene is located zzso zzso upstream of zzso We present evidence that the genes in these clusters are zzso and downstream zzso are formed by zzso at the zzso site and zzso From one zzso cluster we isolated zzso clones representing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the free 3' end created by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso can be processed by zzso Several experiments indicate that zzso zzso is a consequence of a zzso downstream location in an zzso In particular, when an zzso gene was moved to a downstream location, its zzso was zzso largely to zzso The possible regulatory significance of zzso of zzso zzso genes is zzso
