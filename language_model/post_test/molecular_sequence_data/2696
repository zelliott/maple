We have isolated and zzso two overlapping zzso zzso clones carrying sequences of the gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The two clones cover around 23 zzso of the zzso protein gene including its 3' zzso Southern zzso zzso revealed the existence of a single copy of the zzso protein gene in the mouse zzso The zzso portion of the zzso protein gene is divided into eight zzso While most of the zzso are quite small and are widely scattered throughout the DNA zzso the last one consists of about 830 zzso and encodes 226 zzso acids of the zzso zzso including the zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the region of the zzso protein zzso by the zzso clones reveals high conservation of structure when it is compared with the sequence of the human zzso zzso Interestingly, all zzso additions and zzso are zzso exclusively within the zzso of the zzso accounting for a zzso polarity with respect to protein zzso Moreover, the analysis of the zzso sequences predicts the existence of multiple zzso of zzso that may arise by alternative zzso zzso A zzso alternative zzso harboring an zzso termination zzso was also found in the mouse zzso gene and shows, surprisingly, zzso zzso identity to its human zzso
