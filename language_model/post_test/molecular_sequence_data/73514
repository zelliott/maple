zzso is a liver enriched zzso zzso isolated from zzso which is involved in the zzso zzso of liver, zzso zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso and a zzso domain both essential together with the zzso for DNA specific zzso Using the zzso zzso system we searched for proteins interacting with zzso We repeatedly obtained zzso clones zzso zzso zzso an zzso involved in the zzso of aromatic zzso acids that was shown to bind to and zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso system, we show that the zzso activity of zzso is not essential for zzso binding and that the zzso zzso domain is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that both proteins zzso in zzso zzso
