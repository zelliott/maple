We have previously isolated a protein from mouse liver zzso that specifically binds to single stranded zzso zzso zzso is the zzso repeats of zzso and we therefore named the new protein single stranded zzso binding protein zzso Further studies now identify zzso as zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso on the basis of zzso acid sequence determination and zzso zzso zzso and B1 form a major part of the protein component of zzso particles and are abundant nuclear zzso zzso zzso has a high specificity for binding to the zzso equivalent of zzso zzso but under the same conditions does not appear to have a strong affinity for a number of other zzso zzso
