A 37 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso distinct from the zzso zzso is expressed in rat anterior zzso zzso and many regions of the brain, suggesting that zzso may zzso the biological activity of zzso In these studies a mouse brain zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in brain and zzso and encodes a zzso zzso acid protein that is highly zzso to human and rat zzso zzso zzso expressed in cultured zzso cells, binds human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso but exhibits much weaker affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso 206 zzso zzso zzso also blocks zzso zzso release from zzso zzso Additional zzso characterization of the binding activity of zzso indicates that zzso and zzso zzso zzso different molecular interactions to bind zzso
