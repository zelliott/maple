The zzso bulb of the rat contains zzso A at a similar level as the adrenal zzso or the zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso A also displays the same size as zzso A of zzso zzso In the zzso and other brain regions, we could not detect zzso A by zzso In contrast, zzso A zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso protection zzso was observed in all brain regions zzso including the zzso zzso By in zzso zzso zzso with a complementary zzso acid probe zzso zzso and by zzso zzso A synthesis could be localized to cell bodies of the zzso cell layer, of the external zzso layer and of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A was also detected in the central projection areas of zzso and zzso cells in the primary zzso zzso and the anterior zzso area but not in the zzso zzso where the incoming zzso nerve fibers of the primary zzso zzso establish synaptic zzso Taken together the data show that zzso A, following zzso in the zzso of the zzso and zzso cells, is specifically transported into their zzso terminals but not into their primary zzso We propose that the rat zzso system could serve as a model for the study of zzso A regulation and function in zzso
