It has been proposed that protein zzso C may be targeted to specific locations via interactions with zzso proteins located at various zzso zzso A group of proteins collectively termed zzso zzso for zzso zzso have been zzso Here, we made use of a rapid and simple method to purify several zzso from rat zzso taking advantage of the ability of these proteins to be zzso with zzso zzso The method can be used for the isolation of other proteins that share these zzso Four proteins were zzso to apparent zzso with zzso values of 14, 15, 16, and 34 zzso zzso acid composition and zzso characteristics of these proteins are zzso
