The zzso system of the zzso coli cell envelope is composed of five zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a complex in the inner zzso whereas zzso is a zzso protein interacting with zzso the zzso zzso anchored to the outer zzso This system is required for outer membrane integrity and has been shown to form a zzso bridge linking inner and outer zzso The zzso interaction plays an important role in the function of this system and has been found to depend on the zzso motive force and the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso interacts with many zzso such as zzso zzso zzso the major zzso and the zzso zzso In this study, six pal deletions were zzso The analyses of the resulting zzso protein functions and interactions defined an zzso region of 40 zzso which can be deleted without any zzso effect, and three independent regions required for its interaction with zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso The analyses of the integrity of the cells producing the various zzso zzso revealed strong outer membrane zzso only when binding regions were zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso sequence located downstream of the zzso binding motif of zzso was required for the zzso interaction and for the maintenance of outer membrane zzso
