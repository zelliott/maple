zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a member of the zzso family of proteins that is involved in zzso the zzso elements and attaching them to cell zzso zzso zzso mice develop severe zzso of sensory zzso that was attributed in part due to the absence of a zzso zzso called zzso that harbors an zzso domain at the zzso Additional alternative zzso also results in zzso zzso with different first zzso leading to three additional types of zzso called zzso 1, 2 and 3 (or zzso zzso and zzso These unique zzso extensions of the zzso zzso are of variable zzso In this study, we characterized these zzso zzso and evaluated the influence of these unique zzso sequences to the zzso zzso The unique zzso region of zzso 1 is very short and was not expected to affect the property of the zzso that followed zzso In contrast, zzso studies and zzso analyses zzso that the zzso sequences of zzso 2 had the ability to bundle zzso filaments and the zzso region that contained zzso 3 showed cortical zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 also displayed differential tissue expression zzso Taken together, these data suggested that the unique zzso regions of these zzso have different roles that may be tailored to meet tissue specific zzso
