zzso disruption of two zzso alpha zzso genes in the chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso revealed roles for the zzso alpha zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A second G alpha zzso zzso was found to be zzso for these zzso We now report the cloning and targeted disruption of a zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso by this zzso designated zzso was found to share zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with G beta zzso from human, zzso and zzso origins, respectively, but only zzso identity with the zzso zzso G beta zzso zzso zzso Low stringency Southern zzso failed to detect any related G beta zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso resulted in several of the changes previously reported to accompany disruption of the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso gene zzso These included very significant reductions in zzso asexual zzso and zzso In contrast to results obtained for zzso alpha gene zzso the reduction in zzso resulting from the disruption of a G beta gene was accompanied by increased, rather than zzso zzso growth on synthetic zzso The relevance of these results to mechanisms of zzso zzso is zzso
