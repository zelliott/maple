A successful zzso synthesis of zzso with an zzso sulfur atom as zzso of zzso is zzso The key compound zzso was zzso from zzso zzso 4 and the zzso zzso zzso After zzso the zzso zzso was used as an zzso and zzso as a donor in a zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso from zzso zzso The expected zzso zzso and zzso 1 were isolated in zzso and zzso yield, zzso As expected, the zzso 1, zzso and zzso were resistant to zzso zzso by zzso isolated from zzso zzso Furthermore, they have been shown to act as competitive zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 11 by this zzso
