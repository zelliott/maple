The zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso possesses two zzso named zzso and zzso which, respectively, zzso proteins involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an essential zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that releases the terminal zzso group from linear zzso Northern blots showed that both zzso genes are induced by long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript levels being markedly increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso increases of both zzso and zzso specific activities and protein levels by zzso deprivation were also zzso On the other hand, a knockout zzso was obtained by zzso zzso of zzso but it could not be achieved with zzso thus indicating that zzso function is essential for cell zzso Moreover, whereas the zzso zzso exhibited under zzso conditions lower growth rates than the zzso and was certainly devoid of zzso activity, it showed a severe reduction of the zzso zzso These results are the first evidence on the involvement of both zzso and zzso in a possible zzso zzso zzso process activated under zzso
