zzso zzso is a tree species that is highly zzso widely zzso and zzso with zzso of even thousands of zzso To explore the mechanisms underlying these zzso gene expressions have been investigated at the zzso level by zzso combined with a digital gene expression zzso zzso So, it is crucial to have a reliable set of reference genes to zzso the expressions of genes in zzso zzso under various conditions using the most accurate and sensitive method of quantitative real-time zzso zzso In this study, we selected 10 reference gene candidates from zzso data of zzso zzso and examined their expression profiles by zzso using 29 different samples of zzso zzso which were collected from plants of different ages, different zzso and plants subjected to different treatments including cold, heat, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Three zzso software packages zzso zzso and zzso were used to assess the stability of gene zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the optimum pair of reference genes at all zzso stages and under all stress zzso zzso was the most stable gene across different zzso and zzso samples, while zzso was the most zzso expressed reference gene for zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were used zzso or in combination as reference genes to examine the expression levels of zzso (a zzso of zzso in plants subjected to various treatments with zzso The results further proved the reliability of the two selected reference zzso Our study will benefit future research on the expression of genes in response to zzso in zzso zzso and other members of the zzso
