zzso fusion is fundamental to the development and zzso of skeletal zzso To zzso zzso undergo zzso recognition and zzso and merger of zzso between zzso zzso Cell migration must occur in advance of these events to bring zzso into zzso but the factors that regulate zzso zzso are not fully zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso that is targeted to zzso and zzso via its zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso forms complexes with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Watt, zzso zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso stimulates zzso formation in zzso We report here that zzso is associated with zzso in zzso zzso zzso in which zzso levels are increased or decreased via zzso or zzso zzso zzso respectively, show enhanced or reduced zzso formation and cell migration, the latter both zzso and in response to zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso zzso tail zzso that alter the zzso targeting sequence and, consequently, the zzso zzso in zzso reveals a similar correlation between cell zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso (the early zzso compartment of the mouse zzso and in zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso and that this property contributes to its ability to promote zzso fusion into zzso
