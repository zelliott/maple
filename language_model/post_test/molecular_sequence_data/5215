A rabbit zzso specific for the zzso zzso replacement zzso was raised with the aid of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated the specificity of this zzso zzso In addition, we showed on zzso blots that two zzso zzso isolated from mice with systemic lupus zzso zzso display strong zzso with the zzso zzso but not with its zzso zzso Our observations indicate that zzso zzso might play a role as zzso in zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso to characterize the germ line zzso in zzso preparations of zzso zzso because our previous studies had shown that a zzso zzso gene is strongly expressed in the germ line of zzso zzso The zzso reacted with some of the zzso zzso in zzso and with zzso of the zzso germ cells of zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso is not evenly distributed throughout the zzso of germ cells, but is concentrated in distinct zzso zzso zzso disappears from the zzso zzso along with the other core zzso during the late stages of zzso In zzso zzso zzso however, a rather uniform distribution of the zzso zzso was zzso The possible role of zzso zzso is zzso
