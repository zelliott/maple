The zzso potential of the viral zzso zzso zzso is due to its zzso zzso Unlike the highly zzso cellular zzso zzso a zzso deletion of the regulatory tail and numerous point zzso make the viral zzso zzso To determine the basis of these differences, we zzso the structure and stability of zzso and zzso in zzso We show that the stability of zzso against unfolding and irreversible zzso is significantly lower than that of zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso are more exposed already in the native zzso In consequence, zzso was found to be inactive close to zzso zzso We thus suggest that the ensemble of zzso that transform zzso into the zzso zzso cause a zzso zzso of the zzso
