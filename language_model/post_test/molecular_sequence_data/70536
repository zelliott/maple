The zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso are expressed in a zzso and zzso regulated zzso To understand the zzso basis for this regulation, we have cloned and characterized the zzso zzso zzso The promoter was zzso cell specific, showing activity in various zzso and zzso lines but little activity in zzso zzso To our surprise, however, the promoter was regulated differently in B and T zzso Using nuclear extracts from zzso lines, we found that the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso could bind to a zzso sequence critical for promoter zzso zzso activated the promoter in zzso cells, and the zzso site was occupied in a zzso manner in zzso An overlapping DNA sequence binding to a distinct factor was necessary for promoter activity in T zzso Full promoter activity in T cells was also dependent on a more zzso DNA sequence whose disruption had no effect on zzso zzso The unexpected finding that a zzso factor regulates the zzso promoter may explain some of the recently observed differences in the regulation of zzso zzso between B and T zzso
