The genetic organization of the region upstream of the car gene of the zzso acid zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso region revealed the presence of 10 zzso whose putative functions, according to database searches, are zzso Three zzso units are zzso zzso zzso and zzso Potential zzso zzso were identified downstream of zzso zzso and zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso gave rise to zzso unable to produce zzso acid, but with a considerably higher production of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso had a remarkably lower production of zzso acid and similar production of zzso zzso zzso improvements of zzso acid production, associated with a drop in zzso C zzso were obtained with zzso of zzso zzso zzso multiple copies of plasmids carrying different constructions from the zzso zzso This information can be used to guide strain improvement programs, blending random zzso and molecular zzso to zzso the yield of zzso zzso
