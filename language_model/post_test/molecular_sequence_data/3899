In this study, we examined the identification of zzso based on the sequence zzso of the internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso zzso A newly designed primer pair could amplify the target region of all 42 strains zzso The zzso products were zzso and the sequence zzso were searched by zzso It was demonstrated that this method is a reliable identification method at the zzso or species zzso At present, available databases are still insufficient to identify some zzso but with the zzso of further data in the zzso database, this method will be available for the identification of zzso
