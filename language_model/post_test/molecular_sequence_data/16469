zzso zzso disease virus zzso a member of the family zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso the putative zzso zzso zzso occurs in zzso both as a free zzso and as a zzso zzso called zzso To gain more insight in its function, we initiated a zzso zzso zzso With this approach we identified the zzso domain of zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso as an zzso for zzso The association between these molecules was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in the initiation of translation of both capped and zzso zzso Its association with zzso zzso suggests an involvement of this viral protein in zzso zzso zzso An interaction between zzso and full-length zzso was, however, not zzso In view of the known zzso structure of zzso it is conceivable that the interaction of zzso with full-length zzso requires collaborating proteins that open up its structure and expose the zzso site in the zzso zzso The biological relevance of the potential zzso interaction is zzso
