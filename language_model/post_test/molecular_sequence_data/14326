zzso Family 1 zzso comprise the greatest number of zzso found in zzso The widespread occurrence and diversity of zzso throughout the plant kingdom underscore the importance of these zzso zzso Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which a putative family 1 zzso zzso zzso was zzso The role and possible mechanism of zzso in the regulation of flowering were analyzed by zzso genetic and cellular zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited late flowering in both long and short days, and its flowering was promoted by zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso flowering zzso was rescued by the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of the flowering zzso zzso zzso C was increased substantially in the zzso but decreased to the zzso level in zzso lines, with corresponding changes in the expression levels of the floral zzso and floral zzso identity zzso The expression of zzso was zzso regulated and its protein products were distributed in both zzso and zzso zzso Our findings imply that zzso regulates flowering time via the flowering zzso zzso zzso zzso These data highlight an important role for the family 1 zzso in the regulation of plant flower zzso
