A double crossover tile based artificial two-dimensional zzso DNA lattice was zzso and the zzso method was introduced to recover an original DNA lattice structure in order to deposit DNA zzso safely on the organic layer without damaging the zzso The DNA lattice was then employed as an electron blocking layer in a zzso solar cell causing an increase of about zzso up to zzso in the power conversion zzso zzso the resulting solar cell which had an artificial zzso DNA blocking layer showed a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency compared to conventional zzso solar zzso It should be clear that the artificial DNA zzso holds unique physical properties that are extremely attractive for various zzso and zzso zzso
