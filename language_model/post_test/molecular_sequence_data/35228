We reported the design of fusion zzso with improved activity using a zzso inhibitor design zzso First, we chose zzso as the template zzso which is a zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso domain and has zzso activity of zzso 118 zzso in a zzso fusion zzso We zzso the zzso sites and zzso of the template zzso We found that zzso zzso caused activity improvement based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was improved from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Compared with long zzso short peptides may be more suitable to analyze the zzso zzso So we selected a shorter zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso Due its weak zzso no zzso effect zzso zzso we chose zzso which were introduced salt bridges to consolidate the zzso based on the natural sequence zzso The zzso zzso was four times more potent than the zzso zzso in zzso activity, with an zzso value of zzso zzso close to the high active zzso fusion inhibitor zzso The strategy used in this study may be used to design new fusion zzso to interfere similar zzso
