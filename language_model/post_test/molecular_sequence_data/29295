The major zzso zzso gene of human zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by differential zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso generated an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which does not zzso to any known zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the zzso zzso is from zzso 1, 2, and 3 and part of zzso 4, indicating that it is derived from a novel alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso zzso termed zzso which zzso to an zzso zzso with an internal deletion from zzso to zzso and appears as a band at 38 zzso on a sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a low level in the zzso early, and late period of viral zzso zzso was localized in zzso and a zzso zzso revealed that zzso enhances zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, which is identified here as an zzso target zzso Another zzso zzso zzso activated the same promoter but only zzso compared to zzso and zzso of zzso did not alter the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso did not enhance the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso that works with zzso
