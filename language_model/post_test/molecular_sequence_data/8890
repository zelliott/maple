We report the identification of three new mouse models, zzso nice, and zzso with zzso inherited zzso deafness due to novel zzso in the zzso zzso gene 1 zzso These strains were generated by zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed changes in zzso zzso and zzso causing zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso nice, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso affect zzso acid zzso that are zzso zzso across zzso Similar to the previously reported Beethoven zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are located outside a predicted zzso domain, whereas the zzso zzso resides in the predicted zzso domain zzso zzso zzso mice have severe hearing loss at the age of 4 weeks and are deaf by the age of 8 weeks, whereas both zzso and nice zzso are profoundly deaf at the age of 4 zzso None of the strains displays signs of zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed zzso of outer hair cells in the zzso region of zzso nice, and zzso zzso zzso studies revealed expression of zzso protein in the hair cells, spiral zzso zzso supporting cells, and zzso ligament in the inner zzso zzso levels of zzso protein were observed in the spiral ligament of zzso when compared with zzso zzso These three zzso zzso provide valuable models for studying zzso zzso zzso hearing loss zzso in zzso
