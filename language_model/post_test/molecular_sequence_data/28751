The zzso zzso zzso of zzso sodium channels is known to be involved in their mechanism of zzso Its primary sequence is well zzso in sodium channels from different zzso and zzso However, the role of charged zzso in this region, first thought to play an important role in zzso has not been well identified, whereas the zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as the crucial element for zzso In this work, we constructed theoretical models and performed molecular dynamics simulations, exploring the role of zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso interface represented by a zzso zzso From structural predictions, two zzso segments are zzso Moreover, from dynamics simulations, a zzso motif is detected and shown to play a relevant role in guiding the zzso particle toward its zzso zzso
