A novel zzso strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from a marine zzso sample collected from the zzso Islands in the South China Sea and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso zzso had the highest similarity zzso zzso to members of the zzso zzso and was loosely associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso major fatty acids and zzso properties were also consistent with typical characteristics of the zzso zzso however, the presence of zzso in the zzso pattern differs greatly from those of members of the zzso zzso Additionally, strain zzso zzso showed some zzso differences from its most closely related zzso Based on the zzso data, a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso
