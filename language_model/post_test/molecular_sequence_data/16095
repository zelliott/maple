The promoter region of the chicken adult zzso gene contains a sequence of 16 zzso zzso located at a zzso boundary in zzso where the gene is zzso In definitive zzso that express the zzso zzso the zzso is zzso the zzso and adjacent sequences are occupied by zzso zzso zzso and a zzso hypersensitive domain is generated in this zzso To gain insight into the role of the zzso in this series of events, we have examined the proteins that bind to zzso Using the gel mobility shift zzso and a zzso zzso that blocks specific binding to the zzso we have identified a specific zzso zzso that is found only in chicken zzso cells and appears at the same time, or shortly before, the changes in zzso zzso The zzso interacts strongly with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso Although both zzso and zzso require zzso for their zzso activity, these proteins differ in their zzso zzso zzso properties, and molecular zzso In contrast to zzso which is found in a wide variety of cell types, zzso is restricted to zzso and is most abundant in definitive zzso Thus, its presence zzso to the zzso and zzso occupancy of the zzso in zzso
