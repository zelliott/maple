A previously zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso was used to perform an extensive zzso zzso The zzso rates of 21 different zzso zzso and 24 different zzso zzso were zzso Only one of the three zzso zzso base pairs but all nine of the zzso zzso zzso in the central core are needed for self zzso In most cases the zzso did not alter the ability of the zzso to assemble into a zzso zzso In the few cases where zzso zzso did not zzso it appeared to be the result of the zzso stabilizing an alternate zzso or zzso secondary zzso All combinations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were less active than the corresponding single zzso suggesting that the zzso contains few, if any, zzso zzso interactions as are found in zzso The refined consensus zzso resulting from this work was used to identify potential zzso present in a variety of zzso coli gene zzso
