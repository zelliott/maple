We compared zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced either by zzso zzso with zzso or from a zzso strain, with those of zzso zzso in order to gain insight into the zzso changes of the protein backbone that lead to correct folding after retinal is added to zzso The observed zzso zzso spectrum of zzso produced by zzso is not greatly different from that of zzso except for the presence of suppressed or decreased zzso From careful evaluation of the intensity differences between cross polarization magic angle spinning zzso and zzso zzso angle spinning zzso zzso it appears that the reduced zzso arise from reduced efficiency of cross polarization or interference of internal motions with zzso decoupling zzso In particular, the zzso and zzso zzso and some zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have acquired internal motions whose zzso interfere with zzso decoupling zzso In contrast, the protein backbone of the zzso from the zzso cells is incompletely zzso Although it contains mainly zzso its very broad zzso zzso signals indicate that its zzso structure is different from zzso zzso this changed structure is identical in form to that of zzso zzso from zzso zzso after it was zzso with retinal in zzso and zzso with zzso We conclude that the binding of retinal is essential for the correct folding of zzso after it is inserted in zzso into the zzso zzso and the final folded state does not zzso to the partially folded form upon removal of the zzso
