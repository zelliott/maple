zzso are known to be important for many biological zzso due to their ability to recognize cell surface carbohydrates with high zzso Plant zzso have been model systems to study zzso recognition, because individually they exhibit high sensitivity and as a group large diversity in recognizing zzso zzso Although extensive studies have been carried out for zzso zzso that have led to interesting insights into the sequence zzso of sugar recognition in them, zzso with such specific correlations are not available for other plant zzso zzso This study reports a large-scale data acquisition and extensive analysis of sequences and structures of zzso or zzso zzso zzso and shows that zzso in the binding site zzso generates zzso recognition diversity, a strategy analogous to that in zzso zzso zzso of the size, zzso and sequence zzso in key regions reveal the existence of a common theme, zzso as a set of structural features over a common scaffold, in defining zzso This study also points to the remarkable range of domain zzso often arising out of gene zzso events in zzso of this zzso The data analyzed here also indicate a spectacular variety of zzso associations possible in this family of zzso that have implications for zzso zzso These results thus provide zzso zzso an understanding of the molecular basis of zzso recognition by zzso zzso and also a rationale for engineering specific recognition capabilities in relevant zzso
