zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso a zzso protein that has similarity to both acid zzso and zzso The zzso portion of the zzso zzso acid zzso A zzso was most similar (the zzso probability score was zzso to bacterial class A zzso acid zzso The central region of the zzso protein had similarity to passenger zzso of other zzso zzso whereas the zzso portion of zzso resembled the zzso domain of conventional zzso Cloning and expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso coli confirmed the presence of acid zzso activity in the zzso zzso The zzso protein was shown to be localized to the outer membrane of zzso zzso and was not detected either in the soluble zzso fraction from disrupted zzso zzso cells or in the spent culture zzso fluid from zzso zzso Use of the predicted zzso zzso domain in a fusion construct with the passenger domain from another predicted zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso ability of this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso strain zzso reduced the acid zzso activity expressed by this zzso and this zzso could be zzso in trans with the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso gene from six zzso zzso strains showed that this protein was highly zzso among strains of this zzso zzso zzso of a critical zzso zzso zzso in the predicted active site of the acid zzso domain in zzso eliminated acid zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso This is the first description of an zzso protein that expresses acid zzso zzso
