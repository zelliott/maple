We designed a strategy to identify zzso factors that act by preventing zzso transport into the zzso A zzso synthetic zzso was inserted into a zzso gene so that only the zzso could be translated to produce zzso zzso zzso of either of the zzso zzso junction sequence zzso and the zzso sequence zzso resulted in a dramatic increase in zzso translation, indicating its zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso at the zzso temperature, zzso zzso occurred simultaneously with a large increase in zzso zzso Similarly, a point zzso in zzso zzso decreased zzso efficiency and increased zzso zzso From these results, we conclude that early acting factors, probably including zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso gene products, interact in zzso with the zzso zzso junction and the zzso sequence to commit the zzso to the zzso pathway, thereby preventing its transport to the zzso
