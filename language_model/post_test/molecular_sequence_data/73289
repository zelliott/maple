The boundaries required for zzso expression from the zzso region of the full length transcript of zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso coupled to reporter genes were defined by zzso and 3' deletion zzso In transient expression zzso using zzso of zzso zzso a 314 zzso zzso promoter zzso sequence zzso to zzso from the zzso start zzso was sufficient for strong expression zzso Plant expression zzso developed with modified zzso promoters were tested with zzso or zzso as reporter genes in transgenic zzso The zzso promoter is a strong zzso promoter, with strength comparable to or greater than that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter with its double zzso domain linked to zzso or zzso reporter genes provides an average zzso greater activity than the zzso promoter with a single zzso domain zzso to zzso zzso upstream zzso in tests with transgenic plants and in zzso transient expression zzso
