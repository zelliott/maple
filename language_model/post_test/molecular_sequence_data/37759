As a prelude to developing engineered resistance to two important zzso pathogens of zzso a zzso analysis of strains of zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso and zzso common mosaic zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso zzso sequences for the coat protein genes and zzso regions of four zzso and one zzso strains were determined and included in an analysis with published zzso While all the newly zzso viruses showed strong zzso with the existing respective sequences in the database, the zzso group showed a divergence into two zzso These groups differed from each other by more than some zzso strains differed from the South African zzso virus zzso which has distinct biological zzso The implications of the sequence analyses are discussed with respect to a strategy for the generation of engineered resistance to both groups of zzso
