The role of the zzso factor zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso activity was investigated in zzso zzso expressing zzso cells, zzso and in zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso of a region containing the putative zzso binding site resulted in a significant reduction in the activity in zzso zzso while the activity in zzso cells was increased suggesting that the zzso site may zzso regulate zzso gene expression in these distinct cell zzso However, both cell lines were found to express significant and similar levels of the zzso factors zzso Analysis of zzso proteins in each of the cell lines provided evidence that zzso is zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso This result suggests that differential regulation of zzso gene expression may be related to zzso zzso
