Various human body zzso and zzso contain a soluble form of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso The zzso precursor zzso contains eight zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso 7 and 8, we have zzso the soluble form of the zzso precursor from human urine to zzso The protein was shown to have a molecular mass of about 160 zzso and the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso 2, 7 and 8 of the precursor have the consensus sequence for zzso zzso of zzso zzso We identified the presence of zzso acid zzso in acid zzso of the zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso As the DNA sequence encodes zzso in the corresponding position, the zzso represents zzso zzso The zzso zzso have a consensus zzso motif immediately zzso of the first zzso zzso The synthetic zzso module 2 zzso zzso of the zzso precursor was found to bind calcium with low zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso similar to the affinity of other isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso module 7, when part of the intact zzso was found to bind zzso with a zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso higher than that of isolated zzso zzso presumably due to the influence of neighboring zzso We have detected zzso precursor in zzso plasma and demonstrated it to be associated to zzso The zzso were found to have zzso zzso molecules zzso
