zzso muscular zzso zzso a zzso degenerative disorder of the muscle, is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases in zzso It affects about one male in zzso with an estimated one-third of cases being caused by new zzso A less severe disease, zzso muscular zzso zzso maps to the same zzso locus and is most probably an zzso form of zzso Both diseases are sometimes associated with various degrees of mental zzso the molecular basis of these zzso is unknown (for review, see zzso zzso The giant zzso gene spans approximately 2,000 zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso and encodes a zzso zzso The zzso of its expression has not been precisely zzso zzso et zzso using Northern zzso reported expression of the gene in human fetal skeletal muscle and small zzso but not in human fetal brain, or in human cultured zzso and transformed B and T zzso More recently, expression was detected in mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle, but not in mouse zzso Here we show, using a zzso protection zzso that the zzso gene is zzso regulated in rat and mouse zzso cell cultures, and that it is expressed in rat and mouse zzso muscle, in mouse smooth muscle and in zzso mouse and rabbit zzso We could not detect transcripts in other zzso zzso
