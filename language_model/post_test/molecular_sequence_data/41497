zzso by zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso interactions by zzso gene zzso Many viral and cellular zzso are involved in virus infection, though no comprehensive general model for zzso derived from zzso DNA viruses exists for their function in zzso systems, despite extensive research on zzso To address this issue, the zzso from shrimp white spot syndrome virus zzso a DNA virus with a zzso zzso zzso circular DNA zzso were zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso and northern zzso zzso zzso was shown to possess the capacity to zzso 40 distinct viral zzso a zzso content roughly 360 times greater than that of zzso These findings suggested that the high content of viral zzso might greatly contribute to viral zzso in response selective pressures in the host zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso zzso were expressed during early stages of viral infection, indicating their importance in initial zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of viral zzso was demonstrated to be dependent on host zzso and zzso 1, zzso by zzso 1, and viral zzso including zzso and zzso were required for successful zzso zzso During zzso infection, numerous viral genes were likely targeted by zzso zzso The current study presented the first comprehensive view of viral zzso zzso by an zzso DNA virus, providing insight into the molecular events of zzso zzso
