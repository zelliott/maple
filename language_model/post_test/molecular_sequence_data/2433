The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a part of the zzso gene of zzso coli has been zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso proteins of molecular weight zzso and zzso respectively, and are transcribed from a common promoter, zzso locating within zzso bases upstream of zzso zzso from zzso is not significantly induced by nitrate under zzso whereas zzso from zzso promoter, which zzso zzso region and is transcribed zzso is fully induced by zzso The zzso two-thirds of the zzso protein has extensive zzso with those of a diverse set of zzso regulatory zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A segment locating in the zzso half of the zzso protein seems to have potential most likely to form the zzso structure characteristic of a class of zzso zzso The protein is considered to play a role as a zzso zzso of the nitrate zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso protein also has zzso with other regulatory proteins known as counterparts of zzso regulatory systems, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of two copies of zzso segments in the zzso half of the zzso protein suggests the role as a zzso zzso sensing zzso
