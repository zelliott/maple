zzso zzso factors are characterized by three highly zzso zzso zinc finger motifs that bind zzso zzso These proteins behave as either zzso or zzso and have begun to be classified into different zzso based upon the presence of zzso motifs outside the zinc finger zzso This zzso predicts that different zzso zzso share certain functional zzso zzso and zzso constitute a new zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso proteins whose zinc finger motifs also bind zzso zzso However, regions outside of the zzso domain that differ in structure from other zzso family members remain poorly zzso Here, we have used extensive zzso and zzso zzso zzso to identify three repression zzso within zzso and zzso that we call zzso zzso and zzso zzso is 10 zzso zzso zzso is 12 zzso zzso and zzso is approximately 80 zzso acids zzso None of these zzso share zzso with previously described zzso regulatory zzso but they share strong sequence zzso and are functionally zzso between zzso and zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso proteins are capable of zzso transcription, define zzso critical for this function, and further support the idea that different zzso of zzso proteins have evolved to mediate distinct zzso zzso
