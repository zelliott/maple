zzso zzso is the first zzso reported to block zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso its sequence is characterized by net negative charge and high zzso although it retains the zzso zzso zzso In order to obtain structural information and to supply material for further characterization of its biological function, we zzso zzso and determined its zzso bond zzso Because a linear precursor with free zzso groups showed a strong tendency to zzso and to zzso we examined many different conditions for air zzso and concluded that a mixture of zzso buffer and zzso zzso was the most effective for the folding of zzso zzso zzso was shown to suppress the slowly zzso zzso calcium current in cultured zzso zzso zzso and zzso to suppress synaptic transmission between these zzso and their follower zzso In contrast, zzso did not block calcium flux through zzso channels in zzso cells, suggesting a zzso or zzso specificity in this channel zzso zzso bond pairings of zzso and its zzso were determined by zzso fragmentation in combination with chemical zzso thus revealing that zzso has the same zzso bond pattern as other zzso Furthermore, the CD spectrum of zzso is similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso The precursor sequence of zzso was determined by zzso cloning and shown to be closest to that of zzso zzso a sodium channel zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso the structural fold of other zzso and the zzso branch of this family reveals the versatility of its structural scaffold, allowing evolution of structurally related peptides to target different zzso
