A major limiting factor in understanding zzso major zzso zzso function is the lack of knowledge about zzso presentation accessory zzso We report here two zzso clones zzso zzso versions of zzso chain and one zzso a related protein that may play a zzso zzso role in zzso zzso The two zzso chain zzso are similar to each other where they zzso but differ in the presence or absence of a zzso zzso This domain is added to zzso zzso chain protein by alternative zzso but there was no evidence of alternative zzso of the two trout zzso Southern zzso confirmed that all three trout zzso are derived from single copy genes and Northern zzso indicated that they are expressed in zzso zzso Thus the zzso proteins are probably involved in zzso zzso but their expression is probably regulated in a manner different from zzso
