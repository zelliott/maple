It has been zzso for several years that the high affinity zzso zzso zzso system plays a role in clearing zzso from the synaptic zzso Four different zzso zzso zzso are now identified, the major zzso one being zzso To be a good candidate for the zzso of zzso at the synaptic zzso zzso should be properly located at zzso either at zzso or zzso zzso We have investigated the distribution of zzso in primary cultures of zzso zzso which represent an advantageous model for the study of zzso and synaptic zzso We have demonstrated that zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso compartment of fully differentiated zzso zzso where it is localized in the zzso zzso and in the spine neck, outside the area facing the active zzso No zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso produced by typical zzso and zzso markers was ever observed, indicating that zzso is not to be considered a synaptic zzso zzso the zzso pattern of expression of zzso was found to be different from that of typical synaptic zzso Moreover, zzso was expressed in the zzso compartment of zzso zzso already at stages preceding the formation of synaptic zzso and was also expressed in zzso zzso with identical zzso zzso Taken together, these data rule against a possible role for zzso in the clearance of zzso from within the zzso and in the regulation of its time in the zzso They suggest an unconventional zzso function of this zzso zzso carrier, not restricted to zzso zzso
