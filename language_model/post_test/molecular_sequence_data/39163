We have cloned the full-length complementary DNA zzso for a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined its gene zzso The zzso encodes a zzso acid protein that has a zzso zzso acid identity to the human zzso zzso The X zzso zzso zzso has all of the zzso acids identified in the zzso zzso receptors as sites of interaction with the zzso zzso However, this zzso zzso shares the same distinguishing structural features of the zzso zzso that have been characterized from other zzso zzso These include the pair of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso II and zzso compared with the zzso arrangement in zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso motif in zzso loop III zzso in zzso and the presence of a zzso zzso Previous studies have reported that zzso zzso was zzso to other naturally occurring zzso zzso in stimulating zzso release from the zzso zzso However, in this study we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso selectivity for the naturally occurring zzso similar to other zzso zzso zzso The order of potency of the zzso in stimulating zzso zzso production in zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
