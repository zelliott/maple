zzso of pig zzso may be associated with a risk of transmission of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are of particular concern since in zzso experiments have demonstrated that human cells are susceptible to such zzso To monitor the transmission of zzso highly sensitive and specific zzso must be developed for clinical zzso This report describes the production, preliminary characterization and application of a zzso zzso zzso against a zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso The generated zzso was tested using zzso zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli, zzso zzso virus particles and human zzso cell line infected with zzso zzso proteins of 15, 70 and 85 zzso were recognized specifically using zzso zzso and Western zzso No zzso was demonstrated with zzso viral protein zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso can be applied to zzso zzso proteins using an zzso zzso This work reveals that zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso may be effective in detecting zzso against zzso in zzso patients, or for zzso who have extensive contact with zzso
