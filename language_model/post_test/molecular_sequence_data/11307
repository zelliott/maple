The zzso zzso expression system was used to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso results from zzso zzso by G zzso zzso zzso zzso of delta zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso receptors increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso the G zzso inwardly zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso and the intrinsic rate of zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso produced a rapid zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso signaling with a zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso more slowly zzso zzso zzso a similar synergistic effect on zzso required 2-3 h of zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso and zzso zzso at the end of the zzso tail coupled effectively to zzso channels but were insensitive to zzso and zzso However, a zzso zzso having zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the third zzso loop was indistinguishable in zzso and zzso from the wild type zzso These studies establish that zzso receptors can be regulated by zzso and zzso and that a portion of the zzso zzso of zzso enhances sensitivity to this zzso
