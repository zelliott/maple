It has been previously reported zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1992) that primary cultures of rat zzso zzso zzso cells and immortalized zzso cell lines produce three zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to a zzso transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso 1) complementary DNA zzso In this report, we show that the zzso and zzso transcripts are not zzso by Northern analysis of resting adult trachea but are induced in zzso zzso zzso and tumors formed from transformed zzso zzso Northern analysis of the zzso 1 transcripts with zzso of the zzso complementary DNA demonstrate that the zzso transcript lacks much of the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso protection analysis was used to map the zzso start site of the zzso transcript to within zzso base pairs of the first zzso zzso No differences in the coding or 3' zzso were detected between the zzso and the zzso zzso Although zzso cells produce a zzso zzso 1 zzso we were unable to detect a previously reported unique 3' zzso which we found to be almost identical to a rat zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso transcript is missing most of the long zzso zzso zzso it may be translated at a different rate than the zzso and zzso zzso or it may code for an zzso form of zzso zzso The zzso transcript has been observed under several conditions of injury or stress and, therefore, may be an important component of the zzso 1 response to these zzso
