Two protein families that represent major components of essential zzso acid transport in insects have been zzso They are zzso as the zzso and zzso families of zzso according to zzso proximity to characterized zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Members of these families have been identified as important zzso and zzso parts of zzso essential zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso they play critical zzso roles as essential zzso providers to diverse zzso zzso including generic protein zzso This review briefly zzso the requirements for zzso acid transport and a variety of zzso acid transport mechanisms, including the aforementioned zzso Further it focuses on the large group of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which comprise a recently identified zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family zzso or zzso The first insect zzso cloned from the zzso gut, has a broad zzso spectrum similar to zzso zzso zzso Several new zzso members have been characterized in an effort to explore mechanisms for the essential zzso acid zzso in model zzso zzso The identification and functional characterization of new zzso and narrow specificity zzso of essential zzso acids in fruit fly and mosquitoes leads to a fundamentally important zzso that zzso evolved and act together as the integrated active core of a transport network that mediates active zzso zzso and systemic distribution of essential zzso zzso This role of zzso is projected from the most primitive zzso to the most complex zzso organisms, and represents an interesting platform for unraveling the molecular evolution of zzso acid transport and modeling zzso acid transport zzso The comparative study of zzso zzso important zzso differences between essential zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso organisms, outlining a new possibility for selective targeting of essential zzso acid zzso mechanisms to control medically and economically important zzso and other zzso zzso
