We have developed a novel molecular probe that is useful for DNA fingerprint analysis in zzso The probe is based on the zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso It consists of zzso zzso of the 3' portion of the zzso element, extending from the zzso end of the envelope gene to the beginning of the downstream long terminal repeat zzso Unlike other zzso that are currently in use for fingerprint analysis with chicken DNA, the zzso probe works well at normal levels of zzso and with standard zzso zzso zzso of chicken zzso DNA with a variety of restriction zzso routinely yields up to 30 resolvable bands per bird in the 500 zzso to 20 zzso zzso In order to test the efficacy of the zzso fingerprint probe, we have used it to estimate the degree of zzso in the zzso zzso strain of White zzso We find that the estimates derived with the zzso probe are very similar to those reported previously for the zzso zzso These results suggest that molecular zzso based on zzso zzso and other zzso DNA elements should be useful for fingerprint analysis in zzso and in zzso in zzso
