Taking into consideration zzso in humans, human zzso and their derivatives have potential advantages for cancer zzso and/or gene therapy over those from different species such as zzso Recently, we generated 22 human zzso zzso zzso specific for human zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso which carries human zzso zzso In the present study, we tried to clone the variable zzso region genes of the zzso zzso with the highest affinity for zzso and to generate a human zzso variable fragmented zzso zzso 

Using zzso methods, we cloned and zzso zzso zzso V regions of zzso and constructed an zzso gene including a signal sequence for zzso into the zzso space of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was zzso in the zzso space and zzso by zzso affinity column from the zzso of zzso coli after zzso zzso When analyzed by zzso the zzso zzso showed a band corresponding to a calculated molecular weight of 30 zzso The zzso zzso also retained a high zzso with zzso in zzso using immobilized zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso used for fusing with other human functional proteins such as zzso
