To investigate whether the synthesis of cartilage zzso protein zzso is enhanced in zzso zzso 

The content of zzso in human and pig cartilage was determined by zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso was zzso in the zzso cartilage and disc of zzso whereas it was abundant in the rib and zzso cartilage of the same zzso By zzso analysis, zzso was localized in only a few zzso zzso in normal human zzso whereas numerous zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso The number of zzso cells was also increased in zzso cartilage zzso zzso analyses confirmed that the zzso content in the cartilage from zzso and zzso patients was much higher than that in normal zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso can zzso zzso although it is suppressed under zzso zzso The results also suggest that zzso zzso express zzso in response to zzso zzso
