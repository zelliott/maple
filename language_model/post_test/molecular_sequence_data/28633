zzso of similarity between zzso of related species reflect the distribution of selective constraint within zzso We analyzed alignments of 142 zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and found a mosaic pattern with regions of high similarity zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cover approximately zzso of zzso regions, often occur in zzso and are rare within zzso zzso but common within 3' zzso The zzso have a higher ratio of transitions to zzso than expected at random and a higher zzso content than the rest of the zzso zzso The number of zzso and the zzso content of zzso within an zzso region are higher when genes are oriented so that their zzso ends form the boundaries of the zzso zzso Overall, the patterns and characteristics identified here, along with other comparative and experimental studies, suggest that many zzso have a regulatory function, although other types of function are also zzso These conclusions may be quite general across zzso and the characteristics of zzso regulatory elements determined from zzso comparisons can be useful in prediction of regulation sites within individual DNA zzso
