zzso zzso induce production of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and this represents a central component in the zzso of septic shock zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso activates these cells to express zzso are not completely zzso The present study addressed the role of different protein zzso in the zzso induction of zzso It is shown that zzso induced a 12- to zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, and this was completely or more than zzso blocked by the protein zzso zzso specific zzso zzso A and zzso at the zzso of zzso and 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso by zzso reduced zzso induction of zzso whereas it had no effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso A by zzso reduced zzso zzso levels but did not zzso change zzso beta or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not increase leukemia zzso factor zzso which was zzso expressed and not significantly reduced by these zzso In addition to zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso were also reduced to baseline levels by the zzso zzso zzso A and zzso Both zzso zzso also reduced the zzso zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso B), which is a zzso factor involved in the expression of zzso genes such as zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso B was also reduced by zzso whereas zzso had no effect on this zzso In zzso these findings suggest that protein zzso C and protein zzso A appear to have selective effects in the zzso induction of zzso whereas zzso is required for zzso induction of a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso B zzso in zzso
