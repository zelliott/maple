The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of human African sleeping sickness and the cattle disease zzso The zzso form of the zzso uses a dense zzso coat of zzso surface zzso to escape the innate and zzso immune responses of the zzso host and a highly zzso zzso zzso to take up host zzso an essential growth zzso These zzso as well as other zzso pocket, zzso and zzso zzso are known to contain zzso The zzso is unable to take up zzso suggesting that it may depend on the action of zzso zzso for the conversion of zzso to zzso and subsequent incorporation of zzso into zzso via zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the cloning of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and functional characterization by zzso of a zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso conditional zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was created using a transgenic zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso led to a zzso of cell division and substantial cell death, demonstrating that zzso metabolism in zzso zzso proceeds via zzso and is essential for zzso zzso After several days without zzso cultures spontaneously zzso These cells were shown to have undergone a genetic zzso that deleted the zzso zzso The results show that zzso and zzso involved in zzso metabolism may be considered as potential therapeutic targets against African zzso
