In the zzso zzso of zzso rape zzso zzso the zzso ancestral zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso As a result of this crossing event, all gene zzso gene families, or zzso families of the A and C zzso types zzso a certain protein are now combined in one plant zzso In the case of the zzso family for zzso zzso the key zzso of nitrogen zzso six different zzso sequences were isolated from leaf and root specific zzso One sequence pair zzso was characterized by the presence of zzso transit zzso a typical feature of all nuclear zzso zzso zzso Two other zzso pairs zzso and zzso with very high zzso between each other were found in a root specific zzso library and represent protein zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso of zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso restriction analyses of the zzso products permitted the assignment of the zzso sequences to either the A zzso type zzso or the C zzso type zzso zzso the ancestral zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed simultaneously in zzso zzso This result was also confirmed by zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis of zzso zzso In addition, the different zzso genes showed tissue specific expression patterns which are correlated with the state of development of the plant zzso Especially for the zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso a marked increase of expression could be observed after the onset of leaf zzso
