The regions of the zzso virus 40 zzso core origin that are required for stable assembly of zzso zzso T zzso zzso and the zzso origin binding domain zzso have been zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso by interactions with the central region of the core origin, site zzso In contrast, zzso binding and zzso assembly requires a larger region of the core origin that includes both site II and an additional zzso of DNA that may be positioned on either side of site zzso These studies indicate that in the context of zzso the origin binding domain can engage the zzso in site II only if a second region of zzso interacts with one of the zzso zzso The requirements for zzso zzso assembly are complex; the zzso zzso present in the reaction zzso the sequence requirements for zzso Nevertheless, these experiments provide additional evidence that only a subset of the zzso core origin is required for assembly of zzso double zzso
