zzso zzso virus resistance has been described for transgenic plants expressing zzso zzso protein zzso This study was undertaken to determine if expression of other viral sequences could induce this type of virus zzso Plants showing highly resistant or zzso zzso were generated by expressing the tobacco etch virus zzso 6 zzso zzso reading zzso zzso of zzso or zzso versions of this zzso sequence produced resistant zzso zzso resistant and recovery zzso plants expressing zzso coat protein zzso High zzso rates with low zzso levels of the zzso transcript generally correlated with zzso During recovery and induction of the resistance, zzso and protein zzso levels decreased zzso to zzso while zzso of the zzso continued at a similar zzso A zzso cellular system eliminating sequences contained in the zzso transcript and viral zzso would be consistent with the zzso
