Blue color in flowers is due mainly to zzso and a considerable part of blue zzso can be attributed to zzso zzso However, the mechanism of metal zzso transport into zzso and subsequent flower color development has yet to be fully zzso Previously, we studied the mechanism of blue color development specifically at the bottom of the inner zzso in purple zzso petals of zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that differences in iron content were associated with the development of blue- and purple-colored zzso Here, we identify a zzso iron zzso in zzso zzso zzso and characterize the zzso and function of this zzso protein in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso similar that of the zzso zzso zzso iron zzso zzso and also showed similarity to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The gene zzso was expressed exclusively in zzso zzso cells, and protein levels increased with increasing zzso expression and blue zzso zzso expression experiments revealed that zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and is responsible for the development of the blue color in purple zzso zzso of zzso in zzso rescued the growth zzso of zzso zzso cells in the presence of high zzso of zzso Our results indicate that zzso plays an essential role in blue zzso as a zzso iron zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest a new role for involvement of a zzso iron zzso in blue flower color zzso
