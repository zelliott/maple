zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetic disorder causing watery stool and zzso zzso in zzso zzso carrier 26 family member zzso which functions as a coupled zzso zzso cause zzso zzso is a membrane protein predicted to contain 12 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso to the bacterial zzso zzso The zzso domain is required for zzso zzso exchange function and for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator by zzso Here we investigate the molecular zzso by which four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain lead to zzso In a zzso zzso expression system zzso zzso and zzso transport experiments suggest that the four zzso zzso cause zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso studies with the isolated zzso domain suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso disrupt the zzso domain directly, whereas limited zzso experiments suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso affect a later step in the folding and/or trafficking zzso The data suggest that these zzso zzso cause disease by at least two distinct molecular mechanisms, both ultimately leading to loss of functional protein at the plasma zzso
