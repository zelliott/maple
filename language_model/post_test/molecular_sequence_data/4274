zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is achieved by the zzso rotation of a single zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso was used to obtain zzso zzso zzso from this zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of a zzso that shows a zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso was done by electron zzso zzso were obtained by zzso and were used to purify the hook protein zzso zzso The apparent molecular mass of the hook protein was 50 zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and comparisons with the hook proteins of other zzso bacteria indicated that the zzso hook protein has consensus sequences common to zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso library restored zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso Using DNA adjacent to the inserted zzso as a probe, we identified a zzso zzso restriction zzso that contained the gene responsible for the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of this region revealed an open reading frame with a deduced zzso acid sequence that was zzso identical to that of zzso of zzso zzso the zzso responsible for hook length control in that enteric zzso The relevance of a gene zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
