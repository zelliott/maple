Two novel strains isolated from soils, zzso and zzso were characterized using a zzso approach to determine their zzso zzso These zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso with one polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso and fatty acid data supported the affiliation of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso However, zzso data and zzso zzso values allowed differentiation of these strains from other zzso species with zzso published zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between them was zzso zzso zzso zzso values between the novel zzso and strains of other recognized zzso species were zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
