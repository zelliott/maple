zzso zzso I zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells, terminate at three sites that zzso zzso zzso termination element zzso zzso Essential features in these elements were investigated by the in zzso expression of targeted zzso zzso analyses confirmed a functional significance for two of the elements zzso 1 and zzso but indicated that the third, less zzso sequence zzso 2) does not function as a termination zzso The results further indicated that the most zzso zzso in the two active zzso as well as adjacent regions, are also most critical to zzso Furthermore, some zzso in these elements or in immediately zzso sequences affect not only the efficiency of zzso but also alter the position of termination by as much as 35 zzso Since the element is able to influence the site of termination over a surprisingly long stretch of DNA zzso these observations suggest that the TE does not act simply as a pause element by fixing the termination zzso
