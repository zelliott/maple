The presence of a zzso protein zzso characterizes the zzso forms of zzso and zzso at zzso zzso junctions which is zzso in the synaptic zzso zzso zzso zzso differing mostly by their signal zzso are zzso by transcripts zzso and zzso which are zzso expressed in slow and fast zzso muscles in zzso Two distinct zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the upstream sequences of human zzso zzso they showed zzso expression and were activated by zzso zzso elements in cultured zzso After in zzso DNA zzso zzso showed strong activity in slow zzso muscle zzso zzso whereas zzso was preferably expressed in fast zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoters suggested that the muscle fiber zzso expression pattern of zzso transcripts were regulated by a slow zzso regulatory element zzso and a fast zzso regulatory element zzso These regulatory elements were responsive to a calcium zzso and to zzso zzso by zzso zzso The slow fiber zzso expression of zzso was abolished by the zzso of an zzso element in zzso Moreover, both the zzso promoters contained zzso element that was responsible for the zzso expression of zzso zzso These results explain the specific expression patterns of zzso zzso in slow and fast muscle zzso
