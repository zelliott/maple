Basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are zzso proteins that recognize zzso and mostly zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso is linked to the folding of its zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso lacking a folded zzso zzso also recognizes the DNA site with zzso taking place on the zzso Here we report the zzso of DNA recognition by unfolded zzso and folded zzso derivatives of zzso using a 19 zzso zzso DNA containing a zzso zzso zzso The rate of DNA binding of both zzso and zzso zzso has a zzso rate constant of 3-5 zzso zzso zzso zzso which is near the diffusion zzso Because the rate of zzso of zzso is slower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the rate of DNA association, the formation of the zzso zzso complex through consecutive binding of two zzso zzso zzso is faster when starting from free zzso Thus, the results presented here support facilitated and rapid target recognition by the zzso zzso zzso However, DNA binding of zzso folded zzso zzso is as rapid as complex formation through the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso pathways are zzso equivalent if zzso and zzso zzso are at zzso zzso the zzso zzso may also have a role under in zzso zzso The lower affinity of zzso in which two DNA zzso zzso have been zzso is due exclusively to the faster zzso of the zzso zzso complex and not to slower complex zzso
