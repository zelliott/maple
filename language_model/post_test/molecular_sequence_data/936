Overlapping mechanisms that function simultaneously in the zzso sorting of zzso membrane proteins often confound zzso of individual sorting zzso By analyzing sorting in the zzso simpler zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate a role for zzso domain zzso length in modulating the zzso segregation of membrane proteins to distinct zzso zzso The dense zzso zzso of the single pass zzso protein zzso could be completely zzso to the zzso and cell surface simply by replacement of its zzso with that from either zzso zzso virus G or the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses suggested that this effect was not caused by any specific sequence motif or strength of membrane association of the zzso zzso Instead, a property imparted by the zzso zzso virus G or LDL zzso zzso both of which are longer than the zzso zzso appeared to be a decisive zzso Indeed, zzso the LDL zzso zzso to a length similar to that of zzso resulted in dense zzso zzso whereas lengthening the zzso zzso resulted in zzso to the zzso From these data, we conclude that although the zzso may not necessarily be a sole zzso in membrane protein zzso its properties can markedly zzso the zzso of more conventional zzso sorting zzso
