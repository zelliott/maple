The point zzso of zzso gene at zzso 12 was investigated in 11 cases of zzso zzso zzso 10 cases of zzso zzso duct zzso 2 cases of zzso zzso duct zzso and 4 cases of zzso zzso by modified zzso zzso chain reaction which employed zzso embedded zzso The results revealed that there were point zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Judging from the ratio of density of wild and zzso band, not all cancer cells in the tissue section contained the zzso So it was suggested that the normal cells were initiated for the zzso transformation by zzso gene zzso and then, selection might occur against cells containing zzso zzso during progression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was markedly useful for detecting zzso even at low frequency among tumor zzso
