The spike protein zzso of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso is responsible for zzso binding and membrane zzso It contains a highly zzso zzso domain that consists of three zzso an zzso zzso domain, a central domain, and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso tail of S has previously been shown to be required for zzso Here, the roles of the zzso and zzso zzso of S in the zzso and membrane fusion activity of zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to measure zzso zzso In addition, the zzso fusion activity of S was monitored by a zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso an S zzso with a zzso tail derived from zzso zzso virus G protein zzso and zzso an S zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso of mouse zzso virus, displayed zzso activity in both zzso zzso a zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was impaired in the zzso and zzso fusion zzso showing 3 to zzso activity compared to the wild type, depending on the zzso and the cells zzso zzso of the zzso state of the zzso S proteins in zzso revealed that zzso zzso were less stable than zzso S zzso possibly explaining the lowered zzso and zzso
