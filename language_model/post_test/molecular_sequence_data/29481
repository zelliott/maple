The zzso of zzso from zzso pneumoniae, an essential membrane protein involved in bacterial cell division, was predicted by zzso methods and zzso by the alkaline zzso fusion and zzso accessibility zzso zzso results were obtained for the seven zzso zzso zzso However, the results from alkaline zzso zzso did not confirm the zzso analysis of the zzso part of zzso whereas the accessibility of introduced zzso zzso was in agreement with the theoretical zzso Based on the combined results, we propose the first zzso model of zzso featuring 10 zzso zzso a large zzso loop, and both N and C zzso located in the zzso
