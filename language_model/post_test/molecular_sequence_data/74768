A subset of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso needed for protein synthesis using both a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a set of two zzso that operate via a separate indirect zzso In the indirect route, zzso zzso is first zzso by zzso zzso zzso and this zzso intermediate is then converted to zzso by zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso Here, we explore the function of all three zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso also features three distinct zzso zzso further indicating the unusual and complex nature of zzso synthesis in this zzso Comparative zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveals that each zzso prefers a distinct zzso zzso or pair of zzso zzso zzso distinguishing the zzso are shown to reside in the zzso core of the zzso Both zzso also require the zzso formation of zzso in the zzso loop for efficient zzso We further report a new, highly sensitive zzso to measure the activity of zzso under zzso zzso With this approach, we demonstrate that zzso functions as a zzso catalyst with kinetic behavior similar to bacterial zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that both zzso routes and all three zzso species in zzso zzso play important roles in the cellular physiology of the zzso
