zzso zzso 5 zzso plays a key role in the development of the zzso nervous system; it zzso a number of targeted proteins involved in zzso migration during development to synaptic activity in the mature nervous zzso Its role in the initial stages of zzso commitment and differentiation of neural stem cells zzso however, is poorly zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso of zzso at zzso is crucial to neural differentiation because 1) zzso is specifically suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso 2) reduced zzso differentiation in zzso compared with zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso whose differentiation is inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso are rescued by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and 4) zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates the neural differentiation of zzso by zzso of zzso at zzso zzso Additional experiments exploring the role of zzso zzso by zzso suggest that together with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso promotes zzso outgrowth as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a modular zzso may regulate the progress of zzso differentiation from cell cycle arrest through zzso zzso zzso and zzso
