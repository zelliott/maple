We have determined the gene structure for the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We found eight zzso zzso that arise from different combinations of a single zzso terminal zzso zzso and three different 3' terminal zzso zzso relative to zzso We analyzed the zzso by zzso of currents through zzso receptors assembled from these zzso zzso and found that, in addition to its well-known zzso effect at high zzso zzso zzso zzso currents at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is observed only with a subset of zzso zzso zzso that show additional differences in pharmacological zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Our results suggest a possible role for zzso as a positive zzso of zzso receptors in certain regions of the zzso
