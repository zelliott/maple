zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to the zzso ammonium zzso zzso as a key step in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso A full-length zzso zzso a protein exhibiting 45 and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, was identified in an zzso zzso zzso cell culture expressed sequence tag data zzso zzso analysis showed that the protein belongs to a unique zzso of zzso that includes zzso zzso the predicated translation products of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and bacterial zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso coli produced a zzso zzso able to convert the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to their corresponding zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and simple zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not accepted as zzso demonstrating the strict specificity of the zzso The apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transcripts and zzso activity were detected in zzso zzso zzso and all mature plant zzso and were induced in cultured zzso zzso cells after treatment with a zzso zzso The zzso was detected in cell cultures of other members of the zzso but not in species of related plant families that do not accumulate zzso and zzso zzso
