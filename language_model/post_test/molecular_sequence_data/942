The zzso zzso zzso which zzso the first committed step in fatty acid zzso is broadly zzso among zzso Its zzso role in formation of fatty acids makes this zzso an attractive target for the design of novel zzso zzso However, no potent zzso have been discovered so zzso This report describes the identification and characterization of highly potent bacterial zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity for the first zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso antibiotics such as zzso B inhibit the zzso coli zzso at zzso zzso zzso B targets the zzso reaction of this zzso with a competitive zzso pattern versus zzso zzso value zzso 5 zzso zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is also demonstrated using zzso expressed zzso from other bacterial species zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso strains of zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which contain zzso within the zzso zzso zzso or zzso We demonstrate that such zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso values zzso of zzso zzso regarding an zzso zzso zzso from rat liver indicate high selectivity of zzso zzso for the bacterial zzso zzso The natural product zzso B and synthetic zzso show zzso zzso zzso The knowledge of the target and the availability of facile zzso using zzso from different pathogens will enable evaluation of the zzso potential of the zzso zzso as a promising zzso compound class acting via a novel mode of zzso
