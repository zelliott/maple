zzso are the most common molecular zzso in steroid zzso zzso zzso We describe the application of multiplex DNA amplification, by zzso chain reaction, for deletion screening in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA from 38 unrelated patients was amplified using two sets of zzso corresponding to the zzso and the 3' ends of the zzso zzso The analysis of the amplified products was always consistent with the results obtained by Southern zzso This method represents a sensitive fast zzso test for detecting zzso gene zzso
