zzso zzso was made by zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso It binds to cells from zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, to cells from certain other zzso whereas the binding to normal zzso is low to zzso It also binds to soluble zzso in culture zzso from zzso zzso zzso recognizes a zzso of zzso zzso with the same zzso zzso acid sequence as the zzso portion of zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso with fusion proteins zzso either the zzso part of zzso zzso reported to be easily zzso off, or a zzso zzso part zzso showed that zzso only binds to zzso A new member of the zzso family was discovered, which has an zzso insert in the zzso part, leading to a zzso of 212 zzso and whose predicted molecular structure indicates that it is zzso To test patient zzso for soluble tumor zzso zzso was isolated from zzso tumor culture zzso via zzso with zzso and used to generate zzso zzso to an zzso different from the one to which zzso zzso after which zzso to two different zzso were used to develop a zzso zzso Using this zzso the level of circulating zzso was elevated significantly in 23 of 30 zzso from patients with zzso zzso as compared with 0 of 68 zzso from healthy controls, 0 of 3 zzso from patients with zzso diseases, and 25 of 75 zzso from patients with other zzso zzso molecules of the zzso family may provide useful new zzso for diagnosis of zzso zzso and/or monitoring its response to zzso
