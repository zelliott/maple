Complete zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso gene zzso zzso starch zzso I zzso were isolated from the rye zzso and zzso The full-length rye zzso zzso DNA and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence has 11 zzso interrupted by 10 zzso The rye zzso gene is zzso with a higher zzso frequency in the coding region, especially in the third position of the zzso zzso regions of the rye zzso gene are more zzso than zzso regions when compared with the zzso sequences of other zzso The mature rye zzso proteins share more than zzso sequence identity with their zzso in wheat and zzso A zzso tree based on sequence comparisons of available plant zzso proteins shows the evolutionary relationship among zzso genes from rye and other plant zzso The identification of the rye zzso gene will enable the manipulation of starch metabolism in rye and zzso
