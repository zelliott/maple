zzso induced deafness has been linked recently to a zzso zzso zzso in the 3' end of the small zzso zzso zzso gene of the human zzso zzso zzso that makes the zzso zzso structurally more similar to its bacterial zzso This zzso DNA zzso was consistently found in families in which the zzso to develop zzso deafness was inherited through the maternal zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso was rarely found in sporadic patients in China, where a significant proportion of the population has been exposed to zzso To further characterize the zzso zzso to zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso gene in 35 Chinese sporadic patients without the zzso zzso zzso Using single stranded zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso analysis, sequencing, and zzso specific zzso zzso we found three out of 35 sporadic patients with unique sequence changes in the zzso zzso zzso Two of the patients had zzso zzso One patient displayed localized zzso around zzso zzso with an absence of the zzso at this position and different populations of zzso DNA with varying numbers of inserted zzso The description of these putative zzso zzso in particular the zzso zzso around zzso zzso provides further support for the important role of the zzso zzso zzso in genetic predisposition to zzso induced zzso zzso
