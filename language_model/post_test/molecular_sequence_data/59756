zzso zzso zzso zzso have previously been used in zzso to generate zzso proteins in which zzso zzso acids are incorporated zzso Although the existing methodology often provides adequate quantities of zzso zzso the suppression efficiencies of some zzso zzso acids are not high enough to yield useful amounts of zzso In an effort to make this useful zzso strategy more general, we report here the results of a search to find alternative zzso as a way of increasing suppression zzso 

Three zzso zzso have been generated by zzso zzso and their ability to deliver zzso zzso acids zzso into proteins has been assessed in an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of their ability to insert both polar and zzso zzso in response to an amber zzso in two proteins suggests that an zzso coli zzso zzso offers a significant improvement in suppression efficiency over other previously used zzso 

Use of an zzso coli zzso zzso may provide substantially higher yields of proteins containing zzso zzso zzso in addition to offering a broader tolerance for polar zzso zzso A comparison of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso or zzso with that derived from zzso supports emerging evidence that the identity of an zzso acid may be important in message zzso
