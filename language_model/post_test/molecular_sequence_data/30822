zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA coding for the zzso gene has been zzso This structure was shown to contain an zzso corresponding to a protein with molecular weight of zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the regulatory part of zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated identity of zzso and zzso boxes for these genes and similarity of the zzso box and the zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso acids sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins revealed a great conservatism in the zzso and in some structural patches zzso and zzso of the zzso proteins predicted by the model of zzso et zzso In contrast, a strong zzso of the zzso (for the last 25 zzso zzso in zzso was zzso A necessity for zzso zzso acids composition of the zzso end is zzso
