A putative zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was identified in a database of expressed sequence tags zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso activity, consistent with the presence of a zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso A complete zzso was obtained for the zzso zzso gene and the predicted zzso acid sequence shared 38% identity with the two zzso zzso from zzso zzso Based on the obvious zzso the zzso zzso protein was designated zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted zzso signal zzso and an estimated mature molecular mass of zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso locus revealed that the gene exists as a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso unlike the multiple gene copies that have been observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein demonstrated that it is soluble and zzso into the culture medium by zzso zzso Surprisingly, indirect zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression characteristics that are comparable with the zzso protein zzso The absence of zzso during much of zzso implies that this protein does not serve a function during zzso growth and development of zzso zzso zzso Instead, zzso may play a role in events that occur during or zzso to zzso zzso from and/or invasion into zzso
