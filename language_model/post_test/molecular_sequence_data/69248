The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso and contains two zzso regions separated by two repetitive zzso The larger repetitive region contains three complete and one truncated copy of a zzso zzso Each zzso contains the zzso zzso which is very similar to the promoter sequences found in repeated elements in the zzso of other zzso The 3' zzso region, which separates the repeat elements containing the putative zzso promoter sites from the zzso coding region, is large zzso zzso compared to those described for other zzso A putative zzso start point zzso has been identified zzso zzso upstream from the zzso coding region, suggesting that the external transcribed zzso is also large compared to that in other zzso The 3' zzso region contains two zzso tracts of 18 and 20 zzso Such zzso which are capable of forming zzso in zzso have been found upstream from the zzso units of zzso and zzso genes in human, mouse and zzso and are thought to have a functional role in gene zzso
