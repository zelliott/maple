zzso zzso channels are important for regulation of the normal rhythm of the zzso zzso activity of zzso channels causes long zzso syndrome type 2, a disorder that increases the risk of cardiac zzso and sudden cardiac zzso zzso channels are members of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, they also share many similarities with the zzso zzso gated zzso channel family, including having a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, however, are not directly regulated by zzso zzso Recently, crystal structures of the zzso domain from zzso and zzso channels, both members of the zzso family of zzso zzso channels, revealed that a zzso zzso in the zzso domain occupied the putative zzso zzso site thereby zzso binding of zzso zzso Here we show that zzso to zzso in the zzso affect the stability of the open state relative to the closed state of zzso zzso We also show that zzso the structure of the zzso reduces the stability of the zzso state relative to the open zzso Clinical zzso located in this zzso result in reduced trafficking efficiency, which suggests that binding of the zzso zzso to the putative zzso zzso pocket is also important for assembly and trafficking of zzso zzso
