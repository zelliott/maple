We proposed a strategy zzso zzso in which zzso peptides for zzso major zzso complex zzso class II molecules are introduced into a zzso component to render the zzso hybrid peptides bound to the zzso and thus zzso in animals carrying the relevant zzso It was shown that zzso zzso which was prepared by introducing zzso zzso of influenza virus into the zzso binding component induced significant T cell responses and zzso zzso specific for zzso in zzso zzso Further we found that the zzso binding component had a zzso for human class II molecules zzso zzso In the present study, a new zzso zzso zzso was prepared by combining zzso as a carrier and zzso attached to the C zzso of zzso as a zzso and the effect of vaccine was examined in zzso mice which carry zzso alone as zzso class II molecules and thus may be regarded as a model of the zzso positive zzso Since zzso zzso induced merely zzso against zzso it was assumed that zzso induced mainly zzso specific zzso in zzso mice without zzso zzso production against the zzso Indeed, zzso zzso T cell responses and induced zzso specific zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, administration of zzso inhibited growth of influenza virus until 9 weeks after the last zzso in zzso zzso
