We have designed and zzso a linear zzso analogue of zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso for the more usual zzso at position zzso zzso of zzso at the N zzso zzso group with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso characterization of these peptides revealed that all were zzso zzso zzso zzso can simultaneously bind to both the rat liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using this strategy, we were able to study the distribution of zzso receptors on the surface of the rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso image analysis were used to observe the distribution of zzso associated with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a useful precursor for the production of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso can be used selectively to probe the zzso zzso and will be versatile tools for a variety of zzso applications, including zzso zzso and zzso
