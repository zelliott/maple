In the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is spliced in trans from three separate precursors which assemble to form two group II zzso A fourth transcript, zzso completes the structure of the first zzso Of the zzso zzso factors involved in zzso zzso only two are required for zzso of both zzso We cloned and characterized the first of these more general factors, zzso zzso with its role in zzso zzso zzso is imported in the zzso where it is found in a membrane fraction and is part of a large zzso zzso One zzso zzso is defective for zzso of both zzso but another zzso zzso zzso still expresses the 3' part of the zzso gene and is deficient only in zzso of zzso zzso This observation and a deletion analysis indicate the presence of two zzso in zzso The zzso domain is necessary and sufficient for processing of zzso zzso and zzso of the first zzso while the central domain is essential for zzso of the second zzso The combination of these two functional zzso in zzso suggests that this new factor may coordinate zzso of the two zzso to improve the efficiency of zzso zzso
