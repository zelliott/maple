zzso zzso Type D, a zzso agent of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in other domestic animals, produces an zzso zzso capsule that is a putative zzso zzso It was reported previously that the capsule was removed by treating microbes with zzso zzso zzso We zzso cloned a zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso from zzso and zzso Other structurally related sugar zzso did not zzso zzso activity was zzso about zzso by the addition of an zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of approximately zzso sugar zzso were produced in zzso The zzso was sensitive to the action of zzso zzso III but resistant to zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso is not very similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2, or to other zzso zzso zzso that produce zzso or zzso The zzso zzso is the first microbial zzso zzso to be described that forms a zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso requires at least two separate zzso zzso and zzso to catalyze the same zzso zzso
