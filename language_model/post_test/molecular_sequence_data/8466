zzso active DNA zzso of zzso zzso were used to investigate metal zzso interaction with zzso structures lacking the zzso zzso of zzso to the 76 zzso zzso monitored by circular zzso zzso increased base stacking and thus the zzso stability of the zzso zzso binding was dependent on a zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso decreased base stacking zzso thereby zzso the zzso Since zzso in the zzso region contributed to most of the spectral changes observed, detailed studies were conducted with zzso hairpin zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the presence of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso differed significantly from that of the biologically active structure resulting from interaction with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the transition metals were sufficient to zzso the zzso structure without catalyzing zzso of the zzso In the absence of zzso and at zzso to zzso ratios of approximately zzso zzso formed a stable zzso with one zzso bound with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso altered the DNA zzso without discriminating between modified and unmodified zzso This ability of transition metals to disrupt higher order DNA structures, and possibly zzso at zzso zzso in zzso demonstrates that these structures are potential targets in chronic metal exposure, in zzso
