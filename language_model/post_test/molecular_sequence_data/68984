The zzso A crystal structure of activated rod zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso shows the bound zzso gamma S zzso zzso deep in a zzso between a domain structurally zzso to small zzso and a zzso domain unique to zzso G zzso The structure, when combined with zzso and genetic studies, zzso how an activated zzso might open this zzso to allow zzso zzso a mechanism for zzso changes in zzso and zzso binding zzso and a mechanism for zzso activity not evident from previous zzso
