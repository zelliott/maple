As an initial approach in the study of the mechanism of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso and in order to use this zzso as an zzso carrier we previously constructed a fusion between the complete zzso toxin zzso and the mature B zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the resulting zzso hybrid was not zzso to the zzso environment, and cells expressing the hybrid zzso at temperatures above 35 degrees zzso In this work we have established that the hybrid is initially detected as zzso and converted to zzso which lacks the 19 zzso acids that share the properties of a signal zzso the zzso 17 zzso zzso of zzso defined the processing site of zzso at zzso decreases zzso This process was sensitive to an energy zzso zzso and was correlated with zzso of zzso across the inner zzso Additionally, we are able to show that although zzso is processed at 37 degrees C and 29 degrees C, it is more efficiently processed at the latter zzso At 37 degrees C, zzso was poorly released into the zzso resulting in zzso of this zzso zzso and zzso in the inner zzso and in cell zzso In contrast, at 29 degrees C zzso was localized in the zzso and in the inner zzso and zzso and zzso did not zzso however, zzso of zzso zzso across the outer membrane still did not occur, and a second processing step that would eliminate the pro segment from zzso was never zzso Thus, the fusion of zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso that, while incompatible with zzso to the zzso zzso is exported to the zzso in a zzso zzso This latter observation is consistent with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is first processed to zzso zzso by the removal of a zzso signal zzso
