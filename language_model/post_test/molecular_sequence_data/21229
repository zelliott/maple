zzso is a key zzso involved in DNA zzso break repair by zzso zzso Here, we show that in response to DNA damage, budding zzso zzso is zzso on zzso 192 in a manner that is primarily zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso We show that mutating zzso zzso 192 to Ala or zzso zzso hypersensitivity to DNA damage and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analyses indicate that zzso 192 is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso whereas zzso of zzso 192 does not interfere with zzso zzso zzso These data suggest a model in which zzso zzso of zzso zzso 192 in response to DNA damage controls zzso activity and DNA repair by zzso zzso
