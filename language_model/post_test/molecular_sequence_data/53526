zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an enrichment on zzso zzso with zzso zzso The cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter and stained zzso The zzso zzso used included zzso zzso methanol and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or a combination of these zzso When cells grown on zzso were transferred to zzso or methanol and vice versa, a lag phase was zzso The same lag phase occurred when cells grown on zzso were transferred to methanol and vice versa, indicating that for each zzso different zzso were zzso zzso growth occurred within a temperature range of zzso degrees C and a pH of zzso Both zzso and zzso were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The cells exhibited specific growth rates zzso of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso methanol and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso was zzso closely related to members of the zzso zzso but clearly differed from all described species of this zzso zzso sequence zzso
