zzso and zzso characterization was performed for 14 strains of bacteria that produce zzso antibiotics zzso zzso by strain zzso and one strain that produces zzso substances zzso zzso isolated from marine algae and zzso collected from coastal areas of tropical Pacific islands and a zzso island of zzso All 15 zzso were zzso strictly zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene showed that the zzso occupied positions in the zzso radiation of the zzso zzso with similarities of zzso zzso The cells possessed a clearly discernible zzso cell cycle in association with the growth zzso cells were rods during the growth phase and all converted to zzso cells when proliferation zzso The zzso cells were zzso denser than the rod cells and were viable for extended zzso They were considered to constitute a resting zzso The type strains of described species of zzso were also found to possess identical zzso cell zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso system was zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso and the zzso acids comprised zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso The polar lipids comprised zzso zzso and zzso The group of 14 zzso strains and strain zzso each constituted a single zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso characteristics and zzso zzso the zzso represent two novel species in the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
