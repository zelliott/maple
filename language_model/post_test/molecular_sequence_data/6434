We describe a novel reporter zzso the zzso surface zzso zzso useful for zzso and detection of zzso zzso by flow zzso A zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene was isolated, and cell surface expression of its gene product was zzso The zzso zzso was tested as a cell surface reporter zzso in the context of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso and the zzso zzso genes express zzso zzso on their zzso The zzso marker is potentially useful in gene transfer protocols because selection of zzso cells can be achieved by zzso with zzso zzso shortly after infection with the zzso zzso In addition, a human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso expressing zzso is zzso which is zzso and zzso in human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and immortalized zzso cell zzso zzso infected with this zzso zzso express zzso on their surfaces and can be detected and zzso by zzso cell sorting zzso Because of these properties, zzso expressing this genetic marker can be useful for studies in gene therapy and of the zzso zzso
