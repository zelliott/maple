Four zzso zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B zzso and zzso and zzso have been isolated from coffee plants but have zzso zzso zzso These zzso and 10 of their zzso prepared by chemical synthesis were tested against nine strains of zzso zzso and zzso were specific for the zzso zzso zzso with a minimum zzso concentration of approximately zzso zzso They were relatively ineffective against zzso bacteria such as zzso coli and zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso were active against both zzso and zzso zzso In particular, zzso showed potent activity against zzso coli with a minimum zzso concentration of zzso zzso All four zzso peptides were moderately active against two strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but were inactive against zzso zzso These zzso are zzso and zzso human red blood cell with a lethal dose 50% of 400 zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso with a zzso zzso significantly reduced its activity against zzso zzso whereas blocking the zzso in zzso produced no significant zzso The zzso zzso and their scrambled zzso zzso exhibited zzso profiles and potency similar to their native zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso few of these zzso zzso natives or zzso retained zzso zzso These results show that the zzso peptides possess specific and potent zzso activity that is zzso and that their initial interactions with the microbial surfaces may be zzso an effect commonly found in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, their zzso zzso structure with a zzso motif represents a molecular structure of zzso and may provide a useful template for the design of novel zzso zzso
