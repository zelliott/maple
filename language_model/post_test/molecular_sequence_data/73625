zzso an zzso zzso zzso mapping to mouse zzso 7, was recently found to be the result of a zzso zzso in a novel gene with unknown zzso Database searches revealed that sequences corresponding to the C zzso of the tub protein were highly zzso across a number of species including humans, mice, zzso zzso zzso rice, and zzso and that tub was a member of a gene zzso We describe here, zzso the human zzso of mouse tub, and two newly characterized family members, zzso for zzso like protein 1 and zzso These three family members, which differ in the zzso half of the zzso share zzso zzso acid identity across their zzso zzso region and have distinct tissue expression zzso zzso spliced transcripts with zzso variable zzso three of which have been identified for the zzso zzso may mediate tissue specific zzso We also report that zzso zzso and zzso map to human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso map within the minimal intervals identified for zzso zzso 14 on zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in the zzso make excellent candidates for these zzso diseases as a zzso within the tub gene is known to lead to early progressive retinal zzso
