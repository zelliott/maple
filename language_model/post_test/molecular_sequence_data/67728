The plant zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is widely known as a key regulator of plant response to various zzso processes including zzso and zzso regulation of global zzso and control of cell cycle, development, as well as zzso stress, less is known about the function of zzso during pathogen zzso Our previous work has demonstrated that a tomato zzso zzso zzso can interact with and zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso by tomato yellow leaf zzso China zzso Our results also showed that the plant zzso can affect zzso infection in plant and reduce viral DNA zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso impacts its function as a zzso zzso Here we provide more information on interaction between zzso and zzso and propose a zzso model for the zzso defense responses against zzso and the potential role of zzso in plant resistance to zzso
