A major supply of energy in the rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso is from the zzso zzso We have isolated the zzso and zzso clones of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso obtained by reverse translation of zzso zzso sequences derived from zzso of other organisms, were used to prime zzso on zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is interrupted by a single zzso which divides the coding region into two zzso The coding region encodes a protein of 248 zzso acids which is of the same size as zzso from other organisms and shares zzso zzso with other known zzso zzso On comparison with human zzso the zzso domain was found to be highly zzso while significant variations occurred at the other regions in the protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned into the expression zzso zzso and zzso as an zzso protein in zzso zzso The zzso protein was shown to be zzso zzso
