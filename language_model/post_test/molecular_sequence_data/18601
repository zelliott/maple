The advent of inexpensive zzso technologies and other deep sequencing technologies for zzso has the promise to radically improve zzso zzso providing information on transcribed regions and zzso events in a variety of cellular zzso Using zzso zzso many of these events can be confirmed directly at the protein zzso However, the integration of large amounts of redundant zzso data and mass zzso data poses a challenging zzso Our paper addresses this by construction of a compact database that contains all useful information expressed in zzso zzso zzso our method to cumulative zzso zzso data reduced zzso zzso of aligned zzso SAM files to 410 zzso of zzso graph database written in zzso zzso This zzso to zzso zzso of data size, without loss of zzso We performed a zzso study using the custom data set, using a completely automated pipeline, and identified a total of zzso novel events, including 215 novel zzso zzso novel zzso 12 alternative zzso zzso zzso corrections, 245 zzso changes, zzso frame shifts, zzso reverse zzso and 42 translated zzso Our results highlight the usefulness of transcript + zzso integration for improved zzso zzso
