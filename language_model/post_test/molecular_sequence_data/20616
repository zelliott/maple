The genes required for zzso zzso by zzso zzso strain zzso are clustered in two divergent and closely linked zzso zzso a zzso regulator, activates zzso from each zzso in response to zzso The regulatory zzso gene is zzso with the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso resulting in positive zzso zzso binds with different affinity to two primary binding sites, designated B and C, in the intervening region between the two zzso and makes additional contact with secondary sites that extend towards the zzso In addition, zzso may interact with itself when bound to each site via the formation of a DNA loop, as evidenced by the distortion of the DNA between the primary binding sites and the elimination of the zzso complexes following the introduction of a zzso of the DNA zzso between the primary binding zzso zzso from each promoter is not fully independent since zzso in each binding site affected zzso from both zzso Based on these results, we propose a model of zzso zzso that involves the formation of a complex structure by interactions between zzso molecules bound to distant binding sites and zzso zzso from one promoter to the detriment of the zzso
