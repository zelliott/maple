zzso by the protein zzso the zzso zzso system plays a role in the regulation of activity of other sugar transport systems in zzso zzso By using a direct binding zzso a collection of zzso replacement zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso were evaluated for their capacity to bind zzso zzso zzso replacements in zzso zzso or zzso result in loss of binding zzso Analysis of the zzso results together with multiple sequence alignments of a family of proteins that interacts with zzso provides the basis for developing two regions of consensus sequence in those partner proteins necessary for binding to zzso The requirement for two interaction regions is interpreted in the regulatory framework of a zzso zzso change that brings those two regions into an orientation optimal for binding zzso
