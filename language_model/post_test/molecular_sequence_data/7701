Part of a zzso DNA zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso (65 zzso of an alkaline zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 105 zzso was spontaneously deleted during zzso of the zzso The remaining zzso insert of the deleted zzso zzso zzso acids from zzso to zzso of the zzso However, zzso coli zzso cells harboring this zzso produced an active zzso After addition of a termination zzso zzso immediately downstream of the zzso for zzso the zzso zzso was inserted into an expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso zzso for zzso production of the truncated zzso The zzso was then zzso to zzso from a culture of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso showed that the zzso consisted of 7 zzso acid zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso by the truncated zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was very active against zzso and its pH and temperature profiles were almost identical to those of the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso
