Two zzso zzso with specificity for rat zzso T cell zzso zzso were zzso One, called zzso zzso with all zzso zzso zzso rat zzso and thus recognizes a constant zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso et zzso Journal of zzso 1994, zzso zzso The other, called zzso zzso with approximately zzso of zzso T cells in peripheral zzso zzso In rat zzso zzso but not zzso detects a dense network of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso indicated that zzso and zzso are the zzso if not exclusive zzso V transcripts present at this zzso zzso analysis of zzso clones obtained by reverse zzso with zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the variable zzso of rat zzso gamma and delta chains are very zzso to those described in mice zzso and zzso identity at the protein zzso The complete conservation between the two species of the zzso acid sequences at the zzso transitions of this zzso zzso indicates that the interaction of the zzso zzso with its as yet unknown zzso must be of central importance for zzso zzso
