Until recently, the function of the fifth domain of the zzso modular zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso A putative zzso to this domain was however identified in a zzso zzso from the same zzso which raised questions regarding a common zzso An extensive search of all accessible zzso as well as the partially zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso of this domain were zzso by multiple genes in zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, the domain occurred invariably at the zzso of proteins that were predominantly zzso zzso A primary structure motif of three zzso regions including structurally important zzso and a zzso was also identified suggesting a zzso zzso zzso This zzso evidence suggested a possible role of this domain in zzso cell zzso To confirm this theory, zzso zzso was grown, and activity zzso showed that the major part of the zzso activity was connected to whole zzso Moreover, zzso detection using a zzso zzso proved presence of zzso on the zzso zzso cell zzso In the light of this, a revision of experimental data present on both zzso and zzso was performed, and the results all indicate a zzso role of the domain, suggesting that this domain represents a novel type of module that mediates cell attachment in proteins originating from members of the zzso zzso
