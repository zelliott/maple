A new design of zzso zzso zzso displaying high zzso activity and zzso stability is zzso These zzso structures consist of two partially complementary zzso capable of assembling into the zzso structure without zzso II on binding to the zzso zzso A series of these zzso zzso targeting the translation initiation region of multiple drug resistance gene zzso zzso was zzso and assessed in terms of zzso activity under single and multiple reaction turnover zzso zzso zzso resistance of the zzso zzso was achieved by incorporation of zzso zzso at selected positions, along with addition of a zzso zzso zzso The new zzso zzso exhibit higher zzso zzso activity than their full-length zzso because of faster zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, an excess of one of the zzso strands provides the possibility to unfold structured regions of the target zzso and facilitate productive complex zzso
