zzso zzso based on primary zzso acid sequence zzso reflects the evolutionary process and therefore provides a guide to structure, mechanism and zzso Any two proteins that are related by common descent are expected to exhibit similar structures and functions to a degree zzso to the degree of their sequence zzso but two independently evolving proteins should zzso This principle provides the impetus to define protein zzso relationships and zzso families when zzso In this zzso we zzso the zzso approaches and criteria we use to establish common evolutionary zzso We apply these tools to define distant zzso relationships between several previously recognized transport protein zzso In some cases, available structural and functional data are evaluated in order to substantiate our claim that molecular zzso provides a reliable guide to protein structure and zzso
