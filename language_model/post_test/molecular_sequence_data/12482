zzso zzso zzso is seen when certain zzso insect populations are zzso Two hypotheses might explain this zzso zzso with mutually incompatible strains of zzso producing zzso when crossed to individuals infected with only a single bacterial strain or, zzso a bacterial dosage model, with differences in zzso zzso responsible for the zzso A quantitative zzso zzso was set up as a general method to compare zzso zzso between zzso Using this zzso in zzso incompatible stocks of the zzso Aedes zzso we have determined that zzso are significantly higher in Houston than in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is consistent with a dosage model for the observed crossing patterns, but does not rule out the possibility that zzso is the primary cause of the zzso
