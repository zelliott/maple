A computer-based screen of the zzso zzso zzso identified zzso as a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were increased significantly during growth on fatty zzso suggesting that it may play a role in fatty acid zzso The zzso product is highly similar to zzso a bacterial zzso zzso and carries a zzso zzso zzso that closely resembles the consensus sequence for zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso directed green zzso protein to zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso is an abundant component of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene caused a significant decrease in total cellular zzso activity, and zzso zzso was found to exhibit intrinsic zzso zzso activity of 6 zzso zzso also shared significant sequence similarity with zzso a human zzso that was previously identified because of its interaction with human zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso is also a zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso activity is a zzso feature of zzso We propose that zzso and zzso be renamed as zzso and human zzso to reflect the fact that they zzso zzso zzso The physical segregation of zzso and human zzso from the zzso fatty acid zzso suggests that these zzso are unlikely to play a role in formation of fatty zzso Instead, the observation that zzso contributes to growth on fatty acids implicates this zzso in fatty acid zzso
