There are currently no nonhuman zzso models with fully defined major zzso complex zzso class II zzso We recently showed that six common zzso zzso account for essentially all zzso diversity in zzso zzso zzso zzso from the island of zzso In this study, we employ complementary DNA cloning and sequencing to zzso characterize full length zzso class II zzso expressed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the six common zzso We describe 34 full-length zzso class II zzso 12 of which are completely zzso zzso was evident at all six zzso including zzso a locus thought to be zzso in zzso zzso Similar to other Old World zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso share zzso class II zzso lineages with humans at the zzso and DR zzso but not at the zzso zzso Additionally, we identified extensive sharing of zzso class II zzso between zzso and other nonhuman zzso The characterization of these zzso zzso class II zzso will enable researchers to generate zzso class II zzso cell lines, zzso and other molecular zzso that can be used to explore zzso T zzso responses in zzso
