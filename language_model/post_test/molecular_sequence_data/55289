zzso acid sequence variations have possible influences on the zzso of zzso and may be important factors in zzso zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the sequence zzso of group 1 and 2 zzso from Korean zzso of the house dust zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso group 1 and 2 zzso were amplified by zzso and compared the deduced zzso acid zzso zzso f zzso which appeared in zzso % of the 50 sequences zzso was found to be zzso Among the zzso p 1 zzso zzso p zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso f 2 zzso zzso f zzso zzso zzso and a new zzso with zzso at position 42 zzso zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of 60 zzso p 2 clones were zzso and 28 zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso Interestingly, all of the zzso p 2 sequences had zzso instead of zzso at position zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be the most zzso forms of zzso p zzso zzso p 1 has a high rate of sporadic zzso and the group 2 zzso show a more regular pattern with orderly associations of zzso acid zzso zzso f 1 and zzso p 2 from Korean zzso zzso have unique zzso acid sequence zzso These findings provide important data for house dust zzso zzso zzso
