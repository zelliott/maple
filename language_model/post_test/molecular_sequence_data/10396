zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has two consecutive cell zzso genes zzso zzso et zzso zzso In the present study, functional and structural properties of the zzso protein zzso were characterized in zzso zzso zzso microscopic examinations showed that zzso under zzso in zzso coli zzso injured the inner membrane to yield empty ghost cells with the bulk of the cell wall zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso genes under zzso were zzso although the amount of zzso transcript was larger than that of zzso zzso via an apparently zzso zzso just downstream of zzso However, deletion and/or fusion experiments suggested that: zzso the zzso half of zzso zzso zzso composed of three putative zzso zzso may be responsible for interaction with zzso zzso the zzso end (five zzso zzso seems zzso and zzso the zzso half containing charged zzso acids appears to be involved in proper zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, but divergent in several properties from zzso zzso
