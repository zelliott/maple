The zzso repeat number in the zzso disease zzso gene accounts for about 50% of the variation seen in age at onset of zzso In order to determine whether promoter sequence variation can contribute to the residual variation in age at zzso we studied the zzso zzso zzso region upstream of the zzso translation start site in the HD gene in a population of 56 control East zzso 30 zzso 34 Japanese, and 208 English zzso disease zzso A surprisingly high degree of variation was zzso Seven zzso were identified, zzso four zzso two single base pair zzso a 6 zzso zzso present as one or two copies, and a 20 zzso zzso with one to three copies of the tandem zzso No correlation between zzso and age at onset of symptoms was found in HD zzso The 6 zzso and 20 zzso stretches are present only in single copies in the chimpanzees and gorilla, suggesting that these zzso have evolved by zzso of the core sequences in the human zzso
