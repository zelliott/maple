Aquatic larvae of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso silk protein zzso with the zzso motif zzso (where X is any zzso every zzso zzso We report here the cloning and full-length sequence of zzso zzso zzso silk proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences reveal proteins of nearly identical mass composed of 72 blocks of zzso zzso zzso of which can be described by the motif zzso zzso arrangement of these zzso is preserved more than surrounding zzso zzso clones enabled us to map the genes on zzso zzso and identify for the first time the zzso of the zzso zzso ring 3 locus in zzso zzso The apparent molecular weight difference between these proteins zzso vs 220 zzso is not attributable to primary structure and may be due to differential zzso zzso DNA distances and zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes are more related to each other than either is to zzso zzso however, substitution rates for the zzso and zzso of these genes are zzso zzso sequence comparisons suggest zzso variation in that some regions evolved slower or faster than the mean and may have been subjected to different selective zzso
