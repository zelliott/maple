A comparison of the zzso and human zzso zzso reveals nine regions of zzso zzso and zzso DNA that exhibit greater than zzso sequence zzso A large fraction (over zzso of the zzso locus is contained in these zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso which may be required for zzso the proper zzso regulation of this zzso Comparative sequence analyses involving zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been performed for only a small number of zzso zzso The available data and the results presented here suggest that zzso may emerge as common yet important functional components of zzso a hypothesis with significant implications for characterizing genes involved in human zzso
