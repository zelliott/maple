To identify zzso motifs associated with the formation of an zzso zzso we systematically evaluated the zzso activity of synthetic peptides with sequence of predicted zzso segments of the zzso calcium zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso calcium channels suggests the presence in each of four zzso repeats zzso of six segments zzso predicted to form zzso zzso zzso Only peptides representing zzso segments zzso or zzso form channels in zzso zzso To generate a functional calcium channel based on a zzso bundle zzso zzso bundle proteins representing zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso Both proteins form zzso channels, but with distinct zzso the single-channel zzso in 50 zzso zzso is 3 zzso and 10 zzso For zzso the zzso zzso with increasing concentration of zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso does not zzso up to 150 zzso zzso Whereas zzso is blocked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso is not blocked by zzso zzso Only zzso is modulated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating sequence requirement for specific drug zzso Thus, only zzso exhibits pore properties characteristic also of authentic calcium zzso The designed functional calcium channel may provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of zzso zzso and drug action, information that may in turn further our understanding of molecular zzso underlying authentic pore zzso
