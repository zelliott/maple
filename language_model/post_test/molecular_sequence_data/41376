In bacteria, the sodium zzso zzso cycle plays a critical role in negotiating the challenges of an extremely alkaline and zzso zzso zzso bacteria that grow zzso at high pH values use zzso for zzso zzso and zzso rotation because the zzso zzso motive force is insufficient for use at extremely alkaline zzso Only three types of zzso driven rotary zzso exist in zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the bacterial zzso zzso Until now, only zzso and zzso have been reported as zzso zzso for these zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1934 can grow not only under a zzso and zzso zzso zzso condition but also under the opposite condition in an extremely alkaline zzso In this zzso swimming performance depends on zzso of zzso zzso or zzso In the absence of zzso swimming behavior is clearly zzso zzso This pattern was confirmed in swimming zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso expressing zzso from zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a single zzso in zzso was identified that converted the naturally zzso zzso to zzso that cannot use zzso or zzso This is the first report that describes a zzso motor that can use zzso and zzso as zzso zzso The finding will affect the understanding of the operating principles of zzso zzso and the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso the field of the evolution of environmental changes and zzso and areas of zzso
