In zzso muscle tissue of elderly humans small amounts of point zzso in zzso genes of zzso DNA zzso were identified by point zzso zzso These zzso were not found in zzso samples from zzso While the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso previously identified in patients with zzso and zzso respectively, were found in most elderly people, the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified in patients with zzso and zzso respectively, were found only in two of 15 tissue samples from different zzso The data suggest that some zzso of zzso represent zzso zzso for zzso zzso which contribute to human zzso
