Petroleum products spill and leakage have become two major environmental challenges in zzso zzso was performed in the petroleum zzso waste water of Tehran and zzso zzso of zzso zzso degrading bacteria were isolated by enrichment in a zzso zzso with zzso as sole source of carbon and zzso The isolated strains were identified by amplification of zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso were used for identification of zzso zzso zzso Fifteen zzso degrading bacteria were isolated and 8 strains were selected as powerful zzso zzso These 8 strains relate to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The optimum concentration of zzso that allowed high growth was zzso Gas zzso results show that all strains can degrade approximately half of zzso in one week of zzso All of the strains have zzso zzso gene which are important for zzso As a result, this study indicates that there is a high diversity of zzso bacteria in petroleum zzso waste water in zzso
