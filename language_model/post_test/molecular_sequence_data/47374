zzso zzso zzso has been shown to produce a single zzso batch zzso Moreover, other cryptic zzso were also detected when the cells were grown in continuous zzso In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of one of the cryptic zzso in zzso This cryptic zzso zzso designated zzso was expressed zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso had a relative molecular weight of zzso and existed predominantly as a zzso The zzso had a relative molecular weight of zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso being active towards the zzso of zzso acid zzso The structural zzso zzso was isolated on a zzso zzso zzso This zzso contains a functional promoter, because expression of zzso in zzso coli is orientation zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso was determined and zzso An open reading frame of 840 zzso zzso a putative zzso of 280 zzso acids was zzso This zzso closely with the size of the zzso The zzso sequence of zzso did not show any zzso with those of other zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid zzso however, shows significant zzso ranging from 42 to zzso with the zzso acid sequences of many other zzso zzso is unusual in having a long leader zzso a property of zzso zzso
