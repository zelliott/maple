The solution structure of the zzso zzso from the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso strain zzso has been determined using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso of solution zzso for the trans form of this zzso zzso bridged zzso have been generated using a simulated zzso procedure in conjunction with distance and zzso angle restraints derived from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso solution structures of the zzso zzso with those previously determined for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso strain peptides zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso Campbell, zzso et zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso reveals the common structural motif of a zzso which may be the necessary structural requirement for recognition of a common cell surface zzso and a common zzso zzso to which all four strains zzso The importance of this zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides is discussed with regard to the design of a synthetic zzso vaccine effective against multiple strains of zzso zzso zzso
