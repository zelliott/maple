Three of five genes coding for zzso small nuclear zzso zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso were shown to be expressed during early zzso by zzso into sea zzso eggs followed by zzso Both in zzso and in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso a minimal promoter of 80 zzso of zzso zzso sequence is essential for their zzso zzso upstream of position zzso enhance zzso in zzso but not in zzso approximately zzso In zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and is directed by zzso zzso zzso zzso binding studies and zzso zzso demonstrate the presence of multiple proteins interacting with sequences between zzso and zzso which are essential for selection of the correct initiation site and for efficient in zzso zzso Three of these factors recognize a zzso regulatory element between positions zzso and zzso suggesting a role for zzso proteins in the initiation of sea zzso zzso zzso zzso
