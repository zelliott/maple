zzso protein zzso zzso have a zzso groove that interacts with linear zzso motifs in binding zzso To determine the structural basis of binding specificity between zzso and zzso zzso we zzso analyzed the ability of 15 zzso motifs from diverse zzso partners to bind to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso Classical zzso motifs zzso highly specific binding only to zzso and only those motifs with a sequence pattern distinct from the classical zzso binding zzso motif consensus differentiated between the zzso similar zzso grooves of zzso and zzso Crystal structures of four complexes of zzso with zzso zzso representing zzso zzso or zzso and zzso binding zzso revealed that the regions located between consensus positions in the zzso motifs showed zzso zzso Although the consensus positions in the zzso motifs served as anchor points that bound to common zzso surface features and mostly contributed to zzso in a zzso fashion, the zzso of the intervening region between the anchor points mostly determined zzso We designed peptides with tailored zzso binding profiles by rationally changing the length and zzso acid composition of intervening regions located between anchor zzso These results suggest a coherent structural model for zzso zzso specificity that reveals how short linear motifs binding to a common zzso zzso groove can mediate diverse interaction patterns and contribute to correct zzso partner selection in signaling zzso
