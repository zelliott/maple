The prevalence of low birth weight zzso is increased in subjects born after assisted reproduction technology zzso and defective zzso has frequently been identified in patients with zzso and zzso syndromes conceived by zzso Thus, we examined zzso pattern in a girl born after ART who had zzso syndrome zzso which can be caused by maternal zzso zzso for zzso 7 and by zzso of the zzso zzso region zzso of zzso 

We examined zzso status of 31 zzso at the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso on zzso and 23 zzso at the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso on zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

Eight of the 31 zzso in the patient and four of the 31 zzso in the father were zzso in the zzso In the zzso no abnormal zzso pattern was identified in the zzso 

The results suggest that zzso of zzso expressed genes including zzso which usually have zzso effects, may be relevant to zzso in subjects conceived by zzso
