A simplified method of DNA sequencing by zzso chain termination is developed that approaches a zzso zzso zzso the sequencing advantages contributed by a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso stable sequencing reaction concentrates have been obtained that readily perform the entire sequencing reaction simply by adding prepared DNA to each of the four reaction concentrates required by this zzso The mechanics and dynamics of these reactions have been investigated and the capacity of these reactions to withstand normal user variation is zzso This study focuses on one form of this simplified method embodied in the zzso DNA sequencing zzso
