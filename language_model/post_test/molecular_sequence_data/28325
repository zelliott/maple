Two zzso zzso genes were isolated based upon their zzso rescue of a zzso zzso of the gene zzso which encodes a protein zzso involved in control of cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso closely related proteins that also share zzso with zzso zzso characterized by a dramatic zzso of abundance through the cell cycle, are thought to be involved in zzso induction in animal zzso A dominant zzso in the zzso zzso zzso advances the zzso to zzso transition in cycling cells and zzso the ability of cells to arrest in zzso phase in response to external signals, suggesting that the zzso protein is involved in zzso control of the cell cycle in zzso
