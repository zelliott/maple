zzso of the barrier properties of the zzso tight junction is believed to be important in the zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso coli zzso This zzso can be measured in zzso as the ability of zzso to reduce zzso resistance zzso across zzso zzso and requires the products of the locus of zzso zzso zzso and, in particular, the type III zzso zzso protein zzso We report a second zzso gene that is also necessary for zzso to fully reduce zzso zzso is not necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso or formation of attaching and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso have a diminished zzso zzso reduced zzso levels of zzso and a reduced ability to zzso zzso into zzso zzso The product of zzso is a zzso zzso protein rich in zzso that specifically interacts with zzso but not with zzso or other zzso zzso zzso These properties are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso encodes a type III zzso zzso for zzso and we zzso this protein zzso the zzso for zzso zzso protein zzso
