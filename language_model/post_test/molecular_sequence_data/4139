In order to study some of its zzso properties, zzso zzso 1 zzso from the plant zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, a host naturally devoid of zzso zzso In the context of the bacterial membrane and in addition to de zzso zzso the plant zzso is capable of zzso the exchange of the zzso polar head for another zzso Our data clearly show that the zzso exchange reaction can occur using zzso zzso molecular species or zzso molecular species from soybean added zzso Exchange has been observed in the absence of zzso zzso zzso but is greatly enhanced in the presence of 4 zzso zzso Our data also show that zzso zzso the removal of the polar head in the presence of much higher zzso of zzso in a manner that suggests a reverse of zzso All of the zzso zzso activities require free zzso zzso zzso in the presence of low zzso zzso also has an enhancing zzso
