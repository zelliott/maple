zzso proteins regulate both stability and translation through zzso binding to the 3' zzso of target zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso domain, which contains eight repeats of approximately 36 zzso acids zzso Found in all zzso they have been related to several zzso zzso Analysis of the 25 zzso zzso zzso proteins presenting zzso repeats reveals that 12 zzso to zzso have a zzso domain with zzso similarity to the zzso zzso zzso Through zzso zzso we show that zzso to zzso can bind specifically to the zzso response element sequence recognized by zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso library in a zzso zzso we were able to identify an zzso consensus zzso zzso analysis allowed us to identify the zzso element within the 3' zzso in many zzso zzso even in important zzso related to shoot stem cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso to zzso are able to bind specifically to zzso elements in the 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained in the present study indicate that the zzso proteins may act as regulators in zzso through an zzso zzso zzso which may open up a new approach for investigating zzso regulation in zzso
