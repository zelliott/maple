Type IV zzso zzso are surface structures that undergo zzso zzso to generate cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso are zzso localized and undergo zzso zzso zzso with cellular zzso We investigated the mechanisms underlying these zzso We show that several zzso proteins zzso zzso in clusters at both cell poles between zzso and these clusters remain stationary during zzso zzso the zzso and zzso motor zzso that zzso extension and zzso respectively, zzso to opposite poles with zzso predominantly at the zzso and zzso predominantly at the zzso pole, and these proteins zzso between the poles during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involve the zzso of zzso machinery at one pole and zzso of this machinery at the opposite zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso experiments showed rapid turnover of zzso in the polar clusters between zzso Moreover, zzso displays bursts of zzso at the zzso pole between zzso These observations suggest that the spatial separation of zzso and zzso in combination with the noisy zzso zzso at the zzso pole allow the zzso separation of extension and zzso This is the first demonstration that the function of a molecular machine depends on zzso and zzso of its individual zzso
