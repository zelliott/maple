A consensus prediction for the secondary structure of the muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso regions is zzso This protein is a member of the zzso zzso channel zzso which also encompasses the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The strategy used here is based on the application of six different prediction methods to an alignment of 118 sequences of this zzso A consensus prediction was finally produced for each of the four different zzso of the muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso with respect to the total zzso zzso and averaged for the four zzso are as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and turn + zzso zzso When adding to these values the zzso of the secondary structure reported for the zzso region only, the results are in agreement with those obtained zzso by zzso et zzso and zzso et zzso The zzso with respect to these experimental zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and turn + zzso zzso zzso Considering the predictions made for individual zzso the best approximation was obtained for the alpha zzso with zzso of zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for turn + zzso The prediction was used to zzso the zzso involved in forming three zzso that presumably flank the zzso pocket and to propose mechanism for transferring the information of the zzso binding to the zzso zzso
