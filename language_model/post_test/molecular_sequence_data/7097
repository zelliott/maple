zzso zzso and zzso toxin have been shown previously to act zzso to stimulate traverse of zzso and entry into S phase in zzso mouse zzso These agents also have a synergistic effect on the induction of the zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso reporter construct containing the mouse zzso zzso region from zzso to zzso cloned upstream of zzso A detailed zzso analysis of the zzso region revealed that the zzso between zzso and zzso toxin requires multiple discrete zzso including the binding sites for the serum response factor zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso on the zzso side of the serum response element, and a zzso or E zzso zzso on the zzso side of the serum response element zzso to zzso or zzso to zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso response element zzso to zzso shown to be activated in a number of cell types after increases in zzso zzso levels, zzso an induction by zzso but not by zzso toxin in zzso cells, and was not required for the synergistic zzso induced by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso
