zzso are 22 zzso long zzso zzso and exert their function either by zzso or zzso zzso Although many zzso profiles in different zzso and disease states have already been discovered, only little is known about their target zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in many diseases, including cancer, where it might function as an zzso 

We employed a zzso technique called zzso isotope zzso by zzso acids in cell zzso zzso allowing relative zzso to reliably identify target proteins of zzso Using zzso we identified 46 putative zzso target zzso some of which were previously zzso With zzso reporter zzso zzso was confirmed as a new target of zzso zzso zzso of zzso target proteins pointed to a role in cell cycle zzso 

To the best of our knowledge we have investigated for the first time zzso target proteins in the zzso cell line in large zzso In addition, by comparing our results to previously identified zzso target proteins in other cell lines, we provided further evidence for the cell line specificity of zzso
