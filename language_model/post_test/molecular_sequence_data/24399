Recent experiments have demonstrated that formation of functional type B zzso acid zzso receptors requires zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the identification of these zzso and a number of associated zzso zzso there has been little convincing evidence of pharmacological diversity between zzso receptors zzso different zzso zzso However, zzso et zzso zzso zzso 59 zzso zzso have recently suggested a novel and important pharmacological difference between zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study suggested that the zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso is an zzso at zzso receptors expressing the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso The importance of this finding with respect to identifying novel zzso zzso zzso specific zzso prompted us to repeat these experiments in our own zzso binding and second zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso was completely inactive at zzso zzso zzso expressing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso In addition, in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso slices we were unable to demonstrate any zzso effects of zzso at either zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso activated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is not a zzso zzso let alone a zzso zzso zzso selective zzso
