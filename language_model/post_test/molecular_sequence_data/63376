The zzso zzso zzso possesses genes for 13 different zzso Here we characterize zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso form zzso that can move zzso distances on zzso using the energy derived from zzso zzso We expressed zzso zzso in zzso coli and tested them in different in zzso zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso were active in gliding and zzso zzso They showed a strong dependence on zzso zzso Like the full-length zzso the truncated zzso motor zzso zzso zzso motor domain, neck, and partial zzso reached its maximum speed of around zzso zzso at a zzso zzso concentration of zzso The shortened zzso motor zzso zzso zzso motor domain, partial zzso showed a high zzso zzso comparable to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the duty cycle calculations and gliding zzso indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso A zzso protein revealed a mainly zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso makes an association with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Despite a similar zzso distance to both zzso and zzso in terms of its zzso properties zzso revealed a closer similarity to zzso than animal zzso
