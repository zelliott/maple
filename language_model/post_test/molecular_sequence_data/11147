An zzso sequence called Flag was inserted into the zzso zzso coat protein at two different locations and its effects on protein folding and virus assembly were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso assembly functions of the zzso show that when the zzso is inserted at its zzso coat protein folds properly into the form that binds zzso zzso the zzso but is defective for zzso zzso On the other hand, a zzso protein which is expected to display the Flag zzso as a surface loop does not fold correctly and, as a consequence, is zzso zzso zzso fusion of the two zzso of the coat zzso results in a protein considerably more tolerant of these structural zzso and mostly zzso the defects accompanying Flag zzso zzso Increased resistance of the zzso coat protein to zzso zzso indicates that the fused zzso is substantially more stable than wild zzso zzso joining of zzso of zzso probably represents a general strategy for engineering increased protein zzso
