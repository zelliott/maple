zzso diseases affect millions of people world zzso Prevention and treatment of these diseases require considerable attention from the individual as well as society and cause great zzso zzso disease zzso and mechanisms of zzso is a prerequisite for optimal treatment zzso The highly variable speed of zzso destruction and in some sites persistence for years of deep pockets without further zzso destruction points to the significance of individual bacterial species in the complex zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso tissue occurs when the load of bacterial zzso factors overcomes the local immune zzso One way of doing this is by zzso degradation of zzso which is considered to mediate its protective functions in an zzso way and to zzso inflammation through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso A competent zzso system may be of particular significance in chronic inflammatory diseases, as zzso diseases, where the inflammatory reaction in itself probably is the main cause of zzso In these cases, degradation of zzso may serve the purpose of immune evasion for the bacteria and at the same time may induce a relatively increased activity in the zzso part of the immune system which may aggravate zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso species from the zzso zzso induce an altered zzso mobility of zzso indicative of removal of terminally positioned zzso zzso zzso determination of residual zzso content of zzso after incubation with bacterial cells of zzso rods has confirmed that they remove zzso acid, and in addition to that, only minor amounts of zzso Apart from serving a nutritional purpose, zzso of zzso may also serve a purpose of immune zzso zzso and, in particular zzso acid protects zzso including zzso against zzso zzso and zzso of zzso increase their sensitivity to zzso degradation and inhibit the zzso zzso functions that mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso is induced by a number of bacterial species often associated with zzso diseases, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These species produce zzso of broad zzso activity, that also may degrade zzso of other zzso complement factors, zzso plasma proteins zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced by these bacteria serve a nutritional purpose and is essential for growth of other bacteria in mixed zzso It also has an obvious zzso effect on the zzso potential of the specific zzso immune zzso These bacteria seem to be essential for the zzso of experimental infections in animals with zzso of oral bacteria and a likely reason is their ability to provide the other bacteria with zzso zzso zzso and iron for growth and their ability to inhibit the immune zzso The hinge region of zzso is relatively resistant to zzso because of a high zzso content and presence of several zzso side zzso It is therefore interesting that a number of zzso unrelated bacteria, including both zzso and overt zzso have evolved the capability to specifically cleave human zzso in the hinge zzso These so-called zzso zzso leave zzso and zzso fragments intact for which reason a direct nutritional purpose of the zzso may be zzso In the oral zzso specific zzso zzso are produced by the zzso species that constitute a considerable proportion of initial dental plaque and the zzso on zzso and zzso zzso In all three cases the zzso is sparse and contact with zzso including zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso
