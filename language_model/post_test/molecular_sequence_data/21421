The zzso sensors of zzso II and IV of sodium channels are important zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Animal toxins that alter zzso zzso of muscles and zzso often modify sodium channel zzso by selectively interacting with domain II and zzso by selectively interacting with domain zzso This suggests that there may be substantial differences between the zzso sites in these two important zzso Here we explore the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the activity of the domain II and IV zzso zzso zzso is specific for domain II, and we identify five zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of domain II that are crucial for zzso of zzso by zzso These data indicate that a single zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso is crucial for allowing zzso to interact with the other key zzso and trap the zzso sensor in the closed zzso zzso analysis indicates that the five corresponding zzso in domain IV are all critical for zzso zzso with the ability to inhibit fast zzso Our data suggest that the zzso motif in domain II is zzso in domain zzso zzso our understanding of the molecular zzso of toxin interactions with zzso sodium channels may permit development of enhanced zzso zzso zzso
