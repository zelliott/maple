zzso acid zzso amplification zzso an zzso amplification technique for zzso acids zzso was investigated for the zzso identification of zzso A set of zzso was selected from a highly zzso region of the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso a variable sequence to perform amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso tuberculosis complex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso with the amplified zzso acids of 10 zzso zzso and 11 closely related bacteria, as well as with zzso zzso in an zzso gel zzso zzso Each probe was shown to zzso specifically to the amplified zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso clinical zzso of zzso tuberculosis strains from different parts of the world were correctly identified by zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In combination with the zzso zzso could identify zzso zzso zzso in less than 6 zzso The relative simplicity and zzso of this technique makes it an attractive tool for zzso identification of zzso
