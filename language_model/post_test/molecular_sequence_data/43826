zzso zzso are the principal regulators of pH in animal cells, and play a vital role in zzso movement in the stomach, zzso zzso zzso zzso system and central nervous zzso The functional family of zzso zzso includes zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso information is sparse on zzso zzso apart from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose complementary zzso were cloned several years zzso Attempts to clone other zzso zzso based on binding of zzso protein zzso or zzso with zzso zzso have so far been zzso Here we monitor the zzso pH and membrane zzso in zzso zzso to follow the expression of the most zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso We now report the successful cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso zzso acids long with several potential zzso zzso We show that when it is expressed in zzso zzso this protein is zzso zzso and zzso dependent, and blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso and conclude that it is the zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso
