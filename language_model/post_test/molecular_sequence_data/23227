zzso zzso by the zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso various drugs from cells resulting in drug zzso However, its functional relevance to zzso and the regulatory mechanism remain zzso Although zzso is known to be induced by various zzso zzso it is poorly understood whether the zzso stimuli such as zzso induce zzso zzso We investigated the zzso regulation of zzso in zzso by zzso zzso particularly by zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso a specific zzso factor for zzso from the zzso into nucleus of zzso in a zzso manner and resulted in the sequential zzso zzso of zzso expression of zzso on the cell surface, and zzso of the zzso zzso added in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso expression induced by zzso zzso A, a competitive inhibitor of zzso recovered zzso zzso levels in zzso We provide the first evidence that zzso a representative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso expression in zzso Our findings imply that zzso zzso by zzso in zzso in the context of the zzso of zzso diseases, results in zzso zzso resistance, and that zzso could be an important target for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
