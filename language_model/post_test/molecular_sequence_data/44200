zzso was isolated from a zzso library enriched for transcripts from zzso Isolation and sequencing of a zzso zzso clone identified a putative zzso protein with greater than zzso zzso over a zzso stretch to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene contains a region rich in zzso zzso frequently associated with zzso zzso The zzso genes are believed to play important roles in development and differentiation in many different organisms and have also been implicated in the development of some zzso The map position of zzso on zzso places the gene within the candidate regions for the cancer predisposition syndrome multiple zzso zzso zzso and the degenerative neurological disorder zzso sensory zzso type zzso This is a region frequently lost in zzso cell zzso
