zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso processing has been studied with zzso zzso zzso The new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind with high affinity zzso in zzso zzso to spinal zzso zzso receptors and possess zzso stability as compared to earlier generations of zzso zzso These peptides have been examined in the spinal zzso zzso model where zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso of the zzso zzso zzso induced by 30 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso rats in a zzso manner, thus behaving as zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited only weak antagonism at high doses in this zzso Moreover, lower doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso at high doses in the rat spinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were potent zzso of zzso receptors in rat spinal cord, in correlation with their in zzso binding zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso despite their high in zzso zzso exhibited only very weak zzso Moreover, zzso may also behave as a partial zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso may be zzso The zzso between in zzso binding and in zzso zzso potency of zzso and zzso may also suggest the presence of different zzso zzso zzso within the rat spinal zzso However, other explanations for the zzso such as differences in zzso stability, diffusion rates and penetration to the site of action are also zzso
