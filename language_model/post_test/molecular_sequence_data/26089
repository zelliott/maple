Previously, the transfer of a zzso group between the zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in expression of the zzso and zzso genes in response to the medium zzso was demonstrated in zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso at position 243 of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso at positions 12 and 55 of the zzso protein were changed, respectively, by means of zzso zzso We characterized the zzso proteins in terms of not only their in zzso zzso reactions but also their in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was defective in its in zzso ability not only as to zzso but also zzso and zzso This particular zzso zzso protein seemed to exhibit zzso functions as to the in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein with the zzso acid change at position 12 was clearly zzso in zzso but at a very low rate as compared with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein with the zzso acid change at position 55 was more severely zzso This zzso zzso protein appeared to exhibit zzso functions as to the in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso at position 243 of the zzso protein and the zzso zzso at positions 12 and 55 of the zzso protein are deeply involved in the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
