zzso are one of the major causes of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Recent studies on zzso receptors show that different zzso recognize different human zzso group zzso zzso and eight zzso binding patterns of zzso have been zzso The P domain of the zzso zzso is directly involved in this zzso To determine the precise locations and zzso binding modes of zzso carbohydrates on the viral zzso a zzso P protein of a zzso strain zzso zzso was zzso with synthetic type A or B zzso Based on complex crystal structures observed at a zzso resolution, we demonstrated that the zzso binding site lies at the zzso end of the P domain and forms an extensive zzso network with the zzso zzso The A and B zzso display similar binding zzso and the common zzso ring plays a key role in this zzso The extensive interface between the two zzso in a P zzso also plays a crucial role in the formation of the zzso binding zzso
