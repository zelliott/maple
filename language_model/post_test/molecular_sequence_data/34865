A potentially zzso zzso system for zzso gene amplification has been zzso A nearly full zzso zzso sequence of the zzso gene was amplified in two zzso DNA was extracted from zzso zzso and zzso of four mostly spread species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso have been zzso The zzso of zzso species in zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso have been identified, including two zzso zzso close to zzso zzso four zzso zzso close to zzso zzso and one zzso of a potentially new zzso Several zzso species were found in both mice species, although each zzso species zzso a single species of zzso High zzso of zzso infection was found in all studied species of small zzso in the Russian Far zzso Several amplified zzso probably belong to local strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one zzso represents a possible new zzso
