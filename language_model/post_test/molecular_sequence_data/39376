Recently, we have demonstrated the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the native zzso zzso zzso following protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 279, zzso Here we tested an hypothesis that zzso zzso of zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso native zzso from rat zzso zzso and zzso expressed wild type human zzso zzso from human zzso zzso cells revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs on zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso zzso reduced plasma membrane zzso levels, and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the G zzso human zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso with the zzso produced effects similar to zzso via zzso zzso In striking contrast, an zzso double zzso harboring zzso and zzso failed to show zzso zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso by zzso or zzso Most interestingly, the plasma membrane zzso of the zzso and zzso double zzso were not affected by zzso Although the zzso showed increased zzso and zzso from zzso plasma membrane zzso following zzso treatment, the zzso double zzso was completely resistant to these zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso double zzso was significantly zzso In the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso substitution of all other potential zzso within the zzso did not block zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso serve as a zzso zzso site and that zzso of this motif is linked to zzso zzso zzso
