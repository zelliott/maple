Two genes in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been assigned to zzso for zzso zzso A and zzso However, analyses of primary and zzso structures based on structural models of these two zzso revealed significant differences in their active centers suggesting important differences in their specificity for the zzso zzso To test this unexpected finding, a large screening of libraries from 42 strains of zzso zzso succeeded in identifying an zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibited both zzso and zzso activities, with the latter activity zzso The zzso protein was zzso and its zzso acid sequence could be unequivocally assigned to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso clearly demonstrated the preference of the identified zzso for zzso over zzso Thus, we provide evidence that the zzso type A gene zzso from zzso zzso in fact encodes a fully functional zzso using a retaining zzso
