zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified from the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we cloned eight zzso gene zzso from other zzso zzso zzso The similarity of the zzso locus of the zzso gene is associated with the zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso gene was only zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso type strains or two zzso zzso from other zzso These results suggested that the high level of zzso activity in zzso strains was caused by the zzso gene zzso on their zzso
