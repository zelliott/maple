Earlier we found a human zzso zzso region zzso The DNA zzso probe isolated from this region detects multiple zzso of restriction DNA fragments from zzso zzso The sequencing data suggest that the zzso instability and zzso are associated with tandem DNA zzso The DNA zzso probe contains two families of simple DNA repeats designated as zzso and zzso The zzso family of DNA zzso bears some similarity to the simple transcribed repeats of zzso zzso simple repetitive motifs of the human zzso gene zzso 1, and short sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso show an unusual similarity to zzso viral zzso gene zzso Besides zzso zzso and zzso repeats are localized in other zzso zzso and can form separate tandem clusters and terminal repeats zzso certain copies of zzso zzso
