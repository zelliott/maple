An analysis of partial sequences of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of 20 poison zzso species zzso confirmed their zzso relationships to zzso and zzso zzso Representatives of the zzso families and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not cluster as sister group of the zzso Similar results were obtained in an analysis using a partial sequence of the zzso gene zzso zzso in a reduced set of zzso and in a combined zzso Within the zzso our data supported zzso of the zzso zzso but indicated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso clustered within zzso contradicting its previously assumed zzso zzso zzso species clustered as a zzso unit within zzso zzso was positioned in a group containing two zzso species, indicating that lack of zzso presence of skin zzso and zzso zzso evolved independently in zzso and the remaining zzso zzso
