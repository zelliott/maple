We have developed a new model for coronavirus transcription, which we call zzso extension, to explain how zzso zzso stands are derived directly from the zzso The current model called zzso transcription, which states that zzso zzso is transcribed directly from zzso zzso cannot explain many of the recent experimental zzso For instance, zzso zzso are transcribed directly via zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso however zzso zzso does not appear to be copied directly into negative zzso In our model the zzso negative strands would be derived using the zzso as a zzso After the zzso had copied the zzso of the zzso it would zzso at any one of the several zzso sequences and zzso to the sequence immediately downstream of the leader sequence at the zzso of zzso zzso Base pairing between the zzso of the nascent zzso negative zzso which would be complementary to the zzso sequence at the end of the leader sequence at the zzso of zzso would serve to align the nascent negative strand to the zzso and permit the completion of zzso zzso zzso extension of the zzso of the negative zzso Thus, zzso negative strands would arise by zzso zzso but of negative zzso not of positive strands as proposed originally by the zzso zzso zzso
