zzso II zzso is a structurally complex cell wall zzso zzso Despite its complexity, both the structure of zzso and its ability to zzso via a zzso zzso are zzso in vascular plants suggesting that zzso has a fundamental role in primary cell wall zzso and zzso The selection and analysis of new zzso affected in zzso formation represents a promising strategy to unravel these functions and to identify genes zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso In this paper, a novel zzso strategy is described for the screening of zzso zzso based on the mild acid zzso of zzso coupled to the analysis of the resulting fragments by mass zzso This methodology was developed using zzso zzso isolated from citrus zzso and then validated for zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso
