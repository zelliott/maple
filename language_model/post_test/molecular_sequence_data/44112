An increasing number of zzso proteins has been found to be associated with zzso and zzso zzso Some of these proteins play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of the nervous zzso In the zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso in the zzso disorder zzso disease and in zzso zzso while in the zzso peripheral zzso protein 22 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are culprit genes in the most frequent forms of zzso peripheral zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso also called zzso or zzso and zzso are additional zzso proteins that are highly expressed by zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the role of these proteins in the nervous zzso As a prerequisite for functional genetic approaches in the zzso we have isolated and characterized a mouse zzso zzso and the corresponding structural zzso zzso zzso analysis and database searches revealed that zzso belongs to a larger gene family which also includes zzso zzso and the expressed sequence tag zzso zzso While the overall zzso acid sequence identities between mouse zzso and the related proteins are relatively low zzso the zzso motif zzso which is found at the junction of the first zzso loop and the second zzso domain serves as a fingerprint for the zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of the members of the zzso gene family indicates widespread expression in various zzso suggesting a common role of these proteins in cell zzso
