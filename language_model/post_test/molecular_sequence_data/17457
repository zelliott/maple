zzso expansions in two of three large imperfect zzso repeats zzso by the first zzso of zzso have been reported in zzso syndrome zzso Here we report additional families with expansions in the third repeat of 11 and 12 zzso zzso the latter being the largest expansion zzso We also report a patient with a novel, de zzso zzso expansion in the first large zzso Thus, expansions in all three large zzso zzso repeats can cause zzso To determine the molecular basis for impaired zzso function, we performed zzso zzso in zzso cells in mice to expand the size of the third largest zzso tract by 10 zzso zzso zzso mice were indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso zzso limb buds had normal zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso and reduced levels of zzso zzso In zzso translation efficiency of the zzso protein was zzso Thus, loss of function is secondary to a reduction in the in zzso abundance of the expanded protein likely due to zzso
