The presence of zzso gene zzso was examined in zzso induced zzso pancreatic zzso zzso Syrian zzso received 70 zzso of zzso zzso followed by repeated exposure to an zzso pressure regimen consisting of zzso diet combined with zzso and zzso and administration of 20 zzso zzso After two zzso pressure cycles, pancreatic zzso cell zzso appeared and after three cycles, zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso chain reaction products and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso had occurred in one of 9 simple zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso in 5 of 9 zzso zzso and in 4 of 8 zzso zzso The findings thus suggested that zzso is activated in association with very early stage zzso transformation of pancreatic zzso cells in zzso
