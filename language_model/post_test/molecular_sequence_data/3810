Two new zzso class I zzso have been zzso by zzso zzso zzso was initially identified by zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso zzso and afterwards confirmed by sequencing based typing zzso studies in a Spanish Caucasian blood zzso zzso A unique zzso change throughout zzso 2, 3 and 4, leading to the zzso acid replacement zzso zzso zzso and zzso This position behaves as a zzso zzso in zzso and -C zzso and seems to be structurally unrelated to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was first detected by zzso in two African American bone zzso donors in combination with its most structurally related zzso zzso The single zzso acid change found between zzso and zzso was zzso a zzso involved in pocket A of the zzso zzso This new zzso could be the result of a gene conversion event between zzso and any of the zzso zzso
