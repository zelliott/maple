Human zzso is a zzso and each zzso is composed of three different zzso (A zzso B zzso and zzso The two zzso are joined together at the zzso ends by three symmetrical zzso bonds between adjacent A alpha zzso at position 28, and between adjacent gamma chains at gamma 8 and zzso To determine the role of these zzso bonds in zzso assembly and zzso zzso zzso was used to change zzso of A alpha 28 and gamma 8 and 9 to zzso the zzso chains were zzso with normal zzso chains in zzso cells, and assembly and zzso of zzso were zzso zzso of the symmetrical zzso bonds did not affect assembly of the chains and zzso zzso was zzso Analysis by zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso have a similar structure to normal zzso Our results indicate that other zzso of zzso participate in zzso formation and that the three symmetrical zzso bonds are not crucial for assembly and zzso of zzso
