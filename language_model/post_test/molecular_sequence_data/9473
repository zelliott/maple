zzso larvae exhibit zzso pH extremes along the zzso length of their zzso canal that range from very alkaline zzso in the anterior zzso to slightly acid in the zzso The principal buffer in the system is thought to be zzso and/or zzso because the zzso is known to contain high levels of zzso and is surrounded by various zzso cell types which express a variety of zzso zzso However, the precise mechanisms responsible for the transport of zzso into and out of the zzso are zzso In the present study, we test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso play a role in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the gut of zzso mosquitoes zzso aegypti and zzso zzso demonstrate the presence of both a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso zzso show that the two proteins can be located in the same zzso but to different cell zzso zzso experiments in the gastric zzso show that the two proteins can be found in the same cells, but on opposite sides zzso zzso zzso In zzso our results indicate that the zzso canal of zzso mosquitoes exhibits robust expression of two zzso zzso in locations that are consistent with a role in the regulation of zzso zzso The precise zzso contributions of each zzso remain to be zzso
