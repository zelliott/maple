The discovery of a novel zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is zzso The three genes in the zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso and 325 zzso zzso The zzso distances are 87 zzso between zzso and zzso and 117 zzso between zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity, respectively, on their zzso The identity of zzso was established previously by the same approach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each of the genes is preceded by a potential zzso binding zzso The zzso is expressed in a zzso zzso The zzso end of the transcript was determined to be a G zzso positioned 81 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso The pattern of zzso usage within the zzso is highly zzso with 11 unused zzso acid zzso This degree of bias suggests that the zzso is highly zzso The three proteins zzso on the zzso are key zzso in the zzso pathway, the central zzso of energy production and zzso acid synthesis in zzso zzso For this reason, we have called the zzso the las zzso acid zzso zzso
