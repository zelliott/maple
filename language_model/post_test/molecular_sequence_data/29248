The zzso regions of human zzso are comprised of sequence zzso shared between distinct zzso of zzso In the course of developing a set of unique human zzso zzso we identified many clones containing such shared zzso characterized by the presence of zzso signals on one or more zzso in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied the evolutionary origin of seven zzso clones by performing comparative FISH analysis on a zzso panel that included great apes and Old World zzso All clones tested showed a single zzso site in Old World monkeys that corresponded to one of the zzso human sites, thus indicating the ancestral zzso The timing of the zzso events varied among the zzso regions, from approximately 5 to approximately 25 million years zzso To examine the origin of and mechanism for one of these zzso zzso we compared the sequence derived from human zzso ancestral fusion site of two great zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso sequences at zzso and zzso These zzso regions share large continuous zzso and contain three zzso zzso zzso box zzso and zzso Our results provide further evidence for zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that these zzso zzso are most likely the result of ancestral unbalanced zzso that have been fixed in the zzso during recent zzso zzso
