The technique of differential display was used previously to profile the gene expression patterns of zzso cell lung cancer, and several genes zzso expressed were thus zzso In this report, we demonstrate that a DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso showed zzso sequence similarity to human zzso zzso for a zzso zzso The gene product of zzso zzso was zzso to be a shorter zzso of zzso zzso termed zzso based upon the results of searching for sequence zzso The zzso sequence alignment also indicated that the zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso human zzso 1 zzso possibly resulted from the event of alternative zzso from which a zzso region was retained in the zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence confirmed the speculation that both zzso were mapped to the same zzso position zzso of 18 zzso of which the zzso region of zzso constituted zzso zzso The alternative zzso in all lung cancer cell lines was also observed to occur nearly in all tissue specimens zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso was subsequently found in tumor zzso from at least five of seven zzso cell lung cancer zzso Also, a distinct zzso product was initially detected in cell line zzso and further sequence analysis identified the presence of the zzso region mapped to the zzso sequence immediately followed by zzso zzso To evaluate the retention of zzso region, it was found that, besides the predicted zzso product, an unexpected zzso product was zzso observed and identified as the result of zzso 8 zzso The expression and zzso zzso of the full-length zzso and other shorter zzso were detected by flow zzso using three zzso zzso It was concluded that the full-length zzso located at plasma membrane with its zzso domain exposed zzso and the shorter zzso retained at zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso zzso in tumor zzso was further illustrated using zzso zzso
