Nerve damage is the hallmark of zzso zzso infection, which results from zzso zzso invasion of the zzso cell of the peripheral nervous zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso specially the G domain of zzso zzso chain, on the zzso zzso unit serves as an initial neural target for zzso zzso However, zzso zzso surface molecules that mediate bacterial invasion of peripheral nerves are entirely zzso By using human zzso zzso as a probe, a major zzso protein in the zzso zzso cell wall fraction that binds zzso zzso was zzso After zzso zzso acid sequence analysis, zzso strategy was used to clone the gene that encodes this zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of this zzso zzso zzso protein predicts a zzso zzso zzso which is smaller than the observed molecular size in zzso zzso and zzso zzso on intact zzso zzso with zzso against zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protein is surface zzso zzso avidly bound to zzso zzso the zzso domain of the zzso chain, and the native peripheral nerve zzso The role of zzso in zzso cell zzso and invasion was investigated by using fluorescent polystyrene beads coated with zzso Although beads coated with zzso alone specifically zzso to and were zzso by primary zzso cells, these functions were significantly enhanced when beads were zzso with zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the present data suggest that zzso may function as a critical surface zzso that zzso the entry of zzso zzso into zzso zzso
