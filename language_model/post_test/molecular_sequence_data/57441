zzso zzso of zzso and zzso occurs most frequently at the level of basic zzso acids arranged in zzso Previous predictions by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Cohen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso on the basis of 20 zzso sequences containing 53 zzso potential processing sites, that zzso sites situated in, or next to, zzso were zzso in zzso whereas sites included in ordered structures like zzso or zzso were zzso We have used zzso zzso of the zzso processing domain and a zzso preparation of the putative zzso zzso from bovine zzso as a model to demonstrate that zzso processing at zzso sites is associated with a zzso sequence organized in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso is an interchangeable motif since the original sequence could be replaced by an zzso one possessing the ability to organize as a zzso and zzso this particular secondary structure zzso in the zzso reaction, most likely by favoring the interactions of the zzso with the processing zzso It is concluded that, in addition to the zzso and other zzso acids around the zzso zzso the zzso constitutes a key feature in the zzso processing reaction in participating as the favorable zzso for optimal zzso active site zzso
