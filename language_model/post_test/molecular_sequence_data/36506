This study describes evidence in the adult human and rat brain for zzso that zzso two complement zzso zzso zzso and zzso C proteins are important zzso of zzso immunity and inflammation in peripheral zzso but have not been considered as normally present in zzso Previous zzso studies showed that C proteins are associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso but their source is zzso Combined zzso and in zzso zzso techniques show C4 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso rat zzso cultures also show zzso zzso In the zzso from zzso zzso there were two- to zzso increases of zzso zzso and C4 zzso and increased zzso zzso prevalence was in part associated with zzso As a model for zzso we examined zzso zzso zzso path zzso in the rat brain, which caused rapid increases of zzso zzso in the zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso acute and chronic C induction during zzso and experimental zzso can now be considered in relation to functions of C proteins that pertain to cell zzso and/or cell preservation and synaptic zzso
