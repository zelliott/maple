This paper describes our finding on overlapping genes in zzso zzso zzso We found that one of the open reading frames zzso within the zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso sequence of zzso which raises a serious question of the correctness of the initiation zzso assignment for that zzso We suggest that there are two other possible zzso initiation zzso downstream from the zzso zzso which was initially considered as a translation start zzso Only one of the zzso triplets is preceded by the zzso sequence that seems to be required for binding the zzso and initiation of zzso
