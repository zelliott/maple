zzso analysis was used to characterize a zzso domain located near the zzso zzso acid sequence of wheat zzso zzso storage zzso This domain was transformed into a linear template for a global search for similarities in over zzso protein zzso In addition to proteins that had already been found to exhibit zzso to wheat storage zzso a previously zzso zzso was found with zzso zzso proteins from zzso bean zzso zzso and from spinach zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of various members of the present protein group clearly shows a typical domain structure where zzso variable and zzso zzso are located along the sequence at precise positions, zzso the zzso zzso probably reflect a common zzso and zzso the unique properties of a given protein zzso cut into zzso repetitive zzso zzso active zzso are associated with the variable zzso
