zzso zzso persistence of fetal zzso zzso is a common zzso trait characterized by a modest increase of fetal zzso levels in zzso We previously localized a zzso zzso zzso for zzso in an extensive zzso zzso to zzso zzso As part of the strategy of zzso cloning and a means towards identification of the specific genetic zzso in this family, a thorough zzso of the candidate zzso based on a strategy of in zzso zzso wet biology approach with comparative zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso candidate region was shown to contain five zzso zzso We discovered a very large zzso gene containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso and extended the zzso of four previously characterized genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also identified several genes that do not appear to be protein coding, and generated 17 zzso of novel transcript sequence data from zzso 97 zzso zzso 

zzso and thorough zzso of this zzso zzso zzso in zzso confirms a high level of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso The candidate zzso was shown to exhibit an extraordinary level of alternate zzso - 19 transcripts were identified for the 5 protein coding zzso but it appears that a significant portion zzso of these alternate transcripts did not have an open reading frame, hence their functional role is zzso These transcripts may result from zzso rather than regulated zzso
