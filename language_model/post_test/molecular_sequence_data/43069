Previous work showed that E coli zzso zzso zzso binds to the leader region of its own zzso and zzso its translation by blocking zzso zzso The operator consists of four distinct zzso one of them zzso 2) sharing structural analogies with the zzso arm of the E coli zzso The regulation specificity can be switched by using zzso identity rules, suggesting that the operator could be recognized by zzso as a zzso zzso In the present paper, we investigated the relative contribution of the four zzso to the regulation process by using deletions and point zzso This was achieved by testing the effects of the zzso on zzso zzso (by probing zzso on zzso recognition (by zzso experiments and measure of the competition with zzso for zzso on zzso binding and zzso competition (by zzso zzso It turns out that: zzso the four zzso are structurally and functionally zzso zzso domain 2 is essential for regulation and contains the major structural zzso for zzso zzso zzso domain 4 is involved in control and zzso recognition, but to a lesser degree than domain zzso However, the previously described analogies with the zzso stem are not functionally zzso How it is recognized by zzso remains to be zzso zzso domain 1, which contains the zzso loading site, is not involved in zzso zzso The binding of zzso probably masks the zzso binding site by zzso hindrance and not by direct zzso This is only achieved when zzso interacts with both zzso 2 and 4; and zzso the zzso domain 3, which connects zzso 2 and 4, is not directly involved in zzso zzso It should serve as an articulation to provide an appropriate spacing between zzso 2 and zzso Furthermore, it is possibly involved in zzso zzso
