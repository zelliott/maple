Previous studies have implied that a zzso zzso other than zzso is involved in zzso regulation of zzso promoter activity via zzso zzso One such element, zzso was employed to clone from a rat zzso zzso expression library a novel zzso acid zzso zzso designated zzso zzso regulatory element zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso potential zzso zzso but no apparent zzso zzso and exhibits zzso binding to site zzso to a site zzso to that for zzso The zzso gene (or a related zzso is zzso as an apparently single zzso in zzso human, fly, and zzso A single approximately zzso zzso transcript accumulates in zzso rat zzso cells, to levels similar to zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in all human zzso zzso but the observation of zzso multiple transcript patterns suggests the possibility of zzso alternative zzso zzso analysis of human brain tumor zzso samples suggested zzso expression of zzso transcripts in zzso Western and zzso analysis implied that zzso accumulates specifically in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso employing zzso zzso rat zzso cells showed that zzso is as active as, and additive with, zzso in zzso of a zzso promoter zzso and that zzso but not zzso can mediate zzso zzso by protein zzso A zzso zzso in zzso cells of a zzso fusion protein both strongly zzso a zzso indicator construct and yielded a further stimulation of expression of this construct by zzso zzso zzso that zzso can mediate both zzso and zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso These observations imply that zzso will prove to play a significant zzso regulatory role, both in the zzso and in other zzso in which transcripts of its gene are zzso
