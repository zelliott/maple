We have identified and cloned two zzso of zzso in human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso which is similar to the recently cloned zzso and a novel zzso termed zzso zzso results from a deletion of 159 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a protein of approximately zzso zzso zzso is identical to zzso but lacks zzso zzso acid zzso from 90 to zzso This region of zzso has a target sequence for zzso fatty acid zzso suggesting that the two zzso can differ in their capacity to interact with zzso The level of zzso zzso is increased during zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the existence of two zzso proteins in human zzso and therefore, these cells have all the proteins needed to carry out the zzso zzso
