In previous studies we have characterized a zzso intermediate filament zzso zzso termed zzso zzso does not zzso into regular zzso but is known to associate with another zzso zzso protein which has been suggested to represent its assembly zzso To address this possibility, we cloned and zzso the zzso coding for the bovine zzso protein which we have termed zzso (from the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted sequence comprises zzso zzso acids and shows significant similarity zzso identity over zzso zzso to type I zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso domain zzso and a 311 zzso acid long zzso domain punctuated with zzso repeats zzso Similar to zzso 19, zzso lacks a zzso tail domain and it therefore represents the second known example of a naturally zzso IF zzso zzso zzso on frozen lens sections reveals that zzso zzso with zzso and is distributed along the periphery of the lens fiber zzso zzso zzso with whole lens fiber cell preparations and zzso of washed lens zzso suggest that the natural zzso of zzso to zzso is approximately zzso Under in zzso conditions, zzso zzso into zzso zzso structures which tend to zzso into thick zzso However, mixing of zzso and zzso at an optimal ratio of zzso yields stable zzso filaments which have a smooth surface and are zzso indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso shows that these filaments represent zzso zzso Despite its zzso to the zzso zzso does not zzso with zzso zzso zzso or basic zzso zzso zzso From these data we conclude that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso which constitute a new zzso zzso filament system related to, but distinct from the known classes of zzso
