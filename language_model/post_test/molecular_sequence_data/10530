To investigate regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we constructed a truncated form of the mouse zzso zzso and expressed it in a zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso lacked 22 zzso acids in the zzso including four potential zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso receptors was identical with the wild zzso zzso with zzso zzso induced increases in zzso zzso zzso generation and zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso However, the initial increase in zzso generation by the zzso zzso was only approximately 50% of that seen in the wild zzso Exposure of zzso receptors to zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso and calcium zzso zzso with zzso zzso caused some zzso of zzso zzso but the extent of zzso was reduced compared with the wild zzso The protein zzso C inhibitor zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso zzso but had little effect on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with low zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced subsequent responsiveness of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso In contrast, high-dose zzso zzso (1 zzso produced a similar degree of zzso of both zzso zzso These data suggest that: 1) the zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso to its zzso zzso 2) the zzso contributes to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and 3) protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is complex and zzso in part, on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
