On the basis of primary sequence comparisons and secondary structure predictions, zzso internal zzso entry segments zzso have been divided into three groups zzso and zzso zzso and and zzso and zzso A zzso Here, we describe a detailed comparison of the ability of zzso from each group to direct internal initiation of translation in zzso using a single zzso zzso (the only variable being the zzso inserted into the zzso zzso We studied the influence of various parameters on the capacity of six different zzso zzso and the zzso zzso C virus zzso to direct internal initiation of zzso salt zzso the addition of zzso cell proteins to rabbit zzso zzso translation zzso the presence of zzso disease virus zzso or human zzso 2A zzso On the basis of the characteristics of zzso translation in zzso the zzso zzso can be classified in a similar manner to when sequence zzso are zzso zzso from each of the three groups responded differently to all of the parameters tested, indicating that while all of these elements can direct internal zzso entry, the functional requirements for efficient zzso activity vary zzso In the individual optimal conditions for translation zzso the best zzso were those from the zzso and zzso followed by those from the zzso which exhibited up to zzso of the efficiency of the zzso element in directing internal initiation of zzso
