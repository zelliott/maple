Cloning of a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was undertaken using a soluble form of the zzso to identify a source of zzso A zzso T cell line, zzso was identified that appeared to express a cell surface zzso for this zzso A zzso clone was isolated from an expression library prepared from these cells that was capable, when zzso into cells, of zzso binding to a soluble form of the zzso zzso The zzso for this zzso encodes a type I zzso protein that stimulates the proliferation of cells zzso with the zzso zzso A soluble form of the zzso stimulates the proliferation of defined zzso of zzso bone zzso and fetal liver cells as well as human bone zzso cells that are highly enriched for zzso stem cells and primitive zzso zzso zzso
