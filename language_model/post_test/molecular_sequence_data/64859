The zzso zzso are a family of signaling proteins that are zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso To date, four different zzso genes have been identified zzso While zzso zzso have been extensively zzso little is yet known about the other genes of the zzso We report the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso The zzso zzso for the zzso domain of each protein was cloned from the mouse zzso bulb and inserted into the zzso zzso allowing for bacterial expression of the protein fused to an zzso His zzso The zzso zzso expressed in the inclusion bodies were zzso under zzso conditions, zzso by affinity zzso and zzso via dialysis in the presence of reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso were active as they bound to their receptors and induced their zzso In particular, and in agreement with data on the native zzso all the molecules were able to bind and activate zzso while only the zzso and the two zzso (but not zzso bound zzso
