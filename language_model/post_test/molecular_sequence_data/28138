The zzso sequence of a zzso DNA segment which contains the zzso coding sequence and the zzso zzso region of a crystal protein gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The coding region encodes an zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso truncated zzso specifically active against the cotton leaf zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene with that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso classes of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso sequence contains a very high level of zzso acid zzso in the zzso part of the zzso zzso The zzso are grouped in several highly variable segments separated by highly zzso zzso These zzso zzso are also present in the zzso and zzso zzso The control region of the zzso gene shows considerable DNA identity with the control regions of the other zzso zzso zzso of the 3' region of the gene were carried out and the toxic fraction of the zzso zzso was identified with the zzso half of the zzso
