zzso is a zzso zzso gene related strongly to prostate development and prostate zzso To study its regulation of transcription, zzso zzso zzso zzso region of zzso gene and its zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained by zzso and cloned into zzso a zzso zzso reporter zzso to examine their promoter activities driving the reporter gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso reporter zzso was used as internal control, and zzso and zzso were used as positive and negative control zzso The promoter activities were determined by zzso reporter zzso 48 h after zzso zzso were zzso with zzso into prostate cancer cell zzso The results showed that zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was zzso which was about zzso higher than that of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso higher than that of zzso zzso with zzso The results also showed that the relative activities zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the last one still had zzso promoter activity compared with zzso zzso which showed that deletion from zzso zzso to zzso zzso had small effects on promoter zzso The conclusion was that the zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso box and two zzso boxes had strong promoter zzso However, the deletion from zzso zzso to zzso zzso reduced activity zzso while the deletion from zzso zzso to zzso zzso enhanced activity zzso which indicated that these deleted sequences might contain some important positive or negative regulatory zzso It will be important to identify the elements within the zzso promoter that contribute to regulation of the gene zzso in the future zzso
