The gene coding for human zzso zzso was cloned and its structure was zzso The gene is zzso 20 zzso long, and contains 20 zzso The first zzso is zzso The coding sequence of the putative zzso site domain is interrupted in the middle by an zzso of 101 zzso This zzso is not zzso in the highly similar region of the human and rabbit zzso zzso The promoter region was defined by a zzso zzso and the start of the zzso was determined by primer zzso The promoter has features characteristic of a zzso zzso The zzso content is high zzso and distinct zzso and zzso motifs are zzso Two potential binding sites for the zzso zzso factor are zzso Four potential zzso binding sites are located downstream of the zzso end of the zzso
