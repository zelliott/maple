zzso the processes that shape the architecture of interaction networks is a major challenge in zzso Studies have consistently revealed that more closely related zzso tend to show greater overlap in interaction partners, zzso the idea that interactions are zzso zzso However, local ecological processes such as exploitative or apparent competition zzso zzso might instead cause a decrease in overlap in interacting zzso Because of the zzso and geographic zzso of existing studies, the structuring effect of such processes has been zzso Here, we assess the relative importance of zzso and ecological processes in a local, highly zzso zzso zzso zzso Across all network levels we consistently find that zzso zzso among resource species is correlated with consumer overlap but that zzso zzso among consumer species is not or zzso correlated with resource zzso This pervasive pattern indicates that the zzso network has been shaped by both zzso on resource range and by exploitative competition limiting resource overlap among closely related consumer zzso zzso the strength of zzso signal varies in a consistent way across the network zzso We discuss the zzso of our findings and their implications in a changing zzso
