In cyanide poisoning, zzso and zzso groups containing proteins are the main target molecules of zzso attack by zzso To defend against this attack, cyanide is zzso to less toxic zzso via zzso This reaction is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well characterized zzso zzso On the other hand, little was known about zzso because it was unstable and difficult to zzso We first zzso zzso to zzso and cloned zzso zzso from rat liver to characterize zzso We also found that zzso was an zzso related zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are widely distributed in rat zzso and the kidney and liver prominently contain these zzso zzso study revealed that zzso is mainly distributed in zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso in the liver, the zzso area of zzso cells in the heart, and zzso cells in the brain, and zzso zzso study concluded that zzso was distributed in both zzso and zzso so that zzso first zzso cyanide in zzso and the cyanide which escapes from zzso due to zzso enters zzso zzso then zzso cyanide again in cooperation with zzso in zzso zzso other than the liver and kidney are more susceptible to cyanide toxicity because they contain less zzso and zzso Even in the same zzso sensitivity to cyanide toxicity may differ according to the kind of zzso It is determined by a balance between the amount of proteins to be attacked and that of zzso to zzso
