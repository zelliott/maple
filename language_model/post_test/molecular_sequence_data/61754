A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been selected from a random sequence population based on the small zzso zzso The zzso zzso is activated zzso zzso by its zzso zzso zzso the zzso Rev zzso motif zzso and specifically recognizes the Rev zzso relative to other peptides containing zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso can zzso recognize the Rev zzso in the context of the full-length zzso Rev zzso The only zzso exhibited by the zzso is toward the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso from a partially zzso population yielded zzso that could readily discriminate against the zzso zzso These results have important implications for the development of zzso that can be used in zzso for the detection and zzso of multiple cellular proteins zzso zzso
