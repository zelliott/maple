The fiber gene sequences of the human zzso types 19 and 37 were zzso The predicted zzso exposed a high zzso zzso zzso and zzso can cause epidemic zzso zzso whereas zzso only infrequently causes acute zzso zzso zzso of the fiber knobs of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other previously published fiber sequences revealed that only two zzso acid zzso were zzso in the fiber knobs of zzso zzso and zzso Since the zzso is responsible for interaction with the cell zzso these two zzso acid zzso could play an important role in the zzso of zzso causing zzso
