The capsule has been implicated in the zzso of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that has a unique zzso position in the zzso zzso and is a close relative of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the genetic locus and composition of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strain of zzso zzso Genome analysis of the zzso strain revealed that the genetic locus for zzso zzso synthesis zzso is located next to an zzso zzso which is involved in the incorporation and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso are transcribed as a single zzso indicating that the zzso form an zzso Using the cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe, the zzso materials were isolated from the zzso strain by hot water extraction and treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso and gel zzso zzso The materials were then analyzed by zzso liquid zzso mass zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is zzso and consists of the major zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and some minor zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the capsule is modified by zzso which zzso with the zzso materials, as determined by Western zzso and zzso on the cell surface, as determined by zzso electron zzso zzso testing of zzso zzso in mice demonstrated that zzso is critical for the zzso of this zzso
