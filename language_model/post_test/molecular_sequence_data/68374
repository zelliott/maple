zzso zzso is folded into a bundle of seven zzso which is embedded in the cellular membrane of zzso zzso these zzso are connected by short zzso zzso three on the zzso side and three on the zzso zzso zzso or replacement zzso was used to integrate the zzso sequence (13 zzso acids zzso of zzso virus zzso individually into each of the six zzso zzso The altered gene products were obtained by expression of the zzso genes in either zzso coli or zzso zzso and were used to zzso zzso in zzso In four cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso were found to be fully functional as judged by zzso zzso pumping and zzso zzso Within the four functional zzso zzso recognition of the viral zzso by a zzso zzso is restricted to modified zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells producing either of the two latter zzso zzso shows that the protein is distributed among various cellular zzso but is not present in zzso zzso zzso zzso of loop zzso or zzso resulted in loss of function, most zzso due to a folding zzso of the respective zzso These results on the one hand document differences in structural importance of the various zzso zzso zzso and on the other hand open the door to the construction of zzso membrane proteins via loop replacement zzso of zzso
