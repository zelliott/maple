An approach that enables identification of specific synthetic zzso zzso of plant viral infection is zzso zzso zzso of zzso that have sequence and structural similarities to an essential domain of tobacco mosaic virus coat protein were found to possess highly specific zzso zzso This approach involves modification of zzso located at positions analogous to those that are critical for virus zzso The degree of zzso found zzso well with sequence similarities between the viral zzso protein and the zzso zzso studied as well as with the induced zzso changes that result upon interaction of the peptides and zzso zzso
