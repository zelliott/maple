A zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from barley by zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to have 12 zzso zzso and has extensive sequence zzso with other identified zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso was zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso deficient in the gene zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The strong zzso of zzso zzso when zzso was expressed zzso in zzso suggests that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso is expressed specifically in root zzso and the abundance of the zzso is strongly influenced by zzso zzso During zzso of zzso the abundance of zzso corresponding to zzso and the capacity of the roots to take up zzso both zzso Upon zzso of zzso the abundance of the zzso corresponding to zzso and the capacity of the roots to take up zzso decrease zzso zzso with rises in tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to plants grown with adequate zzso supply, leads to increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rates and tissue contents of zzso and zzso It is suggested, that whilst zzso zzso and zzso may be candidates for negative zzso regulators of zzso zzso gene zzso this regulation may be overridden by zzso acting as a positive zzso
