zzso the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso into the three-dimensional structure of 3 zzso zzso zzso shows that these two zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso have similar zzso in spite of very limited sequence identity zzso Conservation of zzso structures is greatest over the first two thirds of the zzso zzso where the typical zzso binding fold is zzso including the five first zzso with only two short deletions or insertions up to zzso zzso The remaining thirds of each of the zzso zzso have significantly different architecture, including insertions that may contribute to zzso zzso and, except for an additional zzso zzso zzso are difficult to zzso Active site relationships can be evaluated and zzso interactions predicted, suggesting that the alpha E + alpha F zzso surface constitutes the major zzso interacting area, forming a zzso unit in the zzso zzso
