zzso zzso is a zzso toxin that activates the plant plasma membrane zzso by binding with zzso zzso causing membrane zzso Here we report on the effect of zzso on a zzso zzso response and show that zzso application zzso the expression of several genes involved in plant responses to zzso Ten members of the zzso zzso protein gene family were isolated from tomato zzso zzso to characterize their role in defense zzso zzso analysis is suggestive of common zzso functions for these tomato zzso zzso but their genes showed different expression patterns in leaves after zzso Different specific zzso of zzso genes were induced after treatment with zzso and during a zzso resistance zzso zzso roles for the zzso and zzso proteins in responses to pathogens are zzso
