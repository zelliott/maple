A complementary DNA zzso library has been constructed in zzso zzso 10 from zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso By differential plaque filter zzso a zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso has been zzso The expression of the zzso gene is studied at various stages of normal fruit development and in fruits of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso Northern analyses of zzso isolated from zzso and zzso fruits of various zzso stages revealed that zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso clone is zzso during normal fruit development, and the level of zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso Furthermore, results with both normal and zzso zzso zzso fruit indicate that there is a positive correlation between growth of zzso fruit and repression of zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and is zzso zzso in zzso The deduced protein has 111 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The putative zzso starts at zzso position 20 and ends at zzso The molecular weight of the predicted zzso is in agreement with the molecular weight of the in zzso translated zzso of hybrid selected zzso A comparison of the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso with zzso and protein sequences in data banks has not revealed any zzso to known zzso
