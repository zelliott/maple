We studied the expression of the human cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso from which a key zzso containing zzso zzso at the active site is zzso zzso of some human zzso gene zzso in zzso cells revealed that the zzso untranslated region zzso was necessary for expression of the zzso zzso since zzso genes having 10 base pairs zzso at the zzso (the complete had 311 zzso expressed zzso at very low zzso The genes with 311 or zzso zzso at the zzso were better expressed than those having zzso zzso The zzso gene having 133 zzso at the zzso zzso zzso shorter than the entire zzso was highly zzso This deletion did not influence zzso We constructed some zzso in which 3 bases were altered at the upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso in the frame of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression decreased but the expression was zzso zzso the upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso was not essential in the zzso decoding zzso Finally, the zzso was essential for the expression of zzso zzso However, the deletion of a part of the zzso and the zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso did not show drastic effects on the zzso
