The high overall genetic zzso between humans and zzso zzso coupled with the zzso conservation of zzso zzso highlights the potential use of nonhuman primates zzso for the zzso evaluation of vaccine zzso For zzso experimental models are needed to identify vaccine regimens capable of zzso desired immune responses, such as broadly zzso zzso zzso One important zzso target on the zzso envelope zzso zzso is the zzso primary zzso zzso binding site zzso The isolation and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso individuals have provided insights into how broadly zzso zzso target this zzso zzso In contrast, and for reasons that are not zzso current zzso zzso elicit zzso zzso with limited zzso zzso To facilitate the use of the zzso model to address this and other questions relevant to human zzso zzso we defined features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared these to the human zzso zzso We then studied zzso zzso zzso identified single B cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso and expressed a panel of functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed differences in the degree of zzso zzso of the zzso as well as in the fine zzso targeted within the zzso These data support the use of the zzso zzso model to characterize zzso B cell responses at high zzso
