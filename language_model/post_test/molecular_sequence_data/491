zzso DNA replication requires the coordinated activity of the zzso DNA zzso Pol zzso Pol delta and Pol zzso The zzso zzso and regulatory B zzso associate in a zzso zzso that represents the functional core of all three zzso zzso Here, we combine X-ray zzso and electron zzso zzso to describe zzso interaction and zzso architecture of zzso zzso Pol zzso The crystal structure of the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso bound to the B zzso illustrates a zzso mechanism of accessory factor recruitment by zzso zzso The zzso reconstructions of Pol alpha reveal a zzso shape with separate zzso and regulatory zzso zzso of the zzso complex in the zzso reconstruction shows that the B zzso is zzso to the zzso domain through a structured but flexible zzso Our combined findings provide a structural template for the common functional architecture of the three major zzso DNA zzso
