zzso (also known as zzso is a recently identified zzso belonging to the zzso zzso It plays a putative role in the regulation of food zzso in the stress response and in reproduction by zzso the zzso zzso zzso In a previous study, we prepared zzso acid zzso human zzso as a zzso for the study of zzso zzso which necessitated a complicated zzso zzso strategy because human zzso contains four primary zzso zzso all of which react with the primary zzso modification zzso To simplify the zzso zzso in the present study we created an easily zzso zzso analogue of human zzso with only one primary zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The analogue retained full activity and could be easily zzso by various functional zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso analogue retained high binding affinity for its zzso zzso zzso and thus represents a useful, zzso and stable zzso for studying the interaction of zzso with various natural or synthetic zzso This new analogue is also a suitable template for the design of other zzso zzso that can be easily zzso with the zzso zzso and used to study binding activity and interactions with various zzso zzso in the zzso
