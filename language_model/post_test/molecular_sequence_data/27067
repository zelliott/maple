zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso zzso disorder that eventually zzso to zzso failure, depending upon the extent of zzso Its basic zzso is impaired zzso zzso of zzso and calcium in the thick ascending limb of the loop of zzso zzso due to a genetic zzso in zzso (a tight junction protein expressed in zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso formerly called zzso gene zzso have been linked to zzso 

An extended Egyptian family with more than one member affection by zzso was included and thoroughly investigated in the current study after giving informed zzso zzso history was taken for zzso zzso and zzso symptoms, as well as clinical examination with stress on zzso zzso and zzso evaluation for zzso and zzso Laboratory zzso for the differential diagnosis of zzso was done: complete zzso including urinary calcium zzso urine pH and zzso zzso blood gas zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function tests as well as zzso and zzso hormone zzso DNA extraction from peripheral blood zzso was done followed by amplification using zzso previously zzso zzso and finally sequencing to analyze each zzso of the zzso zzso 

Two zzso for a zzso couple were affected by zzso and showed persistent zzso zzso zzso with persistently alkaline urine and zzso manifestations in the form of zzso zzso high zzso and retinal zzso The elder zzso showed zzso abnormalities in the form of zzso and zzso These two zzso had a zzso zzso deletion in zzso 1 of the zzso gene zzso zzso del zzso zzso zzso causing a frame shift zzso zzso zzso however, their parents were zzso carriers for that zzso 

The zzso clinical data in the two affected zzso together with the family history of zzso zzso disease associated with zzso and high zzso suggested a diagnosis of zzso which was confirmed for the first time in an Egyptian family by a novel zzso in zzso 1 of the zzso zzso Genitourinary associations with zzso have not yet been reported in the zzso Here, we will try to highlight the principles of zzso detection based on sequencing with the use of the online zzso databases, statistics and other search zzso
