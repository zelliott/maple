Two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso A gene for zzso zzso has been isolated from a barley zzso library and the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene is located on barley zzso 5 while the gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso is carried on zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene contains a single zzso zzso zzso that is inserted in zzso 25 of a sequence zzso a signal zzso of 28 zzso zzso The coding region of the mature zzso is characterized by a high zzso content, which results from an extreme bias towards the use of these zzso in the zzso base position of zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the gene has enabled the complete primary structure of the zzso to be zzso zzso zzso shows zzso zzso identity with the primary sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso and zzso acid zzso However, the zzso sequences of the two genes diverge markedly in their 3' untranslated zzso zzso sites of the two genes were defined by Northern analysis using zzso zzso specific for these 3' untranslated regions and by amplifying specific zzso through the zzso chain zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene is restricted to the zzso layer of zzso zzso In contrast, the gene for zzso zzso is transcribed at relatively high levels in young leaves, but also in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
