The zzso zzso proteins bind 3' untranslated region zzso sequence elements to regulate the stability and translation of their target zzso and such regulatory events are critical for cell growth and zzso Several global zzso analyses have identified hundreds of potential zzso targets of the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, only three zzso targets for these proteins have been characterized thus zzso After direct testing of nearly 40 candidate zzso we established two of these as true zzso targets of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso In a novel finding, multiple zzso zzso including zzso regulate both of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso individually by zzso and zzso but the combination of both proteins is required for full zzso This zzso zzso requires the presence of two zzso binding sites within the zzso 3' zzso with one site regulated by zzso and the other by both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso site in the zzso 3' zzso to more closely resemble the zzso binding site zzso the specificity to include regulation by zzso The stability of the zzso transcribed zzso zzso cellular levels of zzso protein activity, and zzso 3' zzso zzso are affected by zzso and zzso as well as zzso Together these results identify the first zzso targets of zzso zzso describe similar yet distinct zzso control of two new target zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and suggest the importance of direct testing to evaluate zzso zzso
