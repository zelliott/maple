To characterize zzso strains of zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso found in the Second National zzso zzso Study on zzso in China and to analyze its sequence variation in the zzso zzso region during the First National zzso zzso Study zzso 1996 - 1998) to the Second National zzso zzso Study zzso 2001 - zzso 

DNA was extracted from zzso blood zzso cells of the subjects with zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso was amplified with zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso products were directly zzso using zzso 377 DNA zzso then the zzso zzso tree was constructed and its variation of zzso acids was analyzed with zzso zzso 

zzso 169 strains of zzso zzso zzso were identified from blood samples collected from different high risk groups in 17 of 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions all over China by the end of zzso Although sexual transmission still dominated during zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevalence of zzso zzso in intravenous drug users zzso increased to zzso zzso during zzso from zzso zzso during zzso zzso tree analysis showed that zzso zzso strains prevalent in zzso during zzso did not cluster with those prevalent in the subjects infected by sexual transmission during zzso and those in zzso during zzso The zzso acid zzso of zzso region of zzso zzso in zzso were relatively conservative, but the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso region displayed regular zzso 

zzso zzso strain has been introduced into inland provinces from zzso coast areas and southwestern border areas, with an increasing prevalence in zzso The sequence of zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso strains prevalent in zzso during zzso was obviously different from that during zzso suggesting that zzso zzso strains prevalent in zzso during zzso might come from a new source and have a potential to zzso
