zzso arrayed duplicate genes are zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a tandem zzso that consists of the zzso alpha and zzso The rate of zzso unequal zzso at zzso is zzso higher when a zzso is present than when it is absent zzso zzso When a sequence zzso zzso is available, zzso of zzso zzso are generated via zzso with the zzso rather than with the sister zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso zzso events involved alpha rather than zzso These results indicate that: zzso the zzso is the preferred template for unequal zzso and zzso pairing of the duplicated segments with the zzso does not occur randomly but instead favors a particular zzso The choice of zzso template zzso zzso zzso sister zzso affects the distribution of zzso zzso within zzso Rates of unequal zzso at zzso are similar to the rate of zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore common and is likely to be responsible for the generation of genetic zzso even within zzso zzso
