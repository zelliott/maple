The structural and functional properties of zzso genetically zzso at positions 103 zzso and 106 zzso were studied by a protein engineering zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso medium in two steps by zzso zzso on zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso was almost the same as that of wild zzso although the optimal pH of activity was slightly shifted to lower pH by the zzso The Gibbs free energy changes of unfolding zzso zzso at 20 degrees C for zzso and zzso were almost the same as that of zzso On the other hand, the structural flexibility of zzso estimated by zzso zzso was significantly increased by the zzso The surface functional properties of zzso zzso were considerably zzso compared to those of zzso zzso These results suggest that structural flexibility is an important governing factor in surface functional properties of zzso regardless of their structural zzso
