White spot syndrome virus zzso is one of the most virulent pathogens affecting zzso shrimp, causing high mortality in infected zzso zzso between virus structural proteins are likely to be important for virus zzso Many steps of the zzso assembly and maturation zzso remain zzso In the present study, the interaction between zzso and envelope or zzso proteins was zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and confirmed by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso treatment to separate the envelope and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso was confirmed further by His pull-down and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso The binding zzso of zzso with zzso by zzso confirmed that the 2 proteins had direct interaction in zzso This discovery will help zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
