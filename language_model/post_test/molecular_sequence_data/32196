This paper sums up the results of light zzso zzso and molecular studies of five strains of zzso organisms isolated as zzso from zzso fluid of sea zzso zzso zzso zzso collected in the zzso zzso The organisms are reported as zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso the attached zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso bodies was not zzso Although zzso analyses of zzso zzso sequences indicated a close relationship with zzso zzso our zzso strains have not been assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of either one or two zzso reported in zzso closely related organisms and mutually distant zzso positions of strains declared as representatives of the zzso zzso justify our zzso Data obtained in this study may be useful in future analyses of relationships of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in zzso zzso of zzso
