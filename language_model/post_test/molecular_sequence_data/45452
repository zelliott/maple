zzso zzso zzso which regulate various processes involving zzso have two zzso zzso as a zzso core to alter zzso zzso zzso We determined the zzso A resolution structure of the core of the zzso zzso protein zzso in complex with a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso The zzso analog zzso interacts with both of the zzso thereby bringing them into the closed form, with many zzso interactions of zzso zzso The bound zzso is sharply bent, avoiding a clash with a zzso alpha zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso should disrupt base pairs by zzso one of the strands when a duplex is zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso interactions couple zzso zzso to zzso zzso probably through fine positioning of the duplex relative to the wedge zzso This zzso which differs from those for zzso zzso zzso may enable the targeted zzso of intricate zzso zzso
