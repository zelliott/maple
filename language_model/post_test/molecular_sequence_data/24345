zzso directly control the nucleation and growth of zzso but the details of molecular recognition at the zzso interface remain poorly zzso The zzso of recognition mechanisms at this interface may provide design principles for advanced materials development in medical and ceramic composite zzso Here, we have used solid-state zzso techniques to provide the first high-resolution structural and dynamic characterization of a hydrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to its biologically relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary structure for the zzso zzso region was determined using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both sets of experiments indicate the zzso is zzso in character with the zzso directly binding to the zzso being stabilized in the zzso zzso by the presence of zzso Dynamic zzso studies demonstrate that the highly zzso zzso is strongly zzso and immobilized on the zzso surface, while the middle and zzso regions of this domain are mobile and thus zzso interacting with the mineral zzso The direct binding footprint of zzso is thus localized to the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso Study of a zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of the only zzso side chain outside of this domain did not affect the dynamics of zzso on the zzso surface, suggesting that it does not play an important role in zzso zzso
