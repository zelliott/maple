zzso zzso has been notorious as an zzso in which the replication origins are difficult to zzso Although extensive efforts have been exerted on this issue, the locations of replication origins still remain elusive 7 years after the publication of its complete zzso sequence in zzso zzso results were obtained in identifying the replication origins of zzso zzso based on all theoretical and experimental zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso we found that an zzso zzso zzso as a hypothetical zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso The position of the gene is at a global minimum of the zzso component of the Z curve, zzso zzso disparity curve, which has been used to identify replication origins in other zzso In addition, an zzso region zzso zzso that is between the zzso gene and an adjacent zzso shows almost all the characteristics of known replication origins, zzso it is highly rich in AT composition zzso and contains multiple copies of repeat elements and AT zzso zzso these lines of evidence strongly suggest that the identified region is a replication origin, which is designated as zzso The analysis of the y component of the Z curve, zzso zzso disparity curve, suggests the presence of another replication origin corresponding to one of the zzso in the zzso disparity curve at around zzso zzso of the zzso
