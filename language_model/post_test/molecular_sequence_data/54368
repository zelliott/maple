zzso zzso is one of the most important zzso zzso yet it is not well zzso Genome sequence analyses of zzso zzso bacteria would shed light on the understanding of this zzso In this study, the complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described and compared with that of the closely related Antarctic surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has fewer zzso genes than zzso indicating a possible sensitivity to zzso oxygen zzso zzso experimental results showed that zzso was less tolerant of zzso than zzso zzso has gene clusters related to both polar and lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso which are usually present in zzso bacteria and absent in the related surface bacteria, are important for the survival of zzso in zzso zzso With these two zzso systems, zzso can swim in sea water and swarm on the zzso particle surface, favoring the acquisition of nutrients from particulate organic matter and reflecting the zzso alternative lifestyle of zzso in the deep zzso A total of 12 zzso islands were identified in the zzso of zzso that may zzso specific features unique to zzso and absent from zzso such as drug and heavy metal zzso Many signal zzso genes and a zzso production zzso were also present in the zzso zzso which may help zzso respond to food zzso and store carbon and energy in a zzso zzso
