Experimental zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a complex and multifaceted disease zzso by several different zzso zzso There is a zzso progression of the disease affecting the anterior and zzso segments of the eye, culminating with destruction of the zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso on different cell types within the zzso The zzso cells of the peripheral zzso are damaged at the onset of zzso at day zzso There is induction of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in the peripheral retinal zzso cells with zzso reduction in the zzso zzso zzso By day 12 of zzso intensely zzso zzso cells are detected throughout the peripheral and central zzso and with zzso diminution of the zzso zzso There is a lag in the diminution of the zzso zzso first detected at day 12 of zzso and reaching its maximum at day zzso This change in the zzso is associated with destruction of the tips of the zzso zzso These results indicate that during zzso zzso zzso there is a positive correlation between the zzso changes in retinal zzso zzso expression by zzso cells, and loss of retinal zzso
