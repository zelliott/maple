The zzso zzso oxide zzso known as zzso or zzso zzso is only present in adult brain during zzso that involve inflammatory zzso We sought to establish whether zzso was also expressed in the course of normal brain zzso zzso zzso measured by quantitative zzso chain reaction, appeared during the zzso period in different brain zzso It was detected on embryonic day 14, the earliest time zzso and then levels decayed until the first zzso week when a second, more robust phase of expression arose to peak around zzso day zzso zzso then declined to negligible levels in zzso zzso revealed translation of the zzso protein in both embryonic and zzso animals, localized to zzso blood vessels, whereas no vessel zzso was detected in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso activities were present in isolated brain zzso from developing animals but not from adults, and zzso vessels contained a 125 zzso protein band detected with a zzso zzso raised against rat zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso and functional protein are zzso expressed in vessels throughout the brain in the course of normal zzso
