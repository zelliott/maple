The zzso 4 zzso zzso comprises an zzso of surface zzso from zzso cells and from the human blood zzso Member proteins of the zzso are characterized by the presence of four zzso zzso which are presumed to be zzso and specific zzso zzso The zzso group of zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso from blood zzso shows potential as zzso and vaccine target zzso for use in controlling human zzso Here we describe a zzso from zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso which apparently encodes a new member of the zzso The deduced zzso termed zzso has substantial zzso acid zzso to zzso from zzso zzso although it is not a species zzso of zzso zzso is predicted to span the cell membrane four times, with its zzso and zzso embedded in the zzso and to have two zzso zzso zzso one of which may be zzso This zzso is characteristic of zzso zzso in addition, zzso contains the sequence motifs zzso in the zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso are zzso by genes at separate zzso and, further, showed zzso variation at the locus zzso zzso in Chinese and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
