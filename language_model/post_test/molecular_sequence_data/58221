The zzso zzso recognized by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which inhibit binding of zzso to the zzso zzso was characterized by means of peptides zzso on pins zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso Both zzso showed very similar zzso They recognized a linear zzso the essential portion of which was the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso located between two zzso sites of the zzso zzso All the zzso acid zzso of the zzso except zzso were essential for zzso zzso since they could not be replaced by any other zzso acid zzso or by only one or zzso The zzso zzso could be replaced by most other zzso acid zzso and its replacement by 10 zzso acid zzso gave a distinct increase in the zzso zzso The results were in full agreement with the finding that the zzso of the zzso zzso lacking zzso acid zzso zzso zzso did not bind the zzso zzso but bound the zzso zzso zzso similarly to the wild type of the zzso zzso The apparent affinity zzso of both zzso zzso were determined by surface zzso zzso using zzso zzso protein as a zzso
