The durability and functionality of a zzso coating on artificial heart valve leaflets were evaluated with X-ray zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso capacity to bind zzso Current methods for accelerated zzso testing are based on exposing leaflets to water zzso In this paper a method is zzso in which heart valve leaflets were exposed to a continuous high zzso rate (4 zzso of human zzso zzso It was found that the zzso coating was stable and wear resistant enough to still be present after 3 weeks and to have about the same zzso zzso as zzso not exposed to circulating zzso It was, however, partly destroyed by the test as found using zzso We suggest that zzso chains from the upper layer of zzso have been torn off from the carrier chain, in combination with loss of zzso zzso and plasma deposition in zzso This study showed that zzso provides additional information to biological zzso such as zzso zzso zzso is therefore a valuable technique not only to characterize zzso but also to evaluate the effect of a performance zzso
