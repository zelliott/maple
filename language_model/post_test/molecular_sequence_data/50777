zzso of zzso and zzso strains of zzso disease virus type 1 zzso was attempted by zzso chain reaction zzso using the zzso chosen from the sequence within the long zzso repeats of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extracted from zzso cells and zzso disease tumor cell lines produced a major product containing two or three copies of zzso zzso repeat units, whereas zzso of the zzso extracted from zzso cells yielded amplified products with various sizes corresponding to the number of zzso repeat zzso The zzso chosen from the zzso A genes of zzso and zzso of zzso also were used for determination of their zzso zzso The zzso procedure was found to be a simple and sensitive procedure for identification of zzso and zzso of zzso and for zzso of zzso of zzso
