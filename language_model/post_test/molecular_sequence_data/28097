The acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso D, were shown to generate mast cell zzso releasing peptides zzso when incubated with the zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso release was observed using less than 1 zzso equivalent of zzso zzso zzso release was zzso dependent on calcium and energy, and accompanied by zzso The major zzso present in zzso human and canine plasma was identified as zzso whereas that from rat plasma had zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso gave rise to the human zzso (above) as well as to an extended zzso with zzso at the zzso These peptides were apparently derived from one region of serum zzso zzso 139 to 149 of the human, zzso or bovine zzso We zzso that zzso D, released from zzso zzso might generate zzso during the delayed phase of an inflammatory zzso
