zzso zzso of zzso proteins play a critical role in cellular processes involving interactions between membrane and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell respiratory burst zzso the electron transport chain responsible for zzso zzso zzso production, requires membrane components including zzso zzso and several zzso zzso but the zzso interactions of these components are poorly zzso zzso zzso is an electron transport component of the zzso A role for zzso zzso in the organization or integration of other zzso components has also been zzso zzso binding the zzso zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso specifically inhibited an zzso zzso zzso system that requires zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides encompassing a zzso acid zzso sequence zzso within the same region of the zzso zzso blocked zzso of the zzso by zzso but did not affect activity of the assembled zzso when added after zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The same peptides inhibited zzso of the respiratory burst when allowed to diffuse into zzso zzso zzso before stimulation with zzso or zzso zzso zzso These studies define a functional zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which may mediate interactions with other cellular proteins essential to zzso of the zzso respiratory zzso
