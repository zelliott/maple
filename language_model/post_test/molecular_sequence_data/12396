zzso is a protein of zzso zzso acids from zzso zzso that acts as a zzso and zzso of several early zzso zzso zzso zzso near the zzso the zzso acid zzso in which the zzso of the six zzso zzso are identical to those found in 39 zzso zzso DNA binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso This sequence has been shown in zzso and other proteins to form a zinc zzso zzso In spite of the different location, the zzso zzso cloned and zzso within the last 111 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso forms a zzso cluster and exhibits a zzso binding to the zzso DNA zzso The latter, zzso is required for the repression or zzso of zzso genes by zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and the zzso can be exchanged for zzso to yield a protein containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At 5 degrees C, zzso shows two zzso zzso signals, with chemical shifts of zzso and zzso zzso similar to those observed for zzso The magnitude of these chemical shifts suggests that each zzso nucleus is coordinated to four zzso zzso compatible with a zzso cluster structure in which two zzso from bridging zzso The entire zzso gene has been cloned and zzso and binds more tightly to the zzso sequence than the zinc zzso cluster domain zzso zzso I zzso of zzso on zzso DNA show that the protein protects the zzso of the zzso region within the zzso zzso
