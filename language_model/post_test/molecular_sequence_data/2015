A comparative analysis of zzso gene clusters zzso the structural genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried out in three species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the structural genes for the three zzso of zzso zzso M zzso while the two other genes zzso zzso of unknown zzso The degree of conservation of the zzso gene products among different species of zzso zzso No correlation was found between the conservation of the zzso contents of the zzso genes and of the zzso acid sequences of their products among the different zzso The comparison of zzso zzso core zzso genes of zzso zzso as evolutionary markers with their zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso are zzso by different numbers of genes suggesting gene fusion of adjacent genes in the course of zzso The zzso zzso exhibit much stronger zzso with their zzso than with their zzso zzso on the zzso sequence zzso All the analyzed genes are preceded by zzso binding sites of zzso zzso In addition to known putative promoter zzso zzso structural elements of the DNA were detected surrounding the zzso initiation sites of the zzso zzso
