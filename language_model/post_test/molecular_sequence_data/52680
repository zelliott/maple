The effect of zzso zzso on folding has been investigated for a triple zzso of zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso The zzso contains a single zzso His zzso at position 26, a location at which His zzso are found in several zzso c zzso including zzso tuna, and zzso zzso The zzso for fast phase folding exhibits a strong initial pH zzso For zzso unfolded protein at an initial zzso the observed zzso at final pH 6 is dominated by a fast phase zzso zzso zzso zzso that represents folding in the absence of zzso For unfolded protein at initial pH 6, folding at final pH 6 occurs in a fast phase of reduced zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso but the same rate zzso zzso and in two slower zzso zzso seconds, zzso approximately 45 zzso and zzso seconds, zzso approximately 35 zzso Double jump experiments show that the initial pH dependence of the folding zzso results from a slow zzso equilibrium between fast and slow folding species present in the unfolded zzso The slow equilibrium arises from zzso of the His zzso equilibrium to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, zzso is predominantly in trans in the zzso zzso unfolded zzso but is constrained in a non-native zzso zzso state by zzso zzso near neutral zzso zzso from the zzso unfolded form proceeds slowly due to the large energetic barrier required for zzso zzso and displacement of the zzso zzso zzso
