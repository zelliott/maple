A gene zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso active site of the zzso zzso The zzso and 3' regions of the gene were amplified using a zzso technique for the rapid amplification of zzso zzso The cloned gene has an open reading frame of 687 zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso analysis and alignment showed significant zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and conservation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso that form a zzso zzso Analysis of the expressed protein on sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that the molecular weight of the protein was approximately zzso zzso The expressed protein reacted with the zzso of patients with zzso but not with the zzso of zzso and zzso These results suggest that the expressed protein may be valuable as a specific diagnostic material for the zzso of zzso
