DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso which is related to terminal zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso is thought to be involved in zzso end joining and zzso zzso Pol zzso is induced by zzso radiation and exhibits low zzso Analysis of zzso replication by zzso human pol zzso revealed that it zzso a synthetic zzso site with high efficiency, using primarily a zzso zzso It can also replicate across two tandem zzso sites, using the same zzso Pol zzso extends zzso whose zzso zzso are located opposite the zzso zzso Most zzso this extension occurs via a mode of zzso zzso activity, which does not depend on the sequence of the zzso This is not due to simple terminal zzso zzso activity, because pol zzso is unable to add zzso to an zzso primer or to a blunt end duplex zzso under standard zzso Thus, pol zzso is a dual mode zzso zzso which can act as either a classical DNA zzso or as a zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on a zzso zzso with such zzso These activities may be required for its function in zzso end joining in the processing of DNA ends prior to zzso
