zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso is a precursor for the synthesis of numerous zzso zzso in bacteria and zzso Using a zzso screen, a gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was identified and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene belongs to a small gene family composed of six zzso All members of the zzso gene family zzso a putative zzso membrane protein and have two zzso a variable zzso region approximately 120 zzso acids long composed of a predicted zzso zzso and stem domain, followed by a large zzso zzso zzso region approximately 300 zzso acids long composed of a highly zzso zzso domain found in a large protein family of zzso The zzso zzso has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 43 zzso although zzso zzso suggests that it may exist as a zzso zzso 88 zzso zzso forms zzso with an equilibrium constant value of approximately zzso and has an apparent zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso The zzso has maximum activity at pH zzso and is active between 20 degrees C and 55 degrees zzso zzso zzso is not inhibited by zzso zzso or zzso However, the zzso is inhibited by zzso and zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso have a role in regulating the synthesis of zzso The cloning of the zzso gene will increase our ability to investigate the molecular factors that regulate zzso zzso in zzso The availability of a functional zzso zzso zzso will be of considerable value for the facile generation of zzso in the amounts required for detailed studies of zzso zzso
