zzso derived from the sequence of the zzso domain of the zzso heavy chain were tested for their effects on the regulation of cardiac zzso zzso calcium responsiveness of the zzso apparatus in terms of zzso tension generation and zzso was determined in chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a series of peptides derived from the zzso sequence around zzso zzso group zzso zzso resulted in a measurable increase in zzso tension and zzso activity at zzso zzso of calcium but not at zzso levels of calcium activity, thus demonstrating a zzso effect of these zzso The effects of two of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are demonstrated to zzso but zzso were not additive with, the calcium zzso induced by lowering zzso concentration to 10 zzso from 10 zzso This suggests the possibility of a similar mechanism of action underlying both types of zzso Because these effects demonstrate tissue zzso were sensitive with respect to potency to not only zzso acid composition but also zzso and could not be duplicated by a similarly charged, zzso zzso we attribute the effects to be specific to the sequences of these zzso These data provide further evidence that the sequence between zzso 687 and zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso heavy chain influences the calcium responsiveness of the zzso zzso
