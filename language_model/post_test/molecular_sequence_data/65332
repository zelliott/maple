With the introduction of zzso vaccination in India, surveillance of circulating zzso strains has gained zzso The aim of the present study was to achieve molecular characterization of circulating zzso virus zzso strains and differentiation from the zzso vaccine zzso In this study, the zzso of 100 clinical zzso strains was zzso zzso fluid was collected from patients with zzso infections zzso cases of zzso and 8 cases of zzso zzso The zzso analysis of two zzso zzso zzso restriction site in zzso 38 and a zzso restriction site in zzso 54 was used to characterize and differentiate them from the vaccine zzso All the zzso strains were positive for the zzso restriction site in zzso zzso This differentiated them from the zzso vaccine strain, which is zzso zzso The zzso strains as well as the zzso vaccine strain were positive for the zzso restriction site in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of all the zzso strains examined had the zzso pattern represented as zzso zzso None of the strains had the zzso zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso strain or the zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso zzso and zzso serve as good reference markers in the zzso of circulating zzso strains in India and serve to differentiate them from the vaccine strain as well as other zzso zzso
