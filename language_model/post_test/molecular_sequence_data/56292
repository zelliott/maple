zzso genes have been found in both lower and higher zzso They code for proteins of 21 zzso highly zzso in evolution, which belong to the zzso of zzso zzso Among the members of this zzso there are proteins with a regulatory function, such as zzso and proteins involved in zzso trafficking, such as the family of zzso zzso We have investigated the putative role of zzso proteins from zzso zzso as transforming zzso utilizing the zzso and a zzso zzso equivalent to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes found in animal and human zzso zzso of either zzso gene was sufficient to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, when introduced into nude mice, selected clones generated from either gene were able to induce tumors, although those carrying the zzso version were more zzso zzso analysis indicated that generated tumors corresponded to zzso zzso with distinct and zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso tumors were poorly differentiated zzso Thus, our results indicate that under appropriate conditions zzso genes function as zzso and may have a role in the regulation of proliferation in zzso zzso
