Engineering proteins that can fold to unique structures remains a zzso zzso stability has previously been engineered via the observed correlation between zzso stability and zzso zzso zzso To explore the limits of an zzso approach, zzso of the highly zzso zzso bundle protein zzso were studied using zzso surface zzso A library of zzso zzso was created to explore the possible correlation of protein stability and fold with expression zzso Five efficiently expressed zzso were then zzso and further studied zzso Despite their differences in stability, most zzso expressed at levels comparable with that of zzso zzso Two other related sequences zzso and zzso that form collapsed, stable molten zzso but lack a uniquely folded structure were similarly expressed at high levels by zzso zzso Together these observations suggest that the quality control system in zzso is unable to discriminate between zzso proteins of high stability and molten zzso The present study, therefore, suggests that an zzso of the surface display efficiency on zzso may yield proteins that are zzso and chemically stable yet are poorly zzso
