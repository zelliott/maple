We isolated a novel zzso species from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined its gene zzso This novel zzso was termed zzso zzso from its length zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to other related zzso suggests that its existence is restricted to the zzso zzso or related zzso A high level of zzso of this zzso was observed by Northern analysis, indicating that zzso zzso is stable in zzso zzso prediction of the zzso zzso secondary structure also supports its zzso
