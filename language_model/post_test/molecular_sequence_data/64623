The zzso zzso protein zzso is a component of a zzso complex whose levels are drastically decreased in the blood during zzso It is highly zzso to zzso zzso In the zzso several zzso genes in addition to zzso (or zzso are expressed in the liver and have distinct patterns of regulation during zzso in zzso zzso the level of zzso gene expression is greatly reduced, that of the zzso gene is slightly increased, and the expression of the zzso gene is hardly zzso As a first step towards understanding the zzso gene regulation of these zzso zzso zzso we isolated zzso clones for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and analyzed their promoter zzso These zzso genes are composed of five zzso and show a similar gene structure to that of the human zzso zzso suggesting that they were generated by the zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso and zzso cells revealed that for all three zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso sequences were sufficient for the zzso promoter activity, and that the binding of zzso to the promoter region could zzso zzso In addition, analysis of the activity of zzso promoters composed of zzso and zzso gene sequences indicated that the lack of a zzso zzso sequence in the zzso gene is responsible for its weak promoter zzso
