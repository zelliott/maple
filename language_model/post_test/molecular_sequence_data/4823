Studies on frequency and distribution pattern of zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha protein zzso zzso in toxic zzso zzso zzso reported conflicting results, most likely also related to the different screening methods applied and the investigation of only part of zzso 10 of the zzso zzso we screened a consecutive series of 31 zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso by direct sequencing of zzso 9 and the entire zzso 10 of the zzso gene and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in 15 of 31 zzso zzso zzso were localized in the third zzso loop zzso and zzso the sixth zzso segment zzso and zzso zzso and the second zzso loop zzso One zzso was found in the zzso zzso domain zzso Two new zzso zzso were zzso One involves zzso 656 in the third zzso loop zzso The other new zzso is a zzso deletion in the third zzso loop resulting in deletion of 9 zzso acids at zzso zzso zzso expression of the new zzso zzso in zzso cells demonstrated their zzso zzso No zzso was found in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This finding was confirmed by an zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso 201 zzso zzso and 227 zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso can be found in zzso of zzso and thus currently represent the most frequent molecular mechanism known in the zzso of zzso Moreover, the absence of zzso zzso in our series argues for an only minor role of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by a deletion in a region that might be involved in G protein zzso of the zzso offers new insights into zzso zzso
