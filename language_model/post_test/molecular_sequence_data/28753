zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso from Antarctic frozen zzso water that grows from 2 to 25 degrees C with optimal growth rate at 20 degrees zzso The new isolate contains two zzso zzso zzso differing in their zzso zzso zzso sizes and arrangements, and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of 47 zzso zzso and it is comparable to other zzso zzso of zzso from bacteria and lower zzso The zzso zzso described in this communication, has a zzso weight of 160 zzso and belongs to the novel class of zzso with large size zzso The zzso is a zzso this zzso arrangement has not been reported previously for zzso Both zzso have an apparent optimum temperature for activity of approximately 20 degrees C, but their cold activities and zzso zzso are zzso The zzso zzso is more cold zzso at 10 C it retains 50% of its zzso activity, compared with zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is more heat stable, losing only zzso activity after heating for 30 zzso compared with zzso for the zzso zzso It is concluded that in zzso zzso zzso not only does zzso zzso have a novel zzso molecular weight and arrangement, but that its zzso chains are folded differently from those of zzso zzso providing different zzso properties to the two zzso
