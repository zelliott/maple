Sand fly and zzso zzso have been lumped for a long time in the single zzso zzso and on the basis of their zzso characters and the lack of zzso been placed into the zzso family zzso zzso analyses performed in this study clearly demonstrated zzso of the current zzso zzso and revealed disparate zzso positions of zzso zzso mosquitoes and zzso retrieved from sand zzso zzso we reclassified the zzso zzso and created a new zzso zzso to accommodate zzso from sand zzso The zzso zzso is distinguished from all other related zzso zzso by the characteristic zzso of zzso in accessory zzso of female zzso distinctive zzso sequences of the small zzso zzso and host specificity to flies belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso comprises three described zzso the type species for the new zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Its creation is additionally supported by sequencing data from other zzso species originating from the sand fly zzso zzso In the evolutionary context, both zzso of zzso from mosquitoes zzso and sand flies zzso have a close relationship to zzso the zzso represent zzso distinct from the other previously zzso zzso
