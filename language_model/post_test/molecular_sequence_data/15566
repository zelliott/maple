The modified zzso zzso zzso is almost universally found in the zzso zzso position of specific zzso In many bacteria, zzso of Q is modulated by a class of regulatory zzso elements called zzso The zzso zzso found in the zzso of bacterial genes involved in synthesis of the Q precursors zzso and zzso contains the smallest known zzso zzso We report the solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso bound to zzso which is a unique compact zzso with three zzso and two stems that encapsulates zzso at the junction between the two zzso The zzso only forms in the presence of zzso and the 3' zzso tail of the zzso domain is an integral part of the zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso tail forms part of the zzso These structural studies provide insight into zzso zzso control of zzso zzso
