zzso that predict therapeutic response are essential for the development of zzso zzso We have used zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso to directly analyze protein profiles in mouse zzso tumor zzso transgenic mouse frozen tumor sections after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tumor cell proliferation and induction of zzso and tumor reduction were predicted by a zzso reduction in zzso zzso and zzso levels that were zzso after 16 hours of a single drug dose before any evidence of in zzso cellular zzso These effects were zzso and zzso and their spatial distribution in the tumor correlated with that of the zzso inhibitor zzso In addition, they predicted for therapeutic zzso of zzso and zzso as well as for drug zzso These results suggest that drug-induced early zzso changes as measured by zzso can be used to predict the therapeutic response to established and novel zzso
