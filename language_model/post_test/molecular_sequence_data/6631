The zzso genes zzso the proteins involved in iron transport in the zzso iron zzso system were found to be flanked by zzso sequences in a composite zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are related to zzso zzso and the zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso direct zzso zzso The zzso repeats at the ends of zzso and zzso have no more than three zzso when compared to the zzso repeats of the other zzso or zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are flanked by zzso direct repeats, which is the number of bases that are duplicated upon zzso or zzso zzso The similarities found between the zzso zzso zzso and the other zzso as well as zzso and zzso suggest that they derive from a common ancestral zzso zzso At the end of zzso there is a zzso sequence region followed by a zzso sequence found in the zzso sequence immediately outside the zzso This promoter region is followed by an open reading frame with the potential to zzso a zzso of zzso Da whose function is still zzso The functionality of this promoter has been demonstrated and expression analysis showed that the promoter is regulated by the iron concentration of the zzso
