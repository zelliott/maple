zzso peptides are coded for by the zzso sequence zzso zzso of the complementary strand of zzso By reading the sequence of complementary DNA in the zzso direction, alternative complementary peptides may be zzso We describe the zzso testing and analysis of six complementary peptides designed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data is presented to show that one zzso designated 3' zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso zzso and zzso both zzso and zzso in zzso This suggests that complementary peptides could be useful leads for drug discovery, especially where diseases of protein zzso are zzso
