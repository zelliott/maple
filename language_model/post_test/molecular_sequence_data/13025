The dominant Chinese zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was selected for resistance to pea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding studies show that zzso cells express altered cell surface carbohydrates with markedly reduced binding to zzso and increased binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with parental zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso that did not bind to zzso zzso exhibited an increased proportion of species that were bound to zzso Most of these zzso bound to zzso and were unique to zzso zzso This fraction was zzso from approximately zzso cells and shown by zzso zzso zzso and zzso linkage analysis to contain novel zzso zzso zzso of these zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso gave core zzso that, in contrast to zzso from parental cells, were mainly not bound to zzso zzso or to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso showed that the zzso core zzso contained a new zzso zzso that zzso the core zzso zzso zzso linkage analysis of the parent compound provided evidence that the zzso is linked at zzso to give the following novel, zzso core zzso zzso see zzso
