zzso zzso is a member of zzso family, regulators of T cell development and its expression is altered during infection by microbial zzso However, the molecular mechanism involved in zzso expression is still to be zzso In this study, we isolated zzso as a zzso zzso expressed genes zzso in zzso zzso cells and examined expression and regulation of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We defined a zzso start site in the zzso zzso To examine the promoter organization of the zzso zzso we cloned a approximately zzso zzso region upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso analysis indicates consensus sites for zzso and zzso Comprehensive zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveal that functional interaction of zzso and zzso with the promoter element is necessary for the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression by zzso and zzso treatment in zzso In zzso we identified a zzso promoter for the first time and demonstrated that zzso and zzso triggers zzso gene expression by zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso
