An zzso zzso strain, termed strain zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso bacteria zzso combined with zzso bacteria from our previous study and was shown to have ability to reduce nitrate to zzso to either nitrous oxide or molecular zzso Analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences established strain zzso as a member of the species zzso zzso In addition, the ability of strain zzso to zzso various organic zzso as the sole carbon source, supplemented with zzso zzso zzso and zzso compounds, was investigated, and this strain was found to have a narrow zzso range of growth such as zzso zzso ethanol and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso activity, utilizing zzso and zzso as sole carbon sources, was zzso Gene fragments of zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in zzso activities, were zzso cloned and zzso zzso analysis for these two genes showed that both the zzso and zzso zzso although found in separate branches within zzso formed zzso branching from zzso environmental zzso This demonstrated the typical uniqueness of these genes from any cultivated zzso Thus, strain zzso is novel type of zzso bacteria that demonstrated zzso activities when cultivated using zzso as the sole carbon zzso
