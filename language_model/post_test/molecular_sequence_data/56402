zzso is essential for the growth of zzso and the formation of zzso zzso on zzso but its precise role in these processes remains zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso accumulates a major 38 zzso protein when grown in media supplemented with zzso zzso zzso We have zzso this protein and raised zzso zzso against zzso The protein initially is zzso as a 40 zzso precursor which subsequently zzso zzso processing to give rise to the mature zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicate that the 38 zzso protein accumulates zzso in the zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso shows significant zzso to the zzso of zzso acid binding proteins from the zzso including zzso zzso and zzso binding proteins of zzso zzso and zzso coli and a zzso binding protein of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein does not, however, bind zzso The 38 zzso protein is zzso by the bacterial zzso It is absent in several zzso other than zzso zzso but zzso related zzso are present in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso
