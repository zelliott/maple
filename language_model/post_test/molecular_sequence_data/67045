The zzso of zzso zzso express three types of zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso zzso and a zzso zzso We are interested in the zzso role of three zzso We report the sequence of zzso for membrane zzso 1, which consists of zzso zzso that includes an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular weight of membrane zzso 1 was calculated to be zzso based on the predicted zzso acid zzso zzso zzso family 3 zzso and zzso zzso were found within the zzso half of the membrane zzso 1 sequence and were highly zzso with the primary structures of zzso zzso zzso the zzso half of membrane zzso 1 contains two zzso zzso which are known to be zzso binding zzso in the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso which is known to be a cell attachment zzso and a zzso zzso In this way, zzso membrane zzso 1 differs from all previously identified family 3 zzso In addition to zzso for membrane zzso 1, two other distinctly different zzso were also zzso Two sequences were largely identical to zzso for membrane zzso 1, but included a long insert sequence having a stop zzso leading to zzso of their products, which could account for other zzso forms occurred in zzso zzso Thus, the membrane zzso is a new type family 3 zzso fused with the zzso zzso We propose that zzso domain may zzso the zzso activity in response to changes in the zzso zzso
