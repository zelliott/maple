In our initial zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso plant cell cultures, we reported that our most zzso preparations contained a major band at 77 zzso and minor lower Mr zzso Here we present evidence on highly zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cultures to indicate that this zzso is the zzso protein and that lower Mr bands include an zzso of the zzso zzso family that zzso with zzso An zzso raised against the zzso protein and an zzso zzso zzso that recognizes a zzso band were used to monitor zzso zzso by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso blue were compared to corresponding zzso zzso zzso at 77 and 88 zzso were detected with zzso zzso zzso in zzso displaying high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific activity and zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso of the CM and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific activities for each step showed increasing enrichment of zzso zzso accompanied by variable zzso zzso zzso activity zzso Taken together these observations indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso have Mr values of 77 and 70 zzso respectively, and the two zzso are different zzso
