The human type I zzso zzso zzso consists of two essential zzso zzso and zzso however, so far only zzso has been identified in other zzso Furthermore, it has been suggested that in some species the type I zzso zzso may consist of a single zzso since expression of zzso zzso in human cells rendered them responsive to several type I zzso zzso To resolve this issue, we screened a mouse zzso library with a probe derived from zzso zzso A zzso zzso coding for a zzso protein which has zzso identity with zzso was zzso This level of identity suggests that this zzso codes for a zzso In addition, several zzso zzso coding for two distinct soluble zzso of zzso were zzso To test whether zzso is a functional component of the zzso we zzso it with zzso in human cells and with an zzso zzso reporter zzso Treatment of these cells with zzso induced high levels of zzso whereas no induction was obtained in cells expressing only one of the two zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso type I zzso zzso consists of two different zzso zzso shared by humans, and probably all other zzso
