The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two zzso zzso an zzso zzso domain of the zzso acid zzso 1 to 36 and a zzso and a zzso zzso domain including the zzso acid zzso 37 to 65 and a zzso The structure resembles the known zzso and zzso zzso but has a significantly different connectivity pattern of the zzso zzso bonds and zzso contains novel local folds of some zzso backbone zzso These differences can be related to variations of the zzso sequence positions and thus emphasize the special role of the zzso zzso in defining the structure of zzso both on the level of the domain architecture and the zzso of the zzso zzso
