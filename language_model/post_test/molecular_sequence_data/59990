zzso derived from the zzso zzso protein were zzso for studies of zzso binding to zzso molecules and T cell zzso at both neutral and zzso zzso The native zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso at position zzso binds to zzso zzso with a zzso value of zzso at zzso pH and very zzso with a zzso value of greater than 10 zzso at neutral zzso A truncated version of zzso zzso zzso zzso binds with an affinity zzso lower compared to zzso at zzso zzso and binding at neutral pH was barely zzso The zzso zzso zzso has an zzso to Ala substitution at position zzso and binds to zzso with a zzso similar to zzso The short truncated analog zzso binds very poorly at both zzso and neutral zzso Both the wild type zzso and zzso peptides zzso a zzso T cell clone after a brief incubation with zzso presenting cells zzso expressing zzso at zzso zzso Much higher zzso of wild type peptides were needed to activate T cells at neutral zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with zzso peptides zzso or zzso at neutral pH failed to stimulate the T cell zzso while zzso zzso at zzso pH and subsequently washed led to successful T cell zzso The zzso zzso was recognized by the T cell clone at neutral pH only when it was present in the zzso culture throughout the stimulation zzso While the zzso complexes formed with the native zzso are stable, complexes formed with the zzso zzso had a functional zzso of less than 4 zzso at neutral zzso
