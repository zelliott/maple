zzso gene members of the zzso complex are essential for proper development of the zzso zzso zzso of these genes zzso severe zzso in the size and number of zzso zzso zzso a gene related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is located close to zzso and is expressed in limbs like the zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether this tight linkage reflects a functional zzso we produced a zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, and because zzso function is prevalent over that of nearby zzso zzso we generated two different double zzso zzso wherein both zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso The analysis of these various genetic zzso revealed the important function of zzso during the development of the zzso as well as its genetic interaction with zzso These results show that, in zzso zzso functions like a zzso zzso A potential evolutionary scenario is discussed, in which zzso was recruited by the zzso complex in conjunction with the emergence of digits in an ancestral zzso
