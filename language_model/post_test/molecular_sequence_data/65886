To construct two types of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso with progressive zzso zzso patients, and to observe their expression in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of wild type zzso zzso was amplified from human zzso by zzso and zzso zzso was used to obtain full-length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso plasmids zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cells by zzso method, and zzso zzso was used as a zzso The total zzso and protein of the zzso zzso cells were extracted after 48 hours of zzso The expression of zzso gene in the zzso zzso cells was detected by zzso zzso and Western zzso 

By restriction zzso analysis and sequencing, the sequence of zzso and zzso were consistent with that zzso in zzso and the open reading frames matched with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso showed that the zzso plasmids were highly expressed in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso are successfully constructed by genetic zzso and expressed in zzso cells, which lays the foundation for the further study on its molecular functions in zzso
