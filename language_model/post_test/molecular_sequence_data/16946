zzso gene expression is associated with the zzso and migration of neural crest cells in the African clawed zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that the protein zzso 1 zzso regulates the zzso gene expression both indirectly and directly, via a zzso zzso in the zzso promoter, during zzso zzso The ability of the zzso to bind this zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso shift zzso and reporter zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso cells zzso with the process of neural crest zzso The injection of zzso zzso which targeted both zzso and zzso gene products, depleted zzso expression below zzso and was lethal at zzso zzso depletion of zzso reduced the length of the zzso axis and severely inhibited the expression of the neural marker zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso reduced the restricted spatial expression of the zzso reporter gene in the neural zzso border and provoked its expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and with the zzso gene reporter sequence injected into zzso The results suggest that zzso is essential for zzso zzso is necessary for neural zzso zzso a prerequisite for neural crest zzso and restricts which cells can form neural crest zzso through directly blocking zzso gene zzso
