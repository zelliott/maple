As part of a routine screening for the possible presence of the zzso strains of potato virus Y affecting potatoes in Mexico, five zzso zzso were submitted to biological and molecular zzso Considering their zzso properties, two belong to the common strain zzso and three to the zzso strain zzso All the zzso induced vein necrosis in zzso zzso To characterize the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso and compared with sequences from zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity ranged from zzso in the zzso zzso and from zzso in the zzso coding zzso The lowest zzso acid similarity between sequences of zzso gene was zzso In zzso trees of zzso analysis, two zzso Mexican zzso clustered with other zzso zzso In turn, the three zzso zzso grouped with zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso sequences zzso and zzso zzso showed two zzso zzso grouping next to zzso zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso zzso showed two potential zzso regions in the zzso zzso in contrast to zzso where no zzso was zzso
