zzso zzso is a well-known phenomenon for zzso In this study, we determined the zzso relationships of five distinct regions of the zzso zzso for 73 zzso zzso from 1986 and from 1998 to 2005 in zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso isolated in 2004 and 2005 were grouped into zzso zzso However, the zzso region of these zzso differed in that it grouped with zzso B, indicating zzso within zzso had zzso This zzso zzso was first seen in 2002 and became zzso in 2004 and zzso The zzso and zzso analyses identified two zzso points located at the zzso of the 2A and zzso zzso This zzso zzso was identified among naturally circulating zzso zzso in Taiwan, therefore, it suggests that zzso genes may recombine to produce new zzso zzso
