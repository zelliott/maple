In Chinese zzso extended blocks of zzso repeats were previously detected by in zzso zzso at the zzso region of most zzso and short zzso were localized at several zzso zzso In this work, we analyzed the molecular organization of internal zzso sequences zzso in the Chinese zzso zzso In zzso transfers zzso with a zzso probe, multiple zzso insensitive fragments were zzso Most of the fragments ranged in size between less than 1 zzso and more than 100 zzso and some were zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso experiments on DNA fibers and on zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso are composed of extensive and essentially continuous zzso of zzso zzso We then isolated three zzso regions which contain short zzso These zzso are localized at zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and are composed of zzso zzso of zzso zzso A peculiar feature of all the three zzso is the AT richness of the zzso zzso Since zzso DNA is known to be unstable and characteristic of several zzso fragile sites, we propose that the three zzso were inserted at these sites during the repair of double strand zzso
