Plant zzso zzso finger is found to be a versatile reader that functions in recruiting zzso factors and zzso modification zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are identified as scaffold component in a couple of zzso zzso zzso complexes but the biological function of zzso fingers, zzso the motif called zzso zzso zzso in zzso proteins is far from being well zzso Here we report the three-dimensional solution structure of the second zzso finger of zzso in human zzso According to the structure, zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso sheet which is different from any other zzso zzso zzso this zzso finger can potentially bind DNA zzso with an zzso zzso and positively charged zzso We provide the structural and interaction information of this zzso zzso finger and categorize this zzso zzso into a new subset of zzso zzso zzso our work also shed light on the functional aspect of the zzso
