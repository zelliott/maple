zzso and their zzso derivatives zzso play essential roles in the pigmentation of flowers and zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso flowers are intensely yellow due to zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso To study the regulation of zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Two deletions and one zzso zzso in different zzso zzso zzso abolish zzso zzso in flowers but not leaves, where the zzso zzso is zzso zzso A second zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lycopene zzso together define a zzso zzso zzso active in zzso only, zzso the crucial role of gene zzso in specialized plant zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso in tomato was initially selected during evolution to enhance flower zzso and only later recruited to enhance fruit zzso The elimination of zzso zzso in zzso petals results in an zzso reduction in total zzso zzso possibly caused by the inability of petals to store high zzso of zzso other than zzso and by degradation of zzso which accumulates as a result of the zzso zzso but is not due to altered expression of genes in the zzso zzso
