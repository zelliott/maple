zzso zzso contain zzso zzso clocks that control many aspects of retinal zzso Our work has focused on studying the molecular mechanism of this clock and the way in which it controls the many cellular rhythms within the zzso These studies focus on the zzso of zzso zzso a well-established model system extensively used for the study of both retinal physiology and zzso zzso We have cloned zzso zzso of the genes thought to be critical for zzso clock function, including Clock, zzso zzso and period, as well as other rhythmic genes such as zzso We have used these genes to manipulate the clock within different zzso of retinal zzso via zzso zzso in order to study the location of the clock within the zzso These in zzso experiments have shown that zzso cells contain clocks that are necessary for the rhythmic production of zzso We have also used zzso approaches to further investigate the molecular events that drive specific rhythmic zzso such as zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso and control of zzso events within these zzso zzso
