The objective of this study was to investigate factors influencing mother to child transmission of zzso in zzso where zzso zzso the major zzso in Southeast Asia, zzso zzso from 84 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso feeding mothers, 28 who transmitted zzso to their babies zzso and 56 who did not zzso were studied for maternal zzso immune response and virus zzso zzso zzso immune response was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso to laboratory zzso MN strain and two clinical zzso zzso binding zzso to zzso and zzso from strains zzso B, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso characteristics studied were viral load, zzso zzso and viral replication zzso No significant difference between zzso and zzso was found for any zzso of maternal zzso immune zzso However, viral load and viral replication capacity were significantly higher in zzso versus zzso and were not correlated with each zzso This suggests that viral replication capacity may be a transmission factor independent of viral load, which is already well established as a risk factor for transmission of zzso All except four viral zzso used the zzso zzso This is one of few studies of vertical transmission in a population where zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that in this population the maternal zzso immune response was not important in preventing transmission at zzso but that virus characteristics were key factors, and that viral replication capacity may contribute to zzso mother to child transmission of zzso
