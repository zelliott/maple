We recently described a novel zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso In an ongoing search for new human zzso related to zzso we cloned the gene for human zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as previously described zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both coding and zzso portions of the zzso gene have very high zzso similarity to zzso except for the occurrence of a long zzso zzso sequence zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of 114 zzso acid zzso The predicted zzso mature zzso is identical with the zzso protein previously isolated from zzso zzso cells, except for two additional zzso at the zzso zzso We confirmed expression of the gene by Northern analysis and by cloning a portion of the zzso from reverse transcribed zzso cell zzso Despite zzso identity of the first zzso zzso zzso of the zzso start sites, zzso and zzso show zzso differences in zzso zzso is induced in zzso but not zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is expressed in both cell zzso Analysis of zzso sequence relationships does not support the proposal, by others, that zzso is zzso zzso zzso is no more closely related to human zzso than to human zzso and is more distant from both human genes than is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
