Previously published work has shown that a zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso zzso of the zzso protein of respiratory zzso virus zzso is the target for a protective response against the zzso In this report, we demonstrate that a synthetic zzso representing zzso zzso when zzso linked to a fusion zzso derived from the zzso zzso 19 zzso of the F1 protein of zzso virus efficiently zzso zzso zzso in zzso following zzso without zzso
