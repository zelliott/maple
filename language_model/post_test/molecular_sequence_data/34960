To construct a fusion zzso protein with more and stronger zzso to enhance the immunity of the zzso alone, we expressed zzso zzso from giant panda zzso zzso in zzso coli as a zzso fusion zzso zzso the inclusion bodies were zzso with 8 M zzso and applied onto a zzso acid zzso The final production of zzso reached 6 zzso in soluble form, and the zzso final product was zzso zzso In Western zzso zzso the zzso zzso was recognized by zzso zzso against zzso and zzso of giant zzso The results demonstrated that the protein mixture contained correctly folded zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso can promote zzso proliferation and zzso These data suggest that the fusion protein could be used to develop a novel zzso to enhance the immunity of animals against infectious zzso
