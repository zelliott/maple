zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of A- and zzso zzso Each zzso contains two zzso zzso 1 and 3) which point in the same direction, and which are located close to a region zzso 2) from the other zzso of the zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso in zzso 1 and 3 are important for binding to zzso zzso and zzso The aim of the present investigation was to determine the importance of loop 2 for zzso zzso zzso A- and zzso zzso were zzso in the loop 2 regions and zzso into zzso zzso zzso of zzso media of such cell cultures revealed that zzso zzso zzso in the loop 2 region lost its ability to compete with zzso for binding to zzso zzso but retained zzso of its binding of zzso The zzso binds only to zzso zzso of this binding was also retained after zzso of the loop 2 zzso In conclusion, the loop 2 region of zzso is important for zzso zzso but appears to be more important for binding to the zzso zzso than to the zzso
