zzso zzso zzso represents the most prevalent form of sustained cardiac zzso and contributes substantially to cardiovascular morbidity and zzso zzso evidence demonstrates that genetic risk factors play an important role in the zzso of zzso However, zzso is a genetically zzso disease and the genetic defects responsible for zzso in an overwhelming majority of patients remain zzso In the present study, the whole coding region and zzso junction sites of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso factor essential for normal cardiovascular development, were zzso in 160 unrelated patients with lone zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso equivalent to zzso was identified in a patient with positive family history of zzso The zzso zzso which zzso with zzso in the family with complete zzso and was absent in 700 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals, altered the zzso acid completely zzso zzso across species and was predicted to be zzso by zzso and zzso Biological zzso revealed that the zzso zzso protein was associated with significantly decreased zzso activity when compared with its zzso zzso The findings zzso zzso zzso zzso in familial zzso for the first time, providing novel insight into the molecular pathology of zzso
