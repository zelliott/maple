zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso and zzso zzso mediate zzso interactions in zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso clones from mouse zzso zzso expression library that zzso a new signaling protein which we call zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso in length revealed one zzso domain at its zzso region, two zzso motifs with the consensus sequences of binding to zzso zzso and a cluster of zzso motifs that are possibly zzso to serve as zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso and alignment of these characteristics sequences are zzso to those of zzso but zzso and zzso are different zzso zzso of the zzso gene was higher in zzso zzso and brain than in other adult zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso zzso an zzso zzso resulted in the expression of a 83 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso when zzso with a zzso expressing zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso cell zzso zzso became zzso on zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso the result suggests that zzso is a zzso zzso of these zzso
