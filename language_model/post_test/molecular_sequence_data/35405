The current human zzso zzso zzso does not equally represent all human populations but is biased in zzso of representatives originally from north and central zzso This especially affects the zzso of some uncommon West zzso zzso including I and W, whose southern European and Near Eastern components are very poorly represented, suggesting that extensive hidden zzso zzso remains to be zzso This study expanded and zzso the available zzso of I and W complete zzso zzso reaching a comprehensive zzso zzso and searched for precise correlations between the ages and geographical zzso of their numerous newly identified zzso with events of human zzso which contributed to the genetic formation of modern zzso Our results showed that zzso I zzso zzso and W originated in the Near East during the Last zzso zzso or zzso period (the period of gradual warming between the end of the zzso zzso zzso ago, and the beginning of the first main warming phase, zzso zzso zzso and, like the much more common zzso J and zzso may have been involved in Late zzso expansions starting from the Near zzso Thus our data contribute to a better definition of the Late and zzso zzso of Europe, providing further evidence for the scenario that major population expansions started after the Last zzso zzso but before Neolithic times, but also zzso traces of diffusion events in several I and W zzso dating to the European Neolithic and restricted to zzso
