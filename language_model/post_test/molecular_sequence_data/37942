The sequence from a human zzso zzso with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso was used to screen a human zzso zzso zzso The probe sequence was from a region of the zzso lacking zzso to zzso and the goal was to isolate an zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone with an open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso acid protein was zzso This clone had no zzso to zzso zzso analysis of the putative protein sequence reveals one zzso and two K zzso zzso zzso The gene has therefore been named zzso Both zzso and zzso motifs are involved in binding to zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is alternatively spliced in several ways and alternatively zzso at multiple zzso Northern analysis confirmed the presence of messages of multiple lengths with zzso bands at zzso and zzso zzso and also demonstrated that zzso is widely expressed in human zzso Within an zzso of zzso there is a region with zzso zzso to zzso This zzso which is incorporated into the alternatively spliced message represented by zzso contains a 2 zzso deletion that zzso the zzso reading frame and therefore represents an zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the zzso zzso Complex zzso at zzso zzso by radiation hybrid mapping and zzso content of zzso clones from that zzso The zzso contains a large cluster of related genes involved in terminal differentiation of the zzso It remains to be determined whether zzso has a specific role in zzso zzso
