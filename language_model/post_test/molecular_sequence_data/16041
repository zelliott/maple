A modification of the zzso chain reaction technique zzso technique, a zzso zzso amplification of specific target sequences in zzso DNA, was used to introduce point zzso into copies of human zzso zzso zzso and to amplify these zzso copies approximately zzso Of the two zzso zzso used to amplify the DNA, one contained a single base mismatch with the targeted gene segment, either zzso 12 or 61 from the Kirsten zzso zzso zzso fragments harboring any point zzso can be generated using the appropriate zzso and constitute greater than zzso of the zzso zzso The amplified DNA fragments are readily zzso to nylon zzso to serve as positive zzso controls in the search for gene zzso in human tissue zzso The synthesis of single base mismatched DNA fragments was also used to demonstrate that zzso zzso can be detected from mixed DNA populations as might be present in primary tumor zzso even when the zzso of interest is present in only zzso of the amplified sample zzso
