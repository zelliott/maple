Plant zzso transfer proteins zzso are ubiquitous zzso proteins that are involved in various stress zzso In this study, we cloned 14 unique zzso genes zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate their roles under various zzso stress zzso The expression profiles of the 14 zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso exposure in zzso stem and leaf zzso were investigated using real-time zzso The results showed that all 14 zzso were expressed in zzso stem and leaf zzso under normal growth zzso However, under normal growth conditions, zzso abundance varied in each organ, with expression differences of zzso in leaves, zzso in stems and zzso in zzso These results indicated that activity and/or zzso importance of these zzso are quite zzso zzso expression of the 14 zzso was observed zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in at least one tissue indicating that they were all involved in zzso stress zzso All zzso genes were highly induced zzso zzso under zzso treatment in roots, stems and/or leaves, and particularly in roots, suggesting that zzso signaling pathways regulated zzso We zzso that zzso expression constitutes an zzso response to zzso stresses in zzso zzso and plays an important role in zzso stress zzso
