All zzso are thought to have evolved from zzso zzso However, the ancestral conditions zzso the shift to zzso are zzso particularly in plants because the zzso position of many zzso is zzso This is especially true for zzso an zzso zzso that produces the largest flowers in the world and has defied confident zzso placement since its discovery zzso years zzso Here we present results of a zzso analysis of 95 species of seed plants designed to zzso the position of zzso in an evolutionary context using the zzso gene zzso zzso aligned base zzso Overall, the estimated zzso tree is highly zzso with independent analyses and provides a strongly supported placement of zzso with the order zzso which includes zzso violets, and zzso Furthermore, the zzso placement of zzso another enigmatic, zzso zzso with the order zzso (which includes zzso and zzso was obtained with these zzso Although traditionally classified together, zzso and zzso are only zzso zzso zzso that their zzso habits result from zzso zzso Our results indicate that the previous significant difficulties associated with zzso placement of zzso plants may be overcome by using zzso DNA so that a broader understanding of the origins and evolution of zzso may zzso
