The degradation of plant materials by zzso is an industry of increasing zzso For sustainable production of second generation zzso and other products of industrial zzso efficient degradation of zzso plant zzso such as zzso is zzso For each type of zzso a complex mixture of zzso is required for complete conversion to zzso zzso In zzso degrading zzso these zzso are regulated and released by complex regulatory zzso In this study, we present a methodology for evaluating the potential of a given fungus for zzso zzso 

Through the compilation of information from zzso articles, we have zzso knowledge on the structure and degradation of 16 major types of plant zzso to form a zzso zzso As a case example, we have combined this with a list of 188 genes coding for zzso zzso from zzso zzso thus forming an analysis zzso which can be zzso Combination of this information network with gene expression analysis on zzso and zzso zzso has allowed zzso of concerted gene expression from this zzso One such example is the identification of a full set of zzso zzso genes for the degradation of zzso zzso zzso 

The mapping of plant zzso structures along with the corresponding zzso activities is a powerful framework for expression analysis of zzso zzso zzso this network-based approach, we provide the first zzso characterization of all genes coding for zzso zzso identified in zzso zzso
