zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zinc zzso with an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso In contrast, highly zzso zzso from lower organisms only have the zzso zzso From sequence zzso it is not clear why this difference zzso In order to obtain more information on the evolutionary relationship between these zzso and their activities, the structure of a closely related zzso zzso from zzso zzso that only shows a very low zzso zzso activity was zzso To investigate the molecular architecture of the active site, the structures of both the native protein and the protein in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso were zzso These structures show a more spacious active site, and the protected cavity in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso is bound in the human zzso is partially zzso and in other parts is more zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso induced fit upon binding of the inhibitor zzso leading to a movement of the zzso zzso The main triggers for the domain movement are a zzso change of zzso and a subtle change in backbone zzso of the zzso fingerprint region for zzso zzso zzso This leads to a change in the zzso network pulling the zzso domain into a different zzso zzso as zzso is a structural analogue of a zzso zzso and may be regarded as a transition state zzso our results imply that the zzso zzso induced fit during zzso binding and zzso
