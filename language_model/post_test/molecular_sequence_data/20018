zzso zzso zzso zzso against human zzso virus type 1 generate viral escape zzso however, the mechanisms of escape are not clearly zzso In a previous study, we determined the zzso of 48 donor and 25 recipient envelope zzso zzso from five zzso C zzso transmission pairs to zzso in donor plasma by using a virus zzso zzso thereby providing an ideal setting to probe the zzso of zzso to zzso In the present study, acquisition of length in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to correlate with resistance to zzso in donor plasma zzso zzso zzso Kendall's zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso divergence in the zzso zzso region also correlated with resistance to donor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A mutual information analysis suggested possible associations of nine zzso acid positions in zzso to zzso with zzso resistance to the donor's zzso and five of these were located within an zzso zzso zzso zzso located on the zzso outer zzso High zzso substitution zzso ratios, indicative of positive selection, were also found at these five positions in zzso C sequences in the zzso Nevertheless, exchange of the entire zzso zzso between resistant donor zzso and sensitive recipient zzso did not alter the zzso zzso The combined mutual information and zzso analyses suggest that unique zzso patterns in zzso and insertions in the zzso region are associated with zzso resistance during zzso C infection but that the selected positions within the zzso zzso must be linked to still other changes in zzso to zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso C viruses zzso zzso in the zzso zzso for efficient viral replication and immune zzso
