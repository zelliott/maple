Through zzso of a zzso regulatory zzso a gene has been cloned whose product is required for the zzso induction of the zzso expression of the zzso zzso structural zzso By restriction analysis, and from the size of the zzso zzso the gene could be identified as being equivalent to zzso described by zzso et zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene was determined and it was shown to code for a protein with a calculated Mr of zzso Analysis of the derived zzso acid sequence showed that the zzso domain of zzso shares considerable sequence similarity with zzso and zzso which are the zzso of zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso of, and introduction of zzso deletions in, the zzso gene delivered inactive gene zzso When zzso zzso mediates zzso of expression of the zzso zzso and zzso structural genes in the presence of zzso also under zzso growth zzso zzso appears to bind to the upstream regulatory sequence zzso in the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene since zzso of zzso expression was dependent on the presence of the zzso
