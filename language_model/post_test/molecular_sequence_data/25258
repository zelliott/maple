zzso zzso C zzso zzso clones isolated from mouse zzso zzso library zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a characteristic zzso repeat sequence zzso zzso and a protein zzso domain sequence zzso zzso both of which are zzso among zzso family zzso However, zzso zzso lacks a putative zzso binding region zzso zzso that is seen in conventional zzso zzso beta I, beta II, zzso but not in novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows the highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso The similarity extends to the zzso sequence zzso zzso which zzso to one of the divergent regions zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso for zzso zzso is highly expressed in the lung and skin but, in contrast to other members of the zzso family, only slightly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells shows zzso zzso binding activity with a similar affinity to zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified an zzso protein in mouse lung extract as well as in an extract from zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the specific zzso was observed, indicating that zzso zzso is a protein zzso These results clearly demonstrate the existence and the possible importance of zzso zzso as a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
