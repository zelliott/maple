zzso zzso is an important precursor of zzso zzso zzso is found to be closely associated with cancer progression and zzso and has been used to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso have relied on the use of zzso recently cloned and characterized from several zzso zzso However, its application is limited by the difficulty of obtaining homogeneous zzso and the strict zzso specificity of zzso Recently, a number of bacteria have been found to express zzso structures that mimic host zzso The corresponding zzso have been exploited in the facile synthesis of a number of clinically important zzso zzso In this study, we zzso characterized a bacterial zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso which expresses a zzso mimic in the zzso zzso zzso zzso study showed that zzso could readily zzso a series of zzso zzso zzso with zzso at the reducing end, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso which illustrates the use of zzso for the facile synthesis of zzso zzso of a group of putative bacterial zzso revealed the presence of two zzso zzso zzso possibly suggesting a different functional role of each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso binding zzso were carried out to investigate the role of each zzso motif in zzso The results suggest that zzso is critical in the binding of sugar donor zzso whereas zzso may participate in the binding of the sugar zzso This study expands the scope of using bacterial zzso as tools for in zzso synthesis of zzso mimics with clinical zzso
