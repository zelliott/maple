The scorpion zzso zzso is widely distributed in zzso Brazil and known to cause severe human zzso inducing pain, zzso zzso zzso zzso headaches and zzso The present study uses a zzso approach to characterize the gene expression profile from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso library was constructed and 540 clones were zzso and grouped into 153 zzso with one or more zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso percent of zzso belong to recognized zzso zzso with transcripts zzso zzso toxins zzso being the most abundant, followed by zzso zzso like, beta zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso Our analysis indicated that zzso of the transcripts zzso zzso possible zzso zzso which zzso to zzso zzso hypothetical zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides and zzso Fifteen percent of zzso are similar to cellular zzso zzso without good matches corresponded to zzso 

This investigation provides the first global view of gene expression of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso under resting zzso This approach enables characterization of a large number of zzso zzso component zzso which belong either to known or non yet described types of zzso peptides and proteins from the zzso zzso
