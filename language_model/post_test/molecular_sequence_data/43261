zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso involves zzso of the zzso protein zzso or zzso by an unknown zzso To determine the minimal zzso requirements for zzso regulation, hybrid promoter zzso were made between zzso promoter fragments and a zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing two zzso binding sites was sufficient to zzso zzso regulation on the zzso zzso Analysis of deletion and substitution zzso led to the conclusion that the zzso zzso binding site is both necessary and sufficient for regulation, whereas the zzso site zzso the function of the zzso zzso By performing zzso zzso we found two essential regions that flank the zzso zzso An zzso consensus sequence is within one of these regions, and zzso that impaired in zzso zzso binding impaired promoter activity in zzso A second region is zzso and appears to bind zzso No substitution zzso led to high level zzso promoter activity as would be expected from removal of an upstream repression zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso promoter function and that zzso repression most likely involves zzso modification or a negative regulator that does not itself bind zzso
