zzso zzso and genetic characteristics of the zzso strains of zzso zzso isolated from mice and rats were investigated and compared in order to determine the significant differences among the zzso The zzso were divided into six groups on the basis of the patterns of carbon source zzso in the host zzso The zzso sizes were determined by zzso analysis, and the mean zzso size of the zzso from mice was larger than that of the zzso from rats zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequences zzso five zzso the differences might have correlated with the host zzso Principal component analysis zzso based on both the zzso and genetic characteristics revealed total 44 strains zzso into three groups zzso the zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso were mainly classified on the basis of the host zzso by the zzso the existence of zzso that could not be zzso on the basis of the host zzso alone was confirmed by the zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso could be further classified by zzso analysis and also suggested the existence of a zzso group in addition to the zzso zzso
