A virulent strain of zzso zzso was metabolically labeled with zzso and studied for binding to zzso and to zzso human colon zzso zzso The zzso binds strongly to zzso and other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso which all contain terminal zzso beta zzso and zzso to some zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso do not bind zzso including the zzso and other neutral zzso that were zzso Only metabolically active zzso zzso cells bind to zzso as binding is zzso in zzso medium at 37 degrees C and almost completely abolished in zzso medium or by keeping the cells at 4 degrees zzso zzso zzso but not other zzso or zzso zzso at 10 zzso completely zzso binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso does not inhibit binding to the zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso partially zzso zzso of zzso zzso to cultured human colon zzso cells zzso The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that zzso occurs in large amounts in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, there are at least two distinct receptors that mediate binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso containing terminal zzso beta zzso as reported here, and zzso containing terminal zzso alpha zzso beta zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso Olson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ginsburg, zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
