The adult zzso zzso zzso clone 10-3 encodes an zzso that is recognized by zzso from infected zzso We characterized multiple zzso regulated transcripts zzso to the 10-3 zzso and portions of the complex zzso zzso zzso those zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in adults, whereas only the zzso transcript was observed in the zzso zzso These transcripts were highly similar, containing variable numbers of identical direct tandem repeats of 81 zzso Although the sequence of the repeating elements and sequences 3' to them were identical in all the zzso sequences zzso of the repeating elements exhibited variations, including a zzso zzso alternative start sites for transcription, and alternate zzso zzso zzso These transcripts appeared to be derived in part by the zzso controlled alternative zzso of small zzso and the use of alternative zzso initiation sites from the one or two complex zzso of at least 40 zzso zzso Each zzso repeat in the transcripts was zzso by three dispersed zzso zzso These zzso zzso were contained within highly zzso reiterated zzso zzso tandem zzso
