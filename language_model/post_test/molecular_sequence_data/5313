The zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso factor 5 zzso zzso causes highly specific skeletal changes in the limbs of zzso zzso Although Southern zzso analysis does not distinguish sequence disruptions in the zzso sequence of zzso mice, sequencing and mapping zzso zzso reveals the zzso mechanism to be an inversion preceded by a small zzso We report here a simple and sensitive method of zzso detection from mouse zzso zzso Previous zzso detection used degenerative zzso zzso However, without automation, sequencing is a zzso effort for zzso inversion zzso The method developed zzso two zzso zzso in zzso zzso which allow for quick and sensitive analysis of gel zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso mouse zzso DNA cannot amplify a zzso due to the zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso gene in zzso mouse zzso DNA does amplify a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso occurs because of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso changes the direction of the second forward primer 180 degrees to the position of a reverse zzso zzso detection of the zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso fragments were obtained from the zzso zzso DNA in the presence of zzso zzso DNA in ratios up to zzso zzso The sensitivity and simplicity of this method allow for zzso zzso and reliable detection of the zzso zzso
