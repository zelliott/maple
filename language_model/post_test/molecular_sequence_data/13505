Human T cell leukemia virus zzso zzso the zzso agent of adult T cell leukemia zzso zzso human T cells in zzso and in zzso Tax, the major zzso of zzso is critical for the initial events involved in zzso however, the later steps required for progression from an zzso dependent state to one of zzso independence remain to be zzso We investigated the potential role of zzso protein in this process employing several zzso dependent and independent zzso transformed cell zzso All cell lines examined were found to be zzso in the zzso coding region usually associated with zzso zzso using zzso analysis and DNA zzso zzso of zzso protein were consistently higher in zzso independent lines compared to zzso dependent zzso Lack of functional zzso activity was observed only in zzso independent cell lines using a zzso zzso with a zzso reporter gene construct responsive to zzso zzso zzso Increased steady state levels of zzso zzso protein associated with its functional zzso appear to be linked to the loss of zzso dependent growth in zzso transformed zzso
