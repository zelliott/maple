We have cloned a zzso zzso mouse steroid 7 zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and expressed it in zzso zzso Mouse zzso alpha is zzso identical in its zzso acid sequence with the mouse steroid 15 zzso zzso alpha zzso The zzso at position 209 of zzso alpha is the most important zzso to determine the steroid zzso activity of the zzso zzso and zzso (1989) Nature zzso 339, zzso The zzso alpha contains zzso at the position corresponding to the zzso of zzso zzso although both zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha complex is zzso so that it is quickly converted into the inactive zzso whereas the zzso alpha is very zzso The zzso zzso however, is stabilized either by addition of testosterone or by a zzso of zzso to zzso The zzso zzso alpha displays a zzso lower zzso value than the zzso zzso zzso it also has zzso lower zzso and zzso zzso zzso 209 in zzso zzso therefore, appears to be located at a critical site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the testosterone 7 zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso whereas it does not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso alpha activity becomes inhibited by zzso upon the replacement of zzso by zzso In addition, this zzso increases the zzso 15 zzso activity of zzso alpha at least zzso Whereas the zzso by zzso depends on the presence of zzso at position 209, zzso zzso the activities of the zzso regardless of the type of zzso at zzso The results zzso therefore, that the identity of zzso 209 determines the affinity as well as specificity of steroid binding to both zzso alpha and zzso zzso
