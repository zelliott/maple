The adhesive interactions of cells with zzso are zzso by zzso and zzso receptors such as zzso and zzso zzso bind to these receptors at the zzso zzso domain of their alpha zzso but the regions recognized by these receptors have not been mapped zzso In this study, we sought to locate the binding sites of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso through the production of a series of zzso zzso proteins with deletions of the LG zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso We found that deletion of the zzso zzso did not compromise the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso but completely zzso its binding to zzso Further deletion up to the zzso module resulted in loss of its binding to the zzso underlining the importance of zzso for zzso binding by zzso When expressed individually as fusion proteins with zzso zzso or the zzso zzso region of zzso only zzso was capable of binding to zzso whereas neither zzso nor any of the other LG zzso retained the ability to bind to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso in the zzso module is involved in the zzso binding by zzso whereas multiple basic zzso acid zzso in the putative loop regions are involved zzso in the zzso binding by the zzso zzso
