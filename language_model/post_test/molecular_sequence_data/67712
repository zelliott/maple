Two zzso zzso and zzso with unknown functions share a number of features: short length (about 100 zzso zzso by zzso zzso III, predominately nuclear zzso the presence in various zzso and relatively narrow zzso distribution (4 and 3 zzso families, zzso It was reported that zzso zzso turns over zzso whereas zzso zzso is stable in the cell, but their lifetimes remained zzso We showed that zzso is indeed short-lived zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structures specifying rapid or slow zzso of different small cellular zzso remain zzso We searched for zzso structural features that determine the short lifetime of zzso in comparison with the long lifetime of zzso zzso The sequences of genes of zzso and zzso zzso were altered and human cells zzso were zzso with these zzso The zzso rate of the original and altered zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso end regions of zzso zzso proved to contribute to its stability in cells, whereas the lack of such zzso in zzso zzso caused its rapid zzso zzso mechanisms of the phenomenon are zzso
