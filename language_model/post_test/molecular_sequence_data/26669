The work aimed to isolate and culture the zzso and moderately zzso zzso for leaching the zzso zzso 

We enriched and incubated zzso or zzso strains from muddy water of zzso hot spring utilizing zzso irons or zzso sulfur as zzso Then, we identified the strains by their zzso zzso zzso properties and zzso positions, and estimated their zzso potential according to their zzso rate of zzso 

Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial zzso Costa C and Costa zzso were isolated from the samples of zzso hot springs of Costa zzso zzso of the two strains were zzso zzso and zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso and zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso Costa C grew at a temperature range of 30 degrees C - 55 degrees C and a pH range of zzso - zzso zzso at 50 degrees C and zzso zzso Costa E grew at a temperature range of 30 degrees C - 55 degrees C and at a pH range of zzso - zzso zzso at 40 degrees C and zzso Two strains could zzso grow on zzso zzso such as zzso zzso element sulfur and zzso zzso zzso and also could zzso organic zzso like zzso extract for zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences alignment demonstrated that the highest similarity between strain Costa C, Costa E and other species of the zzso zzso was above zzso 

Based on zzso zzso and zzso analysis, Costa C and Costa E can be affiliated to the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso strain Costa C and zzso zzso strain Costa E were zzso Both strains could zzso zzso and the zzso rates arrived zzso zzso zzso d and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
