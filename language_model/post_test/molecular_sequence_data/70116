A restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso was developed to examine the genetic zzso and similarity of the zzso genes of human zzso The zzso genes of 14 human zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those of 2 zzso strains zzso and zzso were zzso and amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso The amplified zzso zzso were then zzso with a panel of restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the identification of at least one zzso with which zzso produced an zzso profile specific for a particular P zzso Of interest was the presence of two distinct zzso patterns within the zzso zzso zzso zzso one corresponding to the zzso gene carried by the members of the zzso zzso and the other corresponding to the zzso genes carried by zzso zzso between members of the zzso and other zzso
