A strategy for the rapid isolation from zzso hybrids of human zzso zzso by zzso amplification is zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the consensus zzso sequence were used to amplify zzso sequence from total human zzso DNA and from a zzso cell hybrid, zzso containing one zzso of zzso 5 as its only human zzso zzso sequence analysis of the products from human zzso DNA confirmed their zzso structure and provided a novel means for the examination of the zzso end of the zzso zzso The amplified sequences from the zzso cell hybrid DNA were cloned into a zzso zzso by zzso zzso yielding clones with zzso in the range 300 to 1000 zzso More than zzso of these clones carried zzso that behaved essentially as zzso human zzso zzso of a selection of these clones to human DNA, zzso DNA, and the original hybrid DNA confirmed that they were derived from zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso boundaries in two clones confirmed that zzso sequences had been zzso This approach has significant advantages over other methods of zzso zzso zzso from hybrid cells, enabling direct separation and cloning of human DNA zzso that can be readily used for mapping zzso
