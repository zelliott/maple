The impact of inserting hydrocarbon staples into short zzso zzso peptides zzso III and zzso zzso peptides of wild bee zzso on their biological and zzso properties has been zzso The zzso was achieved by zzso zzso zzso either between two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporated at i and i + 4 positions or between zzso zzso (R zzso and S zzso incorporated at the i and i + 7 positions, zzso We prepared several zzso III and zzso zzso with a single staple inserted into different positions within the zzso chains as well as zzso with double zzso The zzso peptides exhibited a remarkable increase in zzso activity, while their zzso activities zzso Some single zzso peptides showed a higher resistance against zzso degradation than native ones, while the double zzso zzso were substantially more zzso The CD zzso of the zzso zzso peptides measured in water showed only a slightly better propensity to form zzso structure when compared to native zzso whereas the doubly zzso zzso exhibited dramatically enhanced zzso
