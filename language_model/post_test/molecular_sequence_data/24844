The accurate detection of influenza by clinical symptoms is challenging since multiple zzso viruses and bacteria mimic similar symptoms in a zzso With new and more effective influenza zzso available, there is a growing need for highly accurate and rapid diagnosis of zzso particularly when the window of opportunity for proper treatment is measured in zzso A parallel technology, which is also used in the treatment of zzso was developed for the rapid diagnosis of influenza by exploiting the zzso activity of influenza zzso This technology, which is called zzso offers the high specificity inherent from the conservation of the zzso active zzso The zzso test uses a small zzso zzso of zzso acid chemically coupled to a reporter group together with simple zzso zzso for directly detecting influenza from a patient zzso with high zzso A second-generation platform technology using this zzso detection system coupled with a more sensitive zzso reporter has been developed and zzso for reading on high-speed instant zzso This modification resulted in a platform technology zzso more sensitive than the former while maintaining its inherent high zzso zzso data from a zzso tested during the mild zzso influenza season demonstrated that an zzso zzso test system could approach the accuracy of 14 day viral culture in a convenient zzso zzso zzso This platform technology is currently being explored for the rapid detection of other zzso organisms where sensitivity, specificity and speed are essential in a zzso zzso
