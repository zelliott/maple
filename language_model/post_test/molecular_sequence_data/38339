zzso C virus zzso is a major human pathogen causing chronic liver zzso We have recently found that the large zzso loop zzso of human zzso binds zzso This finding prompted us to assess the zzso features of zzso interaction by using zzso zzso protein and a zzso soluble form of zzso zzso We have found that zzso binds zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso can mediate attachment of zzso on zzso engagement of zzso mediates zzso of only zzso of zzso molecules even after 12 zzso and the four zzso of zzso zzso form two zzso bridges, the integrity of which is necessary for zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso aimed at interfering with zzso binding to human cells should have an affinity higher than zzso M, that zzso binding to zzso may not entirely depend on zzso that zzso is an attachment zzso with poor capacity to mediate virus entry, and that reducing environments do not favor zzso zzso These studies provide a better understanding of the zzso interaction and should thus help to zzso the viral life cycle and to develop new strategies aimed at interfering with zzso binding to human zzso
