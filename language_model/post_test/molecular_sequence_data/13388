We have zzso the zzso gene zzso of 72 zzso the sequence of 6 more species was found in the zzso The 78 species were chosen so as to be representative of two zzso zzso the family, with 39 zzso and the class, with 28 additional zzso zzso Eleven zzso and other land plants were used as zzso to the zzso The 78 sequences were aligned by zzso zzso reconstruction was performed using the Wagner zzso method: our first results were in contradiction with classical zzso due to a local zzso We then used the results obtained with the new distance method zzso to zzso a new tree and carry on further the zzso calculations starting from this zzso zzso Up to 20,000 most zzso trees were thus zzso The zzso of our results was checked by the zzso test and zzso zzso The zzso and the strict consensus tree fitted the general features of land plant zzso Some of our results concerning relationships within the zzso zzso those obtained with the zzso gene zzso Both genes raise questions concerning the zzso zzso as defined in a previous zzso This study proves the zzso gene to be a useful zzso tool within the zzso family and the zzso zzso
