A zzso clone zzso rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso clone includes a very short zzso zzso region, a coding region of 702 zzso and a long zzso region of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows a zzso of 233 zzso acid zzso which consists of a zzso putative signal zzso followed by a zzso mature zzso This mature zzso has a molecular weight of 24 zzso The zzso shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso salmon zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso acid identity with zzso in other fishes, including the 7 zzso zzso zzso Although a zzso site has been identified in zzso of other fish species, none is observed in zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of 2-year-old fish were zzso to zzso higher than those of zzso zzso The tissue distribution of zzso gene expression in adult fish was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and DNA zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in all zzso examined including brain, zzso heart, zzso liver, skeleton muscle, zzso zzso zzso and immature zzso The zzso expression of the zzso gene was also detected in zzso and zzso The zzso products which contained the region coding for mature zzso from heart and kidney were cloned and zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the zzso zzso in heart and kidney were identical to that in the zzso zzso These results suggest that, although the zzso zzso is the zzso tissue for producing zzso it is not the only tissue that zzso gene is expressed in, and the zzso expression of zzso gene starts from very early zzso zzso
