The zzso zzso is an exceptional model system for studying zzso flower development in zzso zzso There is increasing evidence that zzso regulation, particularly DNA zzso is an important regulatory factor during flower zzso Here, zzso amplified zzso zzso was used to screen for zzso DNA zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The sequences of 27 zzso amplified fragments were obtained from DNA prepared from zzso flower zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were cloned as candidate zzso zzso analysis and DNA zzso pattern profiling of the three candidate genes revealed that gene expression zzso was always associated with gene body zzso The results suggested that DNA zzso sites have the potential to regulate the zzso transcript zzso These three genes were shown to play important roles during different zzso of flower zzso This study will help to provide candidates for future experiments aimed at understanding the zzso zzso DNA zzso regulates gene expression in zzso 

We report the first screen for zzso DNA zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso sites were zzso The gene expression levels and DNA zzso patterns were detected for three candidate zzso
