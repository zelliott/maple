Following its zzso of zzso DNA, zzso II is zzso bound to the zzso of both zzso acid zzso However, in order to isolate this zzso DNA complex in the presence of zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso reactions must be terminated by the addition of a strong protein zzso such as sodium zzso zzso zzso Because of the requirement for a protein zzso it is unclear whether DNA zzso in this in zzso system takes place prior to or is induced by the addition of zzso To distinguish between these two possibilities, experiments were carried out to determine whether zzso II bound DNA contains zzso zzso prior to zzso This was accomplished by using circular zzso zzso zzso DNA as a model zzso for the zzso As found previously for zzso II zzso zzso of zzso DNA, the zzso was zzso linked to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, optimal reaction pH as well as optimal salt and zzso zzso was similar for the two zzso In contrast to results with zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso increased with time, was not salt zzso and did not require the presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso products generated in the absence of protein zzso could be labeled at their zzso DNA zzso by incubation with terminal zzso and zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso molecules could be joined to a zzso labeled zzso zzso by a zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
