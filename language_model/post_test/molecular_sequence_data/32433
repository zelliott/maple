In most zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene located on the Y zzso and is the trigger for male sex determination during embryonic zzso Here, we present comparative zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso along with the adjacent zzso zzso flank zzso zzso and 3' flank zzso zzso in 36 species of the cat family zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso closely track species zzso However, several inconsistencies are observed in zzso Overall, the gene exhibits zzso selection to maintain function zzso zzso zzso yet zzso is under positive selection in two of the eight zzso zzso zzso has low numbers of zzso zzso yet most zzso zzso acid changes between species, and four different species have significantly altered zzso due to zzso Moreover, fixation of zzso zzso between sister zzso is not consistent and may occur zzso as in the case of domestic cat, or not at all over long periods of time, as observed within the zzso zzso The former resembles positive selection during zzso and the latter zzso selection to maintain zzso Thus, zzso evolution in cats likely reflects the different zzso zzso selection pressures, and patterns of zzso in modern zzso
