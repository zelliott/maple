zzso zzso a novel blocker of zzso zzso zzso sodium channels zzso has been identified from the zzso cone zzso zzso zzso The deduced sequence consists of a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso mature toxin with its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shares the common zzso arrangement with other zzso Besides, it exhibits high sequence zzso with zzso a toxin recently characterized from zzso zzso which zzso blocks the zzso zzso in zzso zzso With zzso recording, zzso zzso and selectively zzso the zzso zzso of zzso adult rat zzso zzso root zzso zzso zzso with a zzso and zzso property and zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso and zzso implies that they share a common backbone zzso except at the N zzso The zzso zzso only present in zzso is absent and zzso by an zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Similarly, one crucial basic zzso zzso in zzso is replaced by zzso in the latter two zzso Such differences might zzso them with the capacity to selectively inhibit zzso or zzso zzso Considering that zzso zzso predominantly expressed in zzso zzso play pivotal roles in the zzso information transmission and that their specific zzso are still zzso zzso might provide a useful tool for functional studies of these channels, and potentially be developed as an efficient pain zzso
