zzso a zzso acid protein isolated from the green zzso zzso has been recently identified as blocking a large set zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso has been determined by zzso and molecular modeling using a data set of zzso zzso and 265 ambiguous distance zzso as 33 zzso and 13 zzso zzso angle zzso Analysis of the 15 final structures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso adopts the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Its three-dimensional structure is similar to that of snake zzso channel zzso zzso zzso differences with zzso zzso and zzso are localized in the zzso zzso and loop 1 zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and loop 2 zzso zzso These regions zzso to the functional sites of bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso The positioning of the zzso segment zzso relative to the rest of the protein is characteristic of zzso The involvement of this segment and the positively charged zzso at the tip of the zzso in the biological activity of zzso is zzso
