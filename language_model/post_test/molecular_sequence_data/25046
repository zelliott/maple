zzso zzso zzso catalyze all new production in nature of zzso for DNA synthesis by reducing the corresponding zzso The reaction involves the action of a radical that is produced differently for different classes of the zzso Class I zzso which are present in zzso and zzso use an iron center to produce a stable zzso radical that is stored in one of the zzso of the zzso The other classes are only present in zzso Class II zzso use zzso for radical generation and class III zzso which are found only in zzso organisms, use a zzso zzso The zzso activity is in all three classes contained in zzso zzso that have similar structures containing active site zzso The initiation of the reaction by removal of the zzso of the zzso by a transient zzso radical is a common feature of the different classes of zzso This zzso is in all zzso located on the tip of a finger loop inserted into the center of a special barrel zzso A wealth of structural and functional information on the class I and class III zzso can now give detailed views on how these zzso perform their zzso The class I zzso demonstrate a sophisticated pattern as to how the free radical is used in the reaction, in that it is only delivered to the active site at exactly the right zzso zzso are also zzso zzso for which the structural molecular background is now starting to be zzso
