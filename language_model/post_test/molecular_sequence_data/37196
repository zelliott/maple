zzso zzso zzso precursor appears to be involved in two seemingly unrelated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of primary structure revealed a zzso organization of the zzso The zzso portion of zzso is similar to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso while the zzso is unique for zzso and is involved in zzso zzso To gain insight into putative zzso functions of zzso we performed comparative modeling of the zzso domain using crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso The zzso model assumes an zzso sandwich fold similar to that of zzso Modeling revealed the loss of a significant portion of zzso zzso zzso interaction domain, lack of conservation of many zzso involved in interactions with zzso and a major shift in surface charge distribution zzso to the zzso zzso The overall stability of the fold argues against a proposed zzso domain in the central part of the zzso zzso overlap in zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso and surface zzso functions would be mutually zzso The possible biological role of zzso zzso is zzso
