zzso of zzso zzso mouse zzso with transforming growth factor zzso results in uniform conversion to a zzso zzso as judged by a rapid zzso of smooth muscle zzso zzso and zzso Because zzso regulation of the smooth muscle zzso gene in these cells might be zzso by zzso zzso zzso we have examined the sensitivity of zzso DNA to chemical zzso with specificity for zzso bases in a region of the promoter previously implicated in zzso zzso and zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal specific differences between zzso DNA treated in zzso and zzso complexes treated in living zzso Although some differences were observed in zzso cells, treatment with transforming growth factor zzso resulted in the development of additional sensitivity within 1 zzso This enhancement was most pronounced in bases immediately upstream of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso element of similar base distribution showed no such zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso smooth muscle zzso gene during zzso conversion is accompanied by specific structural changes in the promoter that are consistent with a decline in zzso DNA zzso protein zzso
