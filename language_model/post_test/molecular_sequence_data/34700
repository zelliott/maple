Small zzso of the zzso factor zzso family regulate membrane traffic and dynamics in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ear zzso domain, zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso proteins that were originally identified as proteins interacting with zzso and found to associate mainly with zzso of the zzso network zzso Like other zzso and coat zzso membrane association of zzso is regulated by zzso in a zzso zzso Together with or independent of the zzso protein complex zzso zzso mediate sorting of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso by zzso zzso This chapter describes methods to examine the interaction between zzso and zzso and to analyze the cellular function of zzso regulated by zzso
