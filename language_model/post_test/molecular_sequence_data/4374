Three zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso were zzso from gastric zzso of adult house zzso shrew zzso zzso by conventional zzso and gel zzso zzso The molecular masses were 40, 39, and 41 zzso for zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso of about 2 zzso Each zzso was converted to zzso through an intermediate form under zzso zzso By zzso sequence analysis of these protein species, the zzso acid sequences of zzso segments zzso of zzso A and zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso The similarity of these two sequences is nearly zzso Each zzso zzso zzso zzso bonds between zzso and aromatic zzso zzso or bonds on either side of these zzso zzso Although each zzso segment had several sites susceptible to zzso action, zzso proceeded by limited zzso of the segment, presumably due to the zzso zzso of the segment in native zzso The activity of zzso A was inhibited completely in the presence of a more than zzso amount of zzso while a zzso excess amount of zzso was needed for the complete zzso of the activity of zzso zzso and zzso
