Based on sequencing data, zzso zzso zzso have been zzso but no experimental evidence of zzso in zzso has been zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso model, we investigated the occurrence of genetic zzso between two zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The design of a zzso zzso tool allowed accurate discrimination between the parental zzso and the detection of a viable zzso zzso zzso zzso in the progeny zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso identified a zzso event located at the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited distinct growth zzso and produced smaller plaques than the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso at the previously described zzso hot spot for zzso suggesting that the zzso model might be suitable for in zzso studies of zzso zzso Moreover, the results show that exchange of genetic material between zzso can generate viruses with distinct biological properties from the parental zzso
