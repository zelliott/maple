We investigated whether zzso inflammatory cells such as zzso zzso or zzso produced the gene product of a zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso 4-1, which might initiate an immune response resulting in zzso lung zzso We evaluated zzso 4-1 zzso protein production by zzso zzso fluid zzso cells and zzso in 109 patients with zzso idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso lung cancer, and zzso lung disease as well as 26 normal control zzso zzso of zzso 4-1 zzso protein by zzso zzso was observed using indirect zzso in 3 zzso patients and 3 zzso patients zzso No peripheral blood zzso showed zzso 4-1 zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso 4-1 zzso protein were detected in the zzso of all six patients by zzso analysis, while none of the normal control individuals showed zzso 4-1 zzso protein zzso in the zzso All examined zzso cells showed zzso 4-1 zzso zzso transcript expression by reverse zzso chain zzso No significant influence of point zzso or DNA zzso on zzso 4-1 zzso protein production was zzso In conclusion, local production of zzso 4-1 zzso protein and defective tolerance of zzso gene products with zzso zzso production may contribute to the zzso of zzso or zzso in some zzso
