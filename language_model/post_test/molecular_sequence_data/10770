A high molecular weight zzso binding protein zzso was previously identified and zzso from bovine heart zzso fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report the biological function of this zzso zzso was subjected to zzso mapping and three peptides were zzso Two of the three zzso sequences were shown to be highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso However, the third zzso did not show zzso to any known zzso The Western zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso from bovine cardiac muscle showed zzso with zzso zzso raised against zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso II and zzso I activities in a dose dependent zzso Our data based on sequence zzso zzso acid analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso is zzso to zzso and may be a zzso form of zzso
