zzso zzso activates zzso cells, possibly by direct interaction with zzso zzso structure and function are highly zzso across species, suggesting similar conservation of a putative zzso binding site on zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso acid sequence with that of several different species revealed that zzso domain 4 is the most zzso zzso zzso Potential interaction of this domain with zzso was studied by testing zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso binding to zzso in zzso Three zzso zzso zzso region peptides zzso A, B, and zzso blocked zzso zzso activity, with zzso B the most zzso zzso A and B were synergistic for zzso but zzso C was zzso zzso A and B also blocked zzso binding to zzso in zzso whereas zzso C did zzso zzso in addition to its known function as a zzso for major zzso complex class II, contains a binding site for zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso required for zzso binding overlap those previously shown to participate in zzso zzso following class II major zzso complex zzso providing a zzso explanation for the known function of zzso to inhibit the mixed zzso zzso
