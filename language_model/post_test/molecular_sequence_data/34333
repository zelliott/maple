The zzso of the zzso Aedes aegypti can be divided into four regions based on the zzso expression of a zzso sensitive zzso zzso and a long wavelength sensitive zzso type zzso in the zzso zzso We show here that another zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso zzso and a subset of zzso zzso In the zzso region, zzso is expressed in both the cell body and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In other retinal regions zzso is expressed only in zzso cells, being localized to the zzso zzso in the central and zzso regions and in both the cell body and zzso within the zzso zzso Within the zzso transition area zzso do not show a strict pairing of zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso is zzso in the two classes of zzso zzso previously distinguished by the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of transgenic zzso shows that zzso is a short wavelength zzso with an optimal response to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has dual wavelength sensitivity of zzso zzso and near 350 zzso in the zzso zzso As predicted by the spectral properties of each zzso zzso zzso expressing both zzso and zzso zzso exhibit a uniform sensitivity across the broad zzso zzso light zzso We propose that zzso zzso is an adaptation within the zzso cells to improve visual function in the zzso environments in which zzso aegypti is zzso
