zzso rocks, petroleum zzso faults, coal seams, and zzso gas zzso contain an abundance of diverse zzso However, reports on the isolation, zzso and characterization of zzso in the subsurface environment are zzso Currently, no studies investigating zzso within fault environments zzso In this report, we succeeded in obtaining two new zzso zzso zzso of newly proposed species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso fault, which is the fault that caused a devastating earthquake in central Taiwan in zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a fault zzso sample obtained at zzso m below land surface zzso and is an zzso zzso zzso thin, zzso zzso capable of using zzso and zzso as zzso for zzso The zzso zzso and zzso characteristics and zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that this isolate belongs to zzso zzso The zzso strain zzso isolated from a sandstone sample at zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that uses methanol and zzso as zzso for zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso was zzso similar to that of zzso zzso strain zzso and was 96 to zzso similar to the those of other zzso zzso However, the optimal growth temperature and total cell protein profile of strain zzso were different from those of zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed less than zzso zzso between these two zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso be named zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the environmental DNA database survey indicates that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are widespread in the subsurface zzso
