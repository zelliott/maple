zzso zzso of hands and feet zzso is a very rare zzso anomaly characterized by zzso zzso of zzso To isolate the gene responsible for zzso we performed zzso zzso cloning from an zzso patient with zzso We isolated a good candidate gene for zzso that was disrupted by the zzso of the zzso We had previously zzso zzso a zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso covering the zzso zzso of zzso From a zzso segment consisting of seven zzso clones in the zzso we isolated a novel gene (the zzso zzso 1 zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso nuclear factor 3 alpha gene zzso zzso zzso zzso XM zzso zzso spans about zzso comprises 15 zzso and encodes zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression is zzso but very weak in adult heart, liver, skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso and in fetal zzso In view of the zzso sequence and the zzso map constructed, the zzso zzso of the patient was identified as located in zzso 11 of zzso indicating that the gene was disrupted by the zzso and that the breakage resulted in zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso in mouse resulted in mouse zzso signals all over zzso mouse zzso Two other unrelated patients with limb anomalies similar to zzso were subjected to zzso analysis of zzso but none had any zzso We then isolated zzso clones from the other zzso zzso A search for genes and expressed sequence tags in a more than zzso region around the zzso zzso found only the zzso protein gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is located at least zzso zzso to the zzso and is not likely to be related to zzso zzso is a good candidate gene for the zzso type of zzso
