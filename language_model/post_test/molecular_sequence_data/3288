zzso engineering experiments and zzso analysis of zzso zzso reveal that their transition state ensemble zzso is zzso zzso zzso the fluctuations in the transition state zzso structures are zzso In the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso loop and the associated hairpin are fully zzso while the rest of the protein is relatively zzso If native structure predominantly determines the folding zzso the findings for zzso folds raise the question: What are the features of the native zzso that determine the nature of the zzso We propose that the presence of stiff zzso in the native state that connect local structural elements (such as the zzso hairpin in zzso zzso zzso restricts zzso We validate this hypothesis using the simulations of a zzso system (16 zzso zzso forming zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and its zzso In these fragments the role of zzso rigidity in determining the nature of the zzso can be directly examined without complications arising from interactions with the rest of the zzso The zzso structures in the zzso are determined zzso using cluster analysis and limited zzso zzso Both techniques prove that the zzso zzso decreases as the zzso rigidity of the loop zzso To extend this finding to zzso zzso a measure of zzso rigidity based on loop zzso which zzso native structures in the zzso Data Bank zzso is zzso Using this measure we show that, with few exceptions, the ordering of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the 29 zzso structures of zzso zzso is zzso Combining the simulation results for zzso and the analysis of zzso structures for zzso zzso we propose that the stiff zzso loop restricts the zzso fluctuations in the zzso We also predict that constraining the zzso loop to be zzso in the zzso ensemble should not alter the nature of zzso On the other hand, if the zzso and zzso terminals are zzso to form a circular zzso chain, the pathways and zzso are zzso These contrasting scenarios are illustrated using simulations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso domain proteins reveal no clear separation in the zzso of their zzso In the zzso zzso which have large zzso of zzso native zzso the nature of the zzso cannot be apparently determined using purely local structural zzso Nevertheless, the measure of loop zzso still provides qualitative predictions of the ordered regions in the zzso of zzso and zzso
