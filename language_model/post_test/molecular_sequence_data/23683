zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso were obtained by the fusion of zzso zzso myeloma cells and zzso cells from zzso mice zzso with a zzso suspension zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso Two zzso showing strong zzso in zzso were further characterized using zzso and zzso zzso Different treatments of the zzso indicated that zzso zzso and zzso identified zzso of zzso and zzso nature, zzso zzso microscopic examination revealed that, unlike the zzso zzso the zzso zzso were exposed on the surface of the zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso it was found that both zzso recognized common zzso of all the reference strains and field zzso of zzso zzso None of the other bacteria tested reacted with the zzso These results indicated that both the zzso and zzso zzso carried zzso zzso It is suggested that these zzso may potentially be useful for identification of zzso zzso zzso as well as for developing zzso diagnostic zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to kill zzso zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso However, an enhanced bacterial clearance from blood was observed in mice zzso with either of the zzso zzso significant protection was observed in mice using zzso zzso This is believed to be the first report of zzso capable of identifying common zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of their implication in protection against challenge infection in zzso
