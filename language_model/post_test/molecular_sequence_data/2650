We have isolated five zzso DNA clones which contain zzso sequences zzso to a zzso for human zzso protein in Complex III zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that two of them contained different types of zzso suggesting molecular evolution of the zzso and that the other three clones contained the overlapping fragments from the same zzso zzso The gene spans zzso to 5 zzso in zzso The sequences of zzso in the gene were determined and found to be identical to the corresponding parts of the human zzso zzso The zzso boundaries follow the zzso zzso Two zzso boxes were found in the promoter zzso It is concluded from these results that the isolated human zzso gene is zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the gene is present in a single copy in the human zzso
