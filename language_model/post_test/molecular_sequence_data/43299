The zzso acid composition zzso versus the protein identity zzso method was used for establishment of the identities of proteins from bovine brain and zzso which were zzso on a zzso zzso zzso and by zzso flat-bed zzso zzso zzso identities of proteins whose zzso zzso with those of other members of their proper zzso are zzso Groups of zzso zzso can be extracted from protein databases using the standard zzso rule zzso with measures the difference between the zzso of chosen protein versus those in the zzso zzso of zzso of proteins is dependent on several factors such as the upper limit of zzso the limits of variations of molecular mass zzso and zzso point zzso the number of proteins with similar zzso present in protein databases, and the domain structure of zzso zzso of many proteins remain unique if the zzso is maintained within zzso with m zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Certain groups of zzso proteins have zzso zzso only if the zzso is restrained to a value within zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of certain groups of proteins may indicate that a common biological function exists for some members of each zzso The zzso method may become an additional search tool for protein zzso
