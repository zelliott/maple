Three duplex zzso 22, 47, and 100 zzso in length have been zzso with the scanning zzso microscope zzso after deposition on highly oriented zzso zzso zzso Images of the 47 zzso zzso molecules are resolved sufficiently to identify the two zzso zzso the direction of zzso zzso (this zzso contains three turns of left-handed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that all three DNA sequences have adopted an zzso zzso zzso complexes were also prepared and zzso under similar zzso zzso zzso of the complexes demonstrate that the binding of bull zzso 1 to the zzso zzso the DNA in a B zzso and prevents the B to A transition that has been shown to occur as the DNA molecules zzso on the zzso zzso of the diameter of the complex (3 zzso were also obtained and were found to be only slightly larger than the DNA zzso This observation is consistent with the binding of the zzso zzso inside one of the zzso
