The structure of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was determined to zzso A zzso zzso exists as an zzso with two zzso in the zzso zzso The structure reveals the presence of a tightly bound zzso zzso acid at the active zzso The isolation of this reaction product identifies zzso as the most likely precursor and provides the first zzso insights into the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso Additionally, the zzso structure reveals the first protein structure with a zzso domain that binds zzso instead of zzso raising interesting questions about how this protein evolved from a zzso to a zzso binding zzso
