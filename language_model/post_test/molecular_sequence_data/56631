The zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso regulated by zzso and steroids in zzso cells of developing zzso zzso To characterize the molecular mechanisms by which this regulation occurs, the promoter of the rat zzso gene has been analyzed by 1) mapping the zzso start site, 2) constructing deletion zzso reporter genes for zzso zzso and 3) determining zzso interactions by gel shift zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that promoter sequences between zzso and zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso zzso of reporter zzso in primary cultures of zzso cells and for expression in rat zzso zzso cells, which zzso express high amounts of zzso zzso Nuclear extract proteins from zzso cells and zzso zzso cells specifically bound a labeled zzso zzso and were zzso by cold competitor zzso as well as by a shorter region zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso Competition was inhibited by zzso of the central zzso and was affected by adjacent zzso contextual zzso A possible candidate for the binding activity observed in zzso cells and zzso cell nuclear extracts binds an zzso containing the zzso zzso motif and is an orphan member of the zzso hormone zzso These results are the first to characterize zzso DNA elements in the zzso promoter, identify a region that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso expression in zzso cells, and zzso a zzso sequence within this region that binds at least one member of the orphan zzso class of zzso zzso
