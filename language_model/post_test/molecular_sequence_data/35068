zzso zzso zzso is a cardiovascular disease with zzso dominant inheritance caused by zzso in genes coding for zzso and/or regulatory proteins expressed in zzso In a small cohort of zzso patients zzso we searched for zzso in the two most common genes responsible for zzso and found four zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso in the zzso protein zzso gene zzso including one zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso resulted from the zzso of a zzso zzso in a 54-year-old female zzso patient presenting with clinical signs of heart failure due to zzso zzso Although such large zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene are very rare and have been identified only in 4 families reported so far, the identical zzso zzso was found earlier in a Dutch patient, demonstrating that it may constitute a zzso unknown founder zzso in central European zzso This observation underscores the significance of insertions into the coding sequence of the zzso gene for the development and zzso of zzso
