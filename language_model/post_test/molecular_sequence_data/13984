zzso zzso zzso converts zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso and requires two zzso metal zzso designated zzso and zzso for zzso The first zzso zzso zzso is formed during zzso by the transfer of the zzso of zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso transfer between these two zzso charged zzso is thought to be zzso by the zzso zzso To explore the role of the zzso metal in zzso zzso zzso a zzso to the zzso metal, was changed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso All of the zzso bind two zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso The zzso had little effect on the zzso zzso except in the case of zzso which exhibited a zzso zzso zzso 92 zzso a zzso increase compared to that for zzso zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso The ability of these zzso to catalyze zzso transfer to zzso or to the inhibitor zzso was examined by rapid zzso kinetic zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso and shown to be produced by both zzso and zzso The rate of zzso transfer to zzso for zzso is reduced zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso (8 zzso The extra negative charge around the zzso metal zzso contributed by zzso zzso severely reduces the ability of the zzso metal to mediate efficient zzso binding in the presence of zzso charged zzso and zzso the interactions between metal zzso and the zzso in the transition state, thus resulting in a lower rate of zzso zzso
