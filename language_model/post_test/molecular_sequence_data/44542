La zzso zzso virus belongs to the California zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family zzso It is considered one of the most important zzso pathogens in North America, especially in the upper zzso where it is associated with encephalitis during the time of year when mosquitoes are zzso zzso occur most frequently in children and young adults and, while most cases are resolved after a period of intense illness, a small fraction zzso zzso are zzso At present there have only been three zzso of zzso virus from humans all made from brain tissue zzso The cases yielding viruses are separated zzso by 33 years and geographically from zzso zzso zzso to Missouri zzso The M zzso sequence of the first two zzso was previously zzso The present study extends the observations to the isolate from the 1993 case and includes several zzso zzso as zzso A comparison of the M zzso of these viruses shows that for the human zzso both zzso sequence and the deduced zzso sequence of the zzso proteins are highly zzso showing a maximum variation of only zzso and zzso zzso This high degree of conservation over time and space leads to the hypothesis that human infections with this particular zzso of zzso virus are those most likely to have a fatal zzso It is also shown that a virus with this zzso could be found circulating in mosquitoes in an area more or less intermediate between the locations of the first and second fatal zzso
