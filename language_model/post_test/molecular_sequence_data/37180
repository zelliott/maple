The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso has been shown to induce both zzso binding protein alpha zzso and zzso zzso resulting in zzso cell cycle arrest during the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also known to interact strongly both in zzso and in zzso infected zzso We recognized two potential consensus zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter and performed zzso mobility shift zzso zzso analysis with in zzso zzso this analysis showed that one of these sites has a very high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with a target zzso zzso reporter gene confirmed that zzso can zzso activate the zzso promoter up to zzso Although zzso had no effect on its own promoter by itself, the addition of zzso and zzso together resulted in a zzso increase in activity over that obtained with zzso zzso zzso the introduction of zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso expression in zzso cells zzso infected with zzso as detected by both reverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of a zzso loop with zzso and zzso zzso each zzso The zzso promoter can also be activated 50- to zzso by the zzso zzso protein known as replication and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together cooperated to elevate zzso promoter activity zzso to zzso more than either zzso Furthermore, the addition of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso reporter zzso zzso resulted in 7- to zzso more zzso than that seen with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter showed that the strong zzso binding site is crucial for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, the zzso binding site also zzso the previously reported zzso zzso element zzso and the same zzso also both reduced zzso zzso and abolished the zzso between zzso and zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso although capable of binding directly to the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to bind to the zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness but no zzso could be transferred to a zzso promoter containing added consensus zzso binding zzso A zzso zzso zzso showed that all three proteins associated specifically with zzso promoter DNA in zzso and that, when zzso was removed from a zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso cell zzso the levels of association of zzso and zzso with the zzso promoter were reduced 3- and zzso zzso Finally, zzso also proved to physically interact with both zzso and zzso as zzso both in zzso and by zzso zzso to zzso occurred within the zzso DNA binding domain of zzso and deletion of a zzso basic motif of zzso abolished both the zzso and DNA binding activities as well as all zzso zzso and the zzso with zzso zzso we suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso by an interaction with zzso zzso but that full activity requires more than just the core zzso binding zzso
