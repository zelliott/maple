The zzso and dynamics of a protein chain with zzso and polar zzso are examined by the zzso model using zzso Carlo simulations on a cubic zzso The minimal zzso zzso interaction leads to standard zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the radius of zzso zzso with the molecular weight N zzso zzso zzso zzso with gamma approximately zzso zzso zzso interactions with longer range and higher strength are needed to approach the native zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso into the zzso ground state shows a weak zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , alpha approximately zzso zzso
