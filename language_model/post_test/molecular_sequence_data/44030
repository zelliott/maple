zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is involved in a broad spectrum of activities such as immune defense, zzso and the acute phase response, as well as in the zzso of multiple zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed to investigate the roles of zzso and zzso in the structure, zzso stability, zzso zzso zzso and spectral properties of zzso The characteristic zzso zzso of zzso of zzso at low pH was shown to be caused by an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso at low pH and not associated with zzso zzso equilibrium unfolding experiments monitored by zzso and zzso CD showed that the increased quantum yield and blue shift of the wavelength of the zzso maximum observed for zzso at moderate zzso zzso were also associated with zzso rather than zzso The tendency to form zzso unfolding zzso as judged by poor fits to a two-state unfolding zzso low m values zzso of the unfolding curve in the transition zzso and the range of zzso zzso over which these zzso formed, was shown to be higher for zzso than zzso but significantly lower for zzso and zzso These differences were most pronounced at pH zzso and correlated with the tendencies of the proteins to zzso at high protein zzso in the absence of zzso As judged by the zzso zzso chemical shifts of the aromatic zzso the global zzso of zzso and zzso were not significantly different from that of zzso Nuclear zzso effects zzso between the side chains of zzso and zzso were consistent with the zzso side chain of zzso being oriented toward the face of the zzso side chain of zzso an arrangement consistent with our estimates of a low interaction energy zzso zzso between these side zzso A shift in the zzso of the zzso side chain in zzso zzso zzso suggested that, in the absence of zzso zzso could interact with other zzso Further zzso in this region should yield forms of zzso even less prone to zzso which would be more suitable for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso did not significantly alter the zzso activity of the zzso on mouse zzso zzso cells, even though the corresponding region of human zzso has been shown to be important for biological zzso
