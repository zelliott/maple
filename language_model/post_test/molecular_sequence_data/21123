The crystal structure of an extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at a resolution of zzso The overall fold was comprised of three zzso zzso and the zzso coordinates of the zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, there were clear zzso differences around domain 3 between zzso and the other two zzso a zzso zzso in zzso and a protruding zzso in zzso were not present in zzso Instead, a large loop zzso covered the zzso copper zzso of zzso and a short zzso in domain 3 extended near the zzso end of zzso In addition, the sizes of several surface zzso in zzso were markedly smaller than the corresponding zzso in zzso and zzso zzso comparison revealed that the presence of extensive zzso interactions and a smaller cavity volume are likely to be the main factors contributing to the zzso of zzso
