The zzso of most zzso zzso zzso contains an identical zzso repeating zzso Apart from zzso Y, the zzso is modified by addition of a zzso and/or zzso zzso to a specific position in the zzso In this study the zzso zzso gene from a zzso 1 a has been cloned and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was used to probe a zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 a) zzso library and 18 unique clones were zzso Southern zzso of these clones indicated two zzso regions of the zzso contained the zzso zzso When expressed in a live candidate vaccine strain of zzso zzso zzso Y zzso clones with one region produced type I zzso whereas clones containing the other region produced mainly type Y zzso One of the zzso clones positive for type I zzso by zzso and Western zzso was selected for further zzso Genes involved in zzso zzso modification were mapped on a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were produced which fully or partially expressed the type I zzso depending on the extent of the zzso zzso and partially expressing clones may be useful vaccine candidate strains for protection against disease caused by two zzso of zzso zzso
