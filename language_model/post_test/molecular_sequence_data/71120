A key feature of the generally accepted zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the breakage of the zzso bridge between copper and zinc and the loss of a coordinated water zzso from copper on reduction from zzso to zzso Crystal structures exist for the zzso from a number of sources in the zzso five coordinate copper zzso For the reduced form two structures from different sources have been determined only recently but provide contradictory zzso We present crystal structures of bovine zzso zzso in two different space zzso The structure of the zzso form zzso at zzso A resolution clearly shows one zzso with zzso in the five zzso zzso form, and the other with zzso in the three coordinate form expected for the reduced zzso This mixed state of zzso is confirmed by zzso data of these zzso The zzso structure has thus captured each zzso in one of the two zzso state zzso and thus provides direct zzso evidence for the zzso zzso mechanism involving the breakage of the zzso bridge between zzso and zzso A shift in the position of copper in zzso A zzso the zzso zzso to undergo the first stage of zzso via zzso of zzso from zzso with a zzso movement of the coordinated water zzso towards zzso which zzso by approximately 20 degrees, enabling it to form a hydrogen bond to the water zzso The zzso separation in the reduced site is increased by approximately zzso zzso In contrast the zzso A resolution structure in space group zzso zzso shows both of the zzso atoms to be in the five zzso zzso form but in this space group the whole of zzso A is significantly more zzso than zzso zzso An examination of published structures of zzso zzso shows a trend towards longer zzso and zzso zzso in zzso A, which together with the structures reported here indicate a potential functional asymmetry between the zzso of zzso We also suggest that the increased separation between zzso and zzso is a precursor to breakage of zzso
