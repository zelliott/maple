A 3-D model of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso was built by computer zzso based on solution probing of the zzso with different chemical and zzso zzso This model encompasses four major structural zzso including two peculiar zzso oriented zzso and mimicking a zzso structure, and a fifth domain which makes the connection with the rest of the viral zzso After recalling the different steps that led to the present structural knowledge of the zzso zzso domain, we review its novel structural features revealed by the zzso and that did not appear in older versions of 3-D models of this zzso These features comprise additional zzso hairpin zzso new zzso long-range zzso and a second zzso The main goal of this paper is to strengthen the zzso of the model by establishing correlations between the putative 3-D zzso and the functional properties of the zzso For that, we show how the present structural model zzso zzso and zzso data that have established the importance of specific regions of the zzso for its recognition and zzso by zzso zzso zzso We discuss further how the model corroborates zzso analyses performed to understand recognition of this zzso domain by the zzso zzso and by the viral zzso The published zzso of the zzso zzso domain fall into two zzso In one class, the zzso leave unchanged the overall architecture of the zzso thereby affecting functions zzso In the second class, the overall architecture of the zzso is zzso and thus functions are affected zzso
