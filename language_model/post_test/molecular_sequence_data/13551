There is increasing interest in studying how specific zzso activities within the nucleus are zzso into functional zzso The best known example is the zzso where zzso genes are transcribed and zzso processed and assembled into zzso zzso Other zzso zzso have been known for many years through zzso studies but are only recently being zzso at the molecular zzso Here we focus on an zzso zzso nuclear domain, called the coiled body, which contains zzso zzso We review recent literature on the coiled body and discuss a possible model for its biological zzso
