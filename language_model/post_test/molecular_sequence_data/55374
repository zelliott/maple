The zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the surrounding regions were cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso a parental strain of an industrial zzso producer in zzso This region encodes genes for the following proteins (in zzso initiation factor zzso the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso mapping via reverse zzso zzso chain reaction demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed as a zzso transcript from two tandem promoters preceding the zzso zzso The gene order of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is characteristic of zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein of 334 zzso acids with a deduced molecular weight of zzso exhibiting 42 and zzso similarity to the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The regions that mediate interactions with zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso that participate in the recognition of the UP element are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, there are differences between the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso in the zzso assigned to the zzso domain and the zzso acids adjacent to zzso zzso that mediate UP element zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene expressed in zzso coli zzso a temperature sensitive zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso can function in zzso zzso
