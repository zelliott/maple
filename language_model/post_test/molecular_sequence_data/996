While genetic modification of zzso zzso can produce zzso with modified zzso incorporation of targeting zzso into the structural context of the zzso can also result in destruction of zzso targeting or zzso zzso To combat this problem, we have developed a versatile targeting system using metabolically zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso fiber zzso These zzso have been demonstrated to be useful as a platform for zzso zzso screening and zzso targeting by zzso zzso zzso to the virus using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso could also be zzso by zzso binding on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, a second metabolically zzso zzso zzso zzso has been engineered by fusing a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso displays twice as many zzso and was markedly superior for zzso affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso to cells with zzso zzso including zzso against the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso if zzso the zzso zzso for zzso was used as a zzso rather than the zzso This work demonstrates the utility of zzso zzso as a molecular screening tool to assess the utility of different viral zzso proteins for zzso display and the biology and zzso of different zzso and receptors for zzso targeting zzso These results also demonstrate the utility of the zzso zzso as a platform for gentle zzso affinity zzso of zzso zzso
