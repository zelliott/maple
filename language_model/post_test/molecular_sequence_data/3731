A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed that is effective under zzso conditions for the synthesis of zzso This general zzso bond zzso zzso a removable auxiliary that is analogous to the role of zzso in native chemical zzso combining zzso zzso exchange with efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso and improved zzso efficiency were introduced into the zzso auxiliary by increasing the electron density of the aromatic zzso The 62 zzso acid zzso domain from zzso was zzso using the zzso zzso at a zzso zzso The auxiliary was removed with zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso This methodology enables unprotected peptides to be coupled at zzso zzso sites expanding the scope of protein synthesis and zzso
