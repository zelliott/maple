The E1 protein of bovine zzso zzso plays several key roles in viral DNA zzso E1 binds the viral origin, zzso template DNA at the replication fork and recruits cellular replication machinery to the viral zzso E1 is zzso at multiple sites, and zzso of E1 regulates E1 function and viral DNA zzso A consensus motif for the cellular zzso zzso was identified at zzso zzso near the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and found to be highly zzso among zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso by zzso and zzso analysis, and was zzso by a cellular zzso in cultured zzso
