We have analyzed the zzso sequence changes responsible for zzso from zzso to zzso induced in ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were either used as donors in the zzso transfer of an zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso recipients or allowed to continue zzso zzso Although the types and proportions of zzso zzso are likely to have been very similar in these two circumstances, analysis of the sequence data shows that different zzso of zzso were zzso In zzso cells there were about equal numbers of transitions and zzso but transitions outnumbered zzso by about three to one in zzso About zzso of the single zzso zzso could be assigned to a zzso target sequence in both sets of data, but they differed with respect to the location of the zzso more or less equal numbers were found at the 3' and zzso sites of the probable zzso target in zzso cells, but in zzso over zzso were at the 3' zzso It is also possible that zzso were targeted more commonly at zzso sequences in zzso than in zzso cells, but the evidence for this is less zzso We conclude that these results reflect some zzso between zzso cells and zzso in the way damaged DNA is zzso or zzso zzso but the particular features of these processes responsible for the different zzso zzso have not yet been zzso
