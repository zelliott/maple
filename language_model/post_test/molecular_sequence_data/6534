We have previously reported the partial zzso of a zzso to zzso plasma membrane protein from mouse zzso zzso that binds zzso modified low density zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have now identified that protein as zzso a previously cloned zzso membrane protein in the zzso membrane protein family zzso zzso of human zzso Early in the course of zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso a new zzso band at zzso zzso appeared and zzso with the zzso to zzso zzso The zzso pattern of zzso peptides from this higher molecular mass zzso band closely matched that derived from the zzso to zzso zzso Specifically, the same three zzso zzso peptides zzso 9, and 15 zzso were present in the zzso zzso to zzso band and in the zzso to zzso band and zzso raised against zzso sequences in zzso recognized both zzso An zzso against zzso zzso most of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the binding of zzso to mouse zzso zzso is in part attributable to zzso Our previous studies show that zzso competes with oxidized red blood cells and with zzso zzso for binding to mouse zzso zzso Whether zzso plays a role in recognition of zzso and zzso damaged cells by intact zzso remains zzso
