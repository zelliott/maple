In the current study, a group of 17 zzso zzso zzso from clinical and environmental origins was subjected to a zzso zzso characterization including zzso zzso zzso sequencing, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso results were consistent with the conclusion that this group of 17 zzso may represent a currently zzso zzso zzso most closely related to zzso zzso zzso In addition, comparison of newly obtained zzso zzso sequencing data with published sequences demonstrated a high zzso zzso among zzso currently classified in the species zzso zzso
