zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were functionally expressed with zzso tags at their zzso and zzso to apparent zzso Both zzso zzso zzso were zzso were not zzso and exhibited similar specific activities with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso In addition, the activities of both zzso were activated by incubation with zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso complex zzso and were zzso by zzso and zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required higher zzso ratios for zzso stimulation than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or values reported for zzso zzso as might be predicted by the more reduced zzso zzso environment of the zzso Limited zzso zzso of both zzso yielded stable fragments truncated at the zzso zzso The zzso retained their zzso structure and exhibited substantial zzso activity with the zzso zzso E1 as zzso but zzso activity was not activated by incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso by elevated zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that increasing amounts of zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso No additional zzso binding was observed at ratios greater than 20 zzso of zzso of zzso In contrast, the truncated zzso zzso did not exhibit significant binding to the zzso Similarly, a truncated form of zzso zzso generated by zzso exhibited properties similar to those observed for zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso is not required for zzso association of the zzso or zzso but instead seems to be involved in the binding of the zzso to the zzso zzso core of the zzso
