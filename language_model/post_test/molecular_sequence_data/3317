To evaluate molecular zzso in the zzso region of the Plum pox virus zzso zzso a zzso spanning the zzso part of zzso the complete zzso and start of the zzso gene in 12 Slovak and French zzso zzso was amplified in zzso and zzso Computer analysis of obtained and previously published sequences showed rather substantial differences among zzso of zzso and D zzso zzso of zzso identity ranged from zzso to zzso There was a relatively low percentage of zzso among zzso within the same zzso zzso acid multiple sequence alignment showed a total of 14 zzso zzso zzso acid positions among zzso and D zzso in the examined zzso The geographical origin of the zzso was not correlated with their zzso zzso No reasonable correlation could be established between zzso acid zzso and host species and/or biological properties of zzso The present zzso detection method targeting a zzso region of the zzso zzso followed by simple zzso zzso determination, could enhance conventional zzso techniques, especially with peculiar zzso Using this approach, the Slovak isolate zzso was found to be a natural zzso between a D and an M zzso
