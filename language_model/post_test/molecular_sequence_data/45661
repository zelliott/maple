zzso zzso II zzso in zzso cells drives zzso of most zzso zzso zzso core zzso is composed of 12 zzso where zzso is the largest zzso To further understand the mechanisms of zzso transcription, we isolated and characterized novel point zzso of zzso that are sensitive to the zzso drug zzso zzso In this work we zzso the zzso zzso which reduces the interaction of zzso and identified five new point zzso in zzso that cause hypersensitivity to zzso The novel zzso affect highly zzso zzso of zzso and have differential genetic and zzso zzso Three of the zzso affect the zzso and zzso two small zzso suggested by structural studies to play a central role in the separation of the zzso zzso Most interestingly, two zzso affecting the zzso center zzso and the zzso box G zzso have strong opposite effects on the intrinsic in zzso zzso rate of zzso Moreover, the synthetic interactions of these zzso with zzso zzso and zzso suggest differential in zzso zzso
