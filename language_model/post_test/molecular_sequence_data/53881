This study examines sequence divergence in three zzso regions of the zzso DNA zzso zzso to test the hypothesis of unequal zzso zzso zzso of two transcribed zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso formed the basis of comparative zzso zzso divergence was measured both within an individual lake trout zzso zzso and among several related zzso species zzso zzso brook trout, zzso zzso Arctic zzso zzso zzso Atlantic zzso zzso zzso and brown trout, zzso zzso Despite major differences in the length of the zzso zzso within individual lake trout, minimal sequence difference was detected among zzso zzso comparisons found that molecular variation in the zzso zzso did not conform to the predicted pattern of evolution zzso zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso contains a region that appears to be as zzso or more zzso than the zzso
