The zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso is an zzso distributed environmental zzso which can induce a broad spectrum of toxic responses in animals, including zzso In this study, we investigated the impact of 0 or 20 zzso zzso injections into the zzso of chicken eggs before start of development, on liver and zzso protein expression in hatchlings using fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel zzso zzso under a pH range of zzso combined with zzso Despite considerable zzso zzso exposure to zzso prior to the start of embryonic development resulted in significant changes in expression of a small set of zzso zzso of zzso gamma chain precursor in the liver and 60 zzso heat shock protein in the zzso were significantly higher as a result of the very early exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was decreased by early zzso treatment in the liver and zzso zzso These proteins could not be directly linked with drug metabolism per zzso but are involved in blood zzso zzso stress, electron zzso and calcium zzso It remains to be zzso how these changes in the zzso might be linked to the observed long-term consequences during zzso life of the zzso
