zzso populations detected on buildings by traditional methods are mainly zzso whereas direct zzso shows that they are principally zzso zzso that often cannot be isolated in culture, but may grow on artificial media when the spatial zzso relationships are zzso The zzso strategy described here was to select zzso distinct colonies from zzso zzso for direct DNA amplification, allowing zzso organisms to be zzso and their zzso to be characterized by zzso DNA data banks currently contain many entries for zzso of unrecorded zzso which does not facilitate zzso although genetic zzso in a population may be zzso The sequence zzso of the present zzso organisms zzso zzso numbers zzso to zzso with those in DNA zzso were low, indicating differences between zzso zzso on walls and aquatic species zzso the majority in the zzso Further development of databases for the populations found in this environment, subject to temperature extremes, repeated zzso and high zzso and salt levels, is zzso
