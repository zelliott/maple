zzso zzso genes induced by the treatment of immature rats with pregnant zzso serum zzso zzso were isolated by a zzso cloning zzso zzso them was obtained a probable rat zzso of zzso acute regulatory protein zzso which has been recently identified as a protein that is an acute regulator of the rate limiting transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso was determined by zzso sequence zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso levels were rapidly and strongly increased by zzso but not by zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso zzso was strongly induced by zzso in zzso zzso cells as well as in zzso zzso These findings indicate that expression of zzso zzso is restricted to and induced in the zzso zzso cell types where cholesterol is used as a zzso for synthesis of steroid zzso
