zzso of DNA sequences of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family revealed an unusual pattern of zzso substitution in the gene region zzso the second zzso domain zzso of the zzso In this domain, zzso zzso differences between members of this zzso that caused a change in zzso acid zzso polarity were over four times more frequent than zzso differences that did not cause a polarity zzso This zzso pattern of zzso substitution is evidence of past directional selection favoring diversification of the zzso domain among members of this zzso This in turn suggests that zzso may play some important role in the functions unique to each member of the zzso zzso family, and that it may perhaps be an zzso binding zzso
