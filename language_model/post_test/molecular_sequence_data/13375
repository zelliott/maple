A new zzso transport system of zzso coli specific for zzso was characterized by genetic and zzso zzso The system is zzso by five adjacent zzso zzso zzso standing for zzso zzso which are organized in two zzso units zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso gene products zzso and zzso are zzso binding proteins with sequence similarity to binding proteins for polar zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso products are similar to the zzso proteins and the zzso of zzso zzso The mature zzso and J proteins were localized in the zzso and lacked signal peptides of 19 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso specifically binds zzso with high affinity and overproduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso The zzso for zzso is not known, and isolated zzso did not bind common zzso zzso various basic uncommon zzso acids or zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso genes zzso a third zzso system in addition to the known zzso zzso system of zzso zzso and zzso coli and the zzso zzso carrier zzso of zzso zzso
