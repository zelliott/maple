The zzso and initial characterization of zzso zzso from zzso zzso are zzso The zzso consists of a zzso of 85 zzso containing one zzso five or six zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso releases a fluorescent material with spectral properties identical to the zzso zzso released by the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso both isolated from zzso zzso each serves as an electron zzso to zzso zzso and may form a zzso electron transfer zzso for zzso zzso Full reduction of zzso zzso requires zzso reducing zzso using either zzso or zzso as the electron zzso Below 20 K, oxidized zzso zzso exhibits an zzso signal with g values of zzso zzso and zzso which zzso to approximately zzso zzso Since enrichment in zzso results in broadening of this zzso zzso the center giving rise to this signal must contain zzso The most plausible candidates are a zzso high potential iron protein center or a zzso zzso The zzso signal observed in oxidized zzso zzso disappears upon reduction of the protein with either zzso or zzso zzso a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears which is similar to that of zzso zzso clusters and spin zzso to one zzso
