The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a potential model system for the development of a protective zzso stage zzso To characterize this zzso at the molecular level, isolated zzso zzso zzso DNA was used to construct a zzso library in the expression zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso which passively protected mice against zzso zzso challenge infection, was used to identify a zzso zzso zzso clone zzso a portion of the zzso zzso of this zzso Using this clone as a probe, we identified an zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the clone showed that the zzso recognized by the protective zzso zzso is zzso by the 3' portion of the gene for the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that this zzso also contains the zzso repeated zzso zzso a series of 10 zzso zzso located within the terminal 110 zzso zzso and a potential membrane anchor of 18 zzso zzso zzso of this zzso sequence with the zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed zzso acid and zzso acid sequence similarities ranging from zzso to zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso recognized by the protective zzso zzso to this zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso combined with the limited strain zzso in this region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has implications for the development of an effective zzso stage zzso zzso
