The zzso zzso pump assembly of zzso zzso consists of two inner membrane proteins and one outer membrane zzso The zzso membrane zzso zzso appears to function as the zzso zzso whereas the zzso and zzso proteins are supposed to function as the membrane fusion protein and the outer membrane channel zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso predicted the presence of up to 17 potential zzso zzso To verify the zzso we analyzed the membrane zzso of zzso using the alkaline zzso gene fusion zzso We obtained the following unique zzso zzso bears 12 membrane spanning segments leaving both the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso side of the inner zzso Both the first and fourth zzso zzso had very long zzso zzso containing 311 and 314 zzso acid zzso zzso This fact suggests that these zzso may interact with other pump zzso such as the membrane fusion protein zzso and the outer membrane protein zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso halves of zzso showed a zzso zzso and zzso segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 could be zzso with the segments 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, zzso This result suggested that the zzso has a zzso repeat that strengthen the zzso determined zzso zzso This paper reports the structure of the pump zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pump zzso This is the first time to verify the zzso of the zzso zzso pump zzso
