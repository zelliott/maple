We identified two zzso polar zzso acids within different membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso In zzso zzso the position of the zzso is very similar and the zzso is replaced by a zzso polar zzso To assess whether zzso and zzso interact or influence zzso activity, we investigated the effects of changing zzso to zzso or zzso and zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso including a double switch zzso with zzso and zzso exchanged, were expressed and zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at low levels, whereas zzso and the zzso zzso were expressed zzso The specific zzso activities zzso to wild zzso were 17 and zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso and 26 and 38% for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso showed only zzso of zzso activity but was rescued over zzso by changing zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso protein was also rescued to near zzso zzso Based on size exclusion zzso coupled to zzso laser light scattering analysis, all the zzso zzso zzso zzso of smaller zzso zzso mass than zzso zzso zzso zzso the smallest zzso zzso zzso zzso was made by zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso within zzso is a critical zzso for the stability of zzso that it may interact with zzso within zzso and that these zzso are involved in the ability of HAS to zzso very large zzso
