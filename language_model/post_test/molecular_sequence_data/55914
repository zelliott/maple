The zzso coli zzso zzso has been converted into an zzso zzso by zzso zzso inserted by zzso zzso with zzso In the presence of copper zzso and zzso high yields zzso zzso of zzso breaks of DNA are observed after a zzso zzso The high zzso efficiency of this zzso protein zzso zzso zzso can be attributed to the proximity of zzso to the minor groove, the site of the zzso of the zzso and the target of the zzso zzso activity of zzso Since sequence position 49 is close to the zzso C2 zzso axis and adjacent to the minor groove, zzso zzso zzso zzso with the operator DNA near the binding site of this symmetry locus of the zzso The patterns of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso operators zzso confirm the orientation of the zzso to the operator predicted from the X-ray study of a zzso zzso et zzso 1988) and zzso support the model for tandem binding of the zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso operators based on zzso I zzso and zzso interference zzso et zzso zzso There are one, two, and three binding sites for the zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso operators, zzso In addition to providing a novel approach to studying the interactions of DNA binding zzso zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso may be useful as rare zzso in the analysis of high molecular weight zzso especially if their binding zzso can be zzso
