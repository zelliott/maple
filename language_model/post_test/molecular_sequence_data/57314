This study describes the properties of the two zzso expressed zzso chains of zzso d I, the major zzso produced by the domestic cat zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso has been added to the zzso ends of the zzso d I chains 1 and 2 zzso to facilitate zzso using zzso zzso affinity zzso This method provides high yields in a single step of zzso 1 and zzso 2 of zzso d I with a zzso zzso level of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso methods were used to introduce a zzso zzso site zzso decreases zzso at the zzso of both zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 and zzso 2 followed by zzso zzso of the zzso products allowed the isolation of each zzso chain with only two additional zzso zzso at the zzso of the native zzso zzso acid sequencing analysis of the zzso and mass zzso of these zzso demonstrated that they are highly pure and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso from zzso patients binds to both zzso 1 and zzso 2 of zzso d I, demonstrating that both these chains contribute to the zzso of this zzso zzso An examination of the zzso of T cells derived from zzso patients revealed that both zzso chains contribute to the T cell response to this zzso zzso it is concluded that the zzso response to zzso d I is composed of a reaction at both the B and T cell level to each of the two chains that constitute the native zzso
