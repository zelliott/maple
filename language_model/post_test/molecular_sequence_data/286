zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso loop 2 of a subset of zzso zzso zzso Here, the molecular mechanism of the zzso interaction was zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to loop 2 peptides of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, zzso 15, 16, zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping identified the central motif zzso supposed to represent a turn region in the loop 2, as essential for the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso demonstrated the involvement of zzso and zzso of full-length zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso cells expressing zzso whereas zzso bound to zzso zzso cells, zzso This binding was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso in zzso In contrast, removal of the aromatic side chains in the loop 2 of zzso and zzso involved in zzso between zzso increased the amount of zzso zzso These findings and molecular modeling indicate different molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso bind to zzso at the plasma zzso outside zzso zzso Together, these findings demonstrate that zzso binds to the zzso turn and zzso polar zzso in the loop 2 of zzso outside tight zzso The data can be used for the specific design of zzso zzso of tight zzso to improve drug delivery, and as zzso for tumors zzso zzso
