Death zzso zzso and zzso rich repeats zzso are two different types of protein interaction zzso Death zzso are found predominantly in proteins involved in signaling and are involved in zzso and zzso zzso rich repeats are found in proteins with diverse cellular functions, like cell zzso and cellular zzso and mediate zzso zzso zzso In this paper we report the cloning of a new human gene called zzso zzso repeat death domain containing zzso zzso encodes a protein of 83 zzso with six zzso at the zzso and a zzso at the zzso zzso appears to be processed into two fragments of about 33 and 55 zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is shown to interact with two other death domain containing zzso zzso and zzso presumably through death domain zzso zzso may represent a new type of adapter protein that could be involved in signaling or other cellular zzso
