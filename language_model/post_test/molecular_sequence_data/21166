The zzso of zzso and zzso is a broadly acting sweet taste zzso which mediates zzso sweet taste toward natural and artificial zzso and zzso zzso zzso of sweet taste is a zzso zzso zzso For instance, artificial zzso zzso and zzso taste sweet to humans, apes, and Old World monkeys but not to New World monkeys and zzso Although specific regions determining the zzso of the receptors by these zzso have been identified, the molecular mechanism of zzso sweet taste remains zzso Using zzso monkey zzso zzso and molecular zzso we reveal that the different responses of zzso species toward the artificial zzso zzso and zzso are determined by the zzso effect of a combination of a few zzso in the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the human zzso which zzso to zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso monkey zzso were found to be the critical zzso for the zzso difference in sweet zzso In addition, human zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso in zzso monkey zzso zzso the higher affinity of zzso than of zzso Our studies not only shed light on the molecular mechanism of zzso sweet taste toward artificial zzso but also provide guidance for designing novel effective artificial sweet zzso
