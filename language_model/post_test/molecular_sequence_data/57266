The influence of molecular structure and DNA binding mode on the ability of zzso zzso to zzso DNA strand break formation has been studied for a series of zzso zzso zzso using zzso and DNA sequencing zzso zzso zzso with zzso groups in which the zzso nitrogen is in the zzso or zzso position zzso the substitution point are capable of zzso binding and are considerably more efficient DNA zzso than the corresponding zzso zzso zzso Within each group of zzso the zzso efficiency increases with the number of positive zzso Using DNA sequencing experiments, we have demonstrated that zzso occurs primarily at the zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso sites produced by zzso are as important as direct zzso zzso The zzso of strand degradation in zzso and zzso solution suggest that type II reactions (probably zzso by zzso zzso occur with significantly higher yield than type I reactions and are responsible for the formation of zzso sites in zzso zzso These observations seem to confirm the hypothesis that those structural features which influence the strength and mode of binding also serve to establish zzso zzso interactions for zzso
