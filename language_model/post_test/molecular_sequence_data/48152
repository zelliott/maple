zzso B cells represent a zzso conspicuous zzso population that constantly occurs in zzso zzso zzso zzso Although widely believed to be closely related to zzso marginal zone B cells, neither this relationship, nor the zzso differentiation stage of zzso B cells, nor their cellular precursors have been zzso We have therefore examined zzso B cells for their expression of zzso differentiation markers and the zzso zzso at the zzso and protein level as well as for rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso genes and zzso zzso within the variable zzso zzso The results obtained were compared with the corresponding features of other zzso zzso The zzso B cells displayed zzso differences to all other zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was absent from most zzso B cells at the zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in 85 of the 95 cells zzso zzso percent of the rearranged zzso genes were devoid of zzso zzso whereas the remaining zzso carried a low number of zzso zzso The majority of these showed no significant signs of zzso zzso This finding in conjunction with the predominantly unrelated zzso gene zzso indicates that most zzso B cells arise not by zzso proliferation but by transformation of zzso B zzso The B cells undergoing a zzso zzso transformation are in the majority zzso zzso B cells, and only a minority are zzso zzso zzso center B zzso Thus, our data show that zzso B cells represent a distinct zzso zzso
