zzso zzso zzso zzso commonly causes local disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract and has recently been shown to interfere with both the classical and alternative pathways of complement zzso The terminal zzso of the complement system is regulated by zzso that is a component of both plasma and the zzso zzso In this study, we identify protein E zzso 16 zzso which is a recently characterized ubiquitous outer membrane zzso as a zzso protein of zzso A zzso zzso zzso had a markedly reduced survival in serum compared with the zzso zzso zzso wild zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso showed a significantly decreased binding to both soluble and immobilized zzso In zzso zzso zzso coli bound soluble zzso and zzso to immobilized zzso compared with zzso Surface zzso resonance technology revealed a zzso of zzso zzso for the interaction between zzso zzso and immobilized zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso site was located at the zzso zzso of zzso and the major zzso domain was found in the central core of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the surface of zzso zzso reduced membrane attack zzso zzso In contrast to incubation with normal human serum, zzso zzso showed a reduced survival in zzso human serum, thus demonstrating that zzso mediates a protective role at the bacterial zzso Our findings show that zzso by binding zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso
