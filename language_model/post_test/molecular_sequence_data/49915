While zzso regulated genes are generally zzso zzso zzso a key locus involved in the regulation of sexual zzso is highly zzso between species of zzso With an aim to understand its divergence between sibling species, we investigated zzso sequence variation among members of the zzso zzso species complex, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this species group, zzso divergence is rapid yet zzso and exhibits large differences in protein zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso acid tandem duplication, whereas zzso zzso possesses a zzso acid tandem zzso representing a zzso increase in total zzso acid zzso We also found evidence of a zzso distribution of replacement zzso and zzso in substitution rates using zzso statistics and a zzso substitution zzso We show that zzso rapid divergence in this species complex is the result of generally lower selective constraints around regions that zzso zzso zzso zzso and a significantly higher rate of zzso around the zzso site of zzso zzso large zzso The proximity of rapidly zzso regions to sites of zzso zzso suggests that higher local rates of zzso may provide a zzso mechanism for zzso rapid divergence in this zzso A comparison of zzso zzso across the zzso zzso suggest that zzso maintains an assortment of zzso zzso for proper sex determining function while much of the protein zzso relatively zzso
