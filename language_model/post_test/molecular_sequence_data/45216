To compare few zzso and zzso characteristics of two zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In the present study, zzso zzso zzso activity, composition of fatty acids of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and the selection pressure applied during the growth and enrichment of the bacterial strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared in our zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dry cell zzso and that of the bacterial strain zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dry cell zzso zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of cell zzso of these two bacterial strains in the presence of light gas oil showed that both the strains had different fatty acid profiles in their cell zzso zzso of the full gene sequences of the zzso gene zzso in the two bacterial strains showed significant difference in the zzso gene zzso There was a significant difference observed in the selection pressure applied during the growth and enrichment of the two bacterial zzso 

The results of the comparative study of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that there were considerable differences in the zzso and zzso characteristics of these two zzso 

The present study would broaden the understanding of zzso trait at zzso zzso
