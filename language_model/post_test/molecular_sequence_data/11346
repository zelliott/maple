The zzso replacement of zzso with zzso markedly decreased the specific activities for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso zzso reaction was about zzso smaller than that of the wild zzso On the other hand, the affinity for zzso of zzso was not significantly zzso The zzso of the zzso group of zzso bound in zzso was approximately zzso zzso units higher than those in the wild type, but the zzso values at high pH were not so much lower than those of the wild zzso The zzso of zzso was significantly lower than that of the wild zzso zzso zzso seems to be important for the construction of the active zzso zzso
