The sequence preferences for zzso of a series of novel zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso zzso by an zzso chain of variable length were studied by using procedures analogous to zzso zzso The compounds zzso DNA at both zzso and zzso zzso For zzso linked to the zzso by a short zzso chain through a zzso zzso or zzso group, zzso sequences are the most preferred sites at which zzso zzso zzso For zzso with longer chain zzso the preference of zzso sequences diminishes in favor of zzso zzso at the complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso are shown to selectively inhibit zzso at the zzso of zzso (in the major zzso by these compounds but not the zzso at the zzso of zzso (in the minor zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso variation were also studied by using zzso zzso linked to zzso and zzso hindered zzso zzso The results demonstrate that in this series of zzso zzso the zzso interactions of the carrier zzso with DNA significantly modify the sequence selectivity of zzso by the zzso zzso between the DNA zzso patterns of these compounds and their biological activities are zzso
