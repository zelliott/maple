Critical events in zzso processing of zzso are the recognition of the zzso zzso signal by zzso and zzso specificity factor zzso and the binding of zzso stimulation factor zzso via its zzso zzso to the downstream zzso The stability of this zzso complex is thought to determine the efficiency of zzso zzso Since downstream elements reveal high sequence zzso in zzso selection experiments with highly zzso zzso were performed to investigate the sequence requirements for zzso zzso zzso was zzso from calf zzso and from zzso zzso Surprisingly, calf zzso zzso contained an zzso novel form of the zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 70 zzso zzso zzso selected by zzso and calf zzso zzso contained three highly zzso sequence elements as zzso element 1 zzso and two closely related zzso element zzso zzso and element zzso zzso All selected sequences tested functioned as downstream elements in zzso processing in zzso A computer survey of the zzso data library revealed significant zzso to all selected elements in naturally occurring zzso zzso The majority of element zzso zzso was found downstream of coding zzso zzso we zzso that this element represents a novel consensus sequence for downstream elements in zzso processing of zzso
