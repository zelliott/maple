Recent analysis of zzso zzso proteins highlights the zzso regulation of a broad spectrum of cellular zzso However, the exact role of zzso remains unclear due to a lack of zzso zzso data in zzso Here, we present the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enrichment using zzso zzso followed by zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso peptides representing 114 zzso These zzso proteins include not only common zzso from zzso zzso counterparts, but also unique zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is pronounced in zzso zzso These data complement current knowledge of the bacterial zzso and provide an expanded platform for better understanding of the function of zzso in cellular zzso
