New zzso technologies provide an excellent opportunity for sharing and zzso information and using web as a platform for interaction and zzso Although several specialized tools are available for analyzing DNA sequence information, conventional zzso tools have not been zzso for zzso zzso We have developed a novel zzso and implemented it for searching zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso by using popular zzso methods such as zzso 

We developed an alignment independent character based zzso based on dividing a sequence library zzso zzso and query sequence to zzso The actual search is conducted by conventional search tools such as freely available Google Desktop zzso We implemented our zzso in two zzso zzso We developed zzso and zzso software to provide customized input and output services, zzso Our analysis of all publicly available DNA zzso sequences shows a high accuracy as well as rapid zzso 

Our method makes use of conventional zzso technologies for specialized genetic zzso It provides a robust and efficient solution for sequence search on the zzso The integration of our search method for large-scale sequence libraries such as DNA zzso provides an excellent zzso tool for zzso this information and linking it to other available categories of information on the zzso
