Multiple sclerosis zzso may be an zzso disease zzso by T cells specific for a zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated zzso basic protein zzso T cells that were activated in zzso in zzso patients, suggesting that zzso may be a target zzso in zzso The variable zzso region of the T cell zzso zzso beta chain was examined among 83 T cell lines from both zzso patients and healthy subjects that were zzso with the zzso region of human zzso zzso 84 to zzso or with a second zzso region of zzso zzso to zzso V beta 17 and to a lesser extent V beta 12 were frequently used in recognition of zzso among different zzso In contrast, V beta 17 was very zzso among lines zzso with zzso zzso These data demonstrate shared zzso V beta gene usage for the recognition of zzso regions of the human zzso zzso Such zzso structures may be used as targets for specific zzso in zzso
