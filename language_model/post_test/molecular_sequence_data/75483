zzso of zzso DNA from zzso strain zzso zzso virus containing zzso zzso into a rat zzso cell line zzso caused not only cell transformation but also a remarkable change in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso cells was characterized by the exclusive expression of zzso along with a trace amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acid zzso and novel zzso zzso (presumably zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in addition to zzso Thus, the zzso strain zzso zzso virus DNA zzso open two new zzso zzso zzso one leading to the synthesis of zzso and the other to that of zzso zzso These results were in striking contrast to the cases of zzso with so-called zzso zzso transforming zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with which the same zzso cells newly expressed zzso with a zzso decrease in precursor zzso zzso The difference in underlying mechanisms of zzso metabolism shown by these two different types of zzso might reflect differences in the modes of action of the zzso and their biological zzso
