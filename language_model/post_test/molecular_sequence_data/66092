zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins play a key regulatory role in zzso membrane trafficking and cell zzso zzso zzso serve as interaction platforms for short zzso motifs zzso the zzso zzso within zzso zzso regions of accessory zzso The zzso interactions described thus far are of very low affinity and zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso sorting zzso zzso as a zzso zzso for the second zzso domain zzso of the zzso accessory protein zzso zzso data indicate that both zzso motifs within zzso interact with zzso simultaneously and with zzso zzso The solution structure of this complex reveals that the first zzso motif binds to the zzso site on the zzso domain, whereas the second motif zzso into a novel zzso zzso Our data show how combination of two zzso sites provides a means for modulating specificity and allows discrimination from a large pool of potential binding partners containing zzso zzso
