A genetic engineering approach was made to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso virus zzso of the family zzso that expresses zzso zzso The DNA construct containing the entire open reading frame zzso of the zzso gene followed by the zzso zzso stop and zzso signals connected with the zzso zzso three zzso was inserted immediately before the zzso of the viral zzso zzso zzso protein gene in a full-length zzso zzso zzso After zzso expression of full-length zzso transcripts from the engineered zzso and of the viral zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso from the respective zzso a zzso zzso expressing zzso activity at a high level was recovered, although the tendency of this particular reporter gene product to zzso in cells made it difficult to estimate the maximum level of zzso The increase in zzso length brought about by inserting zzso zzso into the zzso zzso parental zzso was associated with reduced plaque size, slightly slower replication zzso and a zzso decrease in yield of the zzso The inserted zzso gene was zzso maintained after numerous rounds of replication by serial passages in chick zzso These results indicate the potential utility of zzso as a novel expression zzso
