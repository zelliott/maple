The molecular weights of zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequences of mature protein and of zzso zzso fragments were determined in zzso zzso The zzso of the primary structure was relatively high among zzso examined here, and there appeared to be a common zzso zzso in the vicinity of the N zzso Based on the zzso acid zzso these zzso could be divided into two groups, including corn and rice in one and zzso zzso four zzso species, zzso and barley in the zzso In zzso wheat and zzso species there were zzso of zzso acids in the primary zzso Variations of this sort suggest that the primary structure of zzso proteins would provide clues to the zzso relations in the wheat zzso
