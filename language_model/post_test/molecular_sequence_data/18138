The zzso protein gene of the virulent Miller strain of zzso zzso virus zzso was zzso from zzso clones and compared to the zzso gene sequence of the zzso Purdue zzso zzso comparisons indicate that most zzso acid differences occur in the zzso half of the zzso which represents the most exposed region of the zzso In addition, analysis of an incompletely zzso open reading frame zzso to the immediate zzso side of the zzso gene indicates extensive sequence zzso with the infectious zzso virus zzso zzso gene which is thought to zzso a zzso zzso
