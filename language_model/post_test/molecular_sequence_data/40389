An zzso strain was isolated from zzso forest soil, and subjected to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso comprised zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were detected as the major cellular fatty zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that this zzso was related to members of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso properties readily differentiated this zzso from the zzso zzso Based on the zzso and zzso evidence, the strain is assigned to a novel species of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
