The rat zzso zzso c promoter is resolved into a mosaic of zzso upstream and zzso elements required for zzso zzso zzso in each diminished zzso c promoter activity and eliminated the specific binding of zzso nuclear zzso Among these is the recognition sequence for a nuclear factor designated zzso zzso respiratory factor 1) also found in the upstream regions of several other nuclear genes whose products function in the zzso The zzso site was tightly coupled to a second functionally independent element zzso zzso and together these sites constitute a major zzso of zzso c zzso In addition to these novel sequence zzso the promoter also contained recognition sites for the common zzso zzso zzso and zzso A potent promoter element within the first zzso consisted of two adjacent zzso binding zzso Point zzso in the first site eliminated the promoter activity of the element as well as zzso binding to both zzso An zzso recognition sequence in the upstream promoter was identical to an authentic zzso zzso zzso responsive element in stimulating promoter activity and in zzso a zzso response upon a zzso zzso These promoter elements and their zzso nuclear factors likely contribute to the zzso function of zzso c and to the coordinate zzso of respiratory gene expression according to cellular energy zzso
