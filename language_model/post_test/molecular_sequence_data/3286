An increasing number of folding studies of two-state proteins shows that point zzso sometimes change the kinetic zzso leading to zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The molecular origin of these changes is yet unclear although it is speculated that they are linked to structural zzso of the transition state or to zzso of zzso zzso To shed more light on this issue, we present here a combined m and zzso analysis of the split zzso protein zzso zzso zzso displays classical two-state zzso with zzso zzso plot, but a majority of its zzso display distinct zzso changes or curved zzso We observe that this kinetic aberration of zzso is linked to zzso that are clustered in distinct regions of the native zzso The most pronounced changes, zzso decrease in the zzso for the unfolding rate constant, are seen upon zzso of interactions between the N and C zzso whereas zzso in the zzso of the zzso core show smaller or even opposed zzso As a consequence, the calculated zzso display a systematic increase upon addition of zzso In the case of zzso the phenomenon seems to arise from a general plasticity of the different species on the folding zzso That is, the structure of the zzso ensemble, the transition state, and the native zzso for unfolding seem to change upon zzso From these changes, it is concluded that interactions spanning the zzso of the zzso core form early in zzso whereas the zzso zzso interactions linking the N and C zzso consolidate very late, mainly on the zzso of the folding zzso
