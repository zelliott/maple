Evidence for zzso demographic and selective factors affecting zzso evolution can be obtained by examining zzso sequence variation in candidate genes such as zzso zzso zzso Two closely related zzso species can be distinguished by their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso populations are fixed for the S zzso and inhabit temporary zzso while zzso zzso populations are fixed for the F zzso and inhabit large zzso zzso One locus is detected in most zzso surveys, but zzso sequencing has revealed two zzso zzso and zzso 

We zzso both zzso genes from 70 zzso of these two species from North America to determine if the association between zzso zzso and habitat shows evidence for selection, and to zzso the evolutionary history of the two zzso We found that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso form distinct groups at both zzso and the substitution of zzso zzso for zzso acid zzso at zzso acid 229 likely causes the zzso mobility shift in the zzso zzso zzso diversity in both zzso genes is much lower in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso Moreover, the lack of spatial structuring of the variation in both genes over a wide geographic area is consistent with a recent demographic expansion of lake zzso zzso tests indicate that both genes are under zzso selection, but the intensity is much stronger on zzso 

Although zzso zzso zzso zzso with the other lineages in the zzso species complex, it remains distinct ecologically and zzso This ecological zzso coupled with the intensity of zzso selection on zzso and the strong association between its zzso and habitat, suggests that experimental studies would be useful to determine if variation in molecular function provides evidence that zzso zzso are zzso
