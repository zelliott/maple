In the present study, we examined whether delta zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso from zzso on zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso with rat brain membrane resulted in the degradation of zzso with liberation of zzso an zzso zzso acid of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the degradation of zzso and release of zzso The releases of zzso zzso substance zzso from rat brain slices and zzso were significantly zzso by high zzso zzso The released zzso was zzso with native zzso on gel zzso zzso High zzso release of zzso did not show zzso zzso This zzso suggests that the zzso zzso of zzso may be different from that of other zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is released from nerve endings on zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may serve as a zzso material in the central nervous zzso
