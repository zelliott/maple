zzso the classic zzso zzso zzso cell division by preventing proper assembly of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is known to act by binding to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso How this binding to zzso changes the structure of the protein and results in zzso poisoning has not been zzso The structural locus of zzso detected zzso changes induced by zzso is zzso We report here that zzso zzso the unfolding of a small region in the zzso region of zzso around zzso This unfolding is detected by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso this region after zzso and zzso zzso after zzso The unfolded region appears to be the zzso end of an zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and we propose that this unfolding prevents contacts necessary for zzso Our results suggest that zzso is exposed on the growing end of the zzso which provides a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso to zzso
