The crystal structure of zzso zzso has been refined at zzso A (1 A zzso zzso zzso resolution using a restrained zzso zzso The final zzso zzso based on zzso reflections in the range zzso A less than or equal to d less than or equal to zzso A with zzso exceeding zzso zzso is zzso Bond lengths and bond angles in the zzso have zzso zzso from ideal values of zzso A and zzso degrees, zzso The refined model includes zzso 5 to zzso four zzso and 69 water molecules per zzso of zzso The electron density for zzso 1 to 4 and 148 is poorly zzso and they are not included in the zzso The zzso is shaped somewhat like a zzso with an overall length of 65 zzso the two zzso are connected by a zzso zzso zzso secondary structural features include seven zzso four zzso zzso and two short, zzso zzso zzso between pairs of adjacent zzso zzso The four zzso zzso in zzso have a typical zzso hand zzso zzso and are similar to those described in other zzso zzso The X-ray structure determination of zzso shows a large zzso zzso in each half of the zzso These zzso regions probably represent the sites of interaction with many of the pharmacological agents known to bind to zzso
