We have isolated a series of human zzso zzso zzso clones by zzso to zzso a Y gene zzso to zzso Their sequence analysis revealed an identical zzso composition in different zzso zzso suggesting that all were zzso by the same zzso We mapped this gene to the short arm of zzso 3 and designated it zzso zzso like zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso revealed two prominent zzso The tandem repetitive structure of 72 zzso sequence units zzso zzso is zzso zzso contains only one 72 zzso sequence zzso zzso of it, a specific 130 zzso sequence domain is present which is absent in zzso and zzso but present in the mouse gene zzso and in the zzso gene zzso zzso encodes an zzso binding protein expressed only in the human male zzso The data presented give strong evidence that not zzso but zzso is the functional human zzso of zzso and zzso
