zzso zzso zzso which is widely used for separation of zzso zzso zzso and compounds of environmental and pharmaceutical interest, can be readily coupled to zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso but this arrangement usually compromises mass spectral resolution due to the zzso of the TLC zzso However, TLC can be coupled to an external zzso source zzso transform zzso zzso instrument without compromising mass accuracy and resolution of the zzso Furthermore, when the zzso has a zzso cooled zzso zzso source, fragile zzso can be zzso from TLC plates without zzso even to the point that zzso of intact molecules from zzso such as zzso acid is zzso In this work, whole brain zzso are separated using zzso the TLC plates are attached directly to the zzso target, where the zzso are zzso zzso and detected in the zzso with zzso zzso resolving zzso
