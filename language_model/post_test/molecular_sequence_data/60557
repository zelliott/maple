The zzso protein of budding zzso and its zzso in other species play an essential role in the initiation of DNA zzso A zzso zzso a human zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in a soluble and functionally active zzso The zzso protein bound specifically to zzso and slowly zzso it, whereas zzso zzso containing zzso acid zzso in the Walker A or B motifs were zzso The zzso proteins retained the ability to bind zzso and zzso but displayed zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of either zzso protein into human cells in zzso inhibited DNA zzso suggesting that zzso binding and zzso by zzso are essential for DNA zzso
