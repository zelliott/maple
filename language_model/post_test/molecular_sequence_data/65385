zzso is a zzso zzso tandem zinc finger protein that can bind to and destabilize certain zzso containing zzso element binding zzso zzso is the single gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a protein containing the critical features of the zzso zinc finger zzso zzso has been linked to zzso signal zzso control and to the coordination of zzso but no biological function has been ascribed to the zzso zzso Through a functional zzso approach we compared transcript levels in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso those elevated in the zzso strain were examined for the presence of potential zzso binding zzso One such potential target transcript was zzso by zzso a gene zzso a protein of unknown function that contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in the zzso strain when it was expressed under the control of a zzso zzso zzso within one zzso element present in the zzso zzso region protected this transcript from zzso zzso whereas mutating another potential binding site had no zzso zzso zzso confirmed a direct interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso this interaction was eliminated when key zzso were zzso in either zzso zinc zzso zzso and its targets in zzso zzso represent a useful model system for studies of zinc finger zzso element interactions that result in zzso zzso
