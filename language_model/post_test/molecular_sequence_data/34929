The crystal structure of the zzso protein from zzso zzso was determined by the zzso anomalous zzso method and was refined to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein family and its structure provides the first insight into the structural organization of this zzso A number of fully and highly zzso zzso defined by multiple sequence alignment of members of the zzso family were mapped onto the structure of zzso The fully zzso zzso are involved in the coordination of a metal zzso and in the stabilization of zzso surrounding the metal zzso Several additional highly zzso zzso also map into the vicinity of the zzso site, while others are clearly involved in stabilizing the zzso core of the zzso The structure of zzso represents a new fold in protein zzso zzso
