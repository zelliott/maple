We have identified four overlapping zzso DNA clones coding for human class 1 zzso growth factor zzso also known as zzso zzso growth factor, by screening zzso DNA libraries with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene was determined by Southern zzso and zzso sequence zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of human zzso was deduced from the zzso sequence of these zzso DNA zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence is identical to the published zzso acid sequence determined by protein zzso Southern zzso analysis of human DNA suggested that there is a zzso gene coding for zzso A zzso zzso and two minor species zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene were detected in cellular zzso isolated from human adult brain and zzso The zzso zzso from brain and kidney had slightly different zzso The mechanism for the synthesis of different sizes of zzso was not zzso We also detected zzso transcript from zzso cells, fetal brain, and kidney but not from zzso or fetal zzso Since zzso is an zzso factor, these data suggest that it may play a role in embryonic zzso during fetal zzso
