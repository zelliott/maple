zzso is a zzso protein that in zzso zzso sheets zzso at tight junctions zzso whereas in sparse cultures accumulates in clusters at the zzso Here, we have characterized several nuclear properties of zzso We observe that zzso is present in the nuclear zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso of sparse zzso We show that zzso presents several zzso at its zzso region, that when deleted, diminish the nuclear import of the zzso zzso segment and impair the ability of the region to regulate the zzso activity of promoters controlled by zzso Several zzso repeats are detected in the zzso zzso segment, however, their deletion does not zzso the display of a speckled nuclear zzso zzso displays two putative zzso However, only the second one appears to be functional, as when zzso to zzso zzso it is able to zzso this protein from the nucleus to the zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
