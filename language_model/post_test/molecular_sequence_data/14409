zzso are symbiotic associations between zzso and zzso algae or zzso zzso are potent toxins that are responsible for the poisoning of both humans and zzso These toxins are mainly associated with aquatic zzso zzso but here we show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from all over the world commonly produce zzso We screened zzso zzso specimens from five different zzso for zzso toxins by amplifying a part of the gene cluster zzso the zzso complex responsible for zzso production and detecting toxins directly from zzso zzso We found either the zzso genes for making zzso or the toxin itself in zzso of all analyzed zzso zzso A plethora of different zzso was found with over 50 chemical zzso and many of the zzso detected have only rarely been reported from zzso zzso In addition, high amounts of zzso up to 60 zzso zzso were detected from some zzso zzso This zzso analog and potent zzso has previously been known only from the aquatic zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a global phenomenon and occurs in many different zzso zzso The very high genetic diversity of the zzso gene and the chemical diversity of zzso suggest that zzso zzso may have been an important environment for diversification of these zzso
