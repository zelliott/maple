zzso B, a zzso zzso that has zzso activity against zzso tissue zzso has been suggested to be important in the zzso tissue zzso processes associated with zzso and plaque zzso This study tested the hypothesis that sequence variation in the promoter region of the zzso B gene influences its zzso zzso individuals carrying certain genetic zzso to more severe zzso 

zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out to search the promoter region of the gene zzso zzso B for naturally occurring genetic zzso As a result, an zzso common zzso was zzso which arose from a zzso zzso to zzso zzso transition at position zzso relative to the start of zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso interaction zzso indicated that the T zzso had a higher promoter activity than the C zzso which appeared to be due to preferential binding of a putative zzso zzso protein to the C zzso zzso A sample of zzso male patients with zzso zzso and 645 zzso male healthy control subjects were zzso The zzso zzso were not significantly different between the cases and control zzso However, in 374 patients with available zzso data, zzso of those carrying 1 or 2 copies of the T zzso had zzso zzso in 3 coronary zzso whereas only zzso of zzso zzso had zzso zzso 

These data suggest that this functional genetic variation influences zzso B gene promoter activity in an zzso manner and has an effect on zzso zzso
