In order to clarify the role of the zzso tumor zzso gene in controlling growth and differentiation of human zzso cells, we zzso a zzso zzso complementary DNA, driven by a zzso mouse zzso tumor virus promoter, into zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso When treated with zzso 2 of 8 independent clones that contained integrated zzso sequences expressed zzso zzso zzso as well as nuclear zzso zzso The highest zzso zzso zzso was as resistant to zzso of cell growth by transforming growth factor beta as control zzso Furthermore, these cells continued to zzso in medium containing the combination of 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso fetal bovine serum, which normally zzso terminal differentiation in primary zzso However, under these same conditions, two of the essential proteins required for the formation of the zzso cell envelope were zzso First, in zzso and zzso cells, the activity of zzso zzso zzso I increased to 3- to zzso higher levels than in control zzso Second, in zzso and zzso cells, the envelope zzso zzso increased to 5 to 8 times the levels attained in control zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso does not restore responsiveness of zzso zzso cells to growth zzso but allows cells to zzso the proteins required for the assembly of the zzso cell zzso
