A hybrid zzso protein was designed against a zzso zzso insect zzso zzso zzso which is tolerant to most of the known zzso The hybrid zzso was created by replacing zzso acid zzso zzso in a poorly active natural zzso zzso with a highly zzso 70 zzso acid region of zzso in domain zzso The truncated zzso zzso zzso and the hybrid protein zzso accumulated in zzso coli to form inclusion zzso The zzso zzso made from zzso coli was zzso fold more toxic to the larvae of zzso zzso than zzso the best known zzso against zzso zzso None of the two truncated zzso zzso from zzso coli caused zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso coli and zzso from inclusion bodies caused mortality of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso A synthetic gene coding for the hybrid zzso zzso was designed for high level expression in plants, taking into consideration several features found in the highly expressed plant zzso zzso single copy plants of tobacco as well as cotton were zzso The selected lines expressed zzso at zzso of soluble leaf zzso Such plants were completely resistant to zzso zzso and caused zzso mortality in all stages of zzso zzso zzso unlike in zzso coli, the hybrid zzso folded into a functionally active zzso in both tobacco and cotton zzso The truncated zzso expressed in tobacco leaves was about zzso more toxic zzso 58 zzso zzso compared to expression in zzso zzso
