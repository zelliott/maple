zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and has been isolated from soil samples and plant materials from France, zzso Turkey and zzso Its zzso characteristics are reminiscent of those of zzso zzso discovered in Algeria by the corresponding zzso Unfortunately, the Algerian isolate was not deposited in any culture collection and ultimately got zzso Those were the days when molecular description of zzso was not a zzso zzso no molecular characteristics of the Algerian zzso were deposited to the zzso Moreover, its zzso zzso branches made it an easy prey to be considered as synonymous to zzso zzso Because there are no living strains of zzso zzso and no sequence at the zzso it is being treated as zzso zzso zzso However, we have now isolated the same type of zzso from four different countries and we have sufficient evidence, both molecular and zzso to describe it as a new species, quite different from zzso zzso In this article, we are giving the zzso and molecular evidence to separate it as a distinct species, zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso description of this zzso its comparison with related species, and the sequence of the internal transcribed zzso region of its zzso zzso are discussed zzso
