As an initial step to develop a zzso transformation system using zzso resistance as a dominant zzso marker in the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso zzso zzso DNA library of a zzso strain zzso and a zzso gene zzso was isolated, cloned and zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that a single copy of zzso is present in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene is composed of seven zzso which are separated by six zzso of 52 to 135 zzso The zzso consensus sequences are similar to those of other zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso acid zzso is highly zzso to those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences around zzso 198 and 200 in zzso and sensitive strains revealed that the zzso zzso from the zzso strain zzso contained a zzso at zzso 198 from zzso zzso to zzso zzso which has been correlated with high resistance to zzso zzso including zzso in various zzso zzso
