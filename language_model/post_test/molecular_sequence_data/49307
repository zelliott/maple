We have used indirect zzso studies and zzso zzso and deletion mapping to characterize the zzso of human copper zzso 1 zzso the putative human zzso zzso zzso Both approaches indicated that zzso contains three zzso zzso and that the zzso of zzso which contains several putative zzso sites, is localized zzso whereas the zzso is exposed to the zzso Based on previous observations that zzso proteins form zzso complexes, we investigated directly whether zzso proteins interact with zzso zzso zzso studies showed that interaction of zzso zzso rat and human zzso occurs at the sites of their zzso zzso and is not dependent on the copper concentration in the growth zzso Analysis of deletion zzso indicated that multiple regions in the zzso are essential for this zzso In contrast, the zzso tail of the presumed zzso copper zzso zzso does not interact with zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso spans the membrane at least six times, permitting formation of a channel, which is consistent with its proposed role as a copper zzso
