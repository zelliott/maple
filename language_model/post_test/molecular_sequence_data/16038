The gene for a new zzso zzso protein zzso was identified and isolated by zzso to a cloned zzso for the zzso zzso of bovine zzso protein zzso This newly isolated zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that shows strong sequence similarity to several zzso protein zzso The protein zzso zzso domain is located at the zzso portion of the zzso A large, zzso domain shows no sequence similarity to any known protein zzso It seems likely that the zzso domain mediates the effects of an unknown regulator of the newly identified zzso protein zzso
