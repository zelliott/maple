We have examined both the sequence changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and the cell zzso of a zzso stock of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso isolated from the zzso fluid of a zzso zzso zzso that developed zzso This virus zzso is highly zzso when zzso into other zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso products revealed a total of 5 zzso changes in the zzso while zzso had 2 consensus zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso and zzso had no consensus zzso acid zzso whereas zzso had 1 consensus zzso The zzso and rev genes of the zzso region of zzso had 2 and 1 consensus zzso acid changes, zzso The zzso gene of the zzso region of zzso which originally had an zzso at the beginning of the zzso reverted to an initiation zzso zzso and in addition contained a consensus zzso acid substitution at position 69 of this zzso As expected, the majority of the zzso zzso were found in the zzso and zzso zzso Thirteen and 5 zzso acid changes were predicted for the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, one-third of the zzso gene clones isolated from the zzso stock had a zzso deletion in the zzso zzso Using three independent zzso we determined that the changes in the zzso were associated with an increase in the efficiency of replication in zzso The zzso few consensus changes in the virus suggest that conversion of this virus to one capable of causing AIDS in zzso zzso was associated with relatively few changes in the viral envelope and/or accessory zzso These results will provide the basis for the development of a zzso molecular clone of zzso capable of causing AIDS in zzso zzso
