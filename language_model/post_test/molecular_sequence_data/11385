zzso is a family of zzso factors that binds discrete zzso sequence and regulates zzso activity of zzso zzso occurs through zzso zzso Among the genes whose zzso activity is regulated are those expressed in a zzso specific zzso This suggests the possible existence of zzso proteins with distinct zzso With the use of the zzso chain reaction technique, we have cloned and analyzed the activity of three spliced zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the regulatory regions of these proteins fused to the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso factor zzso helped identify both negative and positive regulatory zzso In the context of the whole zzso zzso spliced zzso lacking the positive regulatory sequences functioned as zzso whereas those containing both regulatory zzso functioned as weak zzso With the identification of the negative domain in the zzso zzso we demonstrate here a novel regulatory feature of these proteins in positive and negative zzso of gene zzso
