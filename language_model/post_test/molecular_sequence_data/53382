zzso recognition and binding are two very important processes in virtually all biological and chemical zzso An extremely interesting system involving recognition and binding is that of zzso zzso proteins at the zzso zzso These proteins are of great scientific interest because of their zzso zzso Certain fish, insects and plants living in cold weather regions are known to generate these proteins for zzso A detailed molecular understanding of how these proteins work could assist in developing synthetic zzso for use in zzso Although the shapes of these proteins vary from completely zzso to zzso they perform the same zzso It is the shapes of these proteins that control their recognition and binding to a specific face of zzso zzso zzso proteins modify the zzso of the ice zzso thereby depressing the freezing zzso Currently there are three hypotheses proposed with respect to the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso From zzso experiments, ice zzso experiments, X-ray structures and computer modeling at the zzso zzso the first recognition and binding hypothesis was proposed and stated that a lattice match of the ice zzso with zzso groups on the proteins was zzso Additional zzso experiments and computer simulations have lead to the second hypothesis, which asserted that the zzso portion of the zzso zzso of the type I zzso zzso proteins accumulates at the zzso zzso A third hypothesis, also based on zzso experiments and computer simulations, suggests that the zzso zzso proteins accumulate in the zzso interface and actually influence the specific ice plane to which the zzso zzso protein ultimately zzso The first two hypotheses emphasize the aspect of the protein zzso or zzso to specific faces of ice, while the third suggests that the protein assists in the development of the binding zzso Our modeling and analysis supports the third hypothesis, however, the first two cannot be completely ruled out at this zzso The objective of this paper is to review the zzso and experimental efforts during the past 20 years to zzso the recognition and binding of zzso zzso proteins at the zzso and zzso zzso
