We studied the duplex stability and the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequences complementary to the first 14 zzso of the rabbit zzso zzso The duplex formed by the zzso with the natural zzso target possessed a marginally better stability to that of the duplex formed by the zzso compound, as measured by the zzso zzso The zzso did not zzso to native zzso possibly due to the interference of the zzso with the cap structure and, unlike the zzso was practically inactive as inhibitor of translation in a zzso zzso However, it did zzso to an zzso construction containing the zzso zzso plus an additional 50 bases in zzso Surprisingly, translation from this construction was inhibited by the zzso in spite of the zzso of the target to the zzso Both alpha and beta zzso zzso to a DNA zzso of the same sequence as that targeted onto the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the drug brought no considerable stabilization to the duplex, the zzso presumably being zzso to zzso An increased stability of the complex and a higher zzso effect on zzso zzso translation were obtained with two zzso zzso of which one was zzso
