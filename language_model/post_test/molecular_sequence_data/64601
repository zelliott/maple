zzso is a zzso acid zzso involved in iron zzso in mice and zzso It is produced in the liver from a larger zzso and it is zzso in blood and zzso In contrast to the human zzso which contains only one copy of the zzso the mouse zzso contains 2 highly similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are, however, considerably divergent at the level of the corresponding mature zzso acid zzso This striking observation led us to ask whether zzso and zzso performed the same zzso activity with regard to iron metabolism in the zzso We recently described the severe zzso anemia zzso in transgenic mice zzso zzso in the zzso Here we report that, in contrast to the zzso mice, none of the 7 founder zzso animals suffered from zzso They all developed normally with zzso parameters similar to the zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso level was found to be very high for all lines compared with the level of zzso zzso zzso necessary to produce severe zzso These data provide evidence that zzso does not act on iron metabolism like zzso and give clues for the identification of zzso acids important for the zzso action of the mature zzso acid zzso
