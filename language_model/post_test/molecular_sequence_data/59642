The zzso hormone zzso gene zzso is the major candidate gene for the chestnut coat color in horses since it is assumed to be controlled by an zzso at the extension zzso zzso sequences were zzso amplified from chestnut zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was found that showed a complete association to the chestnut coat color among 144 horses representing 12 zzso zzso analysis revealed a single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso associated with the chestnut zzso The substitution occurs in the second zzso region, which apparently plays a key role in the zzso since zzso associated with coat color zzso in mice and cattle as well as red hair and fair skin in humans are found in this part of the zzso We propose that the now reported zzso is likely to be the zzso zzso for the chestnut coat zzso The zzso can be detected with a simple zzso test, since the zzso creates a zzso restriction site in the chestnut zzso
