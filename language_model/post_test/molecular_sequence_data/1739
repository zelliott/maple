Here we report on a male patient with zzso zzso zzso and constitutional zzso inversion of zzso 6 zzso zzso is a zzso group of zzso anomalies with complex genetic zzso Previously, a patient with zzso abnormalities and an zzso deletion of zzso region has been zzso We speculated that a zzso gene for zzso lies in zzso region zzso in both zzso and therefore, cloning of the zzso in our patient would lead to the identification of the disrupted zzso We performed FISH analysis followed by Southern zzso analysis and inverse zzso to clone the zzso The zzso zzso mapped very close to the zzso and the zzso zzso localized in the ninth zzso of the zzso zzso We then evaluated the involvement of zzso in zzso by further screening of the gene in several patients with a similar zzso Two zzso changes causing zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso both affecting zzso acid zzso zzso in the mouse zzso were identified in two zzso Both changes are either very rare zzso or true zzso since they were not detected in 167 normal individuals nor found in the zzso zzso zzso our study suggests zzso as a candidate gene for zzso However, we were unable to detect any zzso defects in the zzso knockout zzso
