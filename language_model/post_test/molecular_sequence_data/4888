The zzso zzso mouse spontaneously develops a generalized zzso disease with features similar to those of systemic lupus zzso This mouse strain provides a valuable system for identifying and characterizing the multiple genetic factors that influence the zzso of zzso zzso One of the most powerful means of examining the role of a specific gene product in zzso is by zzso the gene in mouse embryonic stem zzso cells by zzso zzso and using these cells to derive mouse lines carrying the zzso zzso The successful application of this approach, however, requires an zzso cell line that will remain stable in culture during the processes of genetic manipulation and zzso To date, zzso cell lines that meet this criterion have been derived from only a few mouse zzso Here we describe the production and characterization of stable zzso cell lines from the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso derived from the zzso zzso strain gave rise to zzso cell lines, and both of the male zzso zzso cell lines tested were shown to be zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso cell lines undergo gene targeting by zzso zzso at high frequency by zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso cell lines were used to generate zzso mouse lines zzso for the disrupted zzso zzso thus demonstrating the feasibility of using a genetic approach to dissect the zzso of the zzso disease in the zzso zzso
