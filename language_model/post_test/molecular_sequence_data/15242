In zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of zzso T cells and plays a pivotal role in the recognition and elimination of infected host cells by zzso zzso Here, we report the molecular cloning and expression analysis of zzso and zzso zzso in two zzso species, the gray zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso sequences share a high degree of zzso acid identity of zzso zzso and 57% zzso to each other as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso with their zzso zzso In addition, many of the signature features of zzso zzso and zzso are preserved in both zzso including the two zzso zzso that form the zzso zzso bond in the zzso zzso domain and the two hinge region zzso involved in zzso between the two zzso The zzso binding motif in the zzso tail of the zzso zzso is also zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sequences have a truncated zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso transcripts in the zzso of the adult zzso and zzso showed broad tissue expression with a high level of expression observed in the zzso zzso of both zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of zzso and zzso transcripts in the immune zzso of zzso young over the first 120 days of zzso life revealed a pattern of expression analogous to the maturation of the zzso zzso This is the first report confirming the presence of zzso in the zzso of a zzso and will provide the tools to further zzso T cell zzso in this unique group of zzso
