zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso acid sequences characteristic of the fatty acid zzso were obtained using expressed sequence tag zzso information of the zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso we have determined the zzso sequence and zzso sequence of a zzso The cloned zzso is zzso zzso long and the deduced zzso acid sequence comprised zzso zzso acid zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso The whole sequence was zzso identical to the initially identified zzso of zzso zzso We have confirmed its function as zzso by over expression zzso in zzso zzso and also the gain of function zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the lipids from transformed zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated the zzso of zzso zzso This is the first report zzso fatty acid zzso in cellular slime zzso
