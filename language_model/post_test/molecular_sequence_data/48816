The mechanisms through which environmental and dietary factors zzso DNA repair are still unclear but may include zzso of gene expression due to altered zzso zzso In a mouse model, we investigated the effect of maternal folate depletion during pregnancy and zzso and high-fat feeding from zzso on base zzso repair zzso and DNA zzso and expression of selected zzso genes in the brain of adult zzso While folate depletion did not affect zzso activity of the mothers, zzso increased in the offspring at weaning zzso In the long term, as observed in zzso zzso the double zzso zzso maternal zzso supply and high-fat feeding from zzso decreased zzso activity significantly in the cortex, zzso zzso and zzso regions zzso This fall in zzso activity was associated with small changes in zzso or expression of zzso zzso zzso folate depletion led to slightly increased zzso DNA damage levels in zzso regions of adult zzso which may increase sensitivity to zzso stress and zzso to neurological zzso In zzso our data suggest that zzso supply during early life may leave an zzso mark that can zzso the offspring to further dietary zzso causing adverse effects during adult zzso
