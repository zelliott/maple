A gene zzso for zzso zzso was isolated from a soybean zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso and the zzso clone of zzso indicated that the coding region of this gene is 330 zzso long and is interrupted by a single zzso of zzso zzso The coding region of the zzso gene shows a high degree of localized sequence similarity with the coding sequence of soybean zzso zzso zzso similarity between the two genes is limited to the coding region of 90 zzso in the first zzso and the first 54 zzso in the second zzso of the zzso gene which is repeated as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso gene has been zzso to be a result of repeated zzso of an zzso element consisting of the 54 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In the absence of sequence similarity in the regions zzso the 54 zzso sequence between the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene does not appear to be the ancestral zzso Both zzso and zzso have a similar zzso zzso terminal end suggesting that zzso like zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso Southern analysis of soybean zzso DNA shows the presence of other related sequences to the zzso zzso one of which is found to be closely linked to zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso transcripts during zzso development in effective and ineffective zzso suggests that zzso and related genes might differ from zzso and some other late zzso genes in their mechanism of zzso
