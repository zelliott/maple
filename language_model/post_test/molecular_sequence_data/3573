To evaluate the influence of marine bacterial zzso from the Bay of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were collected from the Bay of zzso during an zzso zzso zzso serially diluted to extinction and zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically enhanced zzso zzso zzso and analysis of zzso zzso fragments revealed an zzso zzso strain to be the only zzso zzso in all zzso that promoted zzso zzso and the sole zzso found in the most dilute zzso that promoted zzso zzso While this zzso has not yet been isolated, other zzso obtained from the zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso indicating that the observed stimulation was not a general effect of marine zzso 

Bay of zzso marine bacterial zzso dominated by a member of the family zzso were found to dramatically stimulate growth of zzso zzso 

These results show that native bacteria have the potential to dramatically promote the growth of zzso zzso and may play an important role in influencing zzso zzso dynamics in the Bay of zzso
