The promoter of the human gene for the zzso of zzso a zzso signal zzso zzso was analyzed by cloning the zzso zzso region of the gene upstream of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and measuring the level of zzso expression after zzso in zzso green monkey kidney zzso Analysis of multiple zzso deletion zzso reveals that a minimum of 85 bases upstream of the major zzso initiation site are required for full zzso promoter zzso zzso 11 bases to position zzso causes a zzso decrease in promoter zzso Another major zzso in activity is seen when a zzso box between zzso and zzso is deleted, consistent with this region being a functionally active zzso zzso zzso zzso extension of a zzso primer zzso to zzso from cells zzso with a zzso alpha zzso construct confirms approximately the same zzso start site as the zzso zzso alpha zzso The 3' deletion zzso that either approach or delete the zzso start site have markedly diminished zzso
