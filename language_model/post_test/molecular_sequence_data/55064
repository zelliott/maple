Most of the zzso zzso zzso ; zzso zzso isolated so far from snake zzso are zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso an active zzso zzso and an inactive zzso zzso zzso from two geographical zzso samples of zzso The zzso zzso from the two samples have rather different zzso zzso zzso that the samples were probably derived from two species zzso and zzso The active zzso s from Sulawesi and Sumatra zzso were designated as zzso and zzso respectively, as a result of the presence of their zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of mouse and human zzso zzso zzso the zzso of mouse zzso but inhibited the zzso of human zzso Both zzso s were found to be zzso at zzso Using zzso analysis, the released zzso were shown to comprise complex type zzso without zzso This is the first zzso structure of the snake zzso zzso to be zzso Furthermore, the zzso removal of zzso from both zzso s did not significantly alter their effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was also found to be as good as that of other zzso zzso zzso The presence of these zzso in zzso s warrants further zzso which may provide useful insights into the functional regulation of these zzso
