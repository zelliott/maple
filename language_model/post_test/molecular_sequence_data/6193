An efficient zzso termed zzso cassette zzso zzso by zzso has been developed for multiple zzso of zzso This method uses suitable extension zzso for incorporating various zzso and is not limited by either the nature of the zzso or the size and spatial location of zzso zzso zzso of the wild type background clone and zzso selection at very high frequency were easily achieved through a zzso zzso First, a deletion of a unique restriction site within the cassette was introduced through additional silent zzso Then, the zzso clones were zzso with the corresponding zzso followed by transformation when selective zzso of zzso clone led to its near total removal leaving the zzso clones as the only zzso zzso Because it is generally possible to design several such zzso unique background zzso markers for any zzso for multiple zzso involving zzso located portions of the gene the present protocol is superior to other currently available zzso The efficiency of zzso has been demonstrated here by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as a model zzso Three different sets of zzso of varying sizes were generated to zzso the three putative zzso regions in the beginning, middle, and the end of the gene zzso zzso Very high efficiency of zzso incorporation and selection were obtained in all zzso Furthermore, by taking advantage of the unique zzso background elimination zzso it was possible to generate a zzso set of double and/or triple zzso The zzso zzso were zzso in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
