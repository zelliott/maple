The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso catalyze two successive reactions in the zzso of zzso In both zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso 1 zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso 5 zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso are essential for zzso zzso It was demonstrated earlier that in zzso the substitution of zzso by zzso zzso generates zzso zzso zzso activity, a related zzso zzso participating in zzso zzso It is shown here that in zzso the corresponding substitution of zzso by zzso zzso also generates zzso zzso To determine the effectiveness of individual zzso acid exchanges in these zzso each of the 20 standard zzso acid zzso was introduced at position zzso of zzso and 130 of zzso by zzso random zzso The zzso and zzso zzso with zzso activity were identified by selection in zzso and the proteins zzso and zzso The results obtained show that removal of the zzso charged zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso 5 is sufficient to establish zzso activity in zzso and zzso presumably because it allows the binding of the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the double zzso zzso and zzso did not show zzso activity, demonstrating that the zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso 1 are essential for zzso of the zzso zzso The ease with which zzso activity can be established on both the zzso and zzso scaffolds supports the evolutionary relationship of these three zzso and highlights the functional plasticity of the zzso zzso zzso
