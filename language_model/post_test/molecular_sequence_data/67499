A zzso approach was pursued utilizing zzso and zzso sequencing methods to discover new genes involved in zzso zzso zzso sequences were generated from developing zzso zzso zzso seeds, which produce large amounts of zzso zzso as a seed storage zzso In addition to known zzso zzso zzso a previously zzso putative zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of an zzso zzso zzso line defective in the corresponding zzso zzso revealed that this gene shows no zzso with the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso but is required for zzso of zzso at a different zzso The gene was termed zzso for zzso zzso chain zzso position zzso It represents an zzso in the same zzso of zzso family 47 as zzso A double zzso defective in both zzso zzso and zzso led to an zzso plant with zzso that consists essentially of only zzso zzso units, with no further zzso
