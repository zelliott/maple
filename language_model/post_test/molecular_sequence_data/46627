Previous work has shown that the gene for the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be involved in zzso isolation between different subspecies of the house zzso zzso zzso We investigated patterns of DNA sequence variation at zzso within and between species of mice to test several predictions of a model of neutral molecular zzso zzso variation among 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with divergence between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso No variation was observed at zzso within zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to divergence was significantly lower at zzso than at zzso and zzso despite the fact that all three genes experience similar rates of zzso zzso comparisons among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the ratio of zzso zzso to synonymous zzso on a zzso basis zzso was generally greater than zzso The combined observations of no variation at zzso within zzso zzso zzso and zzso high zzso values between species suggest that positive directional selection has acted recently at this zzso
