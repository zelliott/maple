In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso regulators, while zzso activates zzso of other nod genes in the presence of zzso A hinge region of zzso was previously identified in our laboratory as a functional region independent of its zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso Further study was carried out to see the possible effect of the length variation in the hinge region on zzso zzso To our surprise, as many as seven classes of zzso were zzso Class I is deficient of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso class II is able to activate zzso zzso independently of zzso and zzso zzso class III retains zzso but partial zzso zzso class IV is able to activate zzso independently of zzso and retains zzso in class zzso zzso is transcribed zzso but the zzso level is drastically zzso in the presence of zzso in class zzso zzso is transcribed zzso with higher induction zzso in class zzso zzso is transcribed zzso with lower induction zzso To learn more about the possible zzso circular zzso zzso were done, which showed that the length variation of the hinge of zzso caused by zzso led to the change in bend angles of nod zzso This finding should help to get an insight into how zzso regulation is zzso by zzso at the molecular level as well as to understand the regulatory system of this important zzso
