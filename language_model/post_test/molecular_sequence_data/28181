Nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been screened for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assigned to zzso group zzso were zzso to be deficient in zzso activity due to zzso in the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso component of the zzso The zzso gene has been cloned by transformation of a representative zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso containing the gene on a zzso zzso had three- to zzso zzso zzso activity than did zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso copy of zzso with a disrupted zzso zzso induced a zzso in zzso zzso The sequence of the cloned region of DNA which zzso zzso zzso was found to have an open reading frame of zzso zzso capable of coding for a protein of zzso zzso The zzso protein had 38% identical zzso with the reported sequence of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Two lines of evidence indicated that zzso of zzso is zzso zzso Higher zzso levels of zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso grown on the zzso sugar zzso than in zzso grown on high zzso zzso of zzso was also studied by fusing different zzso regions of zzso to the zzso gene of zzso coli and measuring the expression of zzso in zzso zzso harboring a fusion of zzso zzso of the zzso sequence expressed 10 times more zzso activity when grown under zzso zzso The response to the carbon source was reduced dramatically when the same zzso fusion was present in a zzso or zzso zzso The promoter zzso responsible for the regulated expression of zzso has been mapped to the zzso to zzso zzso This region contained several putative zzso sites with sequences matching the core element proposed to be essential for binding of the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso
