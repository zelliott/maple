zzso of zzso coli zzso the transfer of an zzso group from zzso to zzso The zzso is essential for growth, as demonstrated here by the analysis of an zzso depletion zzso Cell zzso demonstrated that zzso is an inner membrane zzso Its membrane zzso was determined by fusing zzso to zzso and alkaline zzso and by zzso zzso accessibility method zzso zzso The data show that zzso is embedded in the membrane by seven zzso zzso that its N zzso faces the zzso and that its C zzso faces the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso of both zzso and zzso bacteria were zzso zzso zzso are characterized by a so-called zzso signature motif in which four zzso are zzso Ten zzso zzso were replaced with zzso and the activity of these zzso zzso was analyzed by their ability to complement the zzso depletion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are absolutely required for zzso function, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso The results demonstrate that the majority of the essential zzso of zzso are located in the membrane and that the zzso signature motif faces the zzso
