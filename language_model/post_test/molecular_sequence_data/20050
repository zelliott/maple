The zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso function in the same DNA damage response zzso to effect cell cycle checkpoint zzso and zzso The functional interaction between the zzso complex and zzso has been proposed to require a zzso zzso domain of zzso for recruitment of zzso to sites of DNA zzso Human zzso breakage syndrome zzso cells and those derived from multiple mouse models of zzso express a zzso zzso zzso that exhibits impaired zzso activity despite having an intact zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso C zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso We derived zzso mice in which the zzso zzso interaction domain is zzso zzso cells exhibit zzso checkpoint zzso but are otherwise indistinguishable from zzso cells with respect to other checkpoint functions, zzso radiation sensitivity and zzso zzso However, multiple zzso of zzso mice showed a severe zzso zzso comparable to that of zzso or zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso targets and zzso zzso showed that, in contrast to the zzso of zzso mice, zzso does not impair the induction of zzso zzso Instead, the defects observed in zzso result from impaired zzso of zzso targets including zzso and the zzso factor, zzso
