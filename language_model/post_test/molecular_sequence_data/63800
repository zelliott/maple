Nuclear zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for 21 zzso of zzso zzso zzso two species of zzso five species of zzso three species of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso trees for 49 zzso constructed from combined sequences of these regions by maximum zzso maximum likelihood and zzso methods are zzso The species of zzso zzso zzso excluding zzso zzso combine into two main zzso and these contradict subdivisions of zzso zzso zzso based on zzso The species status of zzso zzso is confirmed, whereas zzso zzso is almost identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso and occupies zzso position to zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso is clearly separated from zzso A low level of divergence was found between zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are closer to zzso than to zzso zzso zzso zzso divergence between geographically remote populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are low as opposed to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Consideration of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso alone can adequately assign some zzso revealed by tree zzso A consensus secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso region could not be zzso for zzso studied mainly due to high sequence length diversity originated from zzso
