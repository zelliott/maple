The zzso zzso comprises clinically important pathogens such as zzso zzso which has zzso as a major cause of morbidity and mortality zzso especially with the emergence of zzso zzso The use of fast-growing species such as zzso zzso has allowed important advances to be made in the field of zzso zzso and in the study of the mechanisms of resistance in zzso The isolation of an zzso gene from zzso zzso has recently been zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso and is present in all zzso of zzso zzso The presence of this gene in other zzso species is studied here and genes zzso to that of zzso zzso have been found in all zzso species zzso In this report, the cloning of the zzso gene from zzso tuberculosis zzso and the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso is zzso Southern zzso zzso have shown that both genes are present in all strains of this species studied to zzso In addition, the putative zzso gene has been located in a recent release of the zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso and zzso genes has been studied in zzso zzso and only zzso is correlated with zzso zzso In order to zzso the role of the zzso zzso genes in zzso and to determine whether they are silent resistance genes or whether they have a secondary role in zzso zzso the zzso gene from zzso zzso has been disrupted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso shows an increase in zzso zzso along with a slight increase in the zzso to zzso
