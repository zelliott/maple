We have zzso the molecular basis for the function of the zzso alpha zzso zzso We have previously found that the three zzso alpha zzso elements zzso zzso activate zzso in zzso zzso We now report that two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso mediate in zzso binding of zzso alpha to zzso and zzso two essential components of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso binding elements of zzso alpha zzso and require zzso acid motifs zzso between the zzso members of the zzso zzso These same motifs are necessary for the zzso zzso function of zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Our data demonstrate a zzso basis for the modular buildup of zzso zzso and indicate that this zzso is zzso in zzso zzso We also show that the same zzso acid motifs in a cellular zzso can zzso to mediate contacts between the zzso and two distinct zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso that interact with zzso surfaces are functionally similar and may be structurally zzso and support the idea that the same zzso acid motifs in an zzso carry out multiple functions during the initiation zzso
