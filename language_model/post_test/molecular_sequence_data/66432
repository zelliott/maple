zzso represents an important cellular zzso mechanism against viral pathogens by virtue of its ability to remove infected zzso zzso many viruses have developed numerous strategies to prevent or delay host cell zzso in order to achieve productive zzso Here we report that deletion of the zzso gene from the zzso zzso results in increased zzso during zzso We demonstrate that zzso which has no sequence zzso to zzso family members, zzso zzso at the level of zzso by binding to zzso As a consequence, zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso and interaction with active zzso all critical steps in the induction of zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso interact directly with the zzso zzso domain 3 zzso domain of zzso This region of zzso has limited sequence similarity to known zzso zzso zzso We also find that such additional zzso zzso exist in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso uses this specific, zzso domain to bind and inhibit zzso at the zzso
