We have cloned the zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso VI from a human bone zzso zzso library using rapid amplification of zzso ends with zzso zzso to complete the zzso end zzso zzso was isolated from zzso using affinity zzso on the snake zzso zzso zzso as a critical zzso Internal zzso sequences were zzso and zzso zzso were designed to amplify a zzso of the zzso zzso which was then used as a probe to screen the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso fragments of zzso zzso made against the zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso base pairs coding for a protein of 339 zzso acids including a putative zzso acid signal sequence and a zzso acid zzso domain between zzso 247 and zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and its sequence is closely related to zzso and to the natural killer zzso Its zzso chain has two zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso An zzso zzso is found in position 3 of the zzso portion, which should permit association with zzso and its zzso zzso zzso motif via a salt zzso With 51 zzso zzso the zzso tail is relatively long and shows little zzso to the zzso part of the other family zzso The ability of the cloned zzso zzso to code for a functional zzso collagen zzso was demonstrated in the zzso cell line zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso mobilized zzso zzso in response to zzso unlike the zzso or mock zzso zzso cells, which do not respond to zzso
