zzso within the zzso gene of zzso zzso cause zzso to zzso chemicals but have no effect upon spontaneous or zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned on a zzso zzso zzso by functional zzso of a zzso zzso double zzso zzso a zzso of the gene was also isolated on a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a small section of the zzso zzso allowed the design of zzso that were subsequently used in zzso experiments to show that this DNA is zzso A zzso zzso derived from the transcribed region was used to screen an zzso zzso zzso library, resulting in the isolation of a zzso partial zzso clone which had sequence overlap with the zzso zzso zzso This partial zzso was incomplete but appeared to contain the whole coding region of zzso The zzso zzso was shown to possess two zzso a zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso due to zzso of a zzso causing disruption to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso predicts a protein of zzso zzso zzso which has zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein and also to certain zzso proteins capable of causing cell zzso
