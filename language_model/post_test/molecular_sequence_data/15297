We have previously reported the design of a new zzso primer pair that allows amplification of a broad range of zzso zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso without zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Here, we report using a similar primer combination to generate three small zzso zzso libraries from zzso zzso of zzso zzso two from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At the class level, libraries were dominated by sequences from the zzso zzso and zzso with some zzso zzso zzso and zzso present as zzso Based on the zzso test implemented in zzso libraries zzso and zzso were significantly different from zzso at the alpha zzso zzso level, while they were only borderline significantly different from each other zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso libraries were primarily due to differences in the number of zzso sequences and specifically sequences from the zzso which were more common in the zzso zzso It is currently unknown what drives these differences between zzso zzso zzso success for zzso zzso zzso sequences was generally low in this study indicating low abundance of bacteria on zzso zzso Attempts to amplify zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso
