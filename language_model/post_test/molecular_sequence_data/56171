We have previously described the use of the zzso form zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso as a zzso for cloning and expressing foreign genes in zzso zzso an zzso which reads zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report cloning and expression in zzso zzso of the G zzso of zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso The G zzso was inserted in the zzso zzso downstream of a synthetic zzso binding site and introduced into zzso zzso by zzso Northern zzso zzso analyses showed that in zzso zzso the G zzso was transcribed from an zzso zzso promoter as a zzso zzso The translation product was detected by Western zzso zzso with a rabbit zzso raised against total proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso and was proved to be zzso specific by using zzso zzso specific for the G region of the zzso zzso The apparent molecular mass of the zzso zzso zzso indicates that in zzso zzso the G zzso was fully translated in spite of the seven zzso zzso present in the reading zzso
